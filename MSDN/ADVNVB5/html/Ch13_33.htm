DB-Library provides a complete programming interface for executing and retrieving SQL statements. The main difference between the DB-Library API and the ODBC API is that DB-Library is designed to work with just one data source, Microsoft SQL Server, whereas ODBC is an open interface that is designed to provide generic access to a wide range of data sources.</p>
<p>
Much of the functionality in DB-Library is similar to ODBC; however, because this API is much more tightly coupled to the data source, it also includes some unique features. Like ODBC, DB-Library for C offers a rich set of functions for these tasks:
<ul type=disc>
<li>
Opening connections<br><br></li>
<li>
Formatting queries<br><br></li>
<li>
Sending query batches to the server and retrieving the resulting data<br><br></li>
<li>
Executing stored procedures or remote stored procedures<br><br></li>
<li>
Using scrollable cursors</li>
</ul>
<p>
But unlike ODBC, DB-Library also provides functions for these additional tasks:
<ul type=disc>
<li>
Bulk copying data from files or program variables to and from the server (BCP)<br><br></li>
<li>
Controlling two-phase commit operations between several participating SQL servers<br><br></li>
<li>
Obtaining the names of SQL servers either locally or over the network</li>
</ul>
<p>
These functions allow the application developer to control features that are not available through any other interface. Let’s look at two of these features in more detail.</p>
