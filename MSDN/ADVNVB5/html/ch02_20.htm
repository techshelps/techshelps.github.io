<p>
If you’re going to build rules into a pool manager, you need to make it capable of remote dynamic rule alteration. It also makes sense to include extras such as server and object version information inquiry so that an object type or an instance of a type can be interrogated for its version information, how many instances of it are running, and so on via the pool manager.</p>
<p>
In short, you can enable your pool manager to respond to queries with information about how it’s running and what objects it’s shepherding by using an ActiveX interface (that is, ActiveX methods and properties). Then it can be remotely interrogated, which would allow a <i>viewer utility</i> to be built that could be used remotely. Such a utility would allow administrators to monitor the system, for example.</p>
