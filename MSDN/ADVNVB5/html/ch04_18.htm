<p>
The Internet is not the most reliable of places: connections can be instantly dropped for no apparent reason, and connections that before were blindingly fast can drop to a mind-numbingly slow crawl. Add to this the size of files that are transferred in today’s computing environments (Microsoft Word files with even a few embedded bitmaps can easily exceed one megabyte in size), and you have a very unstable environment for transferring files.</p>
<p>
Because the <i>OpenURL </i>method is synchronous, execution of your code will not continue until the remote computer has processed the call. If the connection is disrupted or the remote computer is taking a long time to process the request, your code will not resume executing, effectively freezing your program. This can lead to very frustrated users.</p>
<p>
To prevent this from occurring, you can set a maximum time (in seconds) for the Internet Transfer Control to wait for a response. The <i>RequestTimeOut </i>property is used for this purpose. If no data is received from the remote computer in this period, a time-out error will be generated in the <i>StateChanged </i>event. (The <i>StateChanged </i>event is explained later in this chapter.) An error message can then be displayed informing the user that because of a problem with the Internet connection, the file cannot be retrieved at this time (neatly avoiding any criticism of your code).</p>
