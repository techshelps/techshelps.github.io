<p>
Internet communications and data exchange are facilitated by the development of standard communication protocols. Central to the operation of the Internet is the fundamental language that all connected computers “speak.” The dialect of the Internet is TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol). This protocol allows any computer connected to the Internet to be uniquely identified and allows any such computer to send information to or receive information from any other Internet-connected computer.</p>
<p>
At the heart of TCP/IP is the concept that each computer has a unique address. This address is a 32-bit number represented as four 8-bit components (for example, 103.205.67.88). This number is referred to as an IP number. Public IP numbers are regulated by an Internet body—InterNIC—to ensure that there are no clashes between computers connected to the Internet.</p>
<p>
IP numbers don’t mean much to the average user, so a Domain Name Service (DNS) can be used to translate the 32-bit number into something a little more readable. This readable version of an IP number is called a domain name. The IP number 103.27.56.45 could be referred to as <i>mycompany.com</i> or <i>myuniversity.edu</i>. The DNS does the job of maintaining the lists of IP numbers and domain names. Most Domain Name Services are managed by Internet Service Providers (ISPs) or network administrators and are not something that individual users have to worry about.</p>
<p>
One of the most common uses for the Internet has been to access files stored on a remote computer. The standard Internet protocol for remote file access is File Transfer Protocol (FTP). This allows remote users to connect to a computer and to browse and retrieve files that have been made publicly available.</p>
