<p>
An application is basically a collection of software units connected by flow-control statements. The best time to test each individual unit is immediately after it has been written, if for no other reason than it is fresh in your mind (and because if you don’t do it now, you’ll never have the time later). Of course, having a software unit that relies on a call to another unit is only testable if you either comment out the call or substitute a dummy implementation. This dummy is known as a <i>stub</i>. Conversely, if you are testing a unit that would normally be called by a higher-level unit, you can create a temporary calling routine, called a <i>driver</i>. Let’s take a closer look at these concepts.</p>
