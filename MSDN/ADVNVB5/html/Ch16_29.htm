<p>
The maintenance team is a group of people staffed from the resource pool. Typically, a team member stays in the team for a period of about six months. The primary roles of the team are to deal with any bug fixing in live systems and to add small features requested by users. During slack periods, this team does housekeeping tasks, performs reviews for the solution teams, and the like. A dedicated maintenance team is required so that solution teams are not constantly interrupted by tactical firefighting and therefore have a better chance of sticking to project plans.</p>
