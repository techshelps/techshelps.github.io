<p>
This “the system that is yet to come” stuff is all very messianic, very Gene Roddenberry, I suppose, especially when you appear to deflate this grand vision by tacking on at the end the much maligned (unjustly in my view) Visual Basic. Even those who have worked with Visual Basic from the beginning sometimes have trouble accepting the possibility, let alone the feasibility, of the notion that Visual Basic is capable of producing great things. People with a little Basic experience dating from “way back when” are frankly incredulous. I wouldn’t have guessed in 1991 when I first found a copy of Visual Basic 1 on my desk that I would have been talking about building “big sky” distributed systems with “that bloody Basic.”</p>
<p>
Visual Basic has come a long way. In my more paranoid moments, I’ve imagined Gates, Allen, and maybe even Alan Cooper meeting with their Object Generals to plot the storming of development shops with a battering ram of practical object orientation—Visual Basic. But even then I didn’t really see them having designs on the fully distributed world too—not until Visual Basic 4 Enterprise Edition anyway. I think this vision is becoming increasingly practicable with Visual Basic. I have some experience with it, scars and all, and I’m going to try to paint a picture in this chapter of what the options are and how you might make such a distributed, object-oriented system work. I’ll concentrate on Visual Basic, although inevitably, because of the developments in the Microsoft Transaction Server (code name Viper) arena, Transaction Server will get mentioned too. You won’t see as much code here as in some of the other chapters—after all, I’m going for the big picture. But I won’t tell you about anything that can’t be done, I’ll try to explain how to do everything I bring up, and I’ll also attempt to tell you what’s impossible.</p>
