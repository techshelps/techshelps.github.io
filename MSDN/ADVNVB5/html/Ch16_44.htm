The rate of change in hardware, system software, and development tools means that there are no experts. Visual Basic 3 or Visual Basic 4 gurus are not Visual Basic 5 gurus. With lack of expertise and rapidly changing environments, it’s difficult to build a stable and effective technical infrastructure. It’s even harder to get good advice on how to use that infrastructure.</p>
<p>
A development project is unlikely to have teams with all the skills required in sufficient depth to deliver the project. A realistic assessment of the skills required and those possessed should take place. Any deficiency should be filled for the project and a longer-term solution developed. A good approach is to employ external consultants who have skills transfer as part of their experience. It makes no sense to incur extra expense by continually running to outside resources for core skills.</p>
<p>
Three roles are essential in designing Visual Basic 5 client/server systems:
<ul type=disc>
<li>
The system architect creates the overall conceptual design.<br><br></li>
<li>
The system designer carries out the detailed specification of the executable code and the implementation.<br><br></li>
<li>
The DBA is the database technical expert.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Other experts, such as language or network gurus, might be required to solve particular problems. In addition to these roles, the complexity of the systems demands external review.</p>
<p>
You can learn a lot from those who have more experience, so form a partnership to learn more. The problems are complex, and so are the solutions. You might never know whether you have the best solution because the technology is moving on before it is proved. We repeat, there are no experts!</p>
