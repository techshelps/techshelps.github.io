<p>
One of the major themes of this chapter is that <i>attitude</i> is everything when it comes to writing zero-defect code. Developers aren’t stupid, and they can write solid code when given the opportunity. Provided with a clear and unambiguous set of targets, they are usually highly motivated and very effective at meeting those targets. If management sets a crystal-clear target of zero-defect code and then does everything sensible to encourage attitudes aimed at fulfilling that target, the probability is that the code produced by the team will have few defects. So given the goal of writing zero-defect code, let’s look at some of the attitudes that are required.</p>
