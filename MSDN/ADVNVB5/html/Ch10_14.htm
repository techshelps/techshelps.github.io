<p>
Having stepped through your code, you need to create a more formal test program, which will confirm that things do indeed work. Using a test script allows for the same test to be run again in the future, perhaps after some changes have been made. The amount of test code that you write is really a matter of judgment, but what you’re really trying to prove is that a path of execution works correctly and that any error conditions that you would expect to be raised are raised. For critical pieces of code—for example, the mortgage calculation algorithm for a bank—it might be worthwhile to actually write the specific code a second time (preferably by someone else) and then compare results from the two. Of course, there is a 50 percent chance that if there is a discrepancy, it is in the test version of the algorithm rather than the “real” version, but this approach does provide a major confidence test. I know of a case within a company where they were so sensitive about getting the accuracy of an algorithm correct that they assigned three different developers to each code the same routine. As it happened, each piece of code that was written produced a slightly different answer. This was beneficial because it made the analyst behind this realize that he had not nailed down the specification tight enough. This is a good example of the prototype/test scenario.</p>
