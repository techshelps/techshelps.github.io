Today large-scale Visual Basic 5 client/server systems, such as the one depicted in Figure 16-3, are normally attempting to achieve high levels of integration within a business. This implies integration among systems that might require links to e-mail, workflow, document image databases, multiple conventional data sources, and the Internet.</p>

To achieve the necessary integration and performance, you might need to use multiple APIs and protocols. The technical skills required to architect, design, implement, and support such systems are significantly higher level than those called for in traditional mature environments.</p>
<p>
With so many technologies and products involved, the development environment and tools are very fluid. The tools are increasingly complex in order to cope with the complexity of the environment. With the move from Visual Basic 3 to Visual Basic 5, we have seen Visual Basic move through two major leaps in functionality and capability. Practice and skills in this environment are immature.</p>
<p>
The most significant changes in Visual Basic 5 are in the capability to distribute the application by distributing processing (through ActiveX components) and data (via various flavors of ODBC). Learning how to achieve high performance and stability must be an early objective of the introduction of Visual Basic 5. This issue involves development, deployment, and support.</p>
