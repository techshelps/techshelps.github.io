<p>
While performing the preceding two tasks, you should also look out for record fields and table columns that have date values as part of the key. This technique is common in data entities used for storing time-related activities such as deliveries and appointments. For example, you might have a table that stores the details for appointments. The table might have a combination of surname and date as its key, in which case the value of a key might look like this: MAYES010196. If the date part is stored as shown here, with two digits for the year, the effect of accessing this table will be disastrous in the year 2000. So compile a list of any database tables or files that use a Y2K noncompliant date within the key.</p>
