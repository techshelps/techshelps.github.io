<p>
The first category asked, basically, “So what else is new?” Most of us in the audience had been developing large corporate systems for more than a few years, and nothing in this “new” method came as a surprise—not the rigor nor the techniques.</p>
<p>
The second category involved design. At the beginning of the presentation, we had been told that the “new” method addressed both analysis and design, but it seemed to us that analysis dominated the discussion. In fact, the design process had somehow been magically assimilated into the analysis process, or at least it seemed so to the practiced and experienced developers in the audience. We never did get a good answer to our questions about why the method always proceeded from an analysis of the “existing system.” The questioner asked, “What about systems to support business that the company doesn’t currently engage in? What if we want to create a system to support our company’s entry into the retail banking arena? What should we analyze under those circumstances?” Given the subsequent diversification and expansion of financial services companies like the one I was then working for, the questions look remarkably prescient. No satisfactory response was forthcoming, however forcibly the question was pursued.</p>
