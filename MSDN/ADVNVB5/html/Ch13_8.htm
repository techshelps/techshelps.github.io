<p>
I should perhaps explain here what I mean by a <i>local database </i>and a <i>remote database.</i> Just exactly what do “local” and “remote” mean? When I refer to a local database, I am referring to a database that’s accessible via the file system, which could actually mean it’s located on a remote file server, not necessarily on a disk drive local to the PC. A local database is manipulated directly by the application. There might be a layered architecture, but there is only one running process—your application. A remote database isn’t just something that’s physically separate from the PC running the application. (After all, as I’ve just described, a local database can be physically remote.) A remote database is one that can be accessed only via another process that is separate from your application, a process normally known as a DBMS. The DBMS could be running on the local PC, or it could be running on a distant mainframe.</p>
<p>
The distinction between local and remote databases becomes important as soon as the phrase “client/server computing” is mentioned. When the difference between local and remote databases isn’t precisely defined, almost any architecture can be described as client/server architecture. So for the purposes of the discussion in this chapter, “client/server” means the use of a remote database that is also physically remote.</p>
