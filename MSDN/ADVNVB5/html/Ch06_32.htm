<p>
Visual Basic 3 and to a lesser extent 16-bit Visual Basic 4 suffer from a name space problem. They are both given only 64 KB pages in memory for the names of variables, constants, and procedures. Many large corporate projects ran into this limitation, and many solutions were tried. VB Compress and MicroHelp’s Code Analyst, written by The Mandelbrot Set (TMS), let programmers remove unused variables, constants, procedures, and functions. Programs were written to truncate variable, constant, and procedure names. Coding strategies were changed to the detriment of code maintainability. This issue disappears with 32-bit Visual Basic 4 and Visual Basic 5.</p>
