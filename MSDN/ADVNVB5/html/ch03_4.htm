<p>
Once a user masters an application, he or she often has a natural resistance to working with other products that apply alternative techniques or methods for similar activities. To avoid resistance to the report application you’re developing, it is therefore crucial to provide reporting within an environment familiar to the user. User training is expensive; by adopting an approach the user already knows, you can help reduce the need for training, cut down on costs, and improve user acceptance of new applications.</p>
