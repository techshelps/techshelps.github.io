Visual Basic now has an excellent Object Browser. You can include detailed documentation about your functions that will prevent others from constantly having to ask questions about routines you have written. Unfortunately, for many programmers, writing documentation is like going to the dentist. It is also a task that never gets included in project plans, so it almost never gets done. It is vital that you increase your estimates to allow time for these tasks.</p>
