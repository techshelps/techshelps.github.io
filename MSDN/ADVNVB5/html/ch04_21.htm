<p>
A common type of situation occurs when the PC you are using to access the Internet is connected to it via what is known as a proxy server. A proxy server acts as an intermediary between you and the Internet. It is often used as a security barrier between an internal network (or intranet) and the outside Internet world. The proxy server prevents any unwanted access to your internal network by ensuring that all access to and from the Internet is channeled through a single point. The proxy server can then discard information that it does not deem safe. This is a common occurrence in business networks and when access is via an ISP.</p>
<p>
If this is the case, you will have to let the Internet Transfer Control know that you have access to the Internet by way of a proxy server. If you don’t notify the Internet Transfer Control, there is a strong chance that when the Internet Transfer Control attempts to connect to the outside world, the proxy server will deny access. (It actually depends on how strictly the proxy server enforces security.)</p>
<p>
The <i>AccessType </i>property is used to inform the Internet Transfer Control of the existence of a proxy server. There are two options for this property: Direct and Proxy. If Proxy is selected, you need to supply the address of the proxy server in the <i>Proxy </i>property.</p>
