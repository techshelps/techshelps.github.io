<b>PETER J.MORRIS </b></p>
<p>
You first met Peet on page 2. Here is the rest of his story. Recently Peet was the technical lead on MicroHelp’s Code Complete suite of Visual Basic 4 programmer’s tools (which was written by TMS), and he cowrote TMS’s other Visual Basic toolkit, <i>TMS Tools</i>. Peet was a member of the ANSI X3J11 and X3J16 standards groups (C and C++) and is a founding member of the IEEE P1201.1/2 (API and UI) standards groups. He’s also a member of the IEEE computer society and the ACM. In the rare moments he’s not working, his time is almost exclusively the property of his baby son, Daniel. </p>
