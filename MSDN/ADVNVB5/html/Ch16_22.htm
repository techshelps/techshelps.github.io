<p>
This “team” is the key to the process. It receives new project requests, maintains a departmental plan, manages resource levels, identifies project/resource conflicts, recruits, manages people issues (such as appraisals), promotes good departmental communications, and so on. When a new project starts, this team identifies a business analyst/project manager (see the next section) and a prototyper from the resource pool (see page 693) for that manager. Also, it creates a team from the resource pool to form a <i>solution team.</i> This team always has a <i>technical lead,</i> who is the day-to-day project team leader and is the liaison with the business analyst/project manager. The project plan that the business analyst/project manager draws up must be incorporated into the overall high-level departmental plan, and any amendments during the tracking of the project must also be incorporated. Incorporating these changes is an automated process.</p>
