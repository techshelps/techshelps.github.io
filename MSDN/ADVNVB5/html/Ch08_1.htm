<p>
As you can probably guess from its title, this chapter is going to cover a rather broad range of information about Visual Basic. Think of this chapter as a Visual Basic programmer’s smorgasbord. You’ll learn about such topics as the advantages and disadvantages of compiling to p-code and to native code. You’ll get some hints on how to optimize your applications beyond just writing excellent code. And you’ll also receive up-to-the-minute information on such scintillating subjects as types and type libraries. So let’s begin!</p>
<p>
Perhaps it’s bad form to start off so early in the chapter with a disclaimer. Well, you may scold me if you wish, but here’s the disclaimer anyway: Some of the code in this chapter is, for good reason, written in C. Wherever I’ve used C, I’ve endeavored to make the code as readable and easy to follow as possible. I have not, however, included a C tutorial. To learn more about C code, you’ll need to refer to an appropriate text.</p>
