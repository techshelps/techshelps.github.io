<p>
Microsoft Visual Basic has been with us for quite a long time now. Initially intended as a tool for rapidly knocking out small systems and prototypes, Visual Basic has been improved and improved, until it is now the preferred choice for developing large enterprise-wide systems. These systems are often fundamental to the survival of the businesses developing them.</p>
<p>
Features added to each new version reflect this shift, or perhaps Visual Basic’s role has changed to reflect the new features. With each version of Visual Basic, there has been a key improvement, although picking one feature as the key new feature is a matter of opinion. In Visual Basic 5, the key improvement is the ability to create ActiveX controls. The key improvements in other versions are listed at the top of the following page.</p>

Since the introduction of Visual Basic 4, the most significant improvement has been the addition of the capability to break down systems into components, or objects, that can be assembled into complete systems. This improvement allows complex systems to be built of many simpler components. Systems based on simpler components can be more easily maintained and integrated than their larger, monolithic predecessors.</p>
<p>
With more code written in Visual Basic than in any other computer language, it is the facility to build components that represents Visual Basic’s most underused strength. Interestingly, a lot of Visual Basic 3 code is still being written. For example, approximately one third of The Mandlebrot Set’s clients are still developing in Visual Basic 3. With Visual Basic version 1 through version 3, it was difficult to write anything other than monolithic applications. With Visual Basic 4 and 5, it is relatively easy to write your application as a series of components.</p>
<p>
Microsoft estimates that there are over 3 million Visual Basic programmers in the world; in 1996, Visual Basic overtook COBOL as the language with the most code written in it. Of this huge amount of code, some will wither and die, but a lot of it must be maintained. The best way to do this is for the code to exist in a series of small, simple-to-understand components.</p>
<p>
The remainder of this chapter looks briefly at some of the new features in Visual Basic 5 and explains why you should seriously consider converting all your programs, not just your Visual Basic programs, to Visual Basic 5. It discusses the pitfalls you might experience en route. The chapter goes on to consider differing strategies for migrating your systems to a Visual Basic 5 development environment and illustrates by means of a small sample suite of programs some of the difficulties you might face and some possible solutions to these problems.</p>
