<h1><a name="groups"></a>Groups</h1>
<p>
Groups of users are managed at the database level rather than at the server level. Each database has a list of groups. Every user is a member of the group named public and, optionally, just one other group. It’s often useful to create groups for different user roles in a database. You might, for example, create a group for administrators who are allowed to maintain (INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE) the contents of some tables in the database; other users then would be allowed only to see (SELECT) data from the tables. If you have a table of personnel data, you might create another group for personnel managers who would have complete rights to that table, that is, with the ability to see and change all of the data in the table. Other users, not in that group, might be allowed read-only access to the table but would be prevented from seeing the salary information contained in some of the columns.</p>
