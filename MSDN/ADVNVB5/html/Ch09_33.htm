<p>
Without a doubt, the single most contributing factor to a Visual Basic application that is Year 2000 noncompliant will be the incorrect usage of data types. Regardless of how many applications I review, I’m still never quite prepared for the total lack of understanding displayed by experienced programmers who assign date values to the String data type and process all their dates using only strings. You’d think that people would have gotten the message when Microsoft introduced the V_DATE(7) Variant data type, which is used specifically for maintaining dates. And later, when the fully fledged Date data type was made available, did people do the right thing and stop using the String date type? No! People continue to use string variables to maintain dates.</p>
<p>
Finding and replacing the date strings in your Visual Basic applications should be your number one priority. As you’ll see later, anyone who has taken the time to research and use the Date data type [and Variant(7)] will now be reaping the benefits of their foresight because these data types are far more prepared for the change of the century than are strings. Those of you who continued to use strings after Variants and dates became available now have a lot of work to do.</p>
<p>
Let’s look at some of the reasons why strings continue to be used over their date and Variant cousins.</p>
