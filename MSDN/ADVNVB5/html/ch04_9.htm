<p>
Electronic documents are corporate resources that should be leveraged for business applications whenever possible. The Web is document-based, so one of the greatest challenges is not in creating documents but in managing them. These documents can take the form of HTML documents, text, multimedia, spreadsheets, presentation graphics, and so on. Before you rush into any plans for an electronic document management system (EDMS), let’s first understand what characterizes an EDMS. A document-management system should be able to deal with long-term access to documents. Key features include the following:
<ul type=disc>
<li>
Document-change tracking (version control)<br><br></li>
<li>
Access control (security)<br><br></li>
<li>
Search facilities (full-text retrieval)<br><br></li>
<li>
Backup and archiving</li>
</ul>
<p>
In addition, they generally include an integrated workflow capability, imaging, and document manufacturing. The Web offers some of these capabilities, but they generally require some sophisticated programming to achieve a total solution. However, many of the leading EDMS suppliers today provide access to documents by means of a Web browser.</p>
