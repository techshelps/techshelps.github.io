<p>
If you already have a formal training program in place for your existing system, you’ll need to update any training material that refers to dates. It might also be a good idea to build into the training a section covering the use of four-digit years. This can’t do any harm and might even save a fair amount of user frustration later on. Keep in mind that users do use other software and that other software might allow them to enter short format dates even if yours doesn’t.</p>
