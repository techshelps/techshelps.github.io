<p>
Throughout this chapter, many short sections end with a recommendation (marked as <b>Some Final Thoughts</b>) culled from both my own experiences and those of many other people in the IT industry. Acting on these suggestions is probably less important than understanding the issues behind them, as discussed in each section. These recommendations are just opinions, candidly stated, with no reading between the lines required.</p>
