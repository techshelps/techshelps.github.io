<p>
No matter how large or small your system is, planning, managing, and coordinating the Year 2000 conversion project will be a big job for somebody. At times, it will be a real headache. How do you convert all that software across all those systems and departments and still manage to coordinate the code changes alongside ongoing maintenance work and possibly together with existing enhancements? Let me rephrase—it could be a nightmare! But as long as you remember to plan your work and work your plan, you should keep on the straight and narrow.</p>
<p>
One last thing to consider before we move on to the technical side of the problem is the worst-case scenario. What do you do if it all goes horribly wrong? Any system worth its salt has an effective contingency plan. You have to ask yourself, “How can my business survive if I can’t use the system?” You might be in a position to revert to a paper-based solution temporarily, until show-stopping bugs or system crashes are fixed. Then again, you might not. What will you do then? It’s never pleasant to think of the worst possible situation; nevertheless, if you give it some thought now, at least you’ll be prepared should your worst nightmare come true.</p>
