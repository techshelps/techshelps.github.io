Performance is often intertwined with scaling—and sometimes mistaken for it. Many performance inadequacies show up only when the system is required to perform under increased loading. The poor performance is often algorithmic: the system was too slow to start with, but nobody noticed (or maybe nobody looked) because we were concentrating on the build and impressing the users during the feedback cycle.</p>
