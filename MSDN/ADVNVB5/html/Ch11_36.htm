<p>
Now that you have a good understanding of how to create nonstandard Windows applications and how to add multimedia capabilities to your applications, there’s really nothing stopping you from producing your own Document Image Processing (DIP) system. There has been widespread interest in these systems since the mid-80s, when the concept of the paperless office was in vogue, but they were expensive to buy a decade ago and required large amounts of storage and powerful machines. Now, in the mid-90s, we have all of those capabilities sitting on almost every desktop. CDs are now the norm rather than the exception, and with CD mastering equipment dropping rapidly in price, it’s now possible to master your own CDs.</p>
<p>
The basis of a DIP system is the ability to view form and document images in a structured and sensible manner. This usually means using a backend database to log the details. We have already seen how to link form images to details in a database in the CBT application, and these techniques can be successfully applied here. If you require image manipulation, there are a vast array of add-ons to provide the functionality that you require. You can (if you’re feeling adventurous) also use the Windows API to provide image manipulation functionality, such as <i>StretchBlt </i>for zooming.</p>
