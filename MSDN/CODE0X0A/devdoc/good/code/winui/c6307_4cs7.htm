<pre><code>The \Mssdk\Samples\WinUI directory contains samples   <br>of Win32 user interface development, including: <br> <br>* Base graphical user interface (GUI) capabilities <br>* Win32 console functions <br>* Win32 DLL templates <br>* Common dialog boxes, including File <br>* Common controls, including RichEdit, Rebar, and  <br>  ListView <br>* Wheel mouse and associated APIs <br>* Combo boxes and Owner draw boxes <br>* Dynamic dialog box templates <br>* Icon manipulation <br>* Message tables <br> <br>Samples related to the Windows Shell:  <br>* Band objects <br>* Namespace extensions <br>* Drag-and-drop context menus <br>* File viewers <br>* File parsing <br>* Basic shell extensions, including context menu,  <br>  property sheet, icon handler, and copy hook extensions <br> <br>The build environment (headers, libraries, and minimum build  <br>tools) for the Platform SDK must be installed in order to build  <br>any of the samples in the \Mssdk\Samples\WinUI directory. The  <br>most recent version of the build environment is available at  <br>http://www.microsoft.com/msdn/sdk/platform.htm.  <br>Some components may also require you to install runtimes, depending  <br>on the platform on which you are trying to run the sample.  <br>Redistributables are available in the \Mssdk\Redist subdirectory  <br>on the Platform SDK compact disc.  <br> <br>Documentation for the components listed above can be installed  <br>from the Platform SDK compact disc, or can be viewed online at  <br>http://premium.microsoft.com/msdn/library/. This is a FREE service;  <br>registration is necessary. <br> <br>If you do not see any subdirectories in the \Mssdk\Samples\WinUI  <br>node, you'll need to install the Windows Base Services Samples  <br>component from the Platform SDK compact disc or download and  <br>install them from http://www.microsoft.com/msdn/sdk/platform.htm.  <br> <br></code></pre>
