<pre><code>Cabview Sample <br>============== <br> <br>The CABVIEW samples implements a namespace extension that is presented in <br>the Explorer's namespace.  It also parses and extracts component files <br>from CAB files.  The library for working with CAB files is provided for <br>x86 only. <br> <br>After the sample DLL has been built, to install the sample: <br>1. Right Click on the CABVIEW.INF file and select Install from the menu <br> <br>To run the sample <br>1. Through the explorer browse to a directory containing a .CAB file such <br>   as the Windows 95 release CD. <br>2. You will observe that the icon shown by Explorer for this cab file is <br>   CABVIEW.ICO, if your Cabview extension has been installed correctly. <br>3. Double click on the CAB file and a new Explorer window will be launched.  <br>4. This will show the contents of the CAB file. <br>5. You can extract a file from the window by double clicking on the file icon. </code></pre>
