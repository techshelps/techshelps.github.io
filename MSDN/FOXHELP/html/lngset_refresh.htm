Determines whether and how often a Browse window is updated with changes made to records by other users on the network.</p>
<p class=label>
<b>Syntax</b></p>
<p>
SET REFRESH TO <i>nSeconds1</i> [, <i>nSeconds2</i>]</p>
<p class=label>
<b>Arguments</b></p>
<p class=dt>
TO <i>nSeconds1</i> [, <i>nSeconds2</i>]</p>
<p class=indent>
Specifies whether and how often updates are made. <i>nSeconds1</i> specifies the number of seconds between updates to a Browse or memo-editing window. <i>nSeconds1</i> can be a value from 0 to 3,600; the default value is 0 seconds. When <i>nSeconds1</i> is a nonzero value and other users change records you are viewing, those records are updated when the refresh interval elapses. The records you are viewing aren't updated if <i>nSeconds1</i> is 0.</p>
<p class=tl>
Microsoft Visual FoxPro buffers portions of tables in memory on your workstation. <i>nSeconds2</i> specifies how often these local data buffers are updated with current data from the network. <i>nSeconds2</i> is the number of seconds between data buffer updates. You can specify a value between 0 and 3,600; the default value is 5. The buffers are never refreshed if <i>nSeconds2</i> is set to 0.</P><p class=tl>
If you specify a value for <i>nSeconds1</i> other than 0 but don't include <i>nSeconds2</i>, <i>nSeconds2</i> is set to the same value as <i>nSeconds1</i>. However, <i>nSeconds2</i> is set to 5 if you specify 0 for <i>nSeconds1</i> and don't include <i>nSeconds2</i>.</P><p class=tl>
Performance can be improved by increasing the value of <i>nSeconds2</i>.</P><p class=label>
<b>Remarks</b></p>
<p>
Because tables can be opened for shared use on a network, it is possible that records you are viewing in a Browse window are being edited by other users on the network.</p>
<p>
SET REFRESH affects records displayed in a Browse window opened with BROWSE, CHANGE, or EDIT. Memo fields opened for editing in a Browse window are also updated.</p>
<p>
SET REFRESH can also be used to specify how often data buffered locally on your workstation is updated.</p>
