<h1><a name="lngdelete___sql"></a><sup></sup>DELETE - SQL Command</h1>
<p>
<a href="lngdelete___sqlx.htm">Example</a> &nbsp; <a href="lngdelete___sqlsa.htm">See Also</a></p>
<p>
Marks records for deletion.</p>
<p class=label>
<b>Syntax</b></p>
<p>
DELETE FROM [<i>DatabaseName!</i>]<i>TableName</i><br>
 &nbsp; [WHERE <i>FilterCondition1</i> [AND | OR <i>FilterCondition2</i> ...]]</p>
<p class=label>
<b>Arguments</b></p>
<p class=dt>
FROM [<i>DatabaseName!</i>]<i>TableName</i></p>
<p class=indent>
Specifies the table in which records are marked for deletion.</p>
<p class=tl>
<i>DatabaseName!</i> specifies the name of a non-current database containing the table. You must include the name of a database containing the table if the database is not the current database. Include the exclamation point (!) delimiter after the database name and before the table name.</P><p class=dt>
WHERE <i>FilterCondition1</i> [AND | OR <i>FilterCondition2</i> ...]</p>
<p class=indent>
Specifies that Visual FoxPro marks only certain records for deletion.</p>
<p class=tl>
<i>FilterCondition</i> specifies the criteria that records must meet to be marked for deletion. You can include as many filter conditions as you like, connecting them with the AND or OR operator. You can also use the NOT operator to reverse the value of a logical expression, or use EMPTY(&nbsp;) to check for an empty field.</P><p class=label>
<b>Remarks</b></p>
<p>
Records marked for deletion aren't physically removed from the table until PACK is issued. Records marked for deletion can be recalled (unmarked) with RECALL.</p>
<p>
If SET DELETED is set to ON, records marked for deletion are ignored by all commands that include a scope.</p>
<p>
Unlike DELETE, DELETE - SQL uses record locking when marking multiple records for deletion in tables opened for shared access. This reduces record contention in multiuser situations, but may reduce performance. For maximum performance, open the table for exclusive use or use FLOCK(&nbsp;) to lock the table.</p>
