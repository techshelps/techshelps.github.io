<p>
Opens the Class Designer, allowing you to modify an existing class definition or create a new class definition.</p>
<p class=label>
<b>Syntax</b></p>
<p>
MODIFY CLASS <i>ClassName</i> [OF <i>ClassLibraryName1</i>]<br>
 &nbsp; [AS <i>cBaseClassName</i> [FROM <i>ClassLibraryName2</i>]]<br>
 &nbsp; [METHOD MethodName] [NOWAIT] [SAVE]</p>
<p class=label>
<b>Arguments</b></p>
<p class=dt>
<i>ClassName</i></p>
<p class=indent>
Specifies the name of the class definition to modify or create.</p>
<p class=dt>
OF <i>ClassLibraryName1</i></p>
<p class=indent>
Specifies the name of the .vcx visual class library containing the class definition. If you are creating a new class definition and the .vcx visual class library already exists, the class definition is added to it.</p>
<p class=tl>
A .vcx file extension is assumed for the visual class library. Be sure to include the file extension if the visual class library you specify has a file extension other than .vcx.</P><p class=tl>
If the .vcx visual class library you specify is currently in the SET CLASSLIB search list, the visual class library is removed from the search list.</P><p class=dt>
AS <i>cBaseClassName</i></p>
<p class=indent>
Specifies the class on which the class definition is based. <i>cBaseClassName</i> can be any of the Visual FoxPro base classes except Column, Cursor, DataEnvironment, Header, Page, and Relation. You can also specify a user-defined class for <i>cBaseClassName</i> if you include the FROM <i>ClassLibraryName2</i> clause that specifies the name of the .vcx visual class library containing the user-defined class.</p>
<p class=tl>
If you omit AS <i>cBaseClassName</i>, the class definition is based on the Visual FoxPro FormSet base class.</P><p class=dt>
FROM <i>ClassLibraryName2</i></p>
<p class=indent>
Specifies the name of the .vcx visual class library containing the user-defined class specified with <i>cBaseClassName</i>.</p>
<p class=dt>
METHOD <i>MethodName</i></p>
<p class=indent>
Specifies an event or method for which the Code window is opened in the Class Designer. The METHOD clause lets you immediately begin editing event or method code in the Class Designer.</p>
<p class=tl>
<i>MethodName</i> supports the Visual FoxPro object syntax. For example, to immediately edit the Click event code for a text box named txtFirstName in the class named MyClass in a visual class library named MyClassLibrary, use the following command:</P><pre><code>MODIFY CLASS MyClass OF MyClassLibrary;
 &nbsp; METHOD txtFirstName.Click
</code></pre>
<p class=tl>
If you only include an event or method name in the METHOD clause, the Code window is opened for the class's event or method. For example, to immediately edit the Click event code for a class named MyClass in a visual class library named MyClassLibrary, use the following command:</P><pre><code>MODIFY CLASS MyClass OF MyClassLibrary METHOD Click
</code></pre>
<p class=dt>
NOWAIT</p>
<p class=indent>
Continues program execution after the Class Designer is opened. The program doesn't wait for the Class Designer to be closed, but continues execution on the program line immediately following the line that contains MODIFY CLASS NOWAIT. If you omit NOWAIT when MODIFY CLASS is issued in a program, the Class Designer is opened and program execution pauses until the Class Designer is closed.</p>
<p class=tl>
NOWAIT is effective only from within a program. It has no effect on MODIFY CLASS when issued from the Command window. If NOWAIT is included with the METHOD clause, be sure to place NOWAIT before the METHOD clause or NOWAIT will be ignored.</P><p class=dt>
SAVE</p>
<p class=indent>
Leaves the Class Designer open after another window is activated. If you omit SAVE, the Class Designer is closed when another window is activated. Including SAVE has no effect when issued from the Command window.</p>
<p class=label>
<b>Remarks</b></p>
<p>
Use MODIFY CLASS to modify an existing class definition or to create a new class definition and save it in a .vcx visual class library. You can open the .vcx visual class library with SET CLASSLIB, allowing you to access the class definitions within the .vcx visual class library.</p>
