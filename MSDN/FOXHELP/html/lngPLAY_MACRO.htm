<h1><a name="lngplay_macro"></a><sup></sup>PLAY MACRO Command</h1>
<p>
<a href="lngplay_macrosa.htm">See Also</a></p>
<p>
Executes a keyboard macro.</p>
<p class=label>
<b>Syntax</b></p>
<p>
PLAY MACRO <i>MacroName</i><br>
 &nbsp; [TIME <i>nDelay</i>]</p>
<p class=label>
<b>Arguments</b></p>
<p class=dt>
<i>MacroName</i></p>
<p class=indent>
Specifies the name of the keyboard macro to play.</p>
<p class=dt>
TIME <i>nDelay</i></p>
<p class=indent>
Specifies the time interval between the delivery of each keystroke in a keyboard macro. The delay time must be between 0 and 10 seconds. <i>nDelay</i> can evaluate to a number with a decimal fraction. For example, if you specify <i>nDelay</i> equal to 1.5, keystrokes from the macro will be played with a one-and-a-half-second delay between each keystroke.</p>
<p class=label>
<b>Remarks</b></p>
<p>
You can save a series of keystrokes as a keyboard macro by choosing Macros from the Tools menu. PLAY MACRO plays this series of keystrokes. Playing keyboard macros within programs lets you create self-running demo programs.</p>
<p>
If you issue PLAY MACRO from the Command window, it executes immediately. If PLAY MACRO is issued in a program, execution is delayed until the program executes a command that allows keyboard input. Examples of commands that wait for input are @&nbsp;...&nbsp;GET, BROWSE, CHANGE, and EDIT.</p>
<p>
If a series of PLAY MACRO commands is pending in a program, Visual FoxPro doesn't execute the commands in the order in which they are issued. Macros are played in reverse order — the first PLAY MACRO executes last, the last PLAY MACRO executes first — in their bottom-to-top order within the program.</p>
