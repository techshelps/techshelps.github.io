The Application Builder is an integral part of the application development process. The Application Builder is designed, specifically, to make it easy for you to include all necessary, and many optional, elements that make an application effective and pleasurable to use. The Application Builder integrates with the <a href="dgapplication_development_and_developer_productivity.htm#newenhanced_application_framework">Application Framework</a> created by the Application Wizard so you can do the following things:
<ul type=disc>
<li>
Add, edit or remove your application-specific components such as tables, forms, and reports.<br><br></li>
<li>
Specify visual styles for forms and reports.<br><br></li>
<li>
Add common application elements including a Splash screen, an About dialog box, a Favorites menu, a User Login dialog box, and a Standard toolbar.<br><br></li>
<li>
Specify production credits and version information for the application.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Like all Visual FoxPro builders, the Application Builder is reentrant, meaning that you can close it and then reopen it to modify any settings the builder makes. You can reopen the Application Builder by right-clicking on the project and selecting the <b>Builder</b> item from the shortcut menu.</p>
<p class=indent>
<b>Note</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Keep in mind that additional changes made through the builder will not appear in the application until the application is rebuilt.</p>
<p>
Using the Application Wizard and Application Builder, you can now build a complete application without having to write code. Whether you’re new to Visual FoxPro or migrating from FoxPro 2.x, these tools will maximize your productivity while also teaching you the essentials of developing object-oriented applications with Visual FoxPro.</p>
