<b>Syntax</b></p>
<p>
SET TRBETWEEN ON | OFF</p>
<p class=label>
<b>Arguments</b></p>
<p class=dt>
ON</p>
<p class=indent>
Specifies that every line of program code be displayed and highlighted in the Trace window as it is executed. Issuing SET TRBETWEEN ON is identical to enabling the Trace Between Breaks command in the Trace window's Program menu.</p>
<p class=dt>
OFF</p>
<p class=indent>
(Default) Specifies that only the last line at which program execution was paused be highlighted in the Trace window. Issuing SET TRBETWEEN OFF is identical to disabling the Trace Between Breaks command.</p>
<p class=label>
<b>Remarks</b></p>
<p>
The Trace window displays the source code for a program as the program executes. The executing program line is highlighted. When the Trace window is open, you can set breakpoints that cause program execution to stop.</p>
<p>
The Trace window can also be opened by issuing ACTIVATE WINDOW TRACE, SET ECHO ON, or SET STEP ON.</p>
