Conditionally includes a set of commands at compile time if a compile-time constant is defined.</p>

<b>Syntax</b></p>
<p>
#IFDEF | #IFNDEF <i>ConstantName</i><br>
 &nbsp; <i>Commands</i><br>
[#ELSE<br>
 &nbsp; <i>Commands</i>]<br>
#ENDIF</p>
<p class=label>
<b>Arguments</b></p>
<p class=dt>
#IFDEF</p>
<p class=indent>
Specifies that a set of commands is included at compile time when the <i>ConstantName</i> is defined.</p>
<p class=tl>
The following describe how a set of commands is included at compile time when you include #IFDEF:</P><ul type=disc>
<li>
If <i>ConstantName</i> is defined, the set of commands following #IFDEF and preceding #ELSE or #ENDIF (whichever occurs first) is included at compile time.<br><br></li>
<li>
If <i>ConstantName</i> is not defined and #ELSE is included, the set of commands following #ELSE and preceding #ENDIF is included at compile time.<br><br></li>
<li>
If <i>ConstantName</i> is not defined and #ELSE is not included, no commands within the #IFDEF ... #ENDIF structure are included at compile time.</li>
</ul>
<p class=dt>
#IFNDEF</p>
<p class=indent>
Specifies that a set of commands is included at compile time when the <i>ConstantName</i> is not defined. </p>
<p class=tl>
The following describe how a set of commands is included at compile time when you include #IFNDEF:</P><ul type=disc>
<li>
If <i>ConstantName</i> is not defined, the set of commands following #IFNDEF and preceding #ELSE or #ENDIF (whichever occurs first) is included at compile time.<br><br></li>
<li>
If <i>ConstantName</i> is defined and #ELSE is included, the set of commands following #ELSE and preceding #ENDIF is included at compile time.<br><br></li>
<li>
If <i>ConstantName</i> is defined and #ELSE is not included, no commands within the #IFNDEF ... #ENDIF structure are included at compile time.</li>
</ul>
<p class=dt>
<i>ConstantName</i></p>
<p class=indent>
Specifies the compile-time constant whose existence determines whether a set of commands is included at compile time. Compile-time constants are defined with #DEFINE.</p>
<p class=dt>
<i>Commands</i></p>
<p class=indent>
Specifies the set of commands that is included at compile time.</p>
<p class=label>
<b>Remarks</b></p>
<p>
You can nest an #IFDEF | #IFNDEF&nbsp;...&nbsp;#ENDIF structure within another #IFDEF | #IFNDEF&nbsp;...&nbsp;#ENDIF structure.</p>
<p>
Comments can be placed on the same line after #IFDEF, #IFNDEF, #ELSE, and #ENDIF. These comments are ignored during compilation and program execution.</p>
