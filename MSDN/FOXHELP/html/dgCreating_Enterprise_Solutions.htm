By taking advantage of features in Visual FoxPro, you can extend your development efforts to create complex, multifaceted applications. You can create your applications using a team of developers, which allows you to work more quickly and to develop applications that might be difficult for an individual developer to create. You can also combine the power of Visual FoxPro with that of other programs to create rich, enterprise-wide solutions to your application requirements.</p>

To work successfully as a team, developers must coordinate their efforts and avoid duplicating effort or overwriting one another’s work. To help you manage team development, Visual FoxPro allows you to integrate source control software into the Project Manager, so that you can check Visual FoxPro files out and in, merge changes, view differences, and more. You can also work concurrently in the same database.</p>

In addition to creating your applications entirely in Visual FoxPro, you can extend Visual FoxPro by using it as a front end for other data sources, and you can use it as a data source for other Windows programs. You can also use Visual FoxPro in other innovative ways, such as a search engine for the World Wide Web or as a data warehousing tool.</p>
