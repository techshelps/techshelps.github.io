<h1><a name="lngwindowtype_property"></a><sup></sup>WindowType Property</h1>
<p>
<a href="lngwindowtype_propertyat.htm">Applies To</a> &nbsp; <a href="lngwindowtype_propertysa.htm">See Also</a></p>
<p>
Specifies how a form set or form behaves when it is shown or run with DO FORM. Available at design time and run time.</p>
<p class=label>
<b>Syntax</b></p>
<p>
<i>Object</i>.WindowType[ = <i>nType</i>]</p>
<p class=label>
<b>Settings</b></p>
<p class=dt>
<i>nType</i></p>
<p class=indent>
For a form set, the settings for the WindowType property are as follows:</p>
<table border=1 cellpadding=5 cols=2 frame=below rules=rows>
<tr valign=top>
<td class=label width=16%><b>Setting</b></td>
<td class=label width=84%><b>Description</b></td>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=16%>0</td>
<td width=84%>Modeless.</td>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=16%>1</td>
<td width=84%>Modal. No other forms can become active and the menu can be active. All forms in the form set are active.</td>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=16%>2</td>
<td width=84%>Read. The form set behaves as if it were activated by the READ command. Execution stops on the Show method or DO FORM command. When the Form is deactivated, execution continues. (Included for backward compatibility, and available only for Forms converted from previous versions of FoxPro.)</td>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=16%>3</td>
<td width=84%>Read Modal. The form set behaves as if it were activated by a READ command's MODAL clause. Program execution stops at the Show method or the DO FORM command. Any forms specified in the WindowList property are available, but other forms and the menu are not available. (Included for backward compatibility, and available only for forms converted from previous versions of FoxPro.)</td>
</tr>
</table><br>
<p class=tl>
For a form, the settings for the WindowType property are as follows:</P><table border=1 cellpadding=5 cols=2 frame=below rules=rows>
<tr valign=top>
<td class=label width=16%><b>Setting</b></td>
<td class=label width=84%><b>Description</b></td>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=16%>0</td>
<td width=84%>Modeless.</td>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=16%>1</td>
<td width=84%>Modal. No other forms can become active and the menu is inactive. All forms in the form set are active.</td>
</tr>
</table><br>
<p class=label>
<b>Remarks</b></p>
<p>
You cannot change the WindowType setting once the window has been displayed.</p>
<p>
The Show method takes a parameter that can override the WindowType setting.</p>
<p class=indent>
<B><b>Note</b></B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The WindowType setting of a form set overrides the individual WindowType settings of the forms it contains. For example, if the WindowType property for a form set is set to 0, all the forms contained in it are modeless, regardless of their individual WindowType property settings.</p>
