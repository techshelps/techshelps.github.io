Contains options for stepping through code. You can also set the speed at which commands are executed as you watch.</p>
<h3>Menu Commands</h3>
<p class=dt>
<b>Do</b></p>
<p class=indent>
Begins executing the program open in the <a href="wndtrace_window.htm">Trace</a> window. If no program is open in the <b>Trace</b> window, displays the <b>Do</b> dialog box so you can specify a program or form to trace. The program or form you specify is executed with program execution suspended at the first line of executable code.</p>
<p class=dt>
<b>Resume</b></p>
<p class=indent>
Available if program execution is suspended. Continues execution of the program in the <b>Trace</b> window at the current line of code.</p>
<p class=dt>
<b>Cancel</b></p>
<p class=indent>
Closes and stops executing the program or form in the <b>Trace</b> window.</p>
<p class=dt>
<b>Fix</b></p>
<p class=indent>
Available if program execution is suspended.</p>
<p class=tl>
If you are tracing through a program, <b>Fix</b> prompts you to cancel the program and then opens it in an editing window, at the same position that the cursor is in the <b>Trace</b> window.</P><p class=tl>
If you are tracing through code in a form, <b>Fix</b> prompts you to cancel execution and clear the form object from memory. Then an editing window in the <b>Form Designer</b> opens at the same position that the cursor is in the <b>Trace</b> window.</P><p class=dt>
<b>Step Out</b></p>
<p class=indent>
Continues executing the code in a procedure without stepping through the code line by line. Program execution is suspended again on the line of code following the procedure call in the calling program.</p>
<p class=dt>
<b>Step Over</b></p>
<p class=indent>
Executes the next line of code. If the next line of code calls a function, method, or procedure, then the function, method, or procedure is executed in the background.</p>
<p class=dt>
<b>Step Into</b></p>
<p class=indent>
Executes the next line of code.</p>
<p class=dt>
<b>Run To Cursor</b></p>
<p class=indent>
Executes code from the current line indicator to the line of code with the cursor. Click the line of code you want to suspend execution on to place the cursor on that line.</p>
<p class=dt>
<b>Throttle</b></p>
<p class=indent>
Opens the <b>Execution Throttle</b> dialog box so you can specify the delay in seconds between the execution of each line of code.</p>
<p class=dt>
<b>Set Next Statement</b></p>
<p class=indent>
