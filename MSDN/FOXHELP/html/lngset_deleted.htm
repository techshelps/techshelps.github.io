<p class=label>
<b>Arguments</b></p>
<p class=dt>
ON</p>

<p class=dt>

(Default) Specifies that records marked for deletion can be accessed by commands that operate on records (including records in related tables) using a scope.</p>
<p class=label>
<b>Remarks</b></p>
<p>
Queries that use DELETED(&nbsp;) to test the status of records can be optimized using Rushmore technology if the table is indexed on DELETED(&nbsp;). </p>
<p>
For more information on optimizing queries, see "Understanding Rushmore Technology" in Chapter 15, <a href="dgoptimizing_applications.htm">Optimizing Applications</a>, in the <i>Programmer's Guide</i>.</p>
<p>
You can mark records for deletion by issuing DELETE – SQL or DELETE, or by choosing Delete Records... from the Table menu from within a Browse or Edit window.</p>
<p>
You can recall records by issuing RECALL or by choosing Recall Records... from the Table menu from within a Browse or Edit window.</p>
<p class=indent>
<B><b>Important</b></B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SET DELETED is ignored if the default scope for the command is the current record or you include a scope of a single record. INDEX and REINDEX always ignore SET DELETED and index all records in the table.</p>
<p>
SET DELETED is scoped to the current data session.</p>
