<p class=label>
<b>Arguments</b></p>
<p class=dt>
1</p>
<p class=indent>

<b>Remarks</b></p>
<p>
Returns the empty string.</p>
<p>
Visual FoxPro stores the Options dialog box settings in the Windows registry. You can also store additional Visual FoxPro configuration settings in a text file, normally named Config.fpw. Visual FoxPro is configured when it is started by reading these registry settings and its configuration file (if one exists).</p>
<p>
The settings you specify in the Options dialog box are written to the registry when you choose Set As Default. Some settings, such as those for Syntax Coloring, are stored in the registry but have no corresponding SET commands. Other settings do have corresponding SET commands (such as SET BELL, SET CLOCK, and so on) that affect the Visual FoxPro environment. The settings made from the File Locations tab in the Options dialog box are also stored in the registry, and some are accessible through system variables such as _COVERAGE and _SAMPLES.</p>
<p>
Issuing SYS(3056) updates information from the registry settings and the corresponding SET commands, registry settings from the Options dialog File Locations tab, and the Visual FoxPro configuration file (if one exists). SYS(3056) reads the registry information first, and then the configuration file. </p>
<p>
Issuing SYS(3056,1) updates information from the Visual FoxPro registry settings that don’t have corresponding SET commands. The SET commands, File Locations registry settings, and configuration file information aren’t updated if the 1 argument is included.</p>
<p>
Note that registry settings can also be changed directly through the Windows API. See the Windows API section of Solution.app, located in the Visual Studio …\Samples\Vfp98\Solution directory, for an examples of how you can use the Windows API to modify registry settings.</p>
