<p>
Specifies whether Visual FoxPro opens table files for exclusive or shared use on a network.</p>
<p class=label>
<b>Syntax</b></p>
<p>
SET EXCLUSIVE ON | OFF</p>
<p class=label>
<b>Arguments</b></p>
<p class=dt>
ON</p>
<p class=indent>
(The default for the global data session.) Limits accessibility of a table opened on a network to the user who opened it. The table isn't accessible to other users on the network. Unlike FLOCK(&nbsp;), SET EXCLUSIVE ON also prevents all other users from having read-only access. A file can also be opened on a network for exclusive use by including the EXCLUSIVE clause with the USE command. It isn't necessary to perform record or file locking on a table opened for exclusive use.</p>
<p class=tl>
Opening a table for exclusive use ensures that the file can't be changed by other users. For some commands, execution isn't possible until a table is opened for exclusive use. These commands are INSERT, INSERT BLANK, MODIFY STRUCTURE, PACK, REINDEX, and ZAP.</P><p class=dt>
OFF</p>
<p class=indent>
(The default for a private data session.) Allows a table opened on a network to be shared and modified by any user on the network.</p>
<p class=tl>
For additional information about record and file locking and sharing tables on a network, see Chapter 17, <a href="dgprogramming_for_shared_access.htm">Programming for Shared Access</a>, in the <i>Programmer's Guide</i>.</P><p class=label>
<b>Remarks</b></p>
<p>
Changing the setting of SET EXCLUSIVE doesn't change the status of previously opened tables. For example, if a table is opened with SET EXCLUSIVE set to ON, and SET EXCLUSIVE is later changed to OFF, the table retains its exclusive-use status.</p>
<p>
SET EXCLUSIVE is scoped to the current data session.</p>
