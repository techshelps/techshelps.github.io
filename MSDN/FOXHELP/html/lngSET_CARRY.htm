<p class=label>
<b>Syntax</b></p>
<p>
SET CARRY ON | OFF</p>
<p>
-or-</p>
<p>
SET CARRY TO [<i>FieldList</i> [ADDITIVE]]</p>
<p class=label>
<b>Arguments</b></p>
<p class=dt>
ON</p>
<p class=indent>
Brings data from all fields in all work areas forward from the current record to a new record.</p>
<p class=dt>
OFF</p>
<p class=indent>
(Default) Prevents data from all fields from being passed to a new record.</p>
<p class=dt>
TO [<i>FieldList</i> [ADDITIVE]]</p>
<p class=indent>
<i>FieldList</i> specifies the fields from which data is carried forward. Separate the field names with commas.</p>
<p class=tl>
ADDITIVE specifies that the fields in the field list be added to the current set of fields being carried forward. </P><p class=tl>
Issuing SET CARRY TO implicitly performs SET CARRY ON.</P><p class=tl>
Use SET CARRY TO without <i>FieldList</i> to restore the default setting (all fields are carried forward).</P><p class=label>
<b>Remarks</b></p>
<p>
Use SET CARRY to enable data to be carried forward from the current record to a new record or to prevent data from being carried forward. Fields that generally remain unchanged during an editing session can be brought forward for each new record. For example, a field containing the current date can be brought forward for each new record so a new date doesn't have to be entered again. Note that the contents of Memo and General type fields are not carried forward.</p>
<p>
SET CARRY affects only the table open in the currently selected work area.</p>
<p>
SET CARRY is scoped to the current data session.</p>
