<h1><a name="newcoverage_profiler_window"></a><sup></sup>Coverage Profiler Window</h1>
<p>
<a href="newcoverage_profiler_windowsa.htm">See Also</a></p>
<p>
Contains a group of <a href="newcoverage_profiler_tool_buttons.htm">tool buttons</a> and options that let you specify how you display the information returned by the Coverage Engine.</p>
<h3>Window Options</h3>
<p class=dt>
<b>Source List Pane</b></p>
<p class=indent>
The upper <b>Source List</b> pane is divided into two columns. The left-hand column lists the classes within the selected file or <b>All Classes</b>, <b>Objects</b>, and <b>Processes</b>. The right-hand column displays the file containing the source code for this item. This file can be a .frx, .lbx, .scx or .vcx containing the class or object listed in the left pane, the .prg file for the <b>ALL Classes</b> selection or any other type of file that stores source code. For example, a .dbc could be listed if stored procedures were logged; an .frx could be listed if the Data Environment of a report form contained code.</p>
<p class=dt>
<b>Source Code Pane</b></p>
<p class=indent>
The lower <b>Source Code</b> pane (in Preview mode) displays the code of the item you select in the upper <b>Source List</b> pane. The mode you select determines some of the content and the format of the code displayed.</p>
<p class=dt>
<b>Coverage Mode</b></p>
<p class=indent>
In Coverage mode, the <b>Source Code</b> pane displays the code of the item highlighted in the upper section. The Coverage Profiler can mark the lines run and the lines not run. The default setting marks, with the symbol or symbols specified in the <a href="newcoverage_profiler_options_dialog_box.htm">Coverage Profiler Options Dialog Box</a>, each line that was not actually run. Use this mode when testing your application, to verify which lines of code actually run.</p>
<p class=indent>
By marking both the lines run and the lines not run (with different marks) you can more easily distinguish between lines that are never run, such as comments, from lines that were not run during this coverage analysis.</p>
<p class=dt>
<b>Profile Mode</b></p>
<p class=indent>
In profile mode, the <b>Source Code</b> pane displays the code of the item highlighted in the upper <b>Source List </b>pane, the number of times a line was hit, and the duration of each line. Use this mode if you want to evaluate the performance of running code.</p>
<p class=indent>
Lines can report 0.000 duration (both <b>1st</b> and <b>Avg</b>) even though column one shows 1 or more <b>Hits</b> for these lines. This happens when lines are executed so quickly that duration is less than .001 second.</p>
