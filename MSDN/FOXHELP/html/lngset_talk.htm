<h1><a name="lngset_talk"></a><sup></sup>SET TALK Command</h1>
<p>
<a href="lngset_talksa.htm">See Also</a></p>
<p>
Determines whether Visual FoxPro displays command results.</p>
<p class=label>
<b>Syntax</b></p>
<p>
SET TALK ON | OFF | WINDOW [<i>WindowName</i>] | NOWINDOW</p>
<p class=label>
<b>Arguments</b></p>
<p class=dt>
ON</p>
<p class=indent>
(Default) Allows talk to be sent to the main Visual FoxPro window, the system message window, the graphical status bar, or a user-defined window. If SET TALK is set to OFF and is then changed to ON, the talk is directed to the same location it was sent to before you issued SET TALK OFF.</p>
<p class=dt>
OFF</p>
<p class=indent>
Prevents talk from being sent to the main Visual FoxPro window, the system message window, the graphical status bar, or a user-defined window. Note that for in-process .dll automation servers the default setting of SET TALK is OFF.</p>
<p class=dt>
WINDOW [<i>WindowName</i>]</p>
<p class=indent>
<i>WindowName</i> specifies a user-defined window to which talk is directed. You must create the user-defined window before directing talk to it. Talk is directed to the Visual FoxPro system window if the window you specify doesn't exist.</p>
<p class=dt>
NOWINDOW</p>
<p class=indent>
Directs talk to the main Visual FoxPro window.</p>
<p class=label>
<b>Remarks</b></p>
<p>
Some table processing commands return information, or "talk," about their status while they execute. These commands include:</p>
<p class=label>

</table><br>
<p>
Talk can be directed to the main Visual FoxPro window, the graphical status bar, or a user-defined window. Talk can also be turned off.</p>
<p>
The SET TALK reporting interval can be specified with SET ODOMETER. The default value for SET ODOMETER is 100. Note that execution speed can be degraded when SET TALK is set to ON, because the main Visual FoxPro window or user-defined window must be frequently updated. If you just need the total number of records processed by a command, you can issue SET TALK OFF and display the _TALLY system variable once the command has completed executing.</p>
<p>
SET TALK is scoped to the current data session.</p>
