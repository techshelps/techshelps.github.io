<h1><a name="smpvisual_foxpro_solutions_sample"></a>Solutions Sample</h1>
<p>
The Solutions sample contains many examples of useful things you can do using Visual FoxPro. Solutions also includes sample classes in the <a href="smpsample_class_libraries.htm">sample class libraries</a> and examples based on the <a href="ffcvisual_foxpro_foundation_classes.htm">Visual FoxPro Foundation Classes</a>.</p>
<p>
Solution.app is located in the following folder:</p>
<p>

The interface for Solutions.app is Solution.scx and provides several features:
<ul type=disc>
<li>
Two ways to view the contents: As a tree (outline) view, which shows the hierarchy of the components in the application, or as a filtered list view of the components in the application, which provides an alphabetical list of all components that will filter the list according to your sort specifications.<br><br></li>
<li>
An expand/collapse button for viewing all of the components in the tree view.<br><br></li>
<li>
A brief description of a selected sample.<br><br></li>
<li>
The option to run the code and/or view the code by opening it in the appropriate designer.<br><br></li>
