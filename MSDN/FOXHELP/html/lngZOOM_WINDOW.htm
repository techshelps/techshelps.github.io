ZOOM WINDOW <i>WindowName</i> MIN | MAX | NORM<br>
 &nbsp; [AT <i>nRow1</i>, <i>nColumn1</i> | FROM AT <i>nRow1</i>, <i>nColumn1</i><br>

<p class=label>
<b>Arguments</b></p>
<p class=dt>
<i>WindowName</i></p>
<p class=indent>
Specifies the name of the window whose size you want to change.</p>
<p class=dt>
MIN</p>
<p class=indent>
Reduces the window to minimum size.</p>
<p class=tl>
In Visual FoxPro for Windows, the window is reduced to an icon.</P><p class=tl>
All system windows can be reduced to a minimum size in Visual FoxPro for Windows. Visual FoxPro system windows must be open in the main Visual FoxPro window or a user-defined window before they can be minimized.</P><p class=tl>
A user-defined window can be minimized after it is defined. It doesn't have to be activated before you change its size.</P><p class=dt>
MAX</p>
<p class=indent>
Expands a window to fill the main Visual FoxPro window, the Windows desktop, or a user-defined window. If a child window is placed in a parent window and the child window is maximized, it fills the parent window. If any of the additional ZOOM WINDOW clauses (AT, SIZE, TO, or FROM) are included with MAX, MAX is ignored.</p>
<p class=tl>
Only user-defined windows defined with ZOOM can be expanded to maximum size.</P><p class=dt>
NORM</p>
<p class=indent>
Returns a window to its original size after it has been minimized or maximized. NORM can also be used to move a window without changing its size. Use ZOOM WINDOW NORM without any additional clauses to return a minimized or maximized window to its original size and location.</p>
<p class=dt>
AT <i>nRow1</i>, <i>nColumn1</i> | FROM <i>nRow2</i>, <i>nColumn2</i></p>
<p class=indent>
You can specify the placement of a window by including the AT or FROM clause.</p>
<p class=tl>
ZOOM WINDOW <i>WindowName</i> NORM AT AT <i>nRow1</i>, <i>nColumn1</i> restores a minimized or maximized window to its original size and places it at the specific location. The AT <i>nRow1</i>, <i>nColumn1</i> coordinates specify where the upper-left corner of the window is placed. A window's location can also be changed with MOVE WINDOW.</P><p class=tl>
In Visual FoxPro for Windows, if NORM is included, the upper-left corner of the window is placed in the main Visual FoxPro window at the location specified with AT <i>nRow1</i>, <i>nColumn1</i>. If MIN is included, AT and FROM are ignored and the window is displayed as an icon in the lower portion of the main Visual FoxPro window. If MAX is included, AT and FROM are ignored and the window is expanded to fill the main Visual FoxPro window.</P><p class=tl>
In Visual FoxPro for Windows, if the window is created with the IN DESKTOP clause, the upper-left corner of the window is placed in the Windows desktop at the location specified with AT <i>nRow1</i>, <i>nColumn1</i>. If MIN is included, AT and FROM are ignored and the window is displayed as an icon in the lower portion of the Windows desktop. If MAX is included, AT and FROM are ignored and the window is expanded to fill the Windows desktop.</P><p class=dt>
SIZE AT <i>nRow2</i>, <i>nColumn2</i> | TO <i>nRow2</i>, <i>nColumn2</i></p>
<p class=indent>
You can also specify a window size for a window by including SIZE or TO. If SIZE is included, the window size is <i>nRow2</i> rows high and <i>nColumn2</i> columns wide. If the TO clause is included, the upper-left corner of the window remains in its current position and the lower-right corner of the window is placed at the position specified with <i>nRow2</i>, <i>nColumn2</i>.</p>
<p class=label>
<b>Remarks</b></p>
<p>
In Visual FoxPro for Windows, windows can be reduced to a minimum size, enlarged to fill the entire main Visual FoxPro window, or sized anywhere in between. </p>
<p>
If you create a user-defined window with DEFINE WINDOW and the IN DESKTOP clause in Visual FoxPro for Windows, the window you create can be enlarged to fill the entire desktop.</p>
<p>
In Visual FoxPro for Windows, windows can be zoomed directly from minimum to maximum size and vice versa. </p>
<p>
When zooming a window, you can specify where to place the resized window in the main Visual FoxPro window or a user-defined window.</p>
<p>
To zoom a system window, enclose the entire system window name in quotation marks. For example, to maximize the Command window, issue the following command:</p>
<pre><code>ZOOM WINDOW 'Command Window' MAX
</code></pre>
<p>
You can use ZOOM WINDOW to resize all system windows.</p>
