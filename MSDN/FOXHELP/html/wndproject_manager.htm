<h1><a name="wndproject_manager"></a><sup></sup>Project Manager Window</h1>
<p>
<a href="wndproject_managersa.htm">See Also</a></p>
<p>
Use the <b>Project Manager</b> to organize and manage your files in projects. A project is a collection of files, data, documents, and Visual FoxPro objects that is saved as a file with a .pjx extension. When the <b>Project Manager</b> window is active, Visual FoxPro displays the <a href="cmdproject_menu.htm">Project</a> menu on the menu bar.</p>
<p>
The items in the <b>Project Manager</b> are organized in an outline-like view that you can expand or collapse. A plus sign appears next to a symbol if there are one or more items of that type in the project. Click the plus sign next to a symbol to see items in the list. Click the minus sign to collapse an expanded list.</p>
<p>
As with toolbars, you can dock the <b>Project Manager</b> by dragging it to the top of your screen or double-clicking the title bar. When it is docked, it automatically collapses and shows only the tabs.</p>
<h3>Window Options</h3>
<h4>Tabs</h4>
<p>

Click the pushpin button to keep a tab on top of other windows.</P><h4>Expanding/Collapsing Button</h4>
<p>
<img src="oh018.gif" border=0></p>
<p class=tl>

<p>
<img src="oh019.gif" border=0></p>
<p class=tl>
Lists the items contained in the project in an outline-like view. Icons appear to the left of the item to identify its type.</P><p class=tl>
The symbol <img src="oh020.gif" border=0> appears next to items that are excluded from the project.</P><p class=tl>
When files are included in the project, they are compiled into a single .app file when the project is built. All included files are read-only at run time. In the <b>Programs</b>, <b>Forms</b>, <b>Queries</b>, or <b>Menus</b> group, the name of the main program file appears in bold.</P><p class=tl>
