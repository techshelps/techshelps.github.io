<h1><a name="err1524"></a><sup></sup>The selected printer driver does not support direct access (Error 1524)</h1>
<p>
The printer you have selected and set through your operating system does not allow direct access. You can try the Generic/Text Only driver, or the equivalent, in Windows. Bear in mind that the "ASCII File" option in Visual FoxPro bypasses the printer driver and sends the contents of the selected file directly to the printer. You are responsible for making sure that any file sent in this manner contains valid printer commands, and/or that an appropriate driver is selected.</p>
