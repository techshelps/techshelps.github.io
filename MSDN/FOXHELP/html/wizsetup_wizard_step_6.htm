<p>
The wizard lists your files in a grid. You can change the settings for any file by clicking the item that you want to change. The following table describes the settings displayed in each column.</p>
<table border=1 cellpadding=5 cols=2 frame=below rules=rows>
<tr valign=top>
<td class=label width=21%><b>Column</b></td>
<td class=label width=79%><b>Description</b></td>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=21%>File</td>
<td width=79%>Specifies the file name as it will be created on the user's machine.</td>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=21%>Target Dir</td>
<td width=79%>The file can be installed on the user's machine in the Application directory, Windows directory, or Windows System directory.</td>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=21%>PM Item</td>
<td width=79%>If you select this option, the wizard displays the <b>Program Group Menu</b> Item dialog box so you can specify program item properties: description, command line, and icon.<p>
In the command line, you can use an embedded %s sequence to replace the application directory. The "s" must be lowercase. Use the %s sequence when you install files in application subdirectories. This ensures that files will be installed in the correct subdirectory in case your users specify a name for the application directory other than the default name. In the following example, Mydata.dbf is installed in the MAINDATA subdirectory of the application directory:</p>
<p>
%s\Maindata\Mydata.dbf</p>
<p>
If you specify an icon that is outside your source tree, the setup routine will install the icon in your application directory.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=21%>ActiveX</td>
<td width=79%>If you select this option, the installation process will register ActiveX controls during setup on a user's machine. This does not register a design-time license for the control on the user's machine.<p>
It is a good idea to have your setup register ActiveX controls to ensure that your user always uses the correct version of the control.</p>
</td>

<p>
Visual FoxPro allows an ActiveX control to be created or instantiated only if the control and its license have been purchased and installed on your machine. License information is saved with the form or class that allows distributed forms to run successfully on users' machines. Users will not be able to modify these forms at design time unless they also purchase a design-time license from the control's vendor.</p>
<p>
You may distribute visual class libraries that contain ActiveX controls. New controls based on these visual classes may be added to running forms. Users may not modify these visual classes, create controls based on them, or subclass them.</p>
<p>
ActiveX controls may be developed and distributed without charge or licensing requirements. However, most will be designed so that they fail without a license. There are currently two types of licenses for ActiveX controls: design-time and run-time. A design-time license allows you to create new ActiveX controls. A run-time license allows you to run a form that contains an ActiveX control.</p>
<p>
For more information about distributing applications with ActiveX controls, see "Including COM Components," in Chapter 25, <a href="dgbuilding_an_application_for_distribution.htm">Building an Application for Distribution</a>, in the <i>Programmer's Guide</i>.</p>
