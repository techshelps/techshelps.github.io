<b><a name="lngset_readborderx"></a><sup></sup>SET READBORDER Command Example</b></p>
<p>
In the following example, the first three text boxes created with @&nbsp;...&nbsp;GET have borders. The third text box has a border, even though SET READBORDER was SET to OFF before it was created. The fourth text box does not have a border, since READBORDER was SET to OFF and it is encompassed in a different READ from the first three text boxes.</p>
<pre><code>SET READBORDER ON
@ 2,2 GET gnW DEFAULT 1&nbsp;&nbsp; &amp;&amp; 1st READ
@ 4,2 GET gnX DEFAULT 1&nbsp;&nbsp; &amp;&amp; 1st READ
SET READBORDER OFF
@ 6,2 GET gnY DEFAULT 1&nbsp;&nbsp; &amp;&amp; 1st READ
READ
@ 8,2 GET gnZ DEFAULT 2&nbsp;&nbsp; &amp;&amp; 2nd READ
READ
