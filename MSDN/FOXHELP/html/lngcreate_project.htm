<h1><a name="lngcreate_project"></a><sup></sup>CREATE PROJECT Command</h1>
<p>
<a href="lngcreate_projectsa.htm">See Also</a></p>
<p>
Opens the <a href="wndproject_manager.htm">Project Manager</a> so you can create a project.</p>
<p class=label>
<b>Syntax</b></p>
<p>
CREATE PROJECT [<i>FileName</i> | ?]<br>
 &nbsp; [NOWAIT] [SAVE]<br>
 &nbsp; [WINDOW <i>WindowName1</i>]<br>
 &nbsp; [IN [WINDOW] <i>WindowName2</i> | IN SCREEN<br>
 &nbsp; [NOSHOW] [NOPROJECTHOOK]</p>
<p class=label>
<b>Arguments</b></p>
<p class=dt>
<i>FileName</i></p>
<p class=indent>
Specifies the file name for the project table. If you don't specify an extension for the file name, Visual FoxPro automatically assigns a .pjx extension.</p>
<p class=dt>
?</p>
<p class=indent>
Displays the Create dialog box that prompts you to name the project being created.</p>
<p class=dt>
NOWAIT</p>
<p class=indent>
Continues program execution after the Project Manager is opened. The program doesn't wait for the Project Manager to be closed, but continues execution on the program line immediately following the line that contains CREATE PROJECT NOWAIT. If you omit NOWAIT when CREATE PROJECT is issued in a program, the Project Manager is opened and program execution pauses until the Project Manager is closed.</p>
<p class=tl>
Including NOWAIT has no effect on CREATE PROJECT when it is issued in the Command window.</P><p class=dt>
SAVE</p>
<p class=indent>
Leaves the Project Manager open after another window is activated. If you omit SAVE, the Project Manager is closed when another window is activated.</p>
<p class=tl>
Including SAVE has no effect when issued from the Command window.</P><p class=dt>
WINDOW <i>WindowName1</i></p>
<p class=indent>
Specifies a window whose characteristics the Project Manager takes on. For example, if the window is created with the FLOAT option of DEFINE WINDOW, the Project Manager can be moved. The window need not be active or visible, but it must be defined.</p>
<p class=tl>
The Project Manager has a default size that can be larger than the window from which it takes its characteristics. In this case, the Project Manager still assumes the characteristics of the window in which it is placed. The upper-left corner of the Project Manager is placed at the same coordinates as the upper-left corner of the window, and extends beyond the window's borders.</P><p class=dt>
IN [WINDOW] <i>WindowName2</i></p>
<p class=indent>
Specifies a parent window in which the Project Manager is opened. The Project Manager doesn't assume the characteristics of the parent window and cannot be moved outside the parent window. If the parent window is moved, the Project Manager moves with it.</p>
<p class=tl>
The parent window must first be defined with DEFINE WINDOW, and must be visible, to access the Project Manager.</P><p class=dt>
IN SCREEN</p>
<p class=indent>
Specifies that the Project Manager is explicitly opened in the main Visual FoxPro window, after the Project Manager has been placed in a parent window. The Project Manager is placed in a parent window by including the IN WINDOW clause.</p>
<p class=dt>
NOSHOW</p>
<p class=indent>
Specifies that the Project Manager is hidden (its Visible property is set to false (.F.)) when it is opened. To display the Project Manager, set the Project Manager's Visible property to true (.T.). NOSHOW allows you to manipulate a project before displaying it in the Project Manager. Note that to avoid confusion with the NOSHADOW keyword, you cannot abbreviate NOSHOW to less than five characters.</p>
<p class=dt>
NOPROJECTHOOK</p>
<p class=indent>
Specifies that a ProjectHook object isn't created when the Project Manager is opened. Include NOPROJECTHOOK for projects that will not be manipulated programmatically through the Project Manager hooks. Note that a Project object is still created whenever a project file (.pjx) is opened.</p>
<p class=label>
<b>Remarks</b></p>
<p>
A project is a table that keeps track of all files that are required to create an application, as well as all dependencies, references, and connections among the files. A project table has a .pjx extension and an associated memo file with a .pjt extension. In a project, you specify all the pieces that are required for an application, and Visual FoxPro ensures that compiled files are based on the latest source files.</p>
<p>
A project table can be opened with USE and manipulated like any other Visual FoxPro table.</p>
<p>
Issuing the command CREATE PROJECT without any additional arguments displays the Create dialog, allowing you to specify a name for the project.</p>
