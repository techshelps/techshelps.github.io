Creates a form.</p>

<b>Syntax</b></p>
<p>
Form</p>
<p class=label>
<b>Remarks</b></p>
<p>
Use the Form object to create a form to which you can add controls. You can also use the <a href="wndform_designer.htm">Form Designer</a>. Forms have properties that determine their appearance, such as position, size, and color, as well as aspects of their behavior, such as whether they are sizable.</p>
<p>
Forms can also respond to events initiated by a user or triggered by the system. For example, you can write code in a form's Click event procedure that changes the color of the form when you click it.</p>
<p>
In addition to properties and events, you can use methods to manipulate Forms. For example, you can use the Move method to change a form's location and size.</p>
<p>
When designing Forms, use the BorderStyle property to specify a form's border, and the Caption property to specify the text in the title bar. Setting BorderStyle to 0 removes the border. From within a program, you can use the Hide and Show methods to make Forms transparent or visible at run time.</p>
<p>
For additional information about creating Forms, see Chapter 9, <a href="dgcreating_forms.htm">Creating Forms</a>, in the <i>Programmer's Guide</i>.</p>
