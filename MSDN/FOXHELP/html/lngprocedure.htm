<h1><a name="lngprocedure"></a><sup></sup>PROCEDURE Command</h1>
<p>
<a href="lngprocedurex.htm">Example</a> &nbsp; <a href="lngproceduresa.htm">See Also</a></p>
<p>
Identifies the beginning of a procedure in a program file.</p>
<p class=label>
<b>Syntax</b></p>
<p>
PROCEDURE <i>ProcedureName</i><br>
 &nbsp; <i>Commands</i><br>
 &nbsp; [RETURN [<i>eExpression</i> ]]</p>
<p>
ENDPROC</p>
<p class=label>
<b>Arguments</b></p>
<p class=dt>
<i>ProcedureName</i></p>
<p class=indent>
Specifies the name of the procedure to create.</p>
<p class=label>
<b>Remarks</b></p>
<p>
PROCEDURE is a statement within a program file that specifies the beginning of each procedure in the program file and defines the procedure name. Procedure names must begin with a letter or underscore and may contain any combination of letters, numbers, and underscores.</p>
<p>
In Visual FoxPro for Windows, procedure names can be up to 254 characters long.</p>
<p>
Comments can be placed on the same line after PROCEDURE and ENDPROC. These comments are ignored during compilation and program execution.</p>
<p>
The PROCEDURE statement is followed by a series of commands that make up the procedure. You can include <a href="lngreturn.htm">RETURN</a> anywhere in the procedure to return control to the calling program or to another program, and to define a value returned by the procedure. If you do not include a RETURN command, an implicit RETURN is automatically executed when the function quits. If the RETURN command does not include a return value (or if an implicit RETURN is executed), Visual FoxPro assigns .T. (True) as the return value.</p>
<p>
The procedure ends with the ENDPROC command. This command is optional; the procedure quits when it encounters another PROCEDURE command, a FUNCTION command, or the end of the program file.</p>
<p class=indent>
<B><b>Note</b></B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You cannot have normal executable program code included in a program file after procedures; only procedures, user-defined functions, and class definition can follow the first PROCEDURE or FUNCTION command in the file.</p>
<p>
When you execute a procedure with DO <i>ProcedureName</i>, Visual FoxPro searches for the procedure in a specific order. Visual FoxPro searches:
<ol>
<li>
The program containing DO <i>ProcedureName</i>.<br><br></li>
<li>
The current database.<br><br></li>
<li>
The procedure files opened with SET PROCEDURE.<br><br></li>
<li>
Programs in the execution chain. It searches program files beginning with the most recently executed program and continuing back to the first executed program.<br><br></li>
<li>
A stand-alone program file. If a program file with the same name as the file name specified with DO is found, Visual FoxPro executes the program. If a matching program file name isn't found, Visual FoxPro generates an error message.</li>
</ol>
<p>
Include the IN clause in DO to execute a procedure in a specific file.</p>
<p>
By default, parameters are passed to procedures by value. For information on passing parameters to procedures by reference, see <a href="lngset_udfparms.htm">SET UDFPARMS</a>. A maximum of 27 parameters can be passed to a procedure. Parameters can be passed to a procedure by including a PARAMETERS or LPARAMETERS statement in the procedure, or by placing a list of parameters immediately after PROCEDURE <i>ProcedureName</i>. Enclose the list of parameters in a set of parentheses, and separate the parameters with commas.</p>
