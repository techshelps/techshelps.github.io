<h1><a name="newcoverage_profiler_options_dialog_box"></a><sup></sup>Coverage Profiler Options Dialog Box</h1>
<p>
<a href="newcoverage_profiler_options_dialog_boxsa.htm">See Also</a></p>
<p>
Enables you to specify the path sensitivity, dialog format and environment, and the marks used for marking lines of code that run in your program or application, and the fonts for display and code.</p>
<h3>Dialog Box Options</h3>
<p class=dt>
<b>Use Smart Pathing</b></p>
<p class=indent>
Sets the Coverage Profiler to make certain assumptions about the location of files in your project or application according to how the files are listed in the coverage log. By default, Coverage Profiler prompts you to locate source files referenced in the coverage log. If you check this option, Coverage Profiler assumes that folders in which you have already located files contain additional source files you need.</p>
<p class=tl>
Uncheck this option for more complete control or if you have source files with the same name in different folders.</P><p class=dt>
<b>Register Add-Ins when run</b></p>
<p class=indent>
Sets the Coverage Profiler to retain for future use the path and name information of Add-Ins as you run them so that you can locate them in the drop-down list of the <a href="newcoverage_profiler_add-ins_dialog_box.htm">Add-Ins dialog box</a>.</p>
<p class=dt>
<b>Mark all code while log loads</b></p>
<p class=indent>
Marks lines of code as the Coverage Profiler processes the coverage log (.log). This setting can slow load performance, especially in larger files.</p>
<h4>Coverage Marks</h4>
<p class=dt>
<b>Executed</b></p>
<p class=indent>
Allows you to type a character or several characters, such as asterisks, to be used to mark each executed line of code.</p>
<p class=dt>
<b>Not Executed</b></p>
<p class=indent>
Allows you to type a character or several characters to be used to mark each line of code that is not run. A vertical bar is the default character.</p>
<p class=indent>
<B><b>Note</b></B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some lines in code, such as comments, DEFINE CLASS and ELSE statements, and lines within TEXT… ENDTEXT do not appear in coverage logs because they are not executable. Also, lines broken by continuation symbols (semicolons) are considered as a single line of code and are marked only on the last line.</p>
<h4>Start Mode</h4>
<p class=dt>
<b>Coverage</b></p>
<p class=indent>
Specifies that the Coverage Profiler application opens as a coverage analyzer, marking code that actually runs in selected projects or applications.</p>
<p class=dt>
<b>Profile</b></p>
<p class=indent>
Specifies that the Coverage Profiler application opens as a profiler, determining the amount of time required to run lines of code in the selected project or application.</p>
<h4>Environment</h4>
<p class=dt>
<b>Coverage frame</b></p>
<p class=indent>
Specifies that the Coverage Profiler application opens in the Windows desktop.</p>
<p class=dt>
<b>FoxPro frame</b></p>
<p class=indent>
Specifies that the Coverage Profiler application opens within the main Visual FoxPro window.</p>
<h4>Fonts</h4>
<p class=dt>
<b>Display Font</b></p>
<p class=indent>
Allows you to specify the font used in the <b>Source List</b> pane of <a href="newcoverage_profiler_window.htm">Coverage Profiler window</a>.</p>
<p class=dt>
<b>Code Font</b></p>
<p class=indent>
Allows you to specify the font used in the <b>Source Code</b> pane of the <a href="newcoverage_profiler_window.htm">Coverage Profiler window</a>.</p>
<p class=dt>
<b>Set as default</b></p>
<p class=indent>
Saves your selected options in the Windows registry. <b>Start</b> <b>mode</b> and <b>Environment</b> settings take effect when you restart Coverage Profiler.</p>
