<h3><a name="glsresolving_a_reference"></a><sup></sup>resolving a reference</h3>
<p>
When you add a call to a component and rebuild a project, Visual FoxPro automatically locates and includes the new component in the project. Any references to additional components contained in the new component are also resolved and their files are added to the project. By automatically adding necessary files to the project and checking for compilation errors in components that have changed, you can isolate both environmental and logical connection errors between components.</p>
