Cancels any changes made during the current transaction.</p>
<p class=label>
<b>Syntax</b></p>
<p>
ROLLBACK</p>
<p class=label>
<b>Remarks</b></p>
<p>
ROLLBACK restores the original tables, table memo files, and index files to the state they were in before the transaction began.</p>
<p>
When you modify records in a database that is part of a transaction, other users on the network do not have access (read or write) to the records until you end the transaction.</p>
<p>
When other users on the network try to access records you have modified, they must wait until you end your transaction. They receive the message "Record not available ... please wait" until the records become available. Because of this, it is important to keep the length of the transaction to a minimum or conduct the transaction during times when others do not need access.</p>
<p>
ROLLBACK undoes any changes made during the current transaction. If the transaction is nested, only the modifications made since the previous BEGIN TRANSACTION are undone. Program execution continues with the next statement.</p>
<p>
If any record or file locks were placed, they are released.</p>
