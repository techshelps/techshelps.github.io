<h2><a name="_cifs_21"></a><i></i>Message Transport</h2>
<p>
When using a reliable connection oriented transport, the CIFS protocol makes no higher level attempts to ensure sequenced delivery of messages between the client and server.  The transport must have some mechanism to detect failures of either the client or server node, and to deliver such an indication to the client or server software so they can clean up state.  When a reliable transport connection from a client terminates, all work in progress by that client is terminated by the server and all resources open by that client on the server are closed. Message transport is done using NETBIOS session service (see section 5.3 of RFC 1001 and section 4.3 of RFC 1002).</p>
