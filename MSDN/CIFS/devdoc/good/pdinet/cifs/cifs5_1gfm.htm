<p>
This document describes the file and print sharing protocol for a proposed Common Internet File System (CIFS). CIFS is intended to provide an open cross-platform mechanism for client systems to request file and print services from server systems over a network. It is based on the standard Server Message Block (SMB) protocol widely in use by personal computers and workstations running a wide variety of operating systems. An earlier version of this protocol was documented as part of the X/OPEN (now Open Group) CAE series of standards [7]; this document updates the specification to include the latest shipping versions, and is published to allow the creation of implementations that interoperate with those implementations.</p>

Use of the Internet and the World Wide Web has been characterized by read-only access. Existing protocols such as FTP are good solutions for one-way file transfer. However, new read/write interfaces will become increasingly necessary as the Internet becomes more interactive and collaborative. Adoption of a common file sharing protocol having modern semantics such as shared files, byte-range locking, coherent caching, change notification, replicated storage, etc. would provide important benefits to the Internet community.</p>
