<h3><a name="_cifs_10"></a>Distributed replicated virtual volumes</h3>
<p>
The protocol supports file system subtrees which look like to clients as if they are on a single volume and server, but which actually span multiple volumes and servers. The files and directories of such a subtree can be physically moved to different servers, and their names do not have to change, isolating clients from changes in the server configuration. These subtrees can also be transparently replicated for load sharing and fault tolerance. When a client requests a file, the protocol uses referrals to transparently direct a client to the server that stores it.</p>
