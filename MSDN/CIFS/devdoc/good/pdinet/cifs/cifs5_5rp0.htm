<h3><a name="_cifs_154"></a>Hijack connections</h3>
<p>
Any attacker that can inject packets into the network that appear to the server to be coming from a particular client, can hijack that client's connection. Once a connection is set up and the client has authenticated, subsequent packets are not authenticated, so the attacker can inject requests to read, write, or delete files to which the client has access. Doing so require that the injected packets have the right transport level sequence numbers, which can be tricky, especially if the client is sending packets at the same time. It is significantly more difficult to hijack a connection than to eavesdrop, and doing so only permits the attacker to access files as the client for the duration of the session.</p>
