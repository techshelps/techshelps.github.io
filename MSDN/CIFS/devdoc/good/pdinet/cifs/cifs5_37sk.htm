<h3><a name="_cifs_24"></a>Connection Management</h3>
<p>
Once a connection is established, the rules for reliable transport connection dissolution are:
<ul>
<li>
If a server receives a transport establishment request from a client with which it is already conversing, the server may terminate all other transport connections to that client.  This is to recover from the situation where the client was suddenly rebooted and was unable to cleanly terminate its resource sharing activities with the server.</li>
<li>
A server may drop the transport connection to a client at any time if the client is generating malformed or illogical requests.  However, wherever possible the server should first return an error code to the client indicating the cause of the abort.</li>
<li>
If a server gets a hard error on the transport (such as a send failure) the transport connection to that client may be aborted.</li>
<li>
A server may terminate the transport connection when the client has no open resources on the server, however, we recommend that the termination be performed only after some time has passed or if resources are scarce on the server.  This will help performance in that the transport connection will not need to be reestablished if activity soon begins anew. Client software is expected to be able to automatically reconnect to the server if this happens..   </li>
</ul>
