<p>
Microsoft has teamed up with a select group of industry-leading support providers called Microsoft Authorized Support Centers (ASCs). These independent companies meet Microsoft's strict quality standards for support. They also have extensive Microsoft product knowledge, as well as expertise in supporting hardware, software, and networking products from other vendors. ASCs offer a wide range of one-stop-shopping services, from setting up a help desk to delivering mission-critical support for all phases of planning, implementing, and maintaining a client/server system. ASCs are, in essence, a virtual extension of the Microsoft Technical Support organization. They can bring to your company a whole new set of unique and invaluable capabilities to ensure a cohesive, high-performance business solution. For more information, contact your Microsoft account representative, or visit the http://www.microsoft.com/servad/asc/ site. </p>
