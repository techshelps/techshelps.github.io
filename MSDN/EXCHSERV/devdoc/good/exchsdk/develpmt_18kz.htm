<h2><a name="_edk_using_nmake_switches"></a>Using NMAKE Switches</h2>
<p>
When building an application outside the Visual C++ development environment, you do so by opening a command prompt and typing NMAKE<b> </b>in the application's directory. This executes the makefile in that directory using the options specified in the BASEMAKE.INC file, assuming that the BASEMAKE environment variable has been set equal to the BASEMAKE.INC file. In addition to the standard set of options available with NMAKE, the Microsoft Exchange Server SDK defines several other options. They include the following switches:
<ul>
<li>
<b>INCLUDE=</b>  Specifies the path of the INCLUDE directory. Unless this switch is set to some other directory, the default path is set to \BKOFFICE\include.</li>
<li>
<b>LIB=</b>  Sets the path to the EXCHSDK library directory. Unless some other directory is specified, the default path is \BKOFFICE\LIB\I386.</li>
<li>
<b>PACK=</b>  Enables linking on a function-by-function basis by creating packaged functions. This setting invokes the /GY compiler switch. The default is set to Yes.</li>
<li>
<b>LOG=</b>  Sets a destination directory and output file for errors generated during the build. Setting LOG=No causes error messages to be sent to the screen, rather than to a file. Otherwise, error messages are sent to the $(OBJDIR)\$(PROJ).OUT file, which is the default behavior. The file is created in the <i>&lt;component&gt;</i>\WIN32\&lt;<i>build type</i>&gt; directory, where &lt;<i>component</i>&gt; is the name of the project. </li>
<li>
<b>WARNING_LEVEL=</b>  Sets the default warning level. Valid settings are 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4, with 4 as the highest warning level and 0 as the lowest level (no warnings). Default level is 3.</li>
<li>
<b>BLDTYPE=</b>  Sets the build type. See <a href="develpmt_39id.htm">Setting the Build Type</a>.</li>
<li>
<b>MSVCER=</b>  Sets the Microsoft Visual C++ version. This switch must be set to 4.0 or later.</li>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<p>
Setting one or more switches on the NMAKE command line invokes that particular option for that one build. All other current settings remain intact.</p>
