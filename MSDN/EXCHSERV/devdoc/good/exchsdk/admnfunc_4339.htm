<h2><a name="_gdk_monitoring_gateway_performance"></a>Monitoring Gateway Performance</h2>
<p>
The Microsoft Exchange Server SDK provides a performance monitoring interface layer between the gateway and the Windows NT Performance Monitor functions. This interface provides an easy way to publish statistics that are commonly needed for a gateway. Gateways can use the MONITOR.LIB library to:
<ul>
<li>
Collect gateway data</li>
<li>
Calculate statistics using the STATS.LIB library</li>
<li>
Write statistics to memory-mapped files</li>
</ul>
<p>
A performance monitor DLL is responsible for taking data from the memory mapped files and presenting it to the Windows NT Performance Monitor. The Performance Monitor uses the DLL to poll the memory-mapped files at periodic intervals to retrieve performance data.</p>
<p>
<b>Note</b>  A gateway must be run at least once before its object becomes visible in the Performance Monitor.</p>
<p>
The following figure shows the complete performance monitoring process. The shaded areas are the components you need to build.</p>
