<h3><a name="_gdk_performance_monitor_dlls"></a>Performance Monitor DLLs</h3>
<p>
You must supply a DLL with your gateway that reads performace data from the memory-mapped files created by each gateway instance and places it in the Windows NT Registry so that the Windows NT Performance Monitor can access it. This DLL services the memory-mapped files for all instances of the gateway. </p>
<p>
A performance monitor DLL must open the memory mapped files when the Performance Monitor starts, collect performance data each time the Performance Monitor requests a sample, and close the memory-mapped files when the Performance Monitor stops. Performance monitor DLLs use a counter structure for transferring data into the Windows NT Registry.</p>
<p>
Performance monitor DLLs must implement the following functions.</p>
<table cellspacing=4 cols=2>
<tr valign=top>
<th align=left width=49%>Function</th>
<th align=left width=51%>Purpose</th>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=49%><b>OpenGatewayPerformanceData</b></td>
<td width=51%>Opens the memory mapped files, creates a connection to the Windows NT application event log, and passes a copy of the counter structure to the registry.</td>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=49%><b>CollectGatewayPerformanceData</b></td>
<td width=51%>Updates the performance data in the registry with data from the memory mapped files. There are multiple memory-mapped files if there are multiple instances of a gateway. In that case, The DLL can merge them into one structure before passing it to the Performance Monitor.</td>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=49%><b>CloseGatewayPerformanceData</b></td>
<td width=51%>Closes the memory mapped files, frees memory used by the counter structure, and disconnects from the application event log.</td>
</tr>
