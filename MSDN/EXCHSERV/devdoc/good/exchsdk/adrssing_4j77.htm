<h2><a name="_gdk_address_syntax_programs"></a>Address Syntax Programs</h2>
<p>
Address syntax programs work together with <a href="adrssing_1bzn.htm">Address Entry Templates</a> to convert data entered in an address entry template dialog box into a proxy address string. When the user clicks <b>OK</b> or <b>Accept</b> in an address template dialog box, the Microsoft Exchange Server address book reads the data from the dialog box and uses it to create the custom address in the correct syntax. You need to provide an address syntax program that the address book can use to translate the entered data into the complete address. This program is the Address-Syntax attribute on the Address-Entry-Template object.</p>
<p>
This program is written in a special assembly-like address syntax language and is not compiled into executable code for each platform that your gateway is compiled for. It is byte-compiled into a special binary data file that is used by the Microsoft Exchange Server address book. This program does the work of converting data from the address entry template dialog box into an actual address string. Because the program is not compiled into platform-specific executable code, it is portable across all platforms supported by Microsoft Exchange Server.</p>
<h5><img src="../../images/wedge.gif" border=0>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To create the address syntax binary file</h5>
<ol>
<li>
Use the fields defined in the address template text file to determine how to generate the proxy addresses from the template input.</li>
<li>
Write the address syntax program in symbolic format.</li>
<li>
Convert the symbolic program into the binary data stored in a file.</li>
</ol>
