<h2><a name="_edk_editing_migration_files"></a>Editing Migration Files</h2>
<p>
You can edit migration files to change or add data. You edit the primary files after they are extracted and before they are imported with the Migration Wizard. </p>
<p>
<b>Important</b>  Editing the secondary files is not recommended. Changes to secondary files require recalculating all offsets and then updating the primary file.</p>
<p>
You may want to edit the primary files for the following reasons:
<ul>
<li>
To change the common names of <a href="glossary_1ood.htm#_edk_mailbox">mailboxes</a>. You can only do this before the mailbox is created.</li>
<li>
To make the aliases different from the common names.</li>
<li>
To change the display name format.</li>
<li>
To parse the display name to generate the given name and surname fields, depending on the configuration of your source extractor.</li>
<li>
To add additional fields and data (telephone numbers, department names, and other items) to the directory. </li>
<li>
To delete all messages sent before a certain date if your source extractor doesn’t support the limiting of messages.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<b>Important</b>  Editing migration files can introduce invalid or incorrect data. Make a backup of all migration files before editing them.</p>
<p>
You can avoid editing the primary file by configuring the source extractor appropriately. For example, you can configure the source extractor to create given names and surnames, or to accept a text file of the old mailbox names and their new Microsoft Exchange Server common names. Use the following procedures to modify common names.</p>
<h5><img src="../../images/wedge.gif" border=0>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To modify the common names of mailboxes </h5>
<ol>
<li>
Configure the source extractor to create files with mailbox creation information only.</li>
<li>
Modify the small primary file, and then use the source extractor to create migration files that don’t need editing.</li>
<li>
Import the smaller mailbox creation files, and then import the mailbox data files.</li>
</ol>
<p>
You can also use the <b>Directory</b> <b>Import</b> and <b>Directory</b> <b>Export</b> commands instead of the Migration Wizard to import data. You can use these commands to change the display names, addresses, given names, surnames, and other mailbox properties.</p>
<p>
<b>Important</b>  Some primary file fields may exceed 255 characters, but some spreadsheet programs can’t hold more than 255 characters in a cell. The extra characters may be truncated without notice, causing a loss of data.</p>
