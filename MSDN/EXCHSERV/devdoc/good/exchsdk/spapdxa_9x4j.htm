<h2><a name="_splus_style_definitions"></a>Style Definitions</h2>
<p>
The style definitions follow the header. Style definitions are used by print layouts and are unique to page formats. The page format determines the required font size.</p>
<p>
<b>Note</b>  A page format must include all of the styles that a view requires; otherwise the view will not print onto that page format. Therefore, it is important to define a large set of styles. See the list of recommended formats later in this section.</p>
<p>
The style definitions start with the keyword STYLE, and are followed by specifications for each style. They look like this:</p>
<pre><code>STYLE
{style name}, ["{friendly name}"], "{font name}", SWISS | ROMAN | MODERN | DECORATIVE | DONTCARE, {point-size-small}, {point-size-medium}, {point-size-large} [, BOLD | ITALIC | STRIKEOUT]
 </code></pre>
<p>
Point sizes for small, medium, and large must be specified to support the user interface, which can prompt for either the small font set, medium font set, or large font set. As a guideline, only styles that are used by appointment or task text should have different sizes for small, medium, and large. Style names should not be the same as other keywords.</p>
<p>
The friendly name is a name that describes the style. For Schedule+ this entry should be <b>Null</b>.</p>
<p>
The style specifications are repeated as many times as necessary. The keyword STYLE does not need to be repeated.</p>
