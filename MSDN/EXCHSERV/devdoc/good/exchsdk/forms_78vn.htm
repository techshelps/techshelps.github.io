<h1><a name="_edk_forms"></a>Forms</h1>
<p>
To develop forms-based applications for Microsoft Exchange Server, you use <a href="glossary_1ood.htm#_edk_mapi">MAPI</a> forms interfaces. These interfaces give you the ability to define custom <a href="#_edk_forms">forms</a>, install them in forms libraries, and supply them to users of Microsoft Exchange Server. You can also develop forms with the Microsoft Exchange Forms Designer, which in turn calls the MAPI forms interfaces. For more information on creating forms, see the <i>MAPI Programmer's Reference</i>, and the <i>Microsoft Exchange Server Application Designer's Guide</i>.</p>
<p>
Any MAPI-compliant forms application can run in the Microsoft Exchange Server environment. Developers of these applications can take advantage of the following facilities of Microsoft Exchange Server:
<ul>
<li>
<b>Organization forms library</b>  Stores forms for an entire organization. </li>
<li>
<b>Folder forms libraries</b>  Allows users to install folder-specific forms.</li>
<li>
<b>Conflict-resolution capability</b>  Can be invoked when multiple versions of same message have been created by different users. </li>
</ul>
