<h2><a name="_splus_the_metapage"></a>The Metapage</h2>
<p>
The metapage is the logical coordinate system you use to place objects on the page layout. The coordinate system of the metapage is automatically scaled to the actual page size. For example, if you use a metapage of 100x100 pixels, you can work in percentages of the page. Metapage coordinates are expressed in the format (left, top, right, bottom), where all values are absolute coordinates. In the example of 100x100 pixels, all objects must be in the rectangle (0,0,100,100). An object in this page that exists from (0,0,30,100) would take up the top 30% of the page. If the page were actually 1000 pixels by 500 pixels, then the object would exist on the physical page in the rectangle (0,0,300,500).</p>
<p>
<b>Note</b>  All text in the print file must be in uppercase because the parser does not accept lowercase characters. The only exception to this rule is the use of mixed-case text within quoted strings and in comment lines.</p>
<p>
The first line of the print file must start with the word VIEW. The VIEW command allows the print engine to verify that the file is in the expected format. If the first line is not in the following format, an error message dialog box appears and the printing is stopped:</p>
<pre><code>VIEW "{<i>view name</i>}", "{<i>format name</i>}", "{<i>view type</i>}",{<i>meta-x</i>}, {<i>meta-y</i>}
 </code></pre>
<p>
where
<dl>
<dt>
{<i>view name</i>} </dt>
<dd>
Specifies the name of the view.</dd>
<dt>
{<i>format name</i>}</dt>
<dd>
Specifies the name of the preferred page format for the the view (less than 40 characters in length). The preferred page format does not have to be available — if it is not found, a default format is used. </dd>
<dt>
{<i>view type</i>}</dt>
<dd>
Specifies the range of dates the print objects are given, and can have the following values.
<table cellspacing=4 cols=2>
<tr valign=top>
<th align=left width=36%>View type</th>
<th align=left width=64%>Description</th>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=36%>DAILY (default)</td>
<td width=64%>This value can be omitted, but a comma must be inserted in its place unless you are entering no other values on the line. If you eliminate a parameter and use a default, you must enter a comma to indicate a missing value.<p>
When this view is printed for <i>n</i> days, it is iterated <i>n</i> times with the date range being a single day and incremented a day at a time. </p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=36%>WEEKLY</td>
<td width=64%>When this view is printed for <i>n</i> weeks, it is iterated <i>n</i> times with the date range being a week and incremented a week at a time. The start day is always the start of the week. </td>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=36%>WORKWEEKLY</td>
<td width=64%>This view is a special form of WEEKLY that considers a week to be the days Monday through Friday. The start day is always the start of the work week.</td>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=36%>MONTHLY</td>
<td width=64%>When this view is printed for <i>n</i> months, it is iterated <i>n</i> times with the date range being a month and incremented a month at a time. The start day is always the start of the month.</td>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=36%>ALL</td>
<td width=64%>This value iterates the print view only once for the entire range being printed. This is useful for appointment text views or task views, where all the information is printed at once rather than in terms of time intervals.</td>
</tr>
</table><br>

</dd>
<dt>
{<i>meta-x</i>}, {<i>meta-y</i>}</dt>
<dd>
Integers that describe the size of the metapage. The default is 100.
</dd>
</dl>
<p>
The following lines all illustrate a valid first line, and are equivalent:</p>
<pre><code>VIEW "My Own View","Letter",DAILY,100,100
VIEW "My Own View","Letter",DAILY
VIEW "My Own View","Letter",100,100
VIEW "My Own View","Letter"
 </code></pre>
<p>
You can enter any text after the VIEW line. All characters outside quoted strings are ignored and any line beginning with a semicolon (;) is treated as a comment, as is anything between a semicolon and a new line.</p>
