<h2><a name="_edk_building_an_individual_sample_application"></a>Building an Individual Sample Application</h2>
<p>
The shipped versions of the sample applications are built with the RETAIL build type. If do not specify a build type when building an individual sample application, it will be of the DEBUG build type. To build a sample application with the build type of DEBUG, rebuild the libraries in the \BKOFFICE\SAMPLES\EXCHANGE\LIBSRC directory with the build type of DEBUG. The combined library of the DEBUG build type is called EXCHSDKD.LIB. The combined library for the RETAIL build type is EXCHSDK.LIB.</p>
<p>
In some cases, build products are copied to the directory from which the individual sample application is installed or run. In all cases, a Win32 subdirectory is added below the current directory and a subdirectory for the build type is added below it. All object files, .LIB files, and output files are placed in the DEBUG or RETAIL subdirectory according to build type. </p>
<p>
The following procedure describes the general process of building individual sample applications.</p>
<h5><img src="../../images/wedge.gif" border=0>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To build an individual sample application</h5>
<ol>
<li>
Change to the directory containing the sample application:<p>
\BKOFFICE\SAMPLES\EXCHANGE\&lt;<i>sample application name</i>&gt;
</li>
<li>
Type <b>NMAKE [BLDTYPE=RETAIL]</b>.</li>
<li>
For usage information, type &lt;<i>application name</i>&gt; /? at the command prompt.</li>
</ol>
<h5><img src="../../images/wedge.gif" border=0>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To rebuild the libraries with a DEBUG build type</h5>
<ol>
<li>
Change to the directory containing the makefile that builds all the libraries:<p>
\BKOFFICE\SAMPLES\EXCHANGE\LIBSRC
</li>
<li>
Type <b>NMAKE</b>.<p>
This builds all the libraries with the DEBUG build type. 
</li>
</ol>
<p>
<b>Note</b>  You cannot rebuild the libraries from the \BKOFFICE\SAMPLES\EXCHANGE\LIBSRC\EXCHSDK directory. This makefile only contains instructions for gathering the already compiled individual libraries into the EXCHSDK.LIB library. See <a href="develpmt_39id.htm">Setting the Build Type</a>.</p>
