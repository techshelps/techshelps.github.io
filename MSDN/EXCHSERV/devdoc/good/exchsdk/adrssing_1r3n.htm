The proxy generation DLL must provide the following entry points.</p>

<p>
Because proxy address generation is handled by a DLL, it is not portable to different platforms. If you are running Microsoft Exchange Server on multiple platforms, such as Intel and DEC-Alpha, you will have to compile your proxy generation DLL separately on each platform and install the appropriate version on at least one server of each type of platform at a site. Each server must have the proxy generation DLL available to it because proxy addresses are only generated when a recipient object is created on a server or when the DLL is installed. When information about the new address type is replicated to the other servers at the site, those servers will locate and copy the DLL to themselves and perform the normal proxy address generation.</p>
