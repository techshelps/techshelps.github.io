<p>
A&nbsp;<a href="glossary_1ooj.htm#_edk_server_application">server application's</a> directory <a href="glossary_1oof.htm#_edk_object">object</a> makes the application visible to the <a href="glossary_1ood.htm#_edk_microsoft_exchange_server_administrator_program">Microsoft Exchange Server Administrator program</a> Through the Administrator program, administrators manage an application's <a href="glossary_1oo4.htm#_edk_directory">directory</a> attributes by using its object's <a href="glossary_1oog.htm#_edk_property_sheet">property sheet</a>. Property sheets are composed of one or more <a href="glossary_1oog.htm#_edk_property_page">property pages</a>. You can extend the Administrator program to include custom property pages, and you add property pages by creating <a href="glossary_1oo1.htm#_edk_administrator_extension_dll">Administrator extension DLLs</a>. </p>
<p>
You can also create new data fields for a directory object, control these new fields through custom property pages, and manage this application-specific <a href="glossary_1oo5.htm#_edk_extension_data">extension data</a>. These property pages can be used by administrators to view other data accessible on a Microsoft Exchange Server system, such as data in an <a href="glossary_1oo9.htm#_edk_information_store">information store</a>. The Extension-Data attribute is used to associate these new data fields with your application's directory object. Special Administrator extension functions provide support for the Extension-Data directory attribute. Extension data is commonly used to configure an application's behavior.</p>
<p>
Several sample applications included with this SDK illustrate the installation and use of Administrator extension DLLs that extend the abilities of the Administrator program. They include the Queue Viewer (<a href="admin_7kdv.htm#_edk_queue_viewer">QUEVIEW</a>), the Extension Data Viewer (<a href="admin_7kdv.htm#_edk_extdatvw">EXTDATVW</a>), the Mailbox Extension sample application (<a href="admin_7kdv.htm#_edk_mbxserv">MBXSERV</a>), the Sample Mailbox Agent (<a href="admin_7kdv.htm#_edk_smbagent">SMBAGENT</a>), and the <a href="admin_7kdv.htm#_edk_sample_gateway">Sample Gateway</a>.  </p>
<h4>Benefits of Extending the Administrator Program</h4>
<p>
Although you can write your own custom administration interfaces for your <a href="glossary_1ooj.htm#_edk_server_application">server application</a>, it is usually more efficient to extend the Administrator program. Benefits of using Microsoft Exchange Server Administrator extensions include the following centralized administration capabilities:
<ul>
<li>
<b>A single program</b>  The Administrator program can be used to control a wide range of applications from many different vendors. Performing administration tasks at a central location can standardize and thus streamline the work of an administrator.</li>
<li>
<b>Advanced features </b> Advanced features of the Administrator program, such as remote administration, are available to all applications. </li>
<li>
<b>Replication</b>  The Microsoft Exchange Server directory is replicated across an entire <a href="glossary_1oof.htm#_edk_organization">organization</a>. Storing objects in the directory leverages this automatic replication mechanism. </li>
<li>
<b>User interface</b>  The Administrator program provides a user interface, so you don't need to write one for your server application. Using this user interface eliminates the need for users and administrators to learn an additional user interface.</li>
</ul>
