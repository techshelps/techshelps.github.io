<p>
Before you install a Microsoft Exchange Server gateway:
<ul>
<li>
Microsoft Exchange Server must be installed and running.</li>
<li>
The Microsoft Exchange Server Administrator program must be installed on the computer on which the gateway will run.</li>
</ul>
<p>
The computer from which you install the gateway does not have to be the Microsoft Exchange Server computer. This means that you can install a gateway remotely.</p>
<p>
If your gateway is designed to operate as a service of Windows NT Server, an administrator needs to set up a Windows NT Server account with the “Log on as a service” right for the gateway before running its setup program. The documentation for your gateway’s setup procedure should make these prerequisites clear. </p>
