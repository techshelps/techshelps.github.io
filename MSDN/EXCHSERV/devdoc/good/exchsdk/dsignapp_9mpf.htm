<p>
If you can’t find anything wrong with the primary file lines with error reports, trace errors with the following procedure:</p>
<h5><img src="../../images/wedge.gif" border=0>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To check for errors in a primary file</h5>
<ol>
<li>
Make a backup copy of the original migration files.</li>
<li>
Edit the primary file to remove all lines with error reports.</li>
<li>
Import the edited files. <p>
Error reports can now be eliminated. However, if errors are still reported, the errors are in the previous lines. The errors in the previous lines did not stop the importing, but did cause problems in the next lines.
</li>
<li>
Make a copy of the backup migration files.</li>
<li>
Edit the primary file, removing the lines previous to the lines with error reports.</li>
<li>
Import the edited files. <p>
The error reports can now be eliminated. 
</li>
<li>
If errors are still reported, repeat steps 4 through 7, removing lines previous to the lines removed in the last test.</li>
</ol>
<p>
Once you identify the problem lines, see how they differ from lines that were successfully imported, or how they differ from the proper migration file format.</p>
