<h2><a name="_edk_attachment_object"></a>Attachment Object</h2>
<p>
A message can have an <i>attachment</i>—additional data in the form of a file, another message, or an OLE object associated with it. This attachment appears either as an icon or metafile embedded within or adjacent to the main body of a message. A message can have zero, one, or many attachments. Attachments are always transmitted with the message.</p>
<p>
An attachment object represents a document that is an attachment of a message. For more information on the attachment object, see the <i>Active Messaging Library</i>. To create a new attachment within a message, call the <b>IMessage::CreateAttach</b> method, which is implemented by information store providers.</p>
<p>
For more information on accessing attachment objects through MAPI, see <a href="msgxfer_86yb.htm">Message Transfer Envelopes and Attached Messages</a>.</p>
