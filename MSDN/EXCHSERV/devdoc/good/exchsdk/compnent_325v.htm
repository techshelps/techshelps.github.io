<h2><a name="_edk_about_rules"></a>About Rules</h2>
<p>
Microsoft Exchange Server uses rules to automatically execute predefined actions on selected objects. You can also develop applications that use rules to carry out predefined or custom actions. For example:
<ul>
<li>
Rules can be triggered when mail arrives at a user's mailbox or items are sent or posted to a public folder. These rules can set up or control an often-used combination of condition and action. </li>
<li>
Rules can perform a part of an application's activity, such as setting up folder structures.</li>
</ul>
<p>
For more information on developing applications that use rules, see <a href="infostor_79gz.htm">Working with Rules</a>.</p>
<p>
A rule can be set up to run on either Microsoft Exchange Server or on the Microsoft Exchange Client. All rules on the client are known as <a href="glossary_1oo4.htm#_edk_deferred_action">deferred action</a> rules. Rules on the server are of the following two types:
<ul>
<li>
<b>Rules on Public folders</b>  A predefined, limited set of rules. </li>
<li>
<b>Rules on Mailboxes</b>  The predefined rules, as well as <a href="compnent_9wxf.htm">custom actions</a> that are invoked by mailbox rules. Custom actions take place on the Microsoft Exchange Client through the deferred action mechanism.   </li>
</ul>
<p>
The mechanism for rules includes the following:
<ul>
<li>
<b>Server rules engine</b>  Part of the <a href="glossary_1oo9.htm#_edk_information_store">information store</a> process that monitors messages that are sent to other users or posted to <a href="glossary_1oog.htm#_edk_public_folder">public folders</a>.</li>
<li>
<b>Client interface</b>  The interface used for setting rules and for carrying out deferred actions.</li>
<li>
<a href="intrface_1iw5.htm"><b>IExchangeModifyTable</b></a> <b>interface</b>  An interface similar to an <b>IMAPITable</b> interface that is capable of handling the condition and action structures of rules.</li>
<li>
<a href="intrface_208e.htm"><b>IExchangeRuleAction</b></a> <b>interface</b>  An interface used to retrieve actions from deferred action messages.</li>
<li>
<a href="intrface_0jqs.htm"><b>IExchangeRuleExt</b></a><b> interface and <a href="intrface_64rv.htm">IExchangeRuleExtCallback</a></b> <b>interface</b>  Interfaces that provide users with custom deferred actions that can be selected from the Microsoft Exchange Client interface.</li>
</ul>
