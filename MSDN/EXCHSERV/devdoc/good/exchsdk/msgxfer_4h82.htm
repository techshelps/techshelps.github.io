<h2><a name="_gdk_gateway_to_foreign_system_report_transfer"></a>Gateway to Foreign System Report Transfer</h2>
<p>
The following steps are performed when the gateway transfers a report to the foreign system:
<ol>
<li>
When a report is created in the foreign system, a foreign Report-ID is assigned. </li>
<li>
The gateway stores the foreign Report-ID in the gateway report’s PR_FOREIGN_REPORT_ID. </li>
<li>
The Subject-ID of the foreign report is assigned from the gateway report’s PR_FOREIGN_SUBJECT_ID.</li>
<li>
When the report has been transferred to the foreign system, the gateway creates an entry in the accounting and audit log containing the PR_MTS_REPORT_ID, PR_FOREIGN_REPORT_ID, PR_MTS_SUBJECT_ID, and PR_FOREIGN_SUBJECT_ID. </li>
</ol>
<p>
The gateway does not need to save a copy of the report; no further correlation will be required because reports must never generate further reports. </p>
