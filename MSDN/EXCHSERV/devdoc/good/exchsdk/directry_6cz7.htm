<h1><a name="_edk_using_directory_access_pseudo_attributes"></a>Using Directory Access Pseudo-Attributes</h1>
<p>
<a href="glossary_1oo4.htm#_edk_directory_access_functions">Directory access functions</a> use several <a href="glossary_1oog.htm#_edk_pseudo_attribute">pseudo-attributes</a> that exist alongside Microsoft Exchange Server <a href="glossary_1oo4.htm#_edk_directory_schema">directory schema</a> <a href="glossary_1oo1.htm#_edk_attribute">attributes</a> to provide additional functionality. They are available for use with directory access functions only.</p>
<p>
These attributes are not part of the directory schema, and therefore cannot be accessed through the Microsoft Exchange Server Administrator program in <a href="glossary_1ooi.htm#_edk_raw_mode">raw mode</a>. However, pseudo-attributes are treated like schema attributes in that they can be specified alongside schema attributes in the header line of an import file used by <a href="function_1v1w.htm"><b>BatchImport</b></a> or <a href="function_1cac.htm"><b>BatchExport</b></a>.</p>
<p>
<b>Pseudo-Attributes Used by Directory Access Functions</b></p>
<table cellspacing=4 cols=2>
<tr valign=top>
<th align=left width=23%>Pseudo-Attribute</th>
<th align=left width=77%>Purpose</th>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=23%><b>Home-Server</b></td>
<td width=77%>Stores the values of the HomeMDB, HomeMTA, and HomeDSA schema attributes.</td>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=23%><b>Obj-Container</b></td>
<td width=77%>Sets the name of the <a href="glossary_1oo3.htm#_edk_container">container</a> from which you're exporting when used with an export command. <p>
Obj-Container is ignored when it is used with an import command and the DAPI_OVERRIDE_CONTAINER flag is set. If this flag is not set, the value specified in the import file for Obj-Container overrides the <b>pszContainer</b> attribute.</p>
<p>
At initialization, you specify the basepoint parent container, but Obj-Container overrides it for the parent container or even for the basepoint, on an object-by-object basis. If all the objects you need to export are in the same container, you do not need to use Obj-Container. But if 90 percent of the objects you are exporting are in one container and 5 percent are in another, choose the first as the default container, then override it with Obj-Container.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=23%><b>Obj-Admins</b></td>
<td width=77%>Specifies the names of Windows NT Server accounts that are to be given administrator privilege on the object. The <a href="function_1q79.htm"><b>DAPIWrite</b></a> and <a href="function_1v1w.htm"><b>BatchImport</b></a> functions import the Obj-Admins attribute only if the flag DAPI_RESTRICT_ACCESS is set.</td>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=23%><b>Obj-Search</b></td>
<td width=77%>This pseudo-attribute is recognized on container objects only, and is similar to <b>Obj-Admins</b>. Windows NT accounts specified for <b>Obj-Search </b>are granted the privilege to administer security settings in the directory. </td>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=23%><b>Obj-Users</b></td>
<td width=77%>Specifies the names of Windows NT Server accounts that are to have user privilege on the object. The <b>DAPIWrite</b> and <b>BatchImport</b> functions import the Obj-Users attribute only if the flag DAPI_RESTRICT_ACCESS is set.</td>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=23%><b>Member</b></td>
<td width=77%>Specifies the names of object members if this object is a distribution list. In all other cases, specifies the distribution lists of which the object is a member. <p>
If an object is a member of a distribution list, change this membership by changing the Members attribute of the object. But if a distribution list is a member of other distribution lists, change these memberships by changing the Members attributes of the containing (not contained) distribution lists.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=23%><b>Mode</b></td>
<td width=77%>Specifies the operation mode for the import procedure and is optional. For complete information, see <a href="appendxa_2ik4.htm">Specifying the Import Mode for BatchImport</a>.</td>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=23%><b>Secondary-Proxy-<br>
Addresses</b> </td>
<td width=77%>When a request is made to export the Proxy-Addresses attribute, only the primary proxy address (the address used as the originator address on outgoing messages) is exported for each address type. To export secondary proxy addresses (additional addresses for which a gateway will accept incoming mail) the caller must request the Secondary-Proxy-Addresses pseudo-attribute.</td>
