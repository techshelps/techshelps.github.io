<p>
Transport Neutral Encoding Format (TNEF) provides a standard method for passing both textual and binary message data. In this method, TNEF encapsulates MAPI properties not supported by an underlying messaging system into a binary stream that can accompany a message through transports and gateways. The target transport can then decode the encapsulation to retrieve all the properties of the original message.</p>
<p>
Because a message consists of MAPI properties, your gateway can use TNEF to encapsulate the message properties into a binary stream. This stream can then be attached to an outbound message for transfer by the gateway. A gateway must be able to determine whether an attachment is a TNEF attachment.</p>
<p>
You can use TNEF when you want to create extra MAPI properties (for example, in a custom message class) and put these extra properties into an attachment. You can also attach multiple messages to each other in a form that the foreign system understands. Using TNEF lets you transmit messages with more complex formats, such as rich text.</p>
<p>
When mapping addresses, first determine whether any of the Responsibility-TRUE recipients are TNEF. The Boolean MAPI property PR_SEND_RICH_INFO indicates whether the recipients can use TNEF. Send all TNEF recipients a separate message containing the TNEF attachment.</p>
<p>
<b>Note</b>  Do not include reports in TNEF attachments. </p>
<p>
TNEF attachments can be included in or excluded from the TNEF stream. Excluded attachments must have unique names. TNEF generates a tagged form of the message text that is used on inbound processing to recover attachment positions.</p>
<p>
