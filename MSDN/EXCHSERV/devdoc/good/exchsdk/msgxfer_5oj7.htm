<p>
A message always has an associated recipient table, and can also have attachments and embedded messages. Embedded messages have their own PR_MESSAGE_CLASS and PR_SUBJECT properties as well as their own recipient tables. The recipient table has the MAPI properties shown in the following table for each recipient of the message.</p>
<p>
<b>Recipient Table Properties</b></p>
<table cellspacing=4 cols=2>
<tr valign=top>
<th align=left width=48%>Property Name</th>
<th align=left width=52%>Description</th>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=48%>PR_ADDRTYPE</td>
<td width=52%>Type of address, for example SMTP.</td>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=48%>PR_DISPLAY_NAME</td>
<td width=52%>Recipient’s display name. For example, “John Doe.”</td>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=48%>PR_EMAIL_ADDRESS</td>
<td width=52%>Recipients’s address in the format indicated by PR_ADDRTYPE. For example “johnd@microsoft.com.”</td>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=48%>PR_ENTRYID</td>
<td width=52%>Entry Identifier with the Microsoft Exchange Server address book for a recipient.</td>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=48%>PR_RECIPIENT_NUMBER</td>
<td width=52%>A recipient’s ordinal number in the recipient list.</td>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=48%>PR_RECIPIENT_TYPE</td>
<td width=52%>Recipient type, MAPI_TO.</td>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=48%>PR_SEND_RICH_INFO</td>
<td width=52%>Recipient is a MAPI recipient.</td>
</tr>
</table><br>
<p>
<b>Note</b>  A gateway must always check the recipient table of the embedded MAPI message to find the correct value for the PR_SEND_RICH_INFO property. A message sent to a one-off address through a gateway does not carry this property on its MTE.</p>
<p>
MAPI Folders use the <b>IMAPIFolder</b> interface. <b>IMAPIFolder</b> presents methods for accessing a table of messages contained in the folder, and manipulating the contents of that table and its messages.</p>
<p>
The following topics discuss working with MAPI messages and folders. For more complete details, see the <i>MAPI Programmers’ Guide</i>. Keep in mind that gateways are a special kind of client application, and as such not all of the information on this subject in the MAPI documentation is directly applicable to gateways. </p>
