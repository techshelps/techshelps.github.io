<h2><a name="_splus_multiple_pages"></a>Multiple Pages</h2>
<p>
The print view can be defined as multiple pages. The PAGE command breaks to a new page, and all objects defined after the PAGE command refer to the new page. However, the date is not automatically incremented.</p>
<p>
A page can also be defined as a repeating page. Repeating pages repeat themselves until they are empty. These are useful when combined with <a href="spapdxa_95x3.htm">OVERFLOW</a> objects, because they allow all the overflow information to be printed. The OVERFLOW command converts a page to a repeating page. In general, the OVERFLOW command should appear before the first object on a given page.</p>
<p>
<b>Note</b>  The OVERFLOW command should not be confused with the OVERFLOW object.</p>
<p>
An important consideration is that a repeating page must not contain any objects that produce overflow buffer items. If it has such objects, the page can generate more overflow buffer items while it is printing the buffer contents, and thus enter an infinite printing loop.</p>
