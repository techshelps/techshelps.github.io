<h1><a name="_edk_toolform_creating_a_c_or_c_form"></a>TOOLFORM: Creating a C or C++ Form</h1>
<p>
The TOOLFORM sample application demonstrates how to create a <a href="glossary_1oo6.htm#_edk_form">form</a> using C or C++, as well as how to install and use that form. A form created with C or C++ will perform more quickly but will not be as easy to modify as a form created with the Microsoft Exchange Forms Designer. </p>
<p>
TOOLFORM is itself a form created using C++ and Microsoft Foundation Classes (MFC). A similar form could be created using C and MFC.</p>
<p>
For general information about forms design, installation, and management, see <a href="forms_78vn.htm">Forms</a>. Additional information can be found in the <i>Microsoft Exchange Server Application Designer's Guide</i>. </p>
<p>
TOOLFORM is a simple form that lacks much of the functionality of other Microsoft Exchange Server forms. For example, the recipient is hard-coded and is called "Tools." The form's purpose is to demonstrate required C++ development tasks and the resulting performance advantage. The source code can be modified to produce a form similar to other Microsoft Exchange Server forms.</p>
<h5><img src="../../images/wedge.gif" border=0>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To build TOOLFORM.EXE</h5>
<ol>
<li>
Change to the directory containing the TOOLFORM source files:<p>
\BKOFFICE\SAMPLES\EXCHANGE\TOOLFORM
</li>
<li>
Type <b>NMAKE</b>.</li>
</ol>
<p>
</p>
<h5><img src="../../images/wedge.gif" border=0>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To verify that the form has built correctly</h5>
<ol>
<li>
Change to the directory containing the form (\BKOFFICE\SAMPLES\EXCHANGE\TOOLFORM\WIN32\&lt;<i>build type</i>&gt;) </li>
<li>
Type <b>TOOLFORM</b>. You should see a copy of the form.</li>
</ol>
<p>
</p>
<p>
To install the TOOLFORM form in the Forms Library, use the INSTFORM sample application, or use the standard form install procedure on the Microsoft Exchange Client. </p>
<p>
Before you run INSTFORM, edit the .CFG file to reflect where the .EXE file resides in the directory tree. Under the section for your development platform ([Platform .NTx86] for example), edit the <b>file1=</b> entry so that it indicates where the .EXE file is, or move the .EXE file to the directory in the <b>file1=</b> entry of the .CFG file. Then run INSTFORM. Syntax and parameter information is found in <a href="samples2_7w8j.htm">INSTFORM Syntax and Parameters</a>.</p>
<h5><img src="../../images/wedge.gif" border=0>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To install the TOOLFORM Form in the Personal Forms Library</h5>
<ol>
<li>
To install the form in the personal forms library, type a command similar to the following:<p>
<b>INSTFORM /INSTALL C:\EXCHSDK\SAMPLES\EXCHANGE\TOOLFORM\TOOLFORM.CFG </b><br>
<b>/REGISTRY=PERSONAL /PROFILE=&lt;<i>user profile name</i>&gt;</b>
</li>
<li>
Verify that the TOOLFORM form has been installed by opening and sending the form.</li>
</ol>
<p>
</p>
<h5><img src="../../images/wedge.gif" border=0>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To verify successful installation of TOOLFORM</h5>
<ol>
<li>
Start the Microsoft Exchange Client.</li>
<li>
Create a new mailbox called <b>Tools</b> if you do not have such a mailbox. This form may only be sent only to a destination mailbox called Tools unless the source code is modified.</li>
<li>
From the <b>Tools</b> menu, choose <b>Options</b>. Select the <b>Microsoft Exchange Server</b> property page.</li>
<li>
Click <b>Manage Forms</b>. The <b>Forms Manager</b> dialog box is displayed with additional controls. </li>
<li>
Select the library you want to view by clicking the <b>Set</b> button opposite that entry.</li>
<li>
From the <b>Compose</b> dialog box, select<b> New Form</b>. Under <b>Organization</b>, select the <b>Toolform</b> form. The form opens.</li>
<li>
Fill in the fields of the form </li>
<li>
Send the form to Tools.</li>
</ol>
