<h2><a name="_edk_agents_property_page"></a>Agents Property Page</h2>
<p>
Folder owners use this property page to create a new agent. This page is also used for binding an agent to a server.</p>
<p>
<img src="images/agents1.gif" border=0></p>
<p>
This property page is used to connect events, scripts, and servers. Collectively, these components are displayed as properties of an agent. </p>
<p>
As with the Permissions page, this page is visible only to owners of the folder. When the folder owner clicks the <b>Agents</b> tab, the property page displays a list of agents, as shown in the illustration <a href="events_3m3o.htm">Agents Property Page (with Agents Displayed)</a>. </p>
<p>
The Agents property page contains the following controls:
<ul>
<li>
<b>Agents for this folder</b>  This is a list box control that uses the check box style. It lists the current agent messages installed in this folder, displaying the property PR_DISPLAY_NAME. Double-clicking one of the items in the list box is the same as choosing the <b>Edit</b> button.</li>
<li>
<b>New</b>  Choosing <b>New</b> causes a new agent message to be created. See <a href="events_99rs.htm">New Agent Dialog Box</a>.</li>
<li>
<b>Copy</b>  Use <b>Copy </b>to copy agent messages between folders. </li>
<li>
<b>Edit</b>  Use the <b>Edit </b>button to modify the existing agent configuration data. See <a href="events_99rs.htm">New Agent Dialog Box</a>.</li>
<li>
<b>Delete</b>  Choosing <b>Delete </b>deletes the current agent messages. Deletion then requires user confirmation.</li>
<li>
<b>Run these agents on this server</b>  Use this control to <a href="events_6qpe.htm">bind an agent to a server</a>. This is a drop-down list of servers on which the script should be run. It is populated from the list of folders that are under the NON_IPM public folder tree and whose name follows the format <b>EVENTS_&lt;server name&gt;</b>. One such folder exists for each server that has the Event Service installed. Each of these folders is created when the Event Service is installed on a particular computer.<p>
The server choice defaults to the home MDB server of the current folder, assuming that this server has the Event Service installed. If the home MDB server does not have the Event Service installed (and thus has no corresponding <b>EVENTS_&lt;server name&gt;</b> folder), the choice defaults to the first server on the list. The list is sorted alphabetically.
<p>
The set of agents for a given folder must be guaranteed to run on only one server. This helps to ensure that the common set of ICS bookmarks for this folder (stored in the agent message in the folder) are manipulated by only a single server (ICS client).
</li>
</ul>
