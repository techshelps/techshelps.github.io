<h2><a name="_edk_header_lines_and_data_lines"></a>Header Lines and Data Lines</h2>
<p>
The first line of an import file or export file is the header line. This line lists the attributes being imported (or exported) in order of their import or export. These attributes are designated by the names they are listed under in the Microsoft Exchange Server <a href="schema_4mg1.htm">directory schema</a>. Although other separators can be chosen, the comma is the default separator in this line (and all lines) in the import file, as shown in the following example of a header line:</p>
<pre><code>Obj-Class,Common-Name,Given-Name,Surname,Home-Server,Display-Name
 </code></pre>
<p>
In this example, the six listed attributes are to be imported. In the lines that follow, the actual values for those attributes must be listed, separated by the same separator, in the order that the header line specifies. The following lines are typical data lines:</p>
<pre><code>mailbox,SteveMas,Steve,Masters,FALCON,Steve Masters
mailbox,KevinY,,BOB,,
 </code></pre>
<p>
In the second line of this example, the value for the third attribute (Given-Name) is left blank, as indicated by the first pair of consecutive commas. Depending on the attribute, blank values are sometimes constructed from the values of other attributes, or from the values of a specified <a href="directry_72er.htm">user template</a>. Examples of using of directory access import files are given later in this section.</p>
<p>
<b>Note</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;Within a given container, objects are identified by the <a href="sch_attr_5smd.htm">Common-Name</a> property. The <a href="function_1v1w.htm"><b>BatchImport</b></a> function uses the Common-Name property to construct the Directory-Name of the object. Multiple lines in the import file having the same value for Common-Name refer to the same object.</p>
