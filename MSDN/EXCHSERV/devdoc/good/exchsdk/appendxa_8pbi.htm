<p>
Each directory import section of the primary file begins with DIRECTORY. This is followed by a header line. Each line thereafter is one object. For example:</p>
<pre><code>DIRECTORY
Obj-class,Mode,Common-Name,Display-Name,Last Name,First 
Name,Secondary-Proxy-Addresses,Home-Server
mailbox,create,ElizaB,Elizabeth 
Brown,Brown,Elizabeth,MIGRATE:PROFS:Sydney(EBrown),~Server
mailbox,create,PatPa,Pat 
Parkes,Parkes,Pat,MIGRATE:PROFS:Sydney(PParkes),~Server
mailbox,create,MiguelF,Miguel 
Fernandez,Fernandez,Miguel,MIGRATE:PROFS:Sydney(MFernan),~Server
 </code></pre>
<p>
<b>Important</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;Items in the directory section cannot have pointers to data in the secondary file. All data in the directory section must be in the primary file.</p>
<p>
The format of the directory import section in the primary file is slightly different from Directory Import in the Administrator program. In the primary file the mode header field is required and must always be set to <i>create</i>. If the object already exists, an error will be reported. In the Administrator program, the mode header field is optional and can be set to <i>create</i>, <i>modify</i>, or <i>delete</i>. For information on additional attributes, see Appendix D in the <i>Microsoft Exchange Server Migration Guide</i>.</p>
<h4>Backslash Characters in Directory Sections of Migration Files</h4>
<p>
The Migration Wizard tries to import all directory sections in the migration files without modifications. If there is a single backslash (\) character, this is interpreted as an escape character. If the next character is a 'r' or 'n,' the two characters are interpreted as a carriage return or new line character, respectively. If the next character after the backslash is not an 'r' or 'n', an error is logged in the application log.</p>
<p>
If you are creating a source extractor, you can avoid this problem by replacing all backslash characters with two backslashes (\\) in the directory section. If you encounter the error in the application log, you can modify the directory section in the primary file by either deleting the backslash, or replacing it with two backslashes.</p>
<p>
This is not a problem with mail messages, attachments, schedule information or personal address books.</p>
