<h1><a name="_gdk_read_receipts"></a>Read Receipts</h1>
<p>
Read receipts are report messages similar to delivery and non-delivery reports. They have message class strings of the form REPORT.<i>X</i>.RN, where <i>X</i> is the message class of the message the receipt corresponds to (usually IPM.Note). Read receipts inform a sender that a recipient has read a message. Read receipts are generated by the recipient’s email client software; no other component of a messaging system can be guaranteed to know when a user opens a message. </p>
<p>
Whether a gateway can support read receipts depends on the foreign system’s capabilities. If the foreign system does support read receipts, gateways should do the following:
<ul>
<li>
For outgoing messages, convert the value stored in the messages’ PR_READ_RECEIPT_REQUESTED property into whatever format the foreign system requires for read receipt requests.</li>
<li>
For incoming read receipts, convert the content of the receipt—whatever form it takes—into a message whose message class is REPORT.IPM.Note.RN and deliver it to the sender of the original message.</li>
</ul>
<p>
For details about what properties are required on read receipts, see the topic <b>About Message Properties</b> in <i>MAPI Programmer’s Guide</i>.</p>
