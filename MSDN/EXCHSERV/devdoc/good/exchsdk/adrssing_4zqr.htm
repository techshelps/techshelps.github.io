<h1><a name="_gdk_recipient_objects"></a>Recipient Objects</h1>
<p>
Recipient objects represent all of the available delivery points on a Microsoft Exchange Server site. Anything that a message can be delivered to has a recipient object associated with it. Microsoft Exchange Server handles several types of recipient objects:
<ul>
<li>
<b>User mailboxes</b>  Native Microsoft Exchange Server users. Mailboxes are represented by objects in the Microsoft Exchange Server directory, and are visible in Microsoft Exchange Server address books. User mailboxes have storage allocated to them in the Microsoft Exchange Server information store.</li>
<li>
<b>Custom recipients</b>  Objects in the Microsoft Exchange Server directory that represent users of foreign mail systems. Custom recipients appear in Microsoft Exchange Server address books alongside native Microsoft Exchange Server user mailboxes. A foreign e-mail address, or <a href="gwgloss_0vg4.htm#_gdk_target_address">target address</a>,<i> </i>is associated with every custom recipient. Mail sent to a custom recipient is redirected to a gateway capable of delivering the mail to the appropriate foreign mail system.</li>
<li>
<b>One-off addresses</b>  Addresses of any type that do not appear in a Microsoft Exchange Server address book. One-off addresses are either constructed once and not saved, or are saved in a user’s Personal Address Book, inaccessible to Microsoft Exchange Server.</li>
<li>
<b>Distribution lists</b>  Collections of addresses that include any of the types listed above. Public distribution lists are saved on the server, where they can be made available to all users. Private distribution lists are saved in a user’s <a href="gwgloss_0vg0.htm#_gdk_personal_address_book">personal address book</a>.</li>
</ul>
