<h1><a name="_splus_deleted"></a>Deleted</h1>
<p>
The <b>Deleted</b> property returns a Boolean value that indicates whether an exception in the Exceptions table has been marked as deleted.</p>
<h4>Applies To</h4>
<p>
Exception object</p>
<h4>Data Type</h4>
<p>
Boolean</p>
<h4>Access</h4>
<p>
Read/write</p>
<h4>Remarks</h4>
<p>
The <b>Deleted</b> property applies only to recurring items that have been deleted. A deleted instance is an Exception item in the Exceptions table that has its <b>Deleted </b>property set to <b>True</b>.</p>
<p>
For example, if a user creates a weekly recurring appointment, but during the third week of the appointment the user is scheduled to be on vacation, the user deletes the third instance of the appointment. Schedule+ places the deleted instance in the Exceptions table with its <b>Deleted</b> property set to <b>True</b>.</p>
<p>
Applications can use this property to scan the Exceptions table for all instances of recurring appointments that users have deleted.</p>
