<h3><a name="_edk_bindrequest"></a>BindRequest</h3>
<p>
In LDAP version 2, the <b>BindRequest</b> operation must be the first operation performed by an LDAP client. LDAP version 3 removes this restriction; in other words, an LDAP version 3 client can perform directory operations before successfully binding to the directory. Although it is acceptable for an LDAP version 3 server to reject operations from a client that has not bound to the directory first, the LDAP implementation of Microsoft Exchange Server supports LDAP operations from a client that has not successfully bound to the directory.</p>
<h4>Parameters</h4>
<dl>
<dt>
<i>Version</i></dt>
<dd>
LDAP versions 2 and 3 are supported. However, with version 3, there are certain operational messages (such as <b>SearchResultReferral</b>) that are not returned to an LDAP version 2 client.   </dd>
<dt>
<i>Authentication</i> </dt>
<dd>
Two types of authentication are supported: simple and sasl. For simple authentication, the user must supply a Windows NT domain and user account, in this format: dc=domain,cn=username. The Windows NT user account must be on a domain against which the user can authenticate. For sasl authentication, the user supplies sasl credentials, in one of two forms: 
<p>
DPA: password authentication (for MCIS only)

<p>
NTLM: for Windows NT client support only

<p>
If a username and password are provided (in an octet string), the server checks the user's credentials; otherwise, the user is referred to as an 'anonymous' user.  
</dd>
<dt>
<i>Name</i></dt>
<dd>
Contains the DN of the client. If the user is anonymous, the Name parameter is ignored; otherwise, if the Authentication parameter contains a password, the directory service must authenticate the user by ensuring validity of the password. 
</dd>
</dl>
