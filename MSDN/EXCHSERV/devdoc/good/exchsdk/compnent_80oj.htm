<h3><a name="_edk_deferred_actions"></a>Deferred Actions</h3>
<p>
The server information store passes an action to the client by creating a <a href="glossary_1oo4.htm#_edk_deferred_action_message">deferred action message (DAM)</a>. This DAM is stored within the Deferred Action folder in the non-IPM subtree of the server’s private information store. Whenever a client connects to its mailbox, part of its initialization is checking for DAMs. If any DAMs are present, the client executes the action, known as a deferred action, as part of its initialization. All <a href="compnent_9wxf.htm">custom actions</a> are invoked as deferred actions.</p>
