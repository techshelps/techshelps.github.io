<p>
The Microsoft Exchange Server SDK includes a functional gateway and a mailbox agent, which are the two main types of server applications. You can use these sample applications to learn how to construct new applications, and you can build them to test the setup of your development environment. </p>
<h4>Sample Mailbox Agent</h4>
<p>
SMBAGENT, the <a href="glossary_1ood.htm#_edk_mailbox_agent">sample mailbox agent</a>, performs the functions of a list server. Users introduce a topic and SMBAGENT creates a specialized folder for it. Users can then post documents to the topic, and the documents will be delivered to all users who have joined it. Other users can join the topic, and thereafter will receive all the mail from that topic.</p>
<p>
For instructions on building and running the sample mailbox agent, see <a href="samples3_5fqs.htm">SMBAGENT: Creating a Sample Mailbox Agent</a>.</p>
<h4>Sample Gateway</h4>
<p>
A gateway is a connector between a Microsoft Exchange Server system and a foreign mail system. Messages pass through the gateway and are translated from the format of one system to the format of the other. The gateway must keep information about each user in both environments. The sample gateway included with the Microsoft Exchange Server SDK can be compiled and used as it ships, or can be changed to suit your application. For information about building and running the sample gateway, see <a href="samplgw_0rxv.htm">Sample Gateway and Applications</a>.</p>
<p>
For complete development information about gateways, see the <i>Gateway Programmer's Reference</i>. </p>
<h4>Installation Steps</h4>
<p>
If you develop a gateway or mailbox agent, several installation steps are necessary to connect them with Microsoft Exchange Server. These steps have been automated for the Microsoft Exchange Server <a href="samplgw_0rxv.htm">Sample Gateway</a> and the <a href="samples3_5fqs.htm">Sample Mailbox Agent</a> in the MBSETUP and GWSETUP programs, respectively.  </p>
<p>
These steps can also be performed manually or by building a batch file. For information about building and running sample utility programs manually or using a batch file, see <a href="samples3_9apg.htm">Using a Batch File to Install SMBAGENT</a>. </p>
