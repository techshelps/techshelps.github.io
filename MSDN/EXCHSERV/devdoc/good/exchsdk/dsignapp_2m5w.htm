<h3><a name="_edk_choosing_information_to_extract"></a>Choosing Information to Extract</h3>
<p>
When planning your migration, consider which data to extract. For example, you may or may not want to extract schedule and calendar features or personal distribution lists. You may want to limit the extraction to certain ranges of data. For example, you could impose an age limit on mail. Also consider the special issues that related to extracting the following information.</p>
<h4>Personal Address Books (PABs)</h4>
<p>
If users can create their own <a href="glossary_1oo4.htm#_edk_directory">directory</a> entries in <a href="glossary_1oog.htm#_edk_personal_address_book_pab_">personal address books (PABs)</a> on your existing system, you can extract the information. If the administrator cannot access PABs, consider how users will migrate this data. You can have users compose messages to all their PAB entries, type their own names in the <b>Copy To (Cc) </b>fields, and send the messages before their <a href="glossary_1ood.htm#_edk_mailbox">mailboxes</a> are moved. The messages are then migrated to Microsoft Exchange Server, where users can open the messages and add the recipients to the new PABs.</p>
<h4>Attributes</h4>
<p>
Some existing systems have additional data about each account stored in their directory — title or department, for example. Extract this information as part of migration, or import it separately by using the <b>Directory Import</b> command in the <a href="glossary_1oo1.htm#_edk_administrator_program">Administrator program</a>.</p>
<h4>Attachments</h4>
<p>
Is the attachment useful after being migrated? Attachments that require an application on a host system may no longer be useful in their current format. Do any attachments need to be converted before being added to the migration file?</p>
