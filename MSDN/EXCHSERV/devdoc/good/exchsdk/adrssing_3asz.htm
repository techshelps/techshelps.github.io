<p>
Addressing components should be translated into all languages needed by people who will be using your gateway. You should also translate the templates, message and recipient option property sheets, and online Help for your Addr-Type object because these items can be accessed by users. For address entry templates, message option templates, and recipient option templates, create one for each language. Create a separate Windows Help file for each language.</p>
<p>
Translating template files is simply a matter of translating the fields containing text strings into the target language and recompiling those files with the TEMPLATE.EXE utility. Translating Windows Help files is a matter of translating the text in the source file and recompiling it with the Windows Help Compiler.</p>
<p>
Each target language has a number associated with it that you will need to know when installing the translated components. For example, language 409 is English, 40C is French, 407 is German. These numbers are listed in the Win32 Software Development Kit. </p>
