<h3><a name="_edk_modifying_rules"></a>Modifying Rules</h3>
<p>
To modify a <a href="glossary_1ooi.htm#_edk_rule">rule</a>, find the rule you want changed, save and edit its contents, delete it, and insert the new rule in the old rule’s position in the rule table. </p>
<h5><img src="../../images/wedge.gif" border=0>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To modify a rule</h5>
<ol>
<li>
Retrieve an interface pointer to the rule object using <a href="function_341a.htm"><b>HrFolderRulesOpen</b></a>.</li>
<li>
Find the rule you want to modify. First, use the rule object’s <a href="intrface_0x0r.htm"><b>IExchangeFolderRules::HrSeek</b></a> method to seek to the beginning of the rule table. </li>
<li>
Within a loop, call the rule object’s <a href="intrface_5d84.htm"><b>IExchangeFolderRules::HrGet</b></a> method to step through the rule table until you find the rule you want to modify. </li>
<li>
Save the information of the rule to be modified. You can do this as a part of the loop described in step 3 because <b>HrGet</b> returns all the information of the rule, including pointers to an <b>SRestriction</b> structure and an <a href="structs_66er.htm"><b>ACTIONS</b></a> structure. The <b>SRestriction</b> structure contains the rule’s conditions. The <b>ACTIONS</b> structure contains the rule’s actions.</li>
<li>
Modify the saved information to reflect the rule changes you want to make. You will be modifying data of a variety of types. </li>
<li>
Back the cursor up by 1 by calling the <a href="intrface_6jn0.htm"><b>IExchangeFolderRules::HrTell</b></a> method (to determine the absolute position in the rule table) and the <b>IExchangeFolderRules::HrSeek</b> method (to move to the next lower position). </li>
<li>
Delete the rule you want to modify by calling <a href="intrface_5so5.htm"><b>IExchangeFolderRules::HrDelete</b></a>. For <b>HrDelete</b>, the cursor is unchanged. If you delete a rule and then insert a rule, the new rule goes back in the same position. </li>
<li>
Create a new rule with the <a href="intrface_1jec.htm"><b>IExchangeFolderRules::HrInsert</b></a> method. This method inserts the rule into the set of rules for the folder.</li>
</ol>
<p>
To review these methods, see the \BKOFFICE\SAMPLES\EXCHANGE\LIBSRC\RULECLS\RULECLSI.CPP source file. For examples of rule deletion and rule insertion, see the <b>DoDelete</b> function and the <b>DoInsert</b> function in the \BKOFFICE\SAMPLES\EXCHANGE\RULEEDIT\RULEEDIT.CPP file.</p>
