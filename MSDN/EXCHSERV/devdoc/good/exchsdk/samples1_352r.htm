<p>
Once you have installed Windows NT Server, Microsoft Visual C++, the Microsoft Exchange Client, Microsoft Exchange Server, and the Microsoft Exchange Server SDK, you are ready to begin development work. For more information, see <a href="develpmt_1tro.htm">Development Environment</a>.</p>
<p>
At this point you can also use Visual C++ to build the Microsoft Exchange Server sample applications. You can do this in either of two ways:
<ul>
<li>
<b>From a command prompt</b>  See <a href="samples1_5p2m.htm">Building an Individual Sample Application</a>, or see the sample application's description in <a href="samples1_022b.htm">Sample Applications</a>.</li>
<li>
<b>Using the Visual C++ development environment</b>  See <a href="develpmt_7a7o.htm">Building Sample Applications in the Visual C++ Development Environment</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Approximately 1 GB of hard disk space is adequate for setting up the development environment and building the sample applications. </p>
<h4>Build Version Types</h4>
<p>
You can build two different versions of each sample application: DEBUG and RETAIL. See <a href="samples1_7v5f.htm">Building the Set of Sample Applications</a>. </p>
<p>
<b>Tip</b>  Installing the Microsoft Exchange Server SDK creates the \BKOFFICE\BIN directory, copies a complete set of compiled sample applications into it, and adds this directory to your search path. To run a sample application you have built or modified instead of the compiled version in the search path, do one of the following:
<ul>
<li>
Use the full pathname.</li>
<li>
Modify the search path.</li>
<li>
Run the sample application from the directory containing the object files.</li>
</ul>
