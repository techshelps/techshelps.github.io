The <i>Microsoft Exchange Server Programmer’s Reference</i> fully describes the programming elements of Microsoft Exchange Server. It is the primary source for specific information about writing Microsoft Exchange Server applications.</p>
<p>
As seen in the Contents pane, the <i>Microsoft Exchange Server Programmer’s Reference</i> is organized as follows:
<ul>
<li>
Quick Start Procedures</li>
<li>
Guide</li>
<li>
Reference</li>
<li>
Appendixes</li>
<li>
Glossary</li>
</ul>
<h4>Quick Start Procedures</h4>
<p>
Topics in this section describe tasks commonly performed using the Microsoft Exchange Server SDK. They include design tasks, implementation tasks, and references to sample source code. Rather than providing complete in-depth information, these procedures contain links to descriptions of actual implementation details.</p>
<h4>Guide</h4>
<p>
This section begins with a discussion of the key concepts and architecture of Microsoft Exchange Server. It continues with topics such as designing an application, setting up your development environment, debugging applications, extending the Microsoft Exchange Server Administrator program, and writing a setup program for an application, as well as how to build, run, and use the Microsoft Exchange Server sample applications.</p>
<h4>Reference</h4>
<p>
This section consists of alphabetic listings of Microsoft Exchange Server programming elements, including objects, interfaces, functions, properties, and structures. Where appropriate, the reference pages include syntax, parameters and return values for each element. </p>
<h4>Appendixes</h4>
<p>
This section includes information on file formats used for various aspects of Microsoft Exchange Server development or configuration.</p>
<h4>Glossary</h4>
<p>
This section provides definitions for commonly used Microsoft Exchange Server terms and cross-references to related topics in the Guide and Reference.</p>
<p>
For successful application development, the <i>Microsoft Exchange Server Programmer’s Reference</i> should be used in conjunction with the <i>MAPI Programmer’s Reference</i>. For other useful sources of information, see <a href="mesintro_7zce.htm">Finding Other Documentation</a>. </p>
