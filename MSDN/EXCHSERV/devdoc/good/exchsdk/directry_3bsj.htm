<h1><a name="_edk_comparing_mapi_with_directory_access_functions"></a>Comparing MAPI with Directory Access Functions</h1>
<p>
You can perform most directory tasks using either <a href="glossary_1ood.htm#_edk_mapi">MAPI</a> functions or <a href="glossary_1oo4.htm#_edk_directory_access_functions">directory access functions</a>. Each of these sets of functions has its own advantages and its own dependencies. </p>
<p>
For example, the directory access functions are specific to Microsoft Exchange Server. They run only on Windows NT Server computers on which the <a href="glossary_1ood.htm#_edk_microsoft_exchange_server_administrator_program">Microsoft Exchange Server Administrator program</a> has been installed. Because directory access DLLs are not installed on client computers, you must use MAPI for all <a href="glossary_1oo4.htm#_edk_directory">directory</a> access activities performed by client applications, including those running on Windows 95 clients. </p>
<p>
In contrast, MAPI is independent of the underlying directory service, which enables your program to work with any MAPI-compliant directory service. </p>
<p>
For these reasons, you should typically use MAPI to manipulate directory <a href="glossary_1oof.htm#_edk_object">objects</a>. But certain other aspects of common directory operations should be considered, as discussed in the following sections.</p>
