<h2><a name="_edk_choosing_an_export_format"></a>Choosing an Export Format</h2>
<p>
Using a callback function, you can export data in one of three ways: 
<ul>
<li>
Export data into a line whose items are delimited by commas or another specified character. Set the <b>ulEvalTag</b> control flag in the <a href="structs_53qj.htm"><b>EXPORT_CALLBACK</b></a> structure to TEXT_LINE. The data line format is the same as would be used if the data were written to an export file.</li>
<li>
Export data into an array of structures. Set the <b>ulEvalTag</b> control flag to VALUE_ARRAY. Data is returned in its native type, with a few minor exceptions. For example, any attributes whose native type is object (such as distinguished names or OR names) is returned as a text representation of that object. Also, date fields are returned as UTC string representations of the date. Unsigned integer values are returned as integers.</li>
<li>
Export data into an array of structures in "textized" format. Set <b>ulEvalTag</b> to TEXT_VALUE_ARRAY. All binary and nonbinary data is exported in string representations. Binary values are exported as strings of hex digits. </li>
</ul>
