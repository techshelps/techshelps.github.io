<p>
The sample gateway is a single executable file (GWSAMPLE.EXE) that uses two message conversion DLLs (IPM_IN.DLL and IPM_OUT.DLL). It is started and stopped as a service running on Windows NT Server. If it shuts down because of a nonrecoverable error, the status is reflected in the Windows NT service control manager (SCM).</p>
<p>
The sample gateway supports the pause/resume feature. When the SCM requests that the gateway pause, the gateway will not pick up any new messages for processing. When the gateway pauses, it will signal that it is paused and will not perform any more actions until it is resumed. Pausing the gateway will not cause it to declare any messages as nondeliverable.</p>
