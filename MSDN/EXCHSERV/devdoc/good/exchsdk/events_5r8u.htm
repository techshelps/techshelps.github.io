<h1><a name="_edk_microsoft_exchange_server_administration"></a>Microsoft Exchange Server Administration</h1>
<p>
The Microsoft® Exchange Server administrator controls a number of aspects that affect event scripting:
<ul>
<li>
<b>Permissions on an agent's configuration folder</b>  Administrators determine who (persons with Author permission on the <b>EventConfig_&lt;ServerName&gt;</b> folder) can bind agents to run on any particular server. See <a href="events_4c4z.htm">Granting Permissions</a> and <a href="events_6qpe.htm">Binding an Agent to a Server</a>.</li>
<li>
<b>Permissions on the application folder</b>  Administrators grant permissions for authoring and running scripts within the folder in which events will be monitored. Without Owner permission on a folder, you can save a script into the folder, but you cannot create an agent using Microsoft Outlook because the option for doing so (the <b>Agents</b> tab in the folder property sheet) will be unavailable. If you create a folder, you automatically have Owner permission on it until your permissions are expressly changed. </li>
<li>
<b>Agent installation</b>  Because administrators are in charge of the software installed on the server computer, they control which agents are available (installed) on the server. </li>
<li>
<b>Script restrictions</b>  Administrators can set script restrictions, such as which COM objects are available, and the maximum time of execution. </li>
</ul>
