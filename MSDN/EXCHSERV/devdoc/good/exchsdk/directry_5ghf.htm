<p>
The <a href="function_1v1w.htm"><b>BatchImport</b></a> and <a href="function_1q79.htm"><b>DAPIWrite</b></a> <a href="glossary_1oo4.htm#_edk_directory_access_functions">directory access functions</a> import valid <a href="glossary_1oog.htm#_edk_proxy_address">proxy addresses</a> for recipients and, when applicable, create new proxy addresses. If an imported recipient <a href="glossary_1oof.htm#_edk_object">object</a> has a value in its Proxy-Addresses attribute, that value is verified for correct format and uniqueness in the <a href="glossary_1oo4.htm#_edk_directory">directory</a>. If it passes, it is imported along with the object's other <a href="glossary_1oo1.htm#_edk_attribute">attributes</a>.</p>
<p>
These two functions automatically call the Microsoft Exchange Server system attendant. It in turn calls the proxy generation DLLs of installed gateways that add proxy addresses to new recipients as they are imported. Every new recipient object receives an X.400 address, even if no X.400 address was explicitly defined on the object before the import operation.</p>
<p>
In contrast, the Microsoft Exchange Server address book provider does not automatically call the system attendant to generate proxy addresses. Therefore, if you have created a recipient object using MAPI, pass the appropriate information about the new recipient to the system attendant, which generates proxy addresses. The behavior of other address-book providers (such as a CompuServe address-book provider) must be investigated to determine their handling of proxy address generation.</p>
