<h4>Remarks</h4>
<p>
Microsoft Exchange Server reserves the first two members of every ACL for the default access rights of the list and the creator of the list. You cannot delete the access rights member or the creator member of an ACL. You cannot insert a member before the access rights member or the creator member of an ACL.</p>
