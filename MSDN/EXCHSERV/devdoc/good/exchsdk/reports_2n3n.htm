<h1><a name="_gdk_nonread_receipts"></a>Nonread Receipts</h1>
<p>
Nonread receipts are similar to read receipts, delivery reports, and nondelivery reports. They have message class strings of the form REPORT.<i>X</i>.NRN, where <i>X</i> is the message class of the message the receipt corresponds to (usually IPM.Note). Nonread receipts inform a sender that a recipient has deleted a message without opening it. Read receipts are generated by the recipient’s email client software; no other component of a messaging system can be guaranteed to know when a user deletes a message. </p>
<p>
Whether a gateway can support nonread receipts depends on the foreign system’s capabilities. If the foreign system does support nonread receipts, gateways should do the following:
<ul>
<li>
For outgoing an messages, convert the value stored in the message’s PR_NON_RECEIPT_NOTIFICATION_REQUESTED property into whatever format the foreign system requires for nonread receipt requests.</li>
<li>
For an incoming nonread receipt, convert the content of the receipt—whatever form it takes—into a message whose message class is REPORT.IPM.Note.NRN and deliver it to the sender of the original message.</li>
</ul>
<p>
For details about what properties are required on nonread receipts, see <b>About Message Properties</b> in <i>MAPI Programmer’s Guide</i>.</p>
