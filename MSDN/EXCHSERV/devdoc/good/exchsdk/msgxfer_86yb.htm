<p>
A message transfer envelope (MTE) contains the outgoing message to be delivered as an attached object. This message object can be opened with the MAPI <b>IMessage</b> interface. This is the only attachment the MTE can have until the gateway calls the MAPI <b>SetReadFlag</b> function to indicate that it has accepted responsibility for the message. After the gateway accepts the message, it can add more attachments to the MTE if necessary.</p>
<p>
<b>Note</b>  For an MTE with a single attached message, the attachment number of the message is always zero. For a message with a single attachment, the number of the attachment is always zero.</p>
<p>
Delivery reports and nondelivery reports carry the original message as an attachment if the MAPI property PR_CONTENT_RETURN_REQUESTED was set to TRUE on the original message. For more information about delivery report and nondelivery report structures, see <a href="reports_6ann.htm">Reports</a>. </p>
