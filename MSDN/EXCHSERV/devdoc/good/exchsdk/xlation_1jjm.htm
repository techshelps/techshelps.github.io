<p>
The <b>HrGetExportVector</b> function simply returns a list of the other entry points in the DLL. The <b>HrGetExportVector</b> function can simply return the address of a static CONVDLLVECT structure, such as:</p>
<pre><code>static CONVDLLVECT sExportedFuncs = 
{ 
    1,                       // version number 1 
    HrCnvQueryCapability,    // address of query capability function
    HrCnvConvert             // address of translation function
}; </code></pre>
<p>
<b>HrGetExportVector</b> is the only function in the DLL that must be an entry point. The other functions must exist in the DLL, but do not have to be entry points because pointers to them are returned by <b>HrGetExportVector</b>.</p>
<p>
Note that the entry point names in the .DEF file for a translation DLL are not required to have any particular value. Because the translation framework uses Windows NT Registry keys to locate the entry point names for translations, you can put multiple translations in a single translation DLL. Each translation in a DLL consists of an entry point which is the <b>HrGetExportVector</b> function for that translation, plus the corresponding <b>HrCnvQueryCapability</b> and <b>HrCnvConvert</b> functions, although clearly there is no requirement that your implementations of those functions use those function names. See <a href="xlation_0eb0.htm">Installing a Translation DLL</a> for details about how Windows NT Registry keys are used to specify the entry point names for the <b>HrGetExportVector</b> functions within a translation DLL.</p>
<p>
The IPM_IN and IPM_OUT sample translation DLLs, located in the \BKOFFICE\SAMPLES\EXCHANGE directory, contain examples of <b>HrGetExportVector</b> functions, as well as their definitions in the .DEF files for the DLLs.</p>
