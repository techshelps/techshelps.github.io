<h2><a name="_edk_collecting_system_requirements"></a>Collecting System Requirements</h2>
<p>
Applications are usually installed and configured according to the user's specified needs. It's good practice to collect this data from the user at the beginning of the installation procedure through a series of interactive dialog boxes. The application uses this information to install its components and configure the user's system.</p>
<p>
Typical information to be gathered at this point includes the following: 
<ul>
<li>
Name of the Microsoft Exchange Server computer and the <a href="glossary_1ooj.htm#_edk_site">site</a> on which the application will be installed.</li>
<li>
<a href="glossary_1oo4.htm#_edk_display_name">Display name</a> of the application's directory object, the display name of the application's service, the Windows NT account name of the service, and the service's password.</li>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<p>
The setup program should also verify at this point that the destination computer has enough free disk space for the installation.</p>
<p>
For more information about the way a setup program gathers information to be used as attribute values of directory objects, see <a href="setups_70vo.htm">Creating the Directory Object</a>.</p>
<h4>Examples: Collecting System Requirements</h4>
<p>
The sample gateway's setup program uses the following files to collect information at installation time:
<ul>
<li>
<b>DIALOGS.RC</b>  Contains the dialog boxes that are displayed.</li>
<li>
<b>GWUISTF.C</b>  Contains dialog control routines and validates some of the data entered by the administrator.</li>
<li>
<b>GWSETUP.C</b>  Performs high-level dialog control operations and data validation.<b> </b></li>
</ul>
