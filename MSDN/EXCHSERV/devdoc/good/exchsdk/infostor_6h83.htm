<h1><a name="_edk_working_with_messages"></a>Working with Messages</h1>
<p>
Messages are MAPI objects that are transmitted from one client application to another through the <a href="glossary_1ood.htm#_edk_mapi_spooler">MAPI spooler</a> and service providers by way of a messaging system. Every message supports many properties; some that describe the message, some that describe its contents, some that describe transmission options, and some that describe recipients. </p>
<p>
Messages are stored in folders within an <a href="glossary_1oo9.htm#_edk_information_store">information store</a>, typically folders created within the Interpersonal Message (IPM) root folder. The message object represents a single message, item, document, or form in a folder.</p>
<p>
Every message has a message class property, PR_MESSAGE_CLASS, which identifies the type, purpose, or content of the message. A message's class determines the form that is used to present the message to the user and the folder for placing incoming messages. </p>
