<h1><a name="_edk_pr_secure_origination"></a>PR_SECURE_ORIGINATION</h1>
<p>

<h4>Values</h4>
<dl>
<dt>
0</dt>
<dd>
FALSE = Messages moved or copied into the folder are unchanged.</dd>
<dt>
1</dt>
<dd>
TRUE = Messages moved or copied into the folder are modified to appear like they were forwarded by the user.</dd>
</dl>
<h4>Remarks</h4>
<p>
When the PR_SECURE_ORIGINATION property is set to TRUE, all messages created, moved, copied, or sent to the folder will have a trustworthy sender. Users will not be able to create messages that appear to be sent by other people. Nor will they be able to place them in the folder without having them modified so that they are the sender of the message. </p>
<p>
When this property is set to FALSE, the public folder serves as an information repository to which users can drag in messages from any source with out having the message changed. </p>
<p>
This property is exposed in the Microsoft Exchange Client user interface. See Folder/Properties and select the Administration tab. The drop/down labeled Drag drop posting is: " Allows you to set this property to either Move/Copy (=FALSE) or Forward (=TRUE).</p>
