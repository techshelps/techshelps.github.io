<p>
The Schedule object provides additional support for creating recurring items (items that occur on a regular basis) for many of its table types. For example, you can set a recurring appointment for every Friday at 1 p.m. When programming with Schedule+ objects, recurring items are handled differently from single items, which only occur once.</p>
<p>
It is possible for recurring items to have no defined end date. In this case, there could be an infinite number of items. Because Schedule+ cannot store an infinite number of recurring items, it stores a recurring item as a recurrence pattern.</p>
<p>
In addition, because recurring items are stored as patterns, they have a different structure from single items and are kept in a separate table. In the case of appointments, recurring appointments are stored in the RecurringAppointments table. Single appointments are kept in a separate table known as the SingleAppointments table.</p>
