<h3><a name="_gdk_example_administrator_extension_installation"></a>Example: Administrator Extension Installation</h3>
<p>
An SMTP gateway called PRO-SMTP is written by the fictitious company Pro-Electron, Inc. This SMTP gateway is installed to a server called PROTON running Microsoft Exchange Server, the gateway name PRO-SMTP is used as the Extension-Name, and the files are for the i386 (Intel) platform.</p>
<p>
In this installation, the setup program copies both PROADMIN.DLL (the Administrator extension DLL) and PROADMIN.HLP (the Help file for the gateway’s extension property sheets) to \\PROTON\ADD-INS\PRO-SMTP\I386. The proxy generation DLL for this gateway is copied to the \\PROTON\ADDRESS\PRO-SMTP\I386 directory.</p>
<p>
The gateway setup program displays a dialog box that lets the administrator choose the destination of the gateway’s executable file. This destination directory is saved in the Windows NT Registry on the gateway’s computer. </p>
<p>
<b>Note</b>  The Common-Name attribute of a directory object is a concatenation of the values used for Extension-Name and Platform. For example, the gateway in the preceding example would have a common name of PRO-SMTP:i386, and the Administrator program would recognize it only by this name. Therefore, your setup program must use the Extension-Name and Platform values consistently when it copies files and when it imports the gateway’s directory object.</p>
<p>
The sample setup file GWSETUP.C first builds a list of files to be copied, then calls the <b>CopyFilesInCopyList</b> function of the <i>Setup API</i> in the Win32 SDK.</p>
