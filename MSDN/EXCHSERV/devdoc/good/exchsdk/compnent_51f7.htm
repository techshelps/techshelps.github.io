<h2><a name="_edk_about_public_folders"></a>About Public Folders</h2>
<p>
The <a href="glossary_1oog.htm#_edk_public_information_store">public information store</a> contains <a href="glossary_1oog.htm#_edk_public_folder">public folders</a> and messages that can be shared among multiple users and applications. A single public information store is shared by all users within a Microsoft Exchange Server <a href="glossary_1oof.htm#_edk_organization">organization</a>, even if multiple servers are used. </p>

<p>
The public information store consists of two branches: the interpersonal message (IPM) subtree and the non-IPM subtree. Contents of the IPM subtree are visible through the client, but contents of the non-IPM subtree are not visible. The following diagram shows the structure of the public information store.</p>

Folders in the non-IPM subtree that are not visible to the user include:
<ul>
<li>
<b>EFORMS registry</b>  This top-level folder contains forms in various languages.</li>
<li>
<b>Offline Address Book folder</b>  This folder contains information that is needed to perform address book updates.</li>
<li>
<b>Schedule+ Free/Busy Folder</b>  This folder contains a subfolder for each site with free/busy information for the users at that site. It is consulted when meetings are automatically scheduled or other such operations are performed.</li>
</ul>
