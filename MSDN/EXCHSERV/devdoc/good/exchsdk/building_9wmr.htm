<h2><a name="_gdk_directory_objects"></a>Directory Objects</h2>
<p>
Three objects appear in the Microsoft Exchange Server directory to represent the gateway. The first is a Mail-Gateway object that represents the gateway service. The second is an Admin-Extension object that represents the administrator extension DLL. The third is an Addr-Type object that represents the family of addresses handled by the gateway, and the proxy generation DLL that converts between Microsoft Exchange Server addresses and foreign addresses.</p>
<p>
The Mail-Gateway object represents the gateway service itself, whether it is running on the same computer as the server or on a separate computer.</p>
<p>
To address mail to foreign systems, Microsoft Exchange Server uses an Addr-Type directory object that registers the existence of the foreign address type, and points to the location of the proxy generation DLL.</p>
<p>
The Addr-Type object is associated with the Mail-Gateway object in the gateway address routing table (GWART). The GWART contains information about the gateways available to Microsoft Exchange Server and the address types associated with each one. When a message needs to be routed through a gateway, the GWART is used to determine the appropriate gateway to use based on the address type of the recipient. The Addr-Type object also points to the location of the proxy generation DLL.</p>
<p>
Other directory objects are used to describe address entry templates to assist users in entering new addresses, and to describe templates for entering per-message and per-recipient message options, although these do not directly represent any components of the gateway.</p>
