<dl>
<dt>
<a name="_edk_mailbox"></a><b>mailbox</b></dt>
<dd>
The delivery location for all incoming mail messages addressed to a designated owner. Information in a user’s mailbox is stored in the <a href="glossary_1oog.htm#_edk_private_information_store">private information store</a> on a Microsoft Exchange Server computer. A mailbox can contain received messages, message attachments, folders, folder hierarchy, and more. Server applications for Microsoft Exchange Server are often designed with a mailbox for communication.</dd>
<dt>
<a name="_edk_mailbox_agent"></a><b>mailbox agent</b></dt>
<dd>
Any Microsoft Exchange Server application that uses a mailbox as its interface and performs functions for specific mailboxes. Mailbox agents are one of the chief types of server applications, with <a href="glossary_1oo7.htm#_edk_gateway">gateways</a> being the other.</dd>
<dt>
<a name="_edk_mapi"></a><b>MAPI</b></dt>
<dd>
The Messaging Application Programming Interface (MAPI) is a medium-independent messaging architecture that enables multiple applications to interact with multiple systems across a variety of hardware platforms. As a client interface component, MAPI is the complete set of functions and object-oriented interfaces that forms the foundation for the MAPI subsystem’s client application and service provider interfaces.</dd>
<dt>
<a name="_edk_mapi_address_book"></a><b>MAPI address book</b></dt>
<dd>
An object consisting of an information tree and a service agent that provides routing information and keeps track of the addresses and attributes of objects within the hierarchy. The MAPI address book is the basis for the Microsoft Exchange Server <a href="glossary_1oo4.htm#_edk_directory">directory</a>.</dd>
<dt>
<a name="_edk_mapi_idle_engine"></a><b>MAPI idle engine</b></dt>
<dd>
A set of functions that improves performance by making efficient use of idle time. An application uses the MAPI idle engine for tasks that are less time-critical by deferring them until the processor is idle. A callback function is created that executes when called by the MAPI idle engine.</dd>
<dt>
<a name="_edk_mapi_notification"></a><b>MAPI notification</b></dt>
<dd>
A system of communication implemented by MAPI and used by Microsoft Exchange Server. One object registers to learn of a change or error (called an event) that may take place in the other object. After the event occurs, the first object is notified. The object receiving notification is called the advise sink. The object responsible for the notification is called the advise source.</dd>
<dt>
<a name="_edk_mapi_service_provider"></a><b>MAPI service provider</b></dt>
<dd>
A set of functions that connect MAPI client applications to an underlying message system. Microsoft Exchange Server (like most messaging systems) includes three types of services: message store, <a href="glossary_1oo1.htm#_edk_address_book">address book</a> or <a href="glossary_1oo4.htm#_edk_directory">directory</a>, and message transport. MAPI supports each provider independently, allowing a vendor to offer one or more custom service providers.</dd>
<dt>
<a name="_edk_mapi_session"></a><b>MAPI session</b></dt>
<dd>
A connection with a MAPI subsystem that must be established before a client application can call the underlying messaging system.</dd>
<dt>
<a name="_edk_mapi_spooler"></a><b>MAPI spooler</b></dt>
<dd>
A MAPI process that handles the sending and receiving of messages between <a href="glossary_1oo3.htm#_edk_client_application">client applications</a> and most messaging systems. A tightly coupled information store and transport provider does not use the spooler. <i>See also </i><a href="glossary_1oo3.htm#_edk_client_application">client application</a>. </dd>
<dt>
<a name="_edk_marshal"></a><b>marshal</b></dt>
<dd>
The act of passing the function calls and parameters of an OLE object across process boundaries. </dd>
<dt>
<a name="_edk_message_body"></a><b>message body</b></dt>
<dd>
<i>See</i> <a href="#_edk_message_text">message text</a>.</dd>
<dt>
<a name="_edk_message_content"></a><b>message content</b></dt>
<dd>
The collection of all parts of a message that are not headers or footers, including the message text and attachments.</dd>
<dt>
<a name="_edk_message_store_viewer"></a><b>message store viewer</b></dt>
<dd>
A MAPI client application that provides a view of a message and its attachments. The message store viewer displays a message or any other object in the exact format to be used in an application, showing it as a set of properties and a collection of calls that can be performed on the object.</dd>
<dt>
<a name="_edk_message_text"></a><b>message text</b></dt>
<dd>
The main portion of the message content, typically displayed to each <a href="glossary_1ooi.htm#_edk_recipient">recipient</a> as an immediate result of opening the message. It excludes any attachment objects. Also referred to as the message body. </dd>
<dt>
<a name="_edk_message_transfer_agent_mta_"></a><b>message transfer agent (MTA)</b></dt>
<dd>
A component of Microsoft Exchange Server that provides the engine for sending messages and distributing information between Microsoft Exchange Server systems or between Microsoft Exchange Server and a foreign system. Each MTA is associated with one <a href="glossary_1oo9.htm#_edk_information_store">information store</a>. It is accessed using MAPI calls only and has no direct programmer interface with Microsoft Exchange Server. The MTA conforms to the 1988 X.400 specification.</dd>
<dt>
<a name="_edk_message_transfer_envelope"></a><b>message transfer envelope</b></dt>
<dd>
The set of addressing, routing, and network protocol information that surrounds a message as it is transported across Microsoft Exchange Server.</dd>
<dt>
<a name="_edk_messaging_user_object"></a><b>messaging user object</b></dt>
<dd>
A MAPI object that describes an individual recipient of a message. Messaging user objects implement the <b>IMailUser</b> interface, which inherits from the <b>IMAPIProp</b> interface.</dd>
<dt>
<a name="_edk_microsoft_exchange_server"></a><b>Microsoft Exchange Server</b></dt>
<dd>
The correct term to used when referring to both the Microsoft Exchange Server system and its server component.</dd>
<dt>
<a name="_edk_microsoft_exchange_server_administrator_program"></a><b>Microsoft Exchange Server Administrator program</b></dt>
<dd>
A graphical interface that is used for configuring and maintaining the <a href="glossary_1ooj.htm#_edk_site">sites</a> and <a href="glossary_1ooj.htm#_edk_server">servers</a> of an <a href="glossary_1oof.htm#_edk_organization">organization</a> from a single location.</dd>
