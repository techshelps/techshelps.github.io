Microsoft Exchange Server objects are instances of MAPI objects. A MAPI object is a C++ object class or C data structure inherited from one or more MAPI interfaces, or collections of related functions. These collections of related functions are known to C++ developers as pure virtual functions. For a pure virtual function, MAPI supplies only the function prototype, not an implementation. A MAPI interface can only be instantiated through an inherited class.
<p>
Every type of MAPI object is inherited from an interface that is ultimately inherited from the <b>IUnknown</b> interface.

<dt>
<a name="_edk_object_identifier_oid_"></a><b>object identifier (OID)</b></dt>
<dd>
A value specifying the nature of an <a href="glossary_1ooo.htm#_edk_x.400">X.400</a> object. OIDs are used by MAPI for various purposes, such as indicating the types of attached files.  </dd>
<dt>
<a name="_edk_offline_folders"></a><b>offline folders</b></dt>
<dd>
A feature of Microsoft Exchange Server that makes public folders and mailbox folders available to users when they are offline. Folders configured for offline availability are stored in an OST file on the user’s disk. When users log on to their home server and the network connection is reestablished, Microsoft Exchange Server automatically propagates changes that have been made to the offline copy to the copy on the server.</dd>
<dt>
<a name="_edk_offline_folder_store_ost_"></a><b>offline folder store (OST)</b></dt>
<dd>
An information store that is used to store folder information that can be accessed offline. An OST is similar to a PST except that it is RTF aware, while a PST is not.</dd>
<dt>
<a name="_edk_one_off_address"></a><b>one-off address</b></dt>
<dd>
Address of a foreign system as expressed by an <a href="glossary_1oo1.htm#_edk_address_template">address template</a>. </dd>
<dt>
<a name="_edk_organization"></a><b>organization</b></dt>
<dd>
A collection of <a href="glossary_1ooj.htm#_edk_server">servers</a>, grouped into <a href="glossary_1ooj.htm#_edk_site">sites</a>, that are linked together to provide workgroup connectivity, information, and messaging services. The organization is the highest level object in the <a href="glossary_1oo4.htm#_edk_directory_information_tree_dit_">directory information tree (DIT)</a>.</dd>
<dt>
<a name="_edk_organization_forms_library"></a><b>organization forms library</b></dt>
<dd>
A programming interface that stores electronic <a href="glossary_1oo6.htm#_edk_form">forms</a> for use by an entire <a href="#_edk_organization">organization</a>. The forms library architecture is defined by <a href="glossary_1ood.htm#_edk_mapi">MAPI</a>. It functions independently of any specific forms technology and can store forms from multiple forms-development environments. It resides in the <a href="glossary_1oog.htm#_edk_public_information_store">public information store</a> as a hidden <a href="glossary_1oog.htm#_edk_public_folder">public folder</a> and is replicated throughout the organization for user access to forms.</dd>
