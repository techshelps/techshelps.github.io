<p>
Gateways are usually installed and configured according to the user’s specified needs. It is good practice to collect and verify this data from the user at the beginning of the setup procedure through a series of interactive dialog boxes. This information tells the setup program which components to install and how to configure the user’s system.</p>
<p>
Typical information to be gathered at this point includes:
<ul>
<li>
The name of the Microsoft Exchange Server computer on which to install the gateway.</li>
<li>
The site on which to install the gateway.</li>
<li>
A display name for the gateway directory object.</li>
<li>
A display name for the gateway service.</li>
<li>
A path to the directory in which to install the gateway.</li>
<li>
The Windows NT Server account name for the gateway service.</li>
<li>
The Windows NT Server account password for the gateway service.</li>
</ul>
<p>
For example, the setup program for the sample gateway distributed with this SDK uses the following files to collect information at installation time:
<ul>
<li>
<b>DIALOGS.RC</b>  This file contains the dialog boxes that are displayed.</li>
<li>
<b>GWUISTF.C</b>  This program contains dialog box control routines and validates some of the entered data.</li>
<li>
<b>GWSETUP.C</b>  This program performs high-level dialog box control operations and performs some additional data validation.<b> </b></li>
</ul>
