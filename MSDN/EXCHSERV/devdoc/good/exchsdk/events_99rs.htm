<h3><a name="_edk_new_agent_dialog_box"></a>New Agent Dialog Box</h3>
<p>
The following dialog box is displayed when you choose <b>New </b>or <b>Edit</b> on the <b>Agents</b> property page.</p>
<p>
<img src="images/newagent.gif" border=0><b> </b></p>
<p>
This dialog box has the following controls:
<ul>
<li>
<b>Agent Name</b>  This is a text edit box through which the author can name the agent. The string entered is used as the PR_DISPLAY_NAME property of the agent message that is written to the folder.</li>
<li>
<b>When the following event(s) occurs</b>  This is a check box-style list box that contains the following event-type choices:<ul>
<li>
A scheduled event occurs</li>
<li>
A new item is posted in this folder</li>
<li>
An item is changed in this folder</li>
<li>
An item is deleted in this folder</li>
</ul>
<p>
If at least one event is checked in this list box, the agent specified in the <b>Run the following action</b> section will start when that event occurs. Otherwise, no events are monitored in this folder. 
</li>
<li>
<b>Schedule</b>  This is available only if <b>A scheduled event occurs</b> is checked. Choosing the Schedule button displays the <a href="events_5hyw.htm">Scheduled Event dialog box</a>, which you use to schedule timer events. </li>
<li>
<b>Logs</b>  Choosing this button displays the last 32KB of log messages resulting from this particular event, in this particular folder. See <a href="events_3cfn.htm">About Event Logs</a>. </li>
<li>
<b>Run the following action</b>  These controls are used to edit the agent to be invoked when a matching event is triggered.<ul>
<li>
<b>Script</b>  Choosing this option button causes the agent to default to the Microsoft Exchange Scripting Agent that handles scripts. </li>
<li>
<b>Edit Script</b>  Choosing this button starts Microsoft Notepad as your script editor. To use Microsoft Visual Studio 97 to edit scripts, refer to the Release Notes for Exchange Server version 5.5.</li>
<li>
<b>Other</b> (option button)  Choosing this option button sets the agent to the one listed in the drop-down list box.</li>
<li>
<b>Other </b>(drop-down list box)  This control displays the list of <b>IExchangeEventSink</b>-compatible objects installed on the server to which the script was bound on the <a href="events_8jvp.htm"><b>Agents</b> property page</a>. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<b>Properties</b>  Choose <b>Properties</b> to configure the properties of a COM object (a <a href="events_2j90.htm">custom agent</a>). This requires that the actual DLL or EXE files be installed on the local client computer as well as the server, so that the normal ActiveX property pages can be displayed.</li>
<li>
<b>OK/Apply</b>  Choosing <b>OK</b> or <b>Apply</b> registers your folder to be monitored by the Event Service so that your new agent is triggered when the event occurs. Specifically, this action</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>
Writes a message<b> </b>to the application folder. This hidden message contains the script, if the action chosen was to handle scripts with the Microsoft Exchange Scripting Agent. The script, now stored in the application folder, travels with the folder if it is moved. </li>
<li>
Writes an event-binding message to the <b>EVENTS_&lt;server name&gt;</b> hidden public folder. This message holds information for use by the Event Service, such as which folder to monitor (it contains the folder's identifier), the name of the server on which to run the action, the identifier of the script message to be run, and any needed COM object properties.</li>
</ol>
