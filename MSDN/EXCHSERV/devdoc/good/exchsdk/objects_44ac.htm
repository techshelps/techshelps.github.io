<h2><a name="_edk_admin_extension_object"></a>Admin-Extension Object</h2>
<p>
The Admin-Extension object represents an Administrator extension DLL within the directory. Administrator extension DLLs are used to create custom property pages for display by the Microsoft Exchange Server Administrator program. For more information on the Administrator program, see <a href="overview_2jqr.htm">About Server Applications</a>.</p>
<p>
This object contains the executable code for translating a message between the format used by Microsoft Exchange Server and that used by a foreign system. Each address type that a server supports has a separate Admin-Extension object.</p>
<p>
This object is stored in the Add-Ins container of the Microsoft Exchange Server directory. Because Administrator extension DLLs might be needed for several different hardware platforms, each platform can be represented by its own Admin-Extension object. An Administrator extension DLL can also be represented by an <a href="objects_9zg4.htm">Add-In</a> object. For more information on the Administrator extension DLL and the Add-Ins container, see <a href="admin_1ai4.htm">Installing the Administrator Extension DLL</a>.</p>
<p>
Because Admin-Extension objects appear to MAPI as messaging user objects, use the MAPI <b>IMailUser </b>interface to access an Admin-Extension object.</p>
<p>
For more information on accessing Admin-Extension objects through MAPI and through the directory access functions, see <a href="admin_1hid.htm">Initializing Connections with ADMIN_Initialize</a>.</p>
