<h2><a name="_edk_information_storage"></a>Storing Information</h2>
<p>
The <a href="glossary_1oom.htm#_edk_viewer">Viewer</a> structures its information in a graphical format showing a hierarchical tree of folders on the left of the screen and the contents of the selected folder on the right of the screen. All objects are viewed as folders and messages whether they are public or private, local or Internet, scheduling, e-mail, or documents.</p>
<p>
The user interface directory structure contains several different types of folders—the <a href="glossary_1ood.htm#_edk_mailbox">mailbox</a>, <a href="glossary_1oog.htm#_edk_personal_folder">personal folders</a>, and <a href="glossary_1oog.htm#_edk_public_folder">public folders</a>.
<ul>
<li>
The mailbox serves as the delivery location for all incoming mail messages for a designated owner. Information in a user’s mailbox is stored in the <a href="glossary_1oog.htm#_edk_private_information_store">private information store</a> on the client’s home server.</li>
<li>
Personal folders contain information intended for private use. They can also be designated as the delivery location for mail if a user wants to store e-mail messages locally. Mail delivered to personal folders is still funneled through the mailbox on the server running Microsoft Exchange Server, but it is stored wherever the personal folder is located. Personal folders can either reside on a file server or locally on the user’s hard disk.</li>
<li>
Public folders store information that is available and intended for sharing. They reside on servers running Microsoft Exchange Server and provide easy access to the information they contain.</li>
</ul>
