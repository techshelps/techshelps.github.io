<h2><a name="_edk_designing_a_source_extractor"></a>Designing a Source Extractor</h2>
<p>
You must consider many issues when designing your source extractor. For example, your source extractor will ideally extract a reasonable amount of data overnight. If you have international users, the source extractor should be easy to localize and should include appropriate code-pages. You should also consider these questions: 
<ul>
<li>
What level of sophistication is required to install and configure the source extractor?</li>
<li>
Does a user-driven source extractor make sense? </li>
<li>
Where are the files going to be edited after export and before import? </li>
<li>
How will the files be transferred from the extract location to the import location? </li>
<li>
Will file transfer modify the files?</li>
<li>
Is the existing system going to be in use? </li>
</ul>
<p>
Also consider the following additional issues when creating your source extractor:
<ul>
<li>
<b>Existing data</b>  If possible, copy, don’t move, the data from your existing system, so that you will have an additional copy of the data.</li>
<li>
<b>Group migration</b>  If your existing system has account information in the directory, select accounts to migrate by department or location.</li>
<li>
<b>Permissions</b>  Administrator or user authentication should be required to copy data from the source system.</li>
<li>
<b>Primary mailbox files</b>  Mailbox files need to be edited if you’re changing the directory name. It is best to put all the directory entries into one primary file. </li>
<li>
<b>Mailbox names</b>  You cannot change the common or directory name of a mailbox after you create it. If you have a new naming convention, modify every primary file that contains mailbox creation information, or modify the source extractor to select the new directory names from a file.</li>
</ul>
<p>
You should also consider each of the following issues:
<ul>
<li>
Choosing the addressing conventions</li>
<li>
Choosing information to extract</li>
<li>
Configuring command-line options</li>
<li>
Configuring special features </li>
</ul>
