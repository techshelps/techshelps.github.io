<h3><a name="_edk_binding_an_agent_to_a_server"></a>Binding an Agent to a Server</h3>
<p>
One server running the Microsoft Exchange Event Service can handle events for an arbitrary number of folders. </p>
<p>
Although the Event Service can be running on any number of computers, a script runs only once per event, and each event (and thus each script) is processed by only a single server. Therefore, binding an agent to a server means choosing which Event Service server will run the agent. </p>
<p>
For example, to monitor a given folder for new postings, you first specify a Microsoft Exchange server on which to run the events these postings will trigger. </p>
<p>
You use Microsoft Outlook to perform the binding, and you do this while creating agents. Use the <b>Run these agents on this server</b> control on the <a href="events_8jvp.htm">Agents property page</a> to bind an agent to a server. All the agents for a given folder must be bound to the same server.</p>
<h4>Location of Servers, Folders, Scripts, and Registration Information</h4>
<p>
A folder on which you want to run a script may be anywhere, such as in a recipient's mailbox, or replicated from a folder on another server. </p>
<p>
Binding information is stored in a public folder that represents a server on which the Event Service is running. Specifically, when an administrator installs the Event Service, a new folder is created in the <a href="compnent_51f7.htm">non-IPM subtree</a> of the information store, under <b>System Folders\Events Root\</b>. This new folder is named <b>EventConfig_&lt;ServerName&gt;</b>, and it exists to contain data that connects folder events to this particular server. The location of this folder is shown in the following illustration.</p>
<p>

<p>
If, for example, you configure an event in a given folder to trigger an action that will be run on the server <b>EXCHNGE3</b>, the act of binding writes agent data into the folder <b>EventConfig_EXCHNGE3</b>. Although this folder contains binding data, it is not visible through the Microsoft Exchange Server Administrator program.</p>
<p>
The public folder information store, the Event Eervice, and the agents can each be on different Microsoft Windows&nbsp;NT® servers or all on the same server.</p>
<h4>Permissions Are Needed to Bind Agents</h4>
<p>
The Microsoft Exchange administrator, who configures public folders, controls who is allowed to run scripts on a given server. Administrators must grant you Editor permission for you to bind an agent to be run on a particular server. </p>
<p>
To continue with the example from the previous section, only people who have write permissions on the monitored folder for the server <b>EXCHNGE3 </b>can cause agents (including scripts) in that folder to be run on the server <b>EXCHNGE3</b>. Like all public folders, the property sheets for the folder <b>EventConfig_EXCHNGE3</b> contain a <b>Client Permissions </b>property page. A Microsoft Exchange administrator can, on this page, assign Editor permission to whoever should be able to run agents on the server—in this case, <b>EXCHNGE3</b>.</p>
