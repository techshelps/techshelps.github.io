<h2><a name="_edk_using_thread_safe_objects"></a>Using Thread-Safe Objects</h2>
<p>
<a href="glossary_1oo3.htm#_edk_client_application">Client applications</a> and <a href="glossary_1ooj.htm#_edk_service_provider">service providers</a> can assume that <a href="glossary_1oof.htm#_edk_object">objects</a> used directly or as callbacks are always thread-safe except in the following cases:
<ul>
<li>
A transport provider’s status object obtained through a client call to <b>IMAPISession::OpenEntry</b> with an entry identifier from the provider’s status table row.</li>
<li>
All MAPI form objects obtained through a client call to <b>MAPIOpenFormManager</b>. Form objects obey apartment model rules and clients must use them and all objects contained by them only on the thread that created them.</li>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<p>
When a client accesses a transport provider’s row in the status table that includes the entry identifier of the associated status object, the client can open a status object by calling <b>OpenEntry</b> with that entry identifier. This status object is not thread-safe because transport providers run in the context of the MAPI spooler and do not maintain a separate context for their status objects. Status objects obeys apartment model rules and clients must use them only on the thread that created them. </p>
<p>
A client must also invoke <b>MAPIInitialize</b> on every thread before using any MAPI objects and <b>MAPIUninitialize</b> when that use is complete. These calls should be made even if the objects to be used are passed to the thread from an external source. <b>MAPIInitialize</b> and <b>MAPIUninitialize</b> can be called from anywhere except from within a Win32 <b>DLLEntryPoint</b> function, a function that is invoked by the system when processes and threads are initialized and terminated, or upon calls to the <b>LoadLibrary</b> and <b>FreeLibrary</b> functions. Clients should not require the <b>DLLEntryPoint</b> functions because the MAPI service provider interface has its own initialization and deinitialization entry points.</p>
<p>
Indirect use objects should never be assumed to be thread-safe. Indirect use objects are returned by methods that require destination interface pointers as input parameters. Examples of such methods are <b>IMAPIProp::CopyTo</b> and <b>CopyProps</b>, <b>IMAPIFolder::CopyFolder</b> and <b>CopyMessage</b>, and <b>IMsgServiceAdmin::CopyMsgService</b>. If a service provider wants to call such an object from a thread other than the one on which it was passed, the provider is responsible for explicitly marshalling the object.</p>
