<h1><a name="_edk_poppst_.ini_file"></a>POPPST .INI File</h1>
<p>
The .INI file for the <a href="samples3_231h.htm">POPPST</a> sample application is structured consistently with standard Microsoft .INI files. It requires section header lines and section entry lines. In a section header line, the section keyword is enclosed in square brackets. Section entry lines start with an entry keyword that is immediately followed by an equals sign (=), which in turn is followed by a value for the section entry. All characters (including whitespace) following the '=' up to the next &lt;newline&gt; are included in the value. Leading whitespace is permitted and is not significant, but whitespace in all other locations is significant. </p>
<p>
You may include comments by using a semicolon (;) as the first non-whitespace character on a line. Blank lines may be included in the .INI file and are ignored. </p>
<p>
The POPPST .INI file can contain three kinds of sections:
<ul>
<li>
A [newpst] section in the .INI file defines the values used for the creation of a new PST. </li>
<li>
Use a [profile] section to identify an existing Microsoft Exchange Server profile that contains a PST to which you want to add messages. </li>
<li>
A [message] section contains properties used to create a test message that is to be added to a new or existing PST. Using additional [message] sections causes the creation of additional test messages.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Either a [newpst] section or a [profile] section is required, and must be the first section in the .INI file. However, you must not use both a [newpst] section and a [profile] section in one .INI file. </p>
<p>
If you specify a [newpst] section, a temporary profile will be used, which means that no name resolution will be possible. If you specify the [profile] section, the message created will be placed in the specified folder in the default message store. If you want the message to be placed into your PST, then you must <i>first</i> set the Personal Folders information store to be your default information store for the specified profile. To do this, select the <b>Options</b> choice of the <b>Tools</b> menu in the Microsoft Exchange Client, and then click the <b>Delivery</b> tab. Then, click <b>Personal Folders</b> in the drop-down list box labeled <b>Deliver new mail to the following location</b>.</p>
<p>
One or more [message] sections can follow the [newpst] or [profile] section. </p>
<p>
Unless noted as optional in the following description, all section entry lines are required and must occur exactly once per section. The order of section entries within a section is not important. Keywords used in the POPPST program are not case-sensitive. Maximum line-length is 512 characters (MAXINIFILELINE), including the &lt;newline&gt; character.</p>
