<h3><a name="_edk_automatic_conflict_resolution"></a>Automatic Conflict Resolution</h3>
<p>
Once a conflict message has been identified, an application or form can resolve the conflict as follows: 
<ol>
<li>
It locates the attachments in conflict by reading the <a href="props4_5kj8.htm">PR_IN_CONFLICT</a> property on the attachment table.</li>
<li>
It resolves the conflict between these attachments in one of two ways:<ul>
<li>
It can select the winning message based on almost any criteria. </li>
<li>
It can merge the contents of the messages in conflict. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
Using the MAPI <b>IMAPIProp::CopyTo</b> method, it copies the resolved properties to the main message (the message to which conflicting messages are attached). Then, the attachments are deleted.</li>
</ol>
<p>
When all conflicting message attachments are deleted and changes are saved, Microsoft Exchange Server automatically clears the message’s MSGSTATUS_IN_CONFLICT bit. You do not need to programmatically reset this bit after the conflicting message attachment is deleted.</p>
