<h2><a name="_edk_about_mailboxes_and_the_private_information_store"></a>About Mailboxes and the Private Information Store</h2>
<p>
The <a href="glossary_1oog.htm#_edk_private_information_store">private information store</a> consists of <a href="glossary_1ood.htm#_edk_mailbox">mailboxes</a> that can belong to users or to applications. Mailboxes reside on the computer running Microsoft Exchange Server. Each newly created mailbox has four default folders visible to the Microsoft Exchange Client: 
<ul>
<li>
Deleted Items</li>
<li>
Inbox</li>
<li>
Outbox</li>
<li>
Sent Items</li>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<p>
The mailbox contains several other folders that are not visible and are used for storing information such as user-defined views. Users or applications can create new, visible folders in addition to the four default folders. The following diagram shows the internal architecture of a mailbox. </p>
