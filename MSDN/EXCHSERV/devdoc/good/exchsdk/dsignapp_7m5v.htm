<h2><a name="_edk_troubleshooting_errors"></a>Troubleshooting Errors</h2>
<p>
If errors occur during the import of migration files, the Migration Wizard logs errors to an application log and importing may stop. If importing continues, the error is written to a recovery file. A recovery file is created each time files are imported. The recovery files are written into the Temp directory of the computer running the Migration Wizard. </p>
<p>
Therefore, if an error occurs, first check the application log and the recovery file. One error in the file format can cause multiple or cascading error messages. If the error can’t be found in the line with the error report, an error in a previous line might be causing the problem, or there may be an improper offset to the secondary file.</p>
<p>
If it is a primary file error, you can edit this file and fix the problem. If it’s a secondary file error, you get a pointer to the problem, which you can attempt to fix. If you must edit the secondary file, make a backup first. Be careful not to change the offsets of later sections. After all problems are fixed, you can create a new packing list file that lists the primary and edited (not original) secondary files.</p>
<pre><code>File Processing </code></pre>
<p>
If you understand how the Migration Wizard processes the files, you can troubleshoot problems. The Migration Wizard first reads the packing list file and then starts processing the first primary file. The following table describes how each primary file is processed.</p>
<table cellspacing=4 cols=2>
<tr valign=top>
<th align=left width=17%>Section</th>
<th align=left width=83%>Processing</th>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=17%>Directory</td>
<td width=83%>Every line after the directory header line until the start of the next section is passed to the directory import <a href="glossary_1oo4.htm#_edk_dll_dynamic_link_library_">DLL</a> one line at a time.</td>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=17%>PAB</td>
<td width=83%>Each line of <a href="glossary_1oog.htm#_edk_personal_address_book_pab_">personal address book (PAB)</a> data is read. After all lines are read, a message is created.</td>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=17%>MailMessage</td>
<td width=83%>If the <a href="glossary_1ood.htm#_edk_mailbox">mailbox</a> does not exist, it is created by custom recipient conversion if possible. If a message is for public folder, it is created with appropriate permissions if necessary.<p>
For each line, a message is created. The secondary file is checked for body and attachments. If body is empty and there is a document, the attachment to mailbox is copied as a free document. If body is empty and there is a schedule file, the body is supplied by the Migration Wizard and the attachment is added.</p>
