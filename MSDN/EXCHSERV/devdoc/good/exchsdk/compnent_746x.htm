<h2><a name="_edk_about_information_store_security"></a>About Information Store Security</h2>
<p>
<a href="glossary_1oo9.htm#_edk_information_store">Information store</a> <a href="glossary_1oof.htm#_edk_object">objects</a> can be accessed only by users or applications with sufficient <a href="glossary_1oog.htm#_edk_permission">permissions</a>. The ability to create or delete <a href="glossary_1oo6.htm#_edk_folder">folders</a>, post items, and edit <a href="glossary_1oog.htm#_edk_public_folder">public folder</a> contents depends on the account’s permissions on that object, as specified by the <a href="glossary_1oo1.htm#_edk_access_control_list_acl_">access control list (ACL)</a>. An ACL is similar in function to the <a href="glossary_1oo4.htm#_edk_discretionary_access_control_list_dacl_">discretionary access control list (DACL)</a>, which limits access to directory objects. (See <a href="compnent_3zw9.htm">About Directory Security</a>). </p>
<p>
Access to information stores and the objects within them is granted in the following ways:
<ul>
<li>
<a href="glossary_1ood.htm#_edk_mailbox"><b>Mailboxes</b></a>  The information store verifies that the account requesting to log on (as identified by its security identifier) is that of the mailbox’s owner. If so, logon permission is granted.</li>
<li>
<a href="glossary_1oog.htm#_edk_public_information_store"><b>Public information stores</b></a>  Security is not enforced on the public information store, but rather on individual folders within the store.</li>
<li>
<a href="glossary_1oof.htm#_edk_offline_folder_store_ost_"><b>Offline folder stores (OST)</b></a>  Access to an OST is granted to the logon account with the <a href="glossary_1oog.htm#_edk_profile">profile</a> in which the offline store was created. The OST may also be opened by another profile, but that profile must be logged on to the corresponding mailbox. File-level security can also be used to deny access to an OST.</li>
<li>
<b>Top folder within a store</b>  Special permissions are needed to create the top level folder in a public information store. No special permissions are needed in private information stores. Administrators can control the creation of top-level folders through the <a href="glossary_1oo1.htm#_edk_administrator_program">Administrator program</a>.</li>
<li>
<b>Folder within a folder</b>  Folders within folders are treated as Contents of Folders, with this exception: The requestor must own a folder to delete it.</li>
<li>
<b>Contents of folders  </b>Access to messages and other items is determined by the permissions granted the requestor, as defined in the <a href="glossary_1oo1.htm#_edk_access_control_list_acl_">ACL</a> of the containing folder. Any folder in an information store can have an access control list.</li>
</ul>
