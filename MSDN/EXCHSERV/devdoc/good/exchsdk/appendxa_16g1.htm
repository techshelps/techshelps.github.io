<h3><a name="_edk_example_importing_directory_data"></a>Example: Importing Directory Data</h3>
<p>
The following is an sample data file for an import session with no user template selected:</p>
<pre><code>Obj-Class,Common-Name,Given-Name,Surname,Home-Server,Display-Name
mailbox,SteveMas,Steve,Masters,FALCON,Steve Masters    
mailbox,JerryWh,Jerry,Wheeler,BOB,,
mailbox,KevinY,,,BOB,
 </code></pre>
<p>
In the above example, three mailboxes are created:
<ul>
<li>
As specified on the second line, a mailbox for SteveMas is created on the server Falcon. The <a href="sch_attr_2cv9.htm">Given-Name</a>, <a href="sch_attr_6uqt.htm">Surname</a>, and <a href="sch_attr_16w5.htm">Display-Name</a> information was provided and these attributes are imported.</li>
<li>
As specified on the third line, a mailbox for JerryWh is created on the server called BOB. The Given Name and Surname are set. The Display Name is created from the Given Name and Surname as Jerry Wheeler because it was not provided.</li>
<li>
As specified on the fourth line, a mailbox for KevinY is created on the server called BOB. The Surname is set to KevinY because it was not provided. This would also cause the Display-Name to be set to KevinY.</li>
</ul>
<p>
The following is an example data file for an importing session where a user template was selected. This user has a Home-Server of FALCON. (In this example, the user template was designated not in the import file, but through the user interface of the <a href="glossary_1ood.htm#_edk_microsoft_exchange_server_administrator_program">Administrator program</a>.)</p>
<pre><code>Obj-Class,Common-Name,Given-Name,Surname,Display-Name,Member
mailbox,SteveMas,Steve,Masters,,MailPM%MAPITest
mailbox,SharonSw,Sharon,Swanson,Sharon Swanson,Testers
 </code></pre>
<p>
In the preceding example, two mailboxes are created on the FALCON server, a fact derived from the Home-Server attribute of the user template.
<ul>
<li>
As specified on the second line, a mailbox for SteveMas is created with a Given Name of Steve and a Surname of Masters. The Display-Name of Steve Masters is constructed; the <a href="glossary_1oo4.htm#_edk_distinguished_name_dn_">distinguished name (DN)</a>for SteveMas is added to the membership list for the <a href="glossary_1oo4.htm#_edk_distribution_list_dl_">distribution lists (DL)</a> called MailPM and MAPITest. </li>
<li>
On the second line, the names of these DLs for SteveMas are separated by a percent sign (%). You can select a different separator by choosing the <b>Directory Import</b> option from <b>Tools</b> menu in the Administrator program. Click <b>Separators</b> to open the <b>Separators</b> dialog box.</li>
<li>
As specified on the third line, a user SharonSw is created with a Given Name of Sharon and a Surname of Swanson. The Display Name was specified as Sharon Swanson; the <a href="glossary_1oo4.htm#_edk_distinguished_name_dn_">DN</a> for SharonSw is added to the <a href="glossary_1oo4.htm#_edk_distribution_list_dl_">DL</a> called Testers. </li>
</ul>
<p>
If the option had been set in the Administrator program user interface to create the Windows NT Server security account, a Windows NT Server account is created in the Windows NT Server security domain for each of these users. The Windows NT user name is the same as the Common-Name.</p>
