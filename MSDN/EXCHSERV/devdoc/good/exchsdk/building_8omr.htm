<b>Address mapping</b>  Translating between Microsoft Exchange Server addresses and the address format of foreign message systems.</li>
<li>
<b>Message content translation</b>  Converting between the data formats used by Microsoft Exchange Server and foreign message systems. For example, performing RTF to plain text conversion.</li>
<li>
<b>Backboning</b>  Transparently connecting two Microsoft Exchange Servers by means of an intermediate foreign message system.</li>
<li>
<b>Performance monitoring</b>  Monitoring the performace of a gateway, both for self-tuning and for use by an administrator.</li>
<li>
<b>Event logging</b>  Recording events such as deliveries and error conditions to a log file.</li>
<li>
<b>Error handling</b>  Recovering gracefully from error conditions.</li>
<li>
