<p>
The Raw Properties screen is part of the <a href="glossary_1ood.htm#_edk_microsoft_exchange_server_administrator_program">Microsoft Exchange Server Administrator program</a>. By setting data in the Raw Properties screen, you can establish values as they would be set by components you have not yet developed. Data is normally set and manipulated by your application or its setup program, and data is passed from one component to the next. Establishing this artificial environment allows you to test them while they are being developed. For example, you could debug an extension DLL by changing the underlying data. </p>
<p>
To view the Raw Properties screen, select any object and choose <b>Raw Properties</b> from the <b>File</b> menu. Note that the Raw Properties screen is available only if you start the Administrator program with the /raw switch set. </p>
