<h3><a name="_gdk_choosing_gateway_and_gateway_type_names"></a>Choosing Gateway and Gateway Type Names</h3>
<p>
The first step in adding performance monitoring to your gateway is choosing a name that represents your gateway type. This name should be specific to your gateway and not a generic type name. For example, use ACME-Fax rather than Fax. This name is used as a key under the <b>SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services</b> key in the Windows NT Registry, and it will hold information describing the counters in your gateway. For this reason it cannot be shared by another gateway that uses a different set of counters. The type for the sample gateway is MyGate.</p>
<p>
In addition to choosing the gateway type name, you should also choose a name for your specific gateway. This will be the name of the gateway as it is installed in Microsoft Exchange Server. You can install multiple instances of the gateway, in which case there will be more than one gateway name. Each gateway name is also used as a key under the <b>SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services</b> key in the registry, so a gateway name should not be the same as a gateway type name. This example uses two instances of the gateway named MyGate1 and MyGate2.</p>
