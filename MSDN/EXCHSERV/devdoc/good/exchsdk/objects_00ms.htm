<h2><a name="_edk_mailbox_object"></a>Mailbox Object</h2>
<p>
The Mailbox object represents a Microsoft Exchange client that uses the Microsoft Exchange Server information store as its mail repository. A mailbox object inherits from a <a href="objects_0ies.htm">Mail-Recipient object</a>, which means that it can also be contained within a <a href="objects_233o.htm">Distribution-List object</a>.</p>
<p>
For example, a recipient who uses the POP3 protocol (Post Office protocol 3) to connect to Microsoft Exchange Server and retrieve mail must have a mailbox. Similarly, a recipient who uses a Microsoft Exchange client to connect to Microsoft Exchange Server and retrieve mail must also have a mailbox. However, LDAP and NNTP clients communicate directly with the Microsoft Exchange Server directory and are not necessarily represented by mailboxes.</p>
<p>
Because Mailbox objects appear to MAPI as messaging user objects, use the MAPI <b>IMailUser</b> interface to access a Mailbox object.</p>
<p>
For more information on accessing Mailbox objects through MAPI and through directory access functions, see <a href="directry_41gz.htm">Using MAPI with Directory Objects</a> and <a href="admin_938u.htm">Storing and Accessing Configuration Information</a>.</p>
