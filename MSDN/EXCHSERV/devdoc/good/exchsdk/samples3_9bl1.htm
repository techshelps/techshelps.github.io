<h2><a name="_edk_preparing_the_command_file"></a>Preparing the Command File</h2>
<p>
The RULEEDIT command file must contain several sections.</p>
<h4>Initialization Section</h4>
<p>
The initialization section must appear first in the file and start with the [Initialization] header. The initialization section specifies general parameters used for the RULEEDIT session. These may include:
<ul>
<li>
<b>FOLDER=&lt;<i>folder name</i>&gt;</b>  Name of the <a href="glossary_1oo6.htm#_edk_folder">folder</a> in which the <a href="glossary_1ooi.htm#_edk_rule">rules</a> will be created. The syntax of this line is the same as the syntax of the <b>/FOLDER</b> command-line flag.</li>
<li>
<b>PROVIDER=&lt;<i>provider name</i>&gt;</b>  Name of the rule provider to use. If this value is not present in either the .INI file or the command line, the default MSFT:RuleEdit name will be used when inserting or deleting rules</li>
<li>
<b>PROFILE=&lt;<i>profile name</i>&gt;</b>  The MAPI profile used for logging to a store</li>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<p>
Parameters specified in this section may be overwritten by setting the corresponding command-line flags.</p>
<h4>Command Sections</h4>
<p>
These sections specify the individual rule creation, deletion, or listing commands that are to be executed during the RULEEDIT session. Each command section must start with a [Command#] header, where # is a unique number assigned to the command.</p>
<p>
<b>Note</b>  At this time individual command numbers specified in the .INI file are not used by the program and need not be unique. Commands are executed in the order they are listed in the file, not in the order of their numbers. It is recommended, however, that each command be assigned a unique number in the [Command#] header to maintain compatibility with future versions of RULEEDIT. </p>
