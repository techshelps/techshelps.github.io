<h3><a name="_edk_access_to_mailboxes"></a>Access to Mailboxes</h3>
<p>
It is possible to open your own mailbox and, with sufficient permissions, to open another recipient’s mailbox. The owner of a mailbox (a user or an application) has automatic Owner privilege on that mailbox and can therefore open the mailbox and its contents. The owner of a mailbox can assign any of several types of <a href="glossary_1oo4.htm#_edk_delegate_access">delegate access</a> for that mailbox to another recipient, who can then manipulate the mailbox and its contents according to certain rules. </p>
<p>
An owner can also assign <a href="compnent_63qr.htm">access control list</a> (ACL) entries to server store folders, although an ACL entry is not necessary for Owner privileges. A third means of opening mailboxes is a mechanism called privileged access, which is associated with an administrator privilege granted to a server application. Such an application is known as a <a href="glossary_1oog.htm#_edk_privileged_service">privileged service</a>. </p>
<p>
