<h2><a name="_edk_building_the_set_of_sample_applications"></a>Building the Set of Sample Applications</h2>
<p>
All the sample applications are shipped in two forms: as compiled, executable files and as source files. You can rebuild the sample applications as a set or individually. Rebuilding the sample applications is useful for the following purposes:
<ul>
<li>
Creates a set of sample applications with the DEBUG build type. This allows you to extract more information about the sample applications from the Visual C++ interface.</li>
<li>
Acts as a test of your development environment.</li>
<li>
Simplifies the process of building a complex sample application that requires several other sample applications to be built before it can run.</li>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<p>
You will need Visual C++ version 4.0 or later on your system, which can be used to compile both C and C++ files and must be part of the development environment.</p>
<p>
A WIN32 subdirectory is added below the current directory for each sample application. A subdirectory is added below the WIN32 subdirectory for the build type. For example, if the build type is DEBUG, this subdirectory is called DEBUG. All object files, .LIB files, and output files are placed in the build type subdirectory. In this way, DEBUG and RETAIL versions of a product can exist simultaneously in the same directory tree.</p>
<h5><img src="../../images/wedge.gif" border=0>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To build the set of all sample applications </h5>
<ol>
<li>
Change to the directory containing the sample applications:<p>
\BKOFFICE\SAMPLES\EXCHANGE
</li>
<li>
Type <b>NMAKE [BLDTYPE=RETAIL]</b>.<p>
This command builds each library in order, then combines all the libraries into the ExchSDKd.LIB library (DEBUG) or the ExchSDK.LIB library (RETAIL). 
</li>
</ol>
<p>
Building all the sample applications may take 45 to 60 minutes. If stopped, then restarted, the process will compare all products and build only those that have changed since the last time it was invoked. In essence, the process will restart from where it stopped.</p>
