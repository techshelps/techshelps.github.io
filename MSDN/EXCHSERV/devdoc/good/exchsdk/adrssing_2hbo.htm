<h1><a name="_gdk_the_addr_type_object"></a>The Addr-Type Object</h1>
<p>
Every gateway has an associated address type that corresponds to the address format of the foreign system the gateway serves. This address type is represented by an Addr-Type directory object. The gateway and the Addr-Type object are associated by the Microsoft Exchange Server’s GWART. Your gateway’s setup program installs a the Addr-Type object and associated information when it installs the gateway.</p>
<p>
The following components are associated with an Addr-Type object:
<ul>
<li>
A proxy address generation DLL that enables the system to generate proxy addresses of this address type.</li>
<li>
Address entry templates that assist the administrator or user in manually entering a recipient address of this address type. There are two types of templates: normal and MS-DOS. </li>
<li>
Per-message and per-recipient options that enable users to set options in messages sent to addresses of this address type.</li>
<li>
Online Help that provides instructions for using the property pages associated with per-message and per-recipient options.</li>
</ul>
