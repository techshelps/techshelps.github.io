<h1><a name="_splus_schedule_objects"></a>Schedule+ Objects</h1>
<p>
Automation defines programmable objects that can be used to extend the capabilities of Schedule+. The two main Schedule+ object types are tables and items. Tables contain a series of rows, each of which is an item, and each item contains a set of properties. You can think of these properties as the columns of a row. This structure is shown in the following figure.</p>

<p>
All objects can also have data members, which can be thought of as attributes. Properties are objects that can have a class (type) and value. They can be accessed by querying data members, or accessed directly by assigning the property to a variable of the appropriate type, as shown in the following sample code:</p>
<pre><code>Dim objText As Object
Dim strText As Object

Set objText = objAppt.Text
    strText = objText.Value
'or
    strText = objAppt.Text
 </code></pre>
