<h3><a name="_edk_the_executable_file"></a>The Executable File</h3>
<p>
Your server application's executable file is copied into a directory specified by the administrator installing the application. For a Windows NT Server application, this directory must be on the computer on which you are running the installation program, though this computer need not be a Microsoft Exchange Server computer. </p>
<p>
For example, if you want to run a <a href="glossary_1oo7.htm#_edk_gateway">gateway</a> on Computer A, you must run the setup program and install the executable file on Computer A, even though Computer B may be the Microsoft Exchange Server computer to which you will connect the gateway.</p>
<h3>Example: Installing a Gateway</h3>
<p>
An SMTP gateway called Pro-SMTP is written by the fictitious company Pro-Electron, Inc. When this gateway is installed to a Microsoft Exchange Server called Proton, the gateway name Pro-SMTP is used as the Extension-Name, and the files are to be used on the i386 (Intel) platform. </p>
<p>
In this installation, the setup program copies both PROADMIN.DLL (the <a href="glossary_1oo1.htm#_edk_administrator_extension_dll">Administrator extension DLL</a>) and PROADMIN.HLP (the Help file for the gateway's extension <a href="glossary_1oog.htm#_edk_property_page">property pages</a>) to \\PROTON\ADD-INS\PRO-SMTP\I386. The proxy generation DLL for this gateway is copied to the \\PROTON\ADDRESS\PRO-SMTP\I386 directory.</p>
<p>
The gateway setup program displays a dialog box so the administrator can choose the destination of the gateway's executable file. This destination directory is saved into the <a href="glossary_1oon.htm#_edk_windows_nt_registry">Windows NT Registry</a> on the server application's computer.</p>
<p>
<b>Note</b>  The Common-Name attribute of a directory object is a concatenation of the values used for Extension-Name<i> </i>and<i> </i>Platform. For example, the gateway in the preceding example would have a Common-Name of Pro-SMTP:i386, and the <a href="glossary_1ood.htm#_edk_microsoft_exchange_server_administrator_program">Microsoft Exchange Server Administrator program</a> would recognize it by this name only. Therefore, your installation program must use the Extension-Name<i> </i>and<i> </i>Platform values consistently when it copies files and when it is imports the application's directory object.</p>
<p>
The GWSETUP.C and MBSETUP.C sample installation files first build a list of files to be copied, and then call the <b>CopyFilesInCopyList</b> function of the Setup toolkit.</p>
