<p>
You can build client functionality in Microsoft Exchange Server by extending the Microsoft Exchange Client or by developing your own client application. </p>
<p>
Extending the Microsoft Exchange Client usually involves adding functionality to the <a href="glossary_1oom.htm#_edk_viewer">Viewer</a>, such as a new pull-down menu or function key. The Viewer is where users access, organize, and exchange information, as shown in the following figure.</p>
<p>
<img src="images/edk30.gif" border=0></p>
<p>
The Viewer groups many types of information in one place, including such diverse items as e-mail, word processing, voice mail, faxes, spreadsheets, presentation graphics, meeting requests, and customer contact reports. The toolbar is the interface for tasks such as printing, creating a new message, deleting an item, or viewing the <a href="glossary_1oo1.htm#_edk_address_book">address book</a>. This interface is consistent across all platforms supported by Microsoft Exchange Server.</p>
