<p>
Microsoft Exchange Server automatically batches calls to the <b>IMAPITable::SetColumns</b> and <b>IMAPITable::SortTable</b> methods, even if not expressly requested to do so by the calling application. Because of this batching, you need to make these calls in a certain order to receive notifications. Specifically, <b>IMAPITable::GetRowCount</b> or <b>IMAPITable::QueryRows </b>must be called before changes are made to a table for which notifications are expected.</p>
<p>
For example, your code may contain a sequence like the following:
<ol>
<li>
Call lpFolder–&gt;<b>GetContentsTable</b>(lpTable)</li>
<li>
Call lpTable–&gt;<b>Advise</b></li>
<li>
Call methods on objects other than the table, such as lpFolder–&gt;<b>CreateMessage</b>, <b>SetProps</b>, and then <b>SaveChanges</b> on the messages. It is these calls that cause the changes for which notifications are expected.</li>
</ol>
<p>
The result of this sequence is that notifications do not arrive. However, notifications are received if the following order is followed, in which <b>GetRowCount</b> is called before changes are made to the table:
<ol>
<li>
Call lpFolder–&gt;<b>GetContentsTable</b>(lpTable)</li>
<li>
Call lpTable–&gt;<b>Advise</b></li>
<li>
Call lpTable–&gt;<b>GetRowCount </b>or<b> </b>lpTable–&gt;<b>QueryRows</b>. Calling this method at this point enables notifications for the changes to be made in the next step.</li>
<li>
Call methods on objects other than the table, such as lpFolder–&gt;<b>CreateMessage</b>, <b>SetProps</b>, and then <b>SaveChanges</b> on the messages. It is these calls that cause the changes for which notifications are expected.  </li>
</ol>
