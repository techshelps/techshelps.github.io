<p>
The <b>NMAKE CLEAN</b> command cleans the directory structure of all build products with a single build type. If you run this command from the \BKOFFICE\SAMPLES\EXCHANGE directory, all the build products with the specified build type will be removed from all directories. This includes the compiled sample applications, individual sample applications that you have built, and the contents of all subdirectories created by the builds.</p>
<p>
You can also run the <b>NMAKE CLEAN</b> command from an individual sample application's directory. If run from an individual directory such as \BKOFFICE\SAMPLES\EXCHANGE\SMBAGENT, subdirectories of the specified build type under this directory are removed. In other words, DEBUG and RETAIL copies are removed separately.</p>
