<h3><a name="_gdk_calculating_statistics"></a>Calculating Statistics</h3>
<p>
The monitor phase is responsible for collecting gateway data and calculating statistics. There are two types of counter statistics:
<ul>
<li>
<b>Snapshot statistics</b>  Each snapshot statistic is derived from one measurement recorded at one particular moment in time, such as the number of messages in the out-queue or the number of threads in use. Folder snapshot statistics are generated using the folder snapshot functions provided by STATS.LIB.</li>
<li>
<b>Period statistics</b>  Each period statistic is based on measurements recorded over a period of time, such as messages received per hour or the maximum number of messages in the in-queue during a four-hour period. They are generated from snapshot statistic derivations, using the jump window functions provided by STATS.LIB.</li>
</ul>
<p>
