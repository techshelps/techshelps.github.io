<h2><a name="_gdk_foreign_system_to_gateway_report_transfer"></a>Foreign System to Gateway Report Transfer</h2>
<p>
The following steps are performed when the foreign system transfers a delivery or nondelivery report to the gateway:
<ol>
<li>
When the gateway receives a report from the foreign system, it creates a MAPI report which is assigned a PR_SEARCH_KEY. </li>
<li>
The gateway looks up the original message by matching the foreign report’s message ID with the PR_FOREIGN_ID property values of the gateway’s archived messages. The foreign report’s message ID should be the same as the message ID originally generated by the gateway for the outgoing message. </li>
<li>
The gateway assigns the gateway report PR_PARENT_KEY, PR_FOREIGN_SUBJECT_ID, and PR_MTS_SUBJECT_ID properties from identifiers in the original message. (PR_FOREIGN_SUBJECT_ID could also be assigned from the foreign report if the report carries such information.)</li>
<li>
The gateway report’s PR_FOREIGN_REPORT_ID is assigned from the foreign report’s report ID.</li>
</ol>
