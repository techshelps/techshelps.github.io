<h3><a name="_splus_timefmt"></a>TIMEFMT</h3>
<p>
The TIMEFMT property specifies a format for printing the time. A separator string can also be defined to separate the time from any following text, such as appointment text. The format for this property is:</p>
<pre><code>TIME {number}, {separator string}
 </code></pre>
<p>
The different time formats are specified by consecutive integers starting at 0. The integers specifying a time format are as follows.</p>
<table cellspacing=4 cols=2>
<tr valign=top>
<th align=left width=34%>Integer</th>
<th align=left width=66%>Value</th>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=34%>0 (default)</td>
<td width=66%>Standard (3:45 <small>p.m.</small> or 15:45 hrs)<p>
This is the time format specified in the Windows Control Panel.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=34%>1</td>
<td width=66%>Standard No Trailer (3:45 or 15:45)<p>
This format also uses the Windows Control Panel, but does not apply the trailers.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=34%>2</td>
<td width=66%>Modified Standard (Vanishing trailer)<p>
In this format, the object keeps track of the times it has already printed. It prints a trailer only for the first <small>a.m.</small> and first P.M. appointments it prints in 12-hour mode, or for the first appointment only in 24-hour mode.</p>
<p>
For example, in a list of appointments, if you have appointments at 8 A.M., 9 A.M., 10 A.M., 11 A.M., 12 P.M. and 1 P.M., the times are printed as: 8 A.M., 9, 10, 11, 12 P.M., and 1.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=34%>3</td>
<td width=66%>Hour Only (3 or 15)<p>
This format always prints the number associated with the hour (3:45 appears as 3).</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=34%>4</td>
<td width=66%>Hour only when minutes != 0 ( 3:45 or 15:45)<p>
This format prints the hour only when the minutes are zero, and the full time otherwise (3:45 appears as 3:45, but 4:00 appears as 4).</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table><br>
<p>
Formats 3 and 4 are space savers. If necessary, you can limit the amount of space taken up by the time to leave more space for text.</p>
