<h3><a name="_edk_about_agents"></a>About Agents</h3>
<p>
An agent maps a folder, one or more events, and the code (usually in a script) that processes those events. There are two types of agents: 
<ul>
<li>
A script, combined with the Microsoft Exchange Scripting Agent and a folder in which events are monitored</li>
<li>
<a href="events_8gkz.htm">Custom agents</a></li>
</ul>
<p>
An agent is like a <a href="glossary_1ooi.htm#_edk_rule">rule</a> in that is has these characteristics:
<ul>
<li>
It is tied to a specific folder.</li>
<li>
It runs when a certain event triggers it, such as when a message with specific properties appears in that folder.</li>
<li>
It has specific behavior.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Agents differ from rules in that, while any Microsoft Exchange recipient can set a rule, you need special folder permissions to set up agents. For information on creating agents, see <a href="events_9beb.htm">Configuring Events and Actions</a>.</p>
<h4>About the Microsoft Exchange Scripting Agent</h4>
<p>
The Microsoft Exchange Scripting Agent is an agent that runs folder-resident scripts and provides CDO session, folder, and message objects to the script. It can work in conjunction with Microsoft Transaction Server. This is the default agent installed as part of Microsoft Exchange setup. </p>
