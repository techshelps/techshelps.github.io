<h2><a name="_gdk_installing_addressing"></a>Installing Addressing</h2>
<p>
A customer may want to install the gateway’s addressing separate from installing the gateway. For example, suppose the customer has installed a gateway on site A, but not on site B. The two sites are connected by a site connector. Messages from site B that are addressed to recipients served by the gateway are routed to site A and pass through the gateway. Therefore, the customer will install the gateway addressing on site B, even though the gateway itself is not installed there. To allow this kind of routing, the customer would need to install the Addr-Type object, proxy generation DLL, and optionally the Administrator extension DLL on every site that uses the site A gateway. Your setup program should allow for this.</p>
