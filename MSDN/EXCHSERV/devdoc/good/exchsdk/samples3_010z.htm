<p>
By default, the mailbox agent itself is set as the owner of all <a href="glossary_1oo6.htm#_edk_folder">folders</a> and files associated with SMBAGENT, and will have owner access to all files. Additional logons can be granted access as owner or administrator. Default user rights (which apply to any user who is not specifically granted another access) are set to the rights associated with the Reviewer role, that is, to ReadAny, which gives read permission to any message in the folder, but not edit, create, or delete access.</p>

<p>
As subfolders are created, the <a href="glossary_1oo1.htm#_edk_access_control_list_acl_">access control list (ACL)</a> created for the root folder is inherited by the subfolders. That is, all users explicitly granted permissions in the root folder also have these rights on the subfolders. An exception is the default user access permissions, which are always ReadAny for subfolders (although the default permission may be changed for the root folder).</p>
<p>
Changing default user access permissions is not recommended because problems multiply when users have Edit, Create, and Delete permissions to the folders and messages. Problems that may occur include the following:
<ul>
<li>
Folders created by any other means than through the <b>NEW</b> command will not have an associated Intro message and recipient list. These folders generate errors when messages are posted.</li>
<li>
Messages posted directly to the topic folder rather than through the <b>POST</b> command will not be delivered to other subscribers, and the other subscribers will not be notified of their presence.</li>
<li>
Deleted folders will cause general errors until the service is restarted or a new configuration is applied.</li>
<li>
Changing ACLs affects new folders and messages only. ACLs on existing folders and messages are not changed.</li>
</ul>
