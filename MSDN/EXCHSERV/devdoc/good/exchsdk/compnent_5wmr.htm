<h3><a name="_edk_rule_conditions"></a>Rule Conditions</h3>
<p>
Rule conditions are described in terms of MAPI SRestrictions. Rules are tested and fired in a sequence defined by the <a href="props4_5ehx.htm">PR_RULE_SEQUENCE</a> property. The Microsoft Exchange Client rule provider uses gaps between rules as a mechanism to allow rules to be reordered without replacing all the sequence numbers.This means that the sequence numbers need not be consecutive.</p>
<p>
An error will be returned by the <a href="intrface_1iw5.htm"><b>IExchangeModifyTable</b></a> interface when rules are saved if either of the following conditions exists:
<ul>
<li>
If an action cannot be carried out in the given context. For example, if a deferred action is requested on a public folder or if a move is requested to a folder that the information store cannot locate.</li>
<li>
If a condition is in error.</li>
</ul>
