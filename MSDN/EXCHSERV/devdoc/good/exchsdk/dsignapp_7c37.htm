<p>
The Migration Wizard can use three different types of addresses. For more information on the Migration Wizard, see the <i>Microsoft Exchange Server Migration Guide</i>.</p>
<h4>Display Name</h4>
<p>
The <a href="glossary_1oo4.htm#_edk_display_name">display name</a> is the friendly name of a recipient. Source extractors should convert message recipients, senders, and appointment attendees to display names. The Microsoft Exchange Client compares the display name with personal and <a href="glossary_1oo7.htm#_edk_global_address_list">global address list</a> entries. If it cannot find a match, it displays possible matches for the user to select from.</p>
<h4>E-Mail Address</h4>
<p>
Source extractors use unique identifiers to relate each mailbox or custom recipient in the existing system to each mailbox or custom recipient in Microsoft Exchange Server. These identifiers are known as source e-mail addresses<i> </i>and are stored in the following format: <i>Migrate:TYPE<b>:</b>address.</i></p>
<p>
This address is created in the directory section of the primary file and must be in a column with a header of secondary-proxy-addresses. You can remove the <i>Migrate</i> e-mail addresses after migration is complete.</p>
<p>
E-mail addresses are also used for <a href="glossary_1oog.htm#_edk_personal_address_book_pab_">personal address book (PAB)</a> entries. By default, the following address types are valid: MS, MSA, <a href="glossary_1ooo.htm#_edk_x.400">X400</a>, and <a href="glossary_1ooj.htm#_edk_simple_mail_transfer_protocol_smtp_">SMTP</a>. Other <a href="glossary_1oo7.htm#_edk_gateway">gateway</a> address types can be made available. Microsoft Exchange Server defines an address for a foreign system recipient in this format: <i>TYPE:address</i>. For example: <i>SMTP:alig@eur.fab.com</i> </p>
<p>
When extracting addresses from foreign systems, your source extractor must create a target address, or extract the address as a direct address.</p>
<p>
Also consider these PAB addressing issues:
<ul>
<li>
Do you remove addresses from mailboxes on the existing system? </li>
<li>
Do you change the display name to include the address? </li>
<li>
Do you change the addresses to route mail to the appropriate gateway?</li>
</ul>
<h4>Display Name with E-mail Address</h4>
<p>
The source extractor can use display names with e-mail addresses. Use this format only for addresses not in the Microsoft Exchange Server global address list. For example: Allison Klein[<i>SMTP:AKlein@eur.fab.com</i>].</p>
