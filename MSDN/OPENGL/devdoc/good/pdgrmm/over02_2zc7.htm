<h3><a name="_ogl_clipping"></a>Clipping</h3>
<p>
Clipping occurs in two steps: 
<ol>
<li>
<b>Application-specific clipping</b>. Immediately after primitives are assembled, they're clipped in eye coordinates as necessary for any clipping planes you've defined with <a href="glfunc01_9g11.htm"><b>glClipPlane</b></a>. (OpenGL requires support for at least six such application-specific clipping planes.)</li>
<li>
<b>View volume clipping</b>. Primitives are transformed by the projection matrix into clip coordinates and clipped by the corresponding view volume. This matrix can be controlled by the matrix transformation functions (see <a href="over02_8703.htm">Matrix Transformations</a>) but is typically specified by <a href="glfunc02_0oj1.htm"><b>glFrustum</b></a> or <a href="glfunc03_8qnj.htm"><b>glOrtho</b></a>.</li>
</ol>
<p>
Points, line segments, and polygons are handled differently during clipping: 
<ul>
<li>
Points are either retained in their original state (if they're inside the clip volume) or discarded (if they're outside the clip volume). </li>
<li>
If portions of line segments or polygons are outside the clip volume, new vertices are generated at the clip points. </li>
<li>
For polygons, an entire edge may need to be constructed between new vertices generated at the clip points. </li>
<li>
For line segments and polygons that are clipped, the edge flag, color, and texture information is assigned to all new vertices.</li>
</ul>
