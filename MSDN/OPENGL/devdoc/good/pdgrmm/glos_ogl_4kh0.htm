<a name="_ogl_gloss_ogl_depth"></a><b>depth</b></dt>
<dd>
Generally refers to the <i>z</i> window coordinate.</dd>
<dt>
<a name="_ogl_gloss_ogl_depth_cueing"></a><b>depth-cueing</b></dt>
<dd>
A rendering technique that assigns color based on distance from the viewpoint.</dd>
<dt>
<a name="_ogl_gloss_ogl_display_list"></a><b>display list</b></dt>
<dd>
A named list of OpenGL commands. Display lists are always stored on the server, so display lists can be used to reduce the network traffic in client/server environments. The contents of a display list may be preprocessed, and might therefore execute more efficiently than the same set of OpenGL commands executed in immediate mode. Such preprocessing is especially important for computing intensive commands such as <a href="glfunc03_16hw.htm"><b>glTexImage</b></a>.</dd>
<dt>
<a name="_ogl_gloss_ogl_dithering"></a><b>dithering</b></dt>
<dd>
A technique for increasing the perceived range of colors in an image at the cost of spatial resolution. Adjacent pixels are assigned differing color values. When viewed from a distance, these colors seem to blend into a single intermediate color. The technique is similar to the half-toning used in black-and-white publications to achieve shades of gray.</dd>
<dt>
<a name="_ogl_gloss_ogl_double_buffering"></a><b>double-buffering</b></dt>
<dd>
Using OpenGL contexts in which both front and back color buffers are double-buffered. Smooth animation is accomplished by rendering into only the back buffer (which isn't displayed), then causing the front and back buffers to be swapped. </dd>
