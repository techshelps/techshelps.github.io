<h2><a name="_olemsg_using_autocategory"></a>Using AutoCategory</h2>
<p>
In the following assignment, the AutoCategory script sets four keywords:</p>
<pre><code>searcharray = Array("TEST","DEBUG","ERROR", "INVENTORY")
</code></pre>
<p>
You can run this sample application using these keywords, or you can edit the script and replace them with others of your choosing. Because "keyword" is a field visible through Microsoft Outlook, you can create a view that displays keywords for messages, within a given folder. </p>
<h5><img src="../../images/wedge.gif" border=0>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To run AutoCategory</h5>
<ol>
<li>
Send or post a message to the folder in which the AutoCategory agent is installed, or change (and save) a message within that folder. If the message body contains one or more of the four keywords, the message's Keywords field is updated. </li>
<li>
To see the Keywords field, you need to modify your view to display keywords. To do this, first open the folder in which the AutoCategory agent is installed. Then, right-click the field bar and click <b>Field Chooser</b>. Now, click <b>All Document Fields</b>. Finally, drag the Keywords field onto the field bar. </li>
</ol>
<p>
At this point, this view will show the contents of the Keywords field of any message in this folder.</p>
<p>
<b>Note</b>  When the AutoCategory script finds a keyword in a message, it writes it into the keyword field of the message, automatically overwriting the previous contents of that field. For this reason, you cannot use more than one AutoCategory agent in a folder to search messages for different sets of keywords. In this case, whichever agent runs second would overwrite the output of the agent that ran first. </p>
<p>
To avoid this problem, you could consider changing each of these agents to append — not overwrite — its output to the keyword field. </p>
