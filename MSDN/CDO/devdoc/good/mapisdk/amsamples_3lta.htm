<p>
This sample application is intended to let users compose and respond to restaurant critiques. It shows how to create a discussion on your Web site with conversation threads stored in a Microsoft® Exchange public folder. You can provided a link to this discussion, which will then open within a frame on a multiframe page. This multiframe page can be your existing Web site. The file root.htm simulates this case with sample restaurant critiques. This sample application is built on the discussion forum sample application.</p>
<p>
This sample can be best utilized in conjunction with the Culinary Corner Microsoft Exchange public folder application available on http://www.microsoft.com/technet/appfarm. That sample application includes a PST (Personal Folder Store) file which you use in creating the Culinary Corner public folder on your Microsoft Exchange server. Among other things such as data (messages), the .PST file provides the views that the .asp version will read and apply. </p>
