<h1><a name="_olemsg_delete_method_folders_collection_"></a>Delete Method (Folders Collection)  <a href="oleobjaf_1nec.htm"><img src="images/group.gif" border=0></a></h1>
<p>
The <b>Delete</b> method removes all the <a href="oleobjaf_4u2c.htm">Folder</a> objects from the Folders collection. </p>
<h4>Syntax </h4>
<p>
<i>objFoldersColl</i>.<b>Delete( ) </b></p>
<h4>Remarks </h4>
<p>
The <b>Delete</b> method performs an irreversible operation on the collection. It calls <b>Release</b> on the collection's reference to every Folder object. If you have another reference to a folder, you can still access its properties and methods, but you can never again associate it with any collection because the <a href="oleobjaf_3uqn.htm"><b>Add</b></a> method always creates a new object. You should <b>Set</b> your reference variable either to <b>Nothing</b> or to another folder. </p>
<p>
The final <b>Release</b> on each Folder object takes place when you assign your reference variable to <b>Nothing</b>, or when you call <b>Delete</b> if you had no other reference. At this point the object is removed from memory. Attempted access to a released object results in an error return of <b>CdoE_INVALID_OBJECT</b>. </p>
<p>
Be cautious using the <b>Delete</b> method with a collection, because it deletes all the collection's member objects. To delete only one Folder object, use the <a href="oleobjaf_25zz.htm"><b>Delete</b></a> method specific to that object. </p>
<p>
The <b>Delete</b> method on a large collection takes effect immediately and is permanent. A deleted member cannot be recovered. However, the collection itself is still valid, and you can <a href="oleobjaf_3uqn.htm"><b>Add</b></a> new members to it. </p>
