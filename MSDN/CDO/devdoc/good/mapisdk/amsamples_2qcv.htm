<p>
Because it is a sample, this wizard does not do everything you might expect from a form-customization tool. Please consider the following items: 
<ul>
<li>
<b>Test, test, and test again</b>. There is wide variation between the HTML support available in the currently popular browsers. You are strongly encouraged to test your custom forms on the browsers your users will use. </li>
<li>
<b>Data validation</b>. This wizard does not perform explicit data validation on custom fields, nor inform users of errors. It will ensure that only correct data types are bound to the message, but will fail silently for invalid data, for example if you type "test" into a date field. </li>
<li>
<b>Full range of predefined fields</b>. The wizard focuses on allowing you to place custom fields on your forms, and does not include the full range of predefined fields present in the form designer of Microsoft Outlook. </li>
</ul>
