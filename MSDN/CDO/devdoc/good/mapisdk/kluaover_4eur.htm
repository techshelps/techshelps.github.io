<h3><a name="_olemsg_about_asp_files"></a>About ASP Files</h3>
<p>
Active Server Pages (.asp) files are standard HTML documents interlaced with ActiveX script code that calls specific Active Server components, such as CDO. </p>
<p>
The Microsoft Exchange Active Server components include a number of server-side scripts in .asp files. The scripting in these .asp files functions through calls to the interfaces in the CDO Library and the CDO Rendering Library. Active Server Pages processes these .asp files, and uses an <b>IStream</b> interface to send to the browser either generated HTML content or a new (changed) .asp file, which the browser interprets. </p>
<p>
Some .asp files are specific to <a href="msowa_0ppv.htm">Microsoft Outlook Web Access</a>, and others are useful for other ASP-based collaboration applications.</p>
<p>
Because .asp files are not compiled and the ASP source code for Web access to Microsoft Exchange Server is included, the source files for Microsoft Outlook Web Access can be used as sample code for building other applications or can be modified to customize its behavior, visual appearance, or functionality. Because Microsoft Exchange Active Server components are built on the Active Server platform using the <a href="kluaover_4l2r.htm">CDO libraries</a>, they illustrate how other collaborative Web applications can be created using CDO. </p>
<p>
For more information about customizing .asp files for use with Microsoft Exchange Server, see <a href="renoview_6vs7.htm">Overview of CDO<b> </b>Rendering</a>.</p>
