<h1><a name="_olemsg_delete_method_messages_collection"></a>Delete Method (Messages Collection)  <a href="oleobjis_1qd0.htm"><img src="images/group.gif" border=0></a></h1>
<p>
The <b>Delete</b> method removes all the <a href="oleobjaf_5flg.htm">AppointmentItem</a>, <a href="oleobjis_4kac.htm">MeetingItem</a>, <a href="oleobjis_852s.htm">GroupHeader</a>, and <a href="oleobjis_2p10.htm">Message</a> objects from the Messages collection. </p>
<h4>Syntax </h4>
<p>
<i>objMsgColl</i>.<b>Delete( ) </b></p>
<h4>Remarks </h4>
<p>
The <b>Delete</b> method performs an irreversible operation on the collection. It calls <b>Release</b> on the collection's reference to every AppointmentItem, GroupHeader, MeetingItem, and Message object. If you have another reference to an object, you can still access its properties and methods, but you can never again associate it with any collection because the <a href="oleobjis_2l66.htm"><b>Add</b></a> method always creates a new object. You should <b>Set</b> your reference variable either to <b>Nothing</b> or to another object. </p>
<p>
The final <b>Release</b> on each AppointmentItem, GroupHeader, MeetingItem, or Message object takes place when you assign your reference variable to <b>Nothing</b>, or when you call <b>Delete</b> if you had no other reference. At this point the object is removed from memory. Attempted access to a released object results in an error return of <b>CdoE_INVALID_OBJECT</b>. </p>
<p>
The <b>Delete</b> method does not move any MeetingItem or Message objects to the Deleted Items folder. If this folder exists and you wish this functionality, you must specifically program your application for it. </p>
<p>
If the Messages collection underlies a categorized view, the <a href="oleobjis_852s.htm">GroupHeader</a> objects are also removed from the collection, but unlike the messages they are not moved anywhere. Group headers do not persist in storage, and when the collection is released, whether with messages or not, the GroupHeader objects cease to exist. </p>
<p>
Be cautious using the <b>Delete</b> method with a collection, because it deletes all the collection's member objects. To delete only one Message object, use the <a href="oleobjis_410l.htm"><b>Delete</b></a> method specific to that object. </p>
<p>
The <b>Delete</b> method on a large collection takes effect immediately and is permanent. A deleted member cannot be recovered. However, the collection itself is still valid, and you can <a href="oleobjis_2l66.htm"><b>Add</b></a> new members to it. </p>
