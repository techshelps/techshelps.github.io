<p>
The <b>GetAssociatedAppointment</b> method returns an <a href="oleobjaf_5flg.htm">AppointmentItem</a> object associated with this meeting. </p>
<h4>Syntax </h4>
<p>
<b>Set </b><i>objAppoint = objMeeting</i>.<b>GetAssociatedAppointment( ) </b>
<dl>
<dt>
<i>objAppoint </i></dt>
<dd>
On successful return, contains the AppointmentItem object associated with this meeting. </dd>
<dt>
<i>objMeeting </i></dt>
<dd>
Required. This MeetingItem object. 
</dd>
</dl>
<h4>Remarks </h4>
<p>
When you receive a MeetingItem object representing a meeting request, you can call its <b>GetAssociatedAppointment</b> method to obtain an <a href="oleobjaf_5flg.htm">AppointmentItem</a> object associated with the meeting request. This AppointmentItem is not the same object as the original AppointmentItem belonging to the meeting's <a href="oleobjaf_6hnj.htm"><b>Organizer</b></a>, nor is it the same as an AppointmentItem obtained by any other recipient of the meeting request. Only the organizer can access the original AppointmentItem object. </p>
<p>
The AppointmentItem as returned by <b>GetAssociatedAppointment</b> has the same property settings as the original, but you can change them as necessary. This does not affect any corresponding settings in the original AppointmentItem, or in any other recipient's associated AppointmentItem. Your AppointmentItem object is saved in your active calendar folder when you call its <a href="oleobjis_3wh1.htm"><b>Update</b></a> method. </p>
<p>
If the meeting request is a meeting cancellation, that is, if its associated appointment's <a href="oleobjaf_1e8v.htm"><b>MeetingStatus</b></a> property contains <b>CdoMeetingCanceled</b>, and you never received the original meeting request, <b>GetAssociatedAppointment</b> returns <b>CdoE_NOT_FOUND</b>. This behavior is compatible with Microsoft Schedule+ but not with Microsoft Outlook, which creates a tentative appointment in the calendar and brings up a form that asks the user to cancel this tentative appointment. </p>
<p>
CDO automatically creates and saves an associated AppointmentItem for you if you call the MeetingItem object's <a href="oleobjaf_1iov.htm"><b>Respond</b></a> method with the <i>RespondType</i> parameter set to <b>CdoResponseAccepted</b> or <b>CdoResponseTentative</b>. Regardless of how the associated AppointmentItem is created, you are responsible for deleting it when you are finished with it, even if you subsequently decline the meeting request by calling <b>Respond</b> with <i>RespondType</i> set to <b>CdoResponseDeclined</b>. </p>
<p>
If the meeting's organizer has sent an updated meeting request since you accepted the first request, CDO considers the existing AppointmentItem object in your calender folder to be out of date. When you call <b>GetAssociatedAppointment</b>, the existing appointment is deleted from your calendar folder, and <b>GetAssociatedAppointment</b> returns a new, updated AppointmentItem object. However, this new appointment is not stored in your calendar folder until you call its <a href="oleobjis_3wh1.htm"><b>Update</b></a> method. </p>
<p>
You can work directly with the <a href="oleobjaf_5flg.htm">AppointmentItem</a> object to access its specifications and respond to it. The appointment returned by <b>GetAssociatedAppointment</b> is the only AppointmentItem object on which you can call the <a href="oleobjaf_1iov.htm"><b>Respond</b></a> method. </p>
