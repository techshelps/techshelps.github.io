This sample application includes the following files:</p>
<table cellspacing=4 cols=2>
<tr valign=top>
<th align=left width=25%>File</th>
<th align=left width=75%>Purpose</th>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=25%>amprops.inc</td>
<td width=75%>Defines common CDO constants and properties.</td>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=25%><a href="amsamples_90f7.htm">anlogon.inc</a></td>
<td width=75%>Contains all of the Microsoft® Visual Basic® Scripting Edition (VBScript) code necessary to log on anonymously (create and check a CDO session), and find any published public folders.</td>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=25%>compose.asp</td>
<td width=75%>When the user clicks <b>Post New Item</b> or <b>Reply</b>, compose.asp displays a form (a new browser instance) to write a message in and then creates the message in the discussion folder. If the user is replying to a message, the form fields are preloaded with data from the original message.</td>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=25%>discroot.asp</td>
<td width=75%>The root frame for the discussion. Called from root.htm, this file calls title.asp and folder.asp to display the discussion content. This file also contains several JavaScript functions called by the browser on events in title.asp and folder.asp.</td>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=25%>existing.htm</td>
<td width=75%>This is a placeholder for your existing Web site. It is displayed at the top of your browser window. It contains links to two discussions.</td>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=25%><a href="amsamples_2lrk.htm">folder.asp</a></td>
<td width=75%>Folder.asp calls functions in folder.inc to set the renderer and to render views of folders. It displays a page of messages (25 lines at a time). The format depends on the view selected. Each message provides a link to read.asp to allow that message to be read.</td>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=25%>folder.inc</td>
<td width=75%>This include file contains most of the code specific to the CDO Rendering Library. Rendering objects are created and set up here; folder views, current folder, and the current page are set here. The folder.inc file contains functions for generating a renderer. </td>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=25%><a href="amsamples_43vl.htm">global.asa</a></td>
<td width=75%>Performs Active Server startup and shutdown functions, including impersonation to validate the user.  </td>
</tr>

<td width=75%>This script processes next/previous message requests.</td>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>

<td width=75%>Sets strings and error messages. Concentrating these in a single include file eases localization.</td>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=25%>read.asp</td>
<td width=75%>This script opens and displays the contents of a message (in a new browser instance) when you click a link to open the message. It contains controls for closing the message, going to the next or previous message, and replying to the message.</td>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=25%>root.htm</td>
<td width=75%>This is a placeholder for your existing Web site. It shows how to link to discussion scripts and how to set them to open a specific folder. This file simulates existing content (discussion threads), and it creates a frameset for the menu (existing.htm) and diskroot.asp. </td>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=25%>title.asp</td>
<td width=75%>This is a control bar containing JavaScript controls for setting the view, refreshing the screen, paging through messages, and launching compose.asp (through a link).</td>
