<h2><a name="_olemsg_mapi_programming_interfaces"></a>MAPI Programming Interfaces</h2>
<p>
Microsoft provides several programming interfaces for MAPI, so that developers working in a wide variety of development environments can use this common message exchange. </p>
<p>
The following figure shows the CDO Library as a layer that is built on top of MAPI. This is similar to the way function calls to the Common Messaging Calls (CMC) interface are mapped to the underlying MAPI interfaces. It also demonstrates that the CDO Library is available to all the concerned languages, namely Microsoft® Visual Basic®, Visual Basic for Applications, and C/C++.</p>
<p>

<p>
It is important to recognize that the CDO Library does not offer access to all of the features of MAPI. In particular, it is designed primarily for clients and is not suitable for service providers. </p>
<p>
The following table summarizes the programming interfaces that Microsoft provides for MAPI. </p>
