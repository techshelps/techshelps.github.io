<h5><img src="../../images/wedge.gif" border=0>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To run Organization Chart</h5>
<ol>
<li>
Start Organization Chart. You are logged on anonymously. The file jamorgchart.htm displays an HTML form requesting information about the employee you are seeking: either an e-mail name or the person's first or last name. On this screen, you can also choose between two different implementations of Organization Chart: Java or HTML. </li>
<li>
Enter search information about an employee, and click <b>Search</b>. You can use partial search here. This means that you can search using initial letters of the person's first or last name. Partial search is not available when searching by e-mail name. </li>
<li>
When the employee is found, information is extracted from that person's address entry in the Microsoft Exchange address book and displayed. This includes the person's e-mail name, full name, title, office number, and telephone number. This information appears in a box that is positioned in a tree structure along with other boxes showing that person's manager and direct reports.</li>
<li>
To change the view to focus on the person's manager or a direct report, click the box displaying the other person's information. </li>
</ol>
