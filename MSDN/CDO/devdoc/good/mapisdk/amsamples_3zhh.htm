<p>
With the Microsoft® Exchange Form Design Wizard you can quickly create customized HTML forms based on the built-in forms included with Microsoft® Outlook™ Web Access. Additional layout and formatting enhancements can then be done in an HTML/ASP editor such as Microsoft® FrontPage®. Additional scripting enhancements can be done with a script editor such as Microsoft® Visual InterDev™.</p>
<p>
The following types of form are supported by the wizard: 
<ul>
<li>
Forms used to post information directly to public folders (based on the item type IPM.Post) </li>
<li>
Forms used to send information to other recipients (based on the item type IPM.Note) </li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p></body>
