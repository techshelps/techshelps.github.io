<h1><a name="_olemsg_handling_multiple_languages"></a>Handling Multiple Languages</h1>
<p>
Microsoft® Outlook™ Web Access handles the rendering of different languages in the following way: 
<ul>
<li>
Scripts for all languages are installed under the same virtual root (typically //&lt;server&gt;/exchange), in a separate directory for each language. See the illustration in <a href="msowa_32hx.htm">Directory Structure</a>, which shows directories for German (Ger) and Japanese (Jpn) as well as USA-English (usa). Additional language packs can be obtained to support other languages.</li>
<li>
An Internet Server API (<a href="olegloss_48ix.htm#_olemsg_isapi_gly">ISAPI</a>) filter, ExchFilt.dll, is installed. This filter examines all incoming URLs. If a URL is for one of the applications defined in \\HKLU\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\MSExchangeWeb\Applications (Microsoft® Exchange Server is defined by default, but any application can be added to this list), the filter will:<ol>
<li>
Examine the AcceptLanguage header from the browser. (The AcceptLanguage is the language stated to be preferred by a given browser.)</li>
<li>
Look up the header using the table laid out in \\HKLU\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\MSExchangeWeb\AcceptLanguages.</li>
<li>
Insert the directory name into the URL after the application name.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
For example, if you have a browser that prefers USA-English, //MyServer/Exchange/logon.asp becomes //MyServer/Exchange/USA/logon.asp.</p>
<p>
This process enables a Web browser being used with Microsoft Exchange Active Server components to run the set of scripts most suitable for a particular user's language. In the case where a particular language is not installed, the default will be the language of the Microsoft Exchange Server computer.</p>
<p>
Note that code page and locale are also defined in these registry settings and can be used to refine support for specific sublanguages.  </p>
