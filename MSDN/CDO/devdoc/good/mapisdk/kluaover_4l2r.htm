<h1><a name="_olemsg_about_the_cdo_libraries"></a>About the CDO Libraries</h1>
<p>
The CDO and CDO Rendering libraries are used for building collaborative Web server applications on Microsoft® Exchange Server. The CDO Library can be used to build both client and server applications, but the CDO Rendering Library can be used only for server applications. </p>
<p>
The CDO libraries can be called from Microsoft® Visual Basic® or Visual Basic Scripting Edition (VBScript), Microsoft® JScript™, Javascript, Java, and any application that supports Visual Basic for Applications such as Microsoft® Office.</p>
<p>
These libraries are used by the following classes of applications: 
<ul>
<li>
Server applications integrated with Active Server Pages and a browser to provide Web access to client features, namely mailboxes, and public folders. </li>
<li>
Client applications for client-side scripting. In this case, the CDO libraries are not used with Active Server Pages. </li>
</ul>
<p>
<b>Note</b>  Scripts can be run on the server or on the client. The .asp files for Microsoft® Outlook™ Web Access include scripts written in VBScript and executed by Microsoft® Internet Information Server (IIS); client-side scripts are written in VBScript, JScript, or JavaScript and executed by the browser. </p>
<p>
These are the two CDO libraries:
<ul>
<li>
<b>CDO Library</b>  This library lets you add to your application the ability to send and receive mail messages and to interact with folders and address books. You can create programmable messaging objects, then use their properties and methods to meet the needs of your application.</li>
<li>
<b>CDO Rendering Library</b>  This library is used to <a href="olegloss_48j6.htm#_olemsg_rendering_gly">render</a> CDO objects and collections in HTML for use on the World Wide Web. </li>
</ul>
<p>
<b>Note</b>  If your purpose is to run on a Web server to expose content to the Internet, you need a computer running IIS to work with the CDO libraries. However, you can use the CDO Library alone on the client (or on the server) as a scripting library. In this case, it is used as a general-purpose library, and IIS is not required. </p>
