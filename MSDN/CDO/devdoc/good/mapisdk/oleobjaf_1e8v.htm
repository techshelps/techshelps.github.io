The <b>MeetingStatus</b> property returns or sets the overall meeting status of this appointment. Read/write. </p>
<h4>Syntax </h4>
<p>
<i>objAppointment</i>.<b>MeetingStatus </b></p>
<h4>Data Type </h4>
<p>
Long </p>
<h4>Remarks </h4>
<p>
The <b>MeetingStatus</b> property is used to indicate whether this appointment represents a meeting, and if so, what its status is. </p>
<p>
<b>MeetingStatus</b> can have exactly one of the following values: </p>
<table cellspacing=4 cols=3>
<tr valign=top>

<p>
When an AppointmentItem object is first created, its <b>MeetingStatus</b> property contains <b>CdoNonMeeting</b>. The appointment becomes a meeting when you set <b>MeetingStatus</b> to <b>CdoMeeting</b> and <a href="oleobjis_2un9.htm"><b>Send</b></a> it to one or more recipients. This creates a <a href="oleobjis_4kac.htm">MeetingItem</a> object for the meeting and identifies you as the <a href="oleobjaf_6hnj.htm"><b>Organizer</b></a>. The meeting request is usually in your Sent Items folder, and the meeting responses from the recipients appear in your Inbox. </p>
<p>
You should not send a meeting request to any recipient that represents a distribution list, because the status of its individual members cannot be returned to you. You should only send the meeting request to single messaging users. You can determine if a messaging user is a distribution list by checking the <a href="oleobjaf_2kxl.htm"><b>DisplayType</b></a> property of the <a href="oleobjaf_6n1w.htm">AddressEntry</a> object representing that user. </p>
<p>
To cancel a meeting, you set the <b>MeetingStatus</b> property to <b>CdoMeetingCanceled</b> and send it to all the recipients. Once you have sent the cancellation you can release the underlying AppointmentItem object, typically by using the <b>Set</b> statement to assign it to <b>Nothing</b>. Note that simply releasing the appointment does not cancel the meeting, and in fact can produce unexpected behavior. Only the organizer of a meeting can cancel or release it. </p>
<p>
If you organize and then cancel a meeting when your active calendar store is Microsoft® Outlook™, you must not only release the underlying AppointmentItem object but <a href="oleobjis_410l.htm"><b>Delete</b></a> it from the Messages collection as well. Failure to do this could cause unexpected results when working with the folders and their contents. </p>
<p>
Before you call the appointment's <a href="oleobjis_2un9.htm"><b>Send</b></a> method, you must set <b>MeetingStatus</b> to <b>CdoMeeting</b> or <b>CdoMeetingCanceled</b>. If <b>MeetingStatus</b> contains any other value or is not set, <b>Send</b> returns <b>CdoE_NO_SUPPORT</b>. </p>
<p>
Changes you make to properties on an AppointmentItem object take effect when you call the <a href="oleobjis_2un9.htm"><b>Send</b></a> or <a href="oleobjis_3wh1.htm"><b>Update</b></a> method. </p>
