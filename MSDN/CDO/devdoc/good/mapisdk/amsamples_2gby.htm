<h1><a name="_olemsg_job_candidates_sample_application"></a>Job Candidates Sample Application</h1>
<p>
The Job Candidates sample application uses Active Server Pages (ASP) files to present a system for organizing candidates for employment. </p>
<p>
Using this sample application, you can store information about a candidate such as personal contact information, job history, resume, and the title of the position the candidate is seeking. Using a browser, you can enter data about new candidates and update present candidates. If you have Microsoft® Outlook™ or another e-mail client installed, you can also schedule interviews for the candidate. </p>
<p>
The fact that this is an ASP sample application means that all processing takes place on the server. This is beneficial in that the resulting pages are sent to the client as browser-independent HTML.</p>
