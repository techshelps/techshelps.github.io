<h1><a name="_olemsg_delete_method_addressentries_collection_"></a>Delete Method (AddressEntries Collection)  <a href="oleobjaf_7qd0.htm"><img src="images/group.gif" border=0></a></h1>
<p>
The <b>Delete</b> method removes all the <a href="oleobjaf_6n1w.htm">AddressEntry</a> objects from the AddressEntries collection. </p>
<h4>Syntax </h4>
<p>
<i>objAddrEntriesColl</i>.<b>Delete( ) </b></p>
<h4>Remarks </h4>
<p>
The <b>Delete</b> method performs an irreversible operation on the collection. It calls <b>Release</b> on the collection's reference to every AddressEntry object. If you have another reference to an address entry, you can still access its properties and methods, but you can never again associate it with any collection because the <a href="oleobjaf_0j1b.htm"><b>Add</b></a> method always creates a new object. You should <b>Set</b> your reference variable either to <b>Nothing</b> or to another address entry. </p>
<p>
The final <b>Release</b> on each AddressEntry object takes place when you assign your reference variable to <b>Nothing</b>, or when you call <b>Delete</b> if you had no other reference. At this point the object is removed from memory. Attempted access to a released object results in an error return of <b>CdoE_INVALID_OBJECT</b>. </p>
<p>
Be cautious using the <b>Delete</b> method with a collection, because it deletes all the collection's member objects. To delete only one AddressEntry object, use the <a href="oleobjaf_9reh.htm"><b>Delete</b></a> method specific to that object. </p>
<p>
The <b>Delete</b> method on a large collection takes effect immediately and is permanent. A deleted member cannot be recovered. However, the collection itself is still valid, and you can <a href="oleobjaf_0j1b.htm"><b>Add</b></a> new members to it. </p>
<p>
The CDO Library does not support addition, deletion, or modification of members of a distribution list (DL) on the global address list (GAL). </p>
