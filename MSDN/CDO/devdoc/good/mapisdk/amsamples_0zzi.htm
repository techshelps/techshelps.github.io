<h1><a name="_olemsg_discussion_forum_sample_application"></a>Discussion Forum Sample Application</h1>
<p>
This is a Web-site-based discussion forum. Content is hosted in a Microsoft® Exchange public folder; the discussion is rendered under a single frame that appears as a frame on your Web site. This means you can use this sample as a template for a discussion forum on your own Web site with conversation threads stored in a Microsoft Exchange public folder. </p>
<p>
This sample application uses the anonymous logon sample, and extends it in a practical way that demonstrates how to make use of discussion services of Microsoft Exchange Server for the benefit of http/browser users. </p>
<p>
This sample application constitutes the basis for all the peer-to-peer discussion groups hosted on http://www.exchangeserver.com, as well as the Application Design Discussion on the Microsoft Exchange Application Farm (http://www.microsoft.com/technet/appfarm). </p>
