The wizard offers you a choice between deploying to the Web using Web Publishing technology, or deploying to floppies or a directory on a local or network drive.</p>
<h2>Deploying to Floppy Disks, Directories, and CDs</h2>
<p>
You can deploy to floppy disks using the Package and Deployment Wizard only if you have created a standard package using the Multiple Cabs option. This options ensures that your package consists of multiple .cab files or of a single .cab that is smaller than the size of a disk. The system gives you the option of formatting each disk before you copy your .cab files to it. You do not have to format the disk, but you must use empty disks for this deployment process.</p>
<p>
If you choose to deploy to a directory, the system prompts you to pick a local or network directory into which your files will be copied. You can then either direct your users to access the setup program for your application from that location, or you can move your files onto CD-ROMs.</p>
<p class=indent>
<B><b>Note</b></B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you have a writeable CD drive, you may be able to copy your files directly to that drive using the deployment portion of the wizard, rather than deploying to a directories and then copying the files to your CDs.</p>
<h2>Deploying to the Web</h2>
<p>
You can deploy any package, whether it is a standard or Internet package, to the Web. When you choose Web Publishing as your deployment method, the system considers the project folder to be the <i>local base folder</i> for your deployment. The local base folder is used to determine how files and directories should be copied to the Web site you choose. Files and directories that are within the local base directory will be deployed to the Web server with the same directory structure as the base directory.</p>
<p class=indent>
<B><b>Note</b></B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By default, the wizard does not deploy source files from within the project directory or the \Support subdirectory. The packaging portion of the wizard creates the \Support directory and places files in it that can be used to recreate your .cab files.</p>
