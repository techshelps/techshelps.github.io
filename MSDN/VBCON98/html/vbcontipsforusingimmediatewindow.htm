Here are some shortcuts you can use in the Immediate window:
<ul type=disc>
<li>
You can use Data Tips to inspect the value of a variable or object. Data Tips are similar to ToolTips except that they display the current value when the mouse is held over a variable or object property in the Code Window in Break mode. The display of Data Tips is limited to variables and objects that are currently in scope.<br><br></li>
<li>
Data Tips are also available in the Immediate window in Break mode. Unlike the Code Editor, the Immediate window will display values for object properties regardless of scope if a fully qualified object name is provided. For example, a Data Tip would always be displayed for Form1.Text1.Width, but not for Text1.Width unless Text1 was currently in scope.<br><br></li>
<li>
Once you enter a statement, you can execute it again by moving the insertion point back to that statement and pressing ENTER anywhere on the line.<br><br></li>
<li>
Before pressing ENTER, you can edit the current statement to alter its effects.<br><br></li>
<li>
You can use the mouse or the arrow keys to move around in the Immediate window. Don't press ENTER unless you are at a statement you want to execute.<br><br></li>
<li>
CTRL+HOME will take you to the top of the Immediate window; CTRL+END will take you to the bottom.<br><br></li>
<li>
The HOME and END keys move to the beginning and end of the current line.</li>
</ul>

<B><b>Note</b></B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although you will primarily use the Immediate window in Break mode, it is also possible to use the Immediate window in Design mode. This capability is provided in order to debug ActiveX components within the design environment. Using the Immediate window at Design time for a Standard project type may cause unexpected results.</p>
