<p>
Sometimes you need to force the remote query processor to execute the query. As discussed in "Managing DAO ODBC Connections with Jet," earlier in this chapter, opening a Database object directly can be very costly in time and network traffic because the structure of the remote database and its tables must be determined by sending a number of queries to the remote database.</p>
<p>
In cases where you must use remote database-specific SQL syntax, or you want to use the remote database engine's query processor, you must bypass the Jet query processor by using the <b><i>dbSQLPassthrough</i></b> option with the DAO Execute or OpenRecordset methods. It is also possible to create DAO QueryDef objects that bypass the Jet query processor.</p>
<p>
To use QueryDef objects, your application will need access to a Jet .mdb database. There are two kinds of QueryDef objects:
<ul type=disc>
<li>
QueryDef objects used for pass-through queries, which use the server’s syntax and can’t refer to attached tables.<br><br></li>
<li>
QueryDef objects used for non-pass-through queries, which use attached tables and attempt to translate and send as much of the query to the server as possible.</li>
</ul>
