<p>
When you work in the Package and Deployment Wizard, you can create and store scripts. A <i>script</i> is a record of the selections you made in a packaging or deployment session. Creating a script retains these selections so that you can apply them to future sessions in the wizard for the same project. Using scripts can save you significant time in your packaging and deployment sessions. In addition, you can use scripts to package and deploy your applications in silent mode.</p>
<p>
Each time you package or deploy a project, Visual Basic stores information about that session as a script. All scripts for a project are stored in a special file within the application's project directory. You can view the full list of scripts for the current project by using the Manage Scripts option in the Package and Deployment Wizard. This option lets you:
<ul type=disc>
<li>
View a list of all packaging or deployment scripts.<br><br></li>
<li>
Rename a script.<br><br></li>
<li>
Create a copy of a script with a new name.<br><br></li>
<li>
Delete a script that you no longer need.</li>
</ul>
<p class=indent>
<B><b>Caution</b></B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you remove a packaging script, the deployment portion of the Package and Deployment Wizard will no longer recognize the package created from that script as one that it can deploy. You will then have to repackage the file in order to be able to deploy it. Delete only those scripts you are certain you no longer need.</p>
<p class=label>
<b>To view a list of scripts</b>
<ol>
<li>
Start the wizard, and then select <b>Manage Scripts </b>from the main screen.<p class=atl>
<B><b>Important</b></B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you have started the wizard as a stand-alone application, you must choose the Visual Basic project you want before selecting Manage Scripts.</p></li>
<li>
Choose the appropriate panel for the scripts you want to view.</li>
</ol>
