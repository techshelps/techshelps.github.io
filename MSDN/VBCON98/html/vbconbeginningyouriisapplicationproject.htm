<p>
When you begin an IIS application, you select a special type of project called an IIS Application. An <i>IIS Application </i>project<i> </i>is an ActiveX DLL project type that automatically includes an instance of the appropriate ActiveX designer. The designer, called a <i>WebClass object</i>, acts as the base on which you create your application.</p>
<p>
The Webclass designer corresponds to a single webclass in your application, but it can contain multiple HTML templates and webitems. If you want to include more than one webclass in your application, you can insert additional designers into your project.</p>
<p>
There are several properties that you should always set for the webclass.
<ul type=disc>
<li>
<b>StateManagement</b> — This property, available for the webclass object in the Properties window, determines whether your webclass stays alive between browser requests or is destroyed at the completion of each request.<br><br></li>
<li>
<b>Public</b> — Your webclass must be set to public in order for the application to run. This is controlled by the Public property, available for the webclass object in the Properties window. By default, the Public property is set to True.<br><br></li>
<li>
<b>Unattended Execution</b> — This option, available in the Project Properties dialog box for your IIS applications, allows instances of a DLL class to be allocated on any thread. This ability is necessary to IIS in order to avoid having all webclass instances allocated to a single thread.<br><br></li>
<li>
<b>Retained in Memory</b> — This option, available in the Project Properties dialog box for your IIS applications, allows the Visual Basic project to keep its run-time support state permanently loaded on the server's threads, allowing server programs that load Visual Basic projects to run significantly faster.</li>
</ul>
<p class=label>
<b>To begin your IIS application</b>
<ol>
<li>
Start a new project and select <b>IIS Application</b> as your project type.<br><br></li>
<li>
In the Project Explorer window, open the Designers folder, then double-click on the designer to display it in the main window.</li>
</ol>
<p class=label>
<b>To add additional webclass designers to your project</b>
<ul type=disc>
<li>
On the <b>Project</b> menu, click <b>Add Webclass</b> and Visual Basic adds it to your project.<p class=atl>
<B><b>Note</b></B> &nbsp; The first four kinds of ActiveX designers loaded for a project are listed on the <b>Project</b> menu. If more than four designers are loaded, the later ones will be available from the <b>More ActiveX Designers</b> submenu on the <b>Project</b> menu. </p></li>
</ul>
<p>
<B><b>For More Information</b></B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See "State Management in IIS Applications" for more information on setting the StateManagement property for your webclass. Also see "Public Property" in the <i>Language Reference</i>.</p>
