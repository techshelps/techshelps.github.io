Keyboard events, along with mouse events, are the primary elements of a user's interaction with your program. Clicks and key presses trigger events and provide the means of data input and the basic forms of window and menu navigation.</p>
<p>
Although the operating system provides the seamless back-end for all these actions, it's sometimes useful or necessary to modify or enhance them. The KeyPress, KeyUp, and KeyDown events allow you to make these modifications and enhancements.</p>
<p>
Programming your application to respond to key events is referred to as writing a <i>keyboard handler.</i> A keyboard handler can work on two levels: at the control level and at the form level. The control level (<i>low-level </i>) handler allows you to program a specific control. For instance, you might want to convert all the typed text in a Textbox control to uppercase. A <i>form-level </i>handler allows the form to react to the key events first. The focus can then be shifted to a control or controls on the form, and the events can either be repeated or initiated.</p>
<p>
With these key events you can write code to handle most of the keys on a standard keyboard. For information on dealing with international character sets and keyboards, see "International Issues."</p>
