Printing is one of the most complex tasks a Windows – based application performs. Good results depend on all parts of the process working together. Poor results can arise from problems in your application, variations in printer drivers, or limited printer capabilities. Although it is a good idea to test your application with commonly used printers and printer drivers, you can’t test all the possible combinations users may have.</p>
<p>
Printing from your application involves these three components:
<ul type=disc>
<li>
The code in your application that starts the printing process.<br><br></li>
<li>
The printer drivers installed on both your system and the systems of users of your application.<br><br></li>
<li>
The capabilities of the printers available to users of your application.</li>
</ul>
<p>
The code in your application determines the type and quality of print output available from your application. But the users’ printer drivers and printers also impact print quality. This section deals with enabling printing from a Visual Basic application. For information on printing from the Visual Basic development environment, see "Printing Information in the Immediate Window" in "Debugging Your Code and Handling Errors. "</p>
