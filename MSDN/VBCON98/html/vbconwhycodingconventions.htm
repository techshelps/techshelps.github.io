<p>
The main reason for using a consistent set of coding conventions is to standardize the structure and coding style of an application so that you and others can easily read and understand the code.</p>
<p>
Good coding conventions result in precise, readable, and unambiguous source code that is consistent with other language conventions and as intuitive as possible.</p>
<h2>Minimal Coding Conventions</h2>
<p>
A general-purpose set of coding conventions should define the minimal requirements necessary to accomplish the purposes discussed above, leaving the programmer free to create the program’s logic and functional flow.</p>
<p>
The object is to make the program easy to read and understand without cramping the programmer’s natural creativity with excessive constraints and arbitrary restrictions.</p>
<p>
To this end, the conventions suggested in this appendix are brief and suggestive. They do not list every possible object or control, nor do they specify every type of informational comment that could be valuable. Depending on your project and your organization’s specific needs, you may wish to extend these guidelines to include additional elements, such as:
<ul type=disc>
<li>
Conventions for specific objects and components developed in-house or purchased from third-party vendors.<br><br></li>
<li>
Variables that describe your organization’s business activities or facilities.<br><br></li>
<li>
Any other elements that your project or enterprise considers important for clarity and readability.</li>
</ul>
