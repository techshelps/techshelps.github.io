If you've been using Windows-based applications for a while, you've probably noticed that not all user interfaces look or behave the same. There are two main styles of user interface: the <i>single-document interface</i> (<i>SDI</i>) and the <i>multiple-document interface</i> (<i>MDI</i>). An example of the SDI interface is the WordPad application included with Microsoft Windows (Figure 6.1). In WordPad, only a single document may be open; you must close one document in order to open another.</p>

Applications such as Microsoft Excel and Microsoft Word for Windows are MDI interfaces; they allow you to display multiple documents at the same time, with each document displayed in its own window (Figure 6.2). You can recognize a MDI application by the inclusion of a Window menu item with submenus for switching between windows or documents.</p>

<p>
In determining which interface style is best, you need to look at the purpose of the application. An application for processing insurance claims might lend itself to the MDI style — a clerk is likely to be working on more than one claim at a time or might need to compare two claims. On the other hand, a calendar application would be best suited to the SDI style — it's not likely that you would need more than one calendar open at a time; in the rare event that you did, you could open a second instance of the SDI application.</p>
<p>
The SDI style is the more common; most of the examples in the <i>Programmer's Guide</i> assume an SDI application. There are a number of considerations and techniques unique to creating MDI applications, which are addressed in "Multiple-Document Interface (MDI) Applications" later in this chapter.</p>
<p>
In addition to the two most common interface styles, SDI and MDI, a third interface style is becoming more popular: the <i>explorer-style</i> interface (Figure 6.3). The explorer-style interface is a single window containing two <i>panes </i>or regions, usually consisting of a tree or hierarchical view on the left and a display area on the right, as in the Microsoft Windows Explorer. This type of interface lends itself to navigating or browsing large numbers of documents, pictures, or files.</p>

In addition to the MDI and SDI application examples that accompany this chapter, the Application Wizard provides a good way to compare the different interface styles. You can use the Wizard to generate a framework for each style and view the forms and code that it generates.</p>

<b><B>For More Information</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>To learn more about MDI applications, see "Multiple-Document Interface (MDI) Applications." The basics of working with forms are covered in "Forms, Controls, and Menus." For information on accessing the Application Wizard, see "Using Wizards and Add-Ins" in "Managing Projects."</p>
