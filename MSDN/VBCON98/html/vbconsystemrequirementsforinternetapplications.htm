<p>
System requirements vary depending on whether you're developing DHTML applications or IIS applications.</p>
<h2>DHTML Application Requirements</h2>
<p>
System requirements for DHTML applications vary for the development computer and the end-user's computer.</p>
<h3>The Development Computer</h3>
<p>
In order to create and test client intranet applications, you must have Internet Explorer 4.01 Service Pack 1 or later installed on your computer. In addition, you may want the HTML editor of your choice and other programs you use to create Web pages, such as image editors, and any supplemental programs your DHTML application will use, such as database programs.</p>
<h3>The End-User Computer</h3>
<p>
End-users of a DHTML application must have Internet Explorer 4.0 or later. The first time end users download a DHTML application, they must download the Visual Basic run-time if it is not already on their computer. For subsequent applications, they do not need to download this file again. In addition, if the application uses ActiveX components, the end user must download those as well. You should be certain to include all necessary components in your download files.</p>
<h2>IIS Application Requirements</h2>
<p>
System requirements for IIS Applications vary for the development computer, the deployment computer, and the end-user's computer.</p>
<h3>The Development Computer</h3>
<p>
To create and test IIS applications, you need to have Internet Explorer 4.0 and a Web server installed on your development computer that is capable of running Active Server Pages. You can use any of the combinations in the table below for development purposes:</p>
<table border=1 cellpadding=5 cols=2 frame=below rules=rows>
<tr valign=top>
<td class=label width=50%><b>Operating System</b></td>
<td class=label width=50%><b>Web Server</b></td>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=50%>Windows NT Server<sup>®</sup> 4.0 or later</td>
<td width=50%>Internet Information Server 3.0 or later, with Active Server Pages</td>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=50%>Windows NT Workstation 4.0 or later</td>
<td width=50%>Peer Web Services 3.0 or later, with Active Server Pages</td>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=50%>Windows 95 or later</td>
<td width=50%>Personal Web Server 3.0 or later, with Active Server Pages</td>
</tr>
</table><br>
<p class=indent>
<B><b>Important</b></B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you are using Windows NT Server or Windows NT Workstation, you must have Service Pack 3.0 installed.</p>
<h3>The Deployment Computer</h3>
<p>
For deployment purposes, you must have Microsoft Internet Information Server, along with any supplemental system such as database applications that are needed by your application.</p>
<h3>The End-User Computer</h3>
<p>
End users of an IIS application must have a browser installed. Although Internet Explorer 4.0 or later is recommended, any browser can act as the front end of an IIS application.</p>
