<p>
When you no longer need access to the remote server, you should consider closing the connection with the Close method. While it does not always make sense to close a connection before an application is terminated, schemes used to maximize the number of simultaneous users connected to a system often close connections when they become idle or are no longer needed. These applications subsequently reopen the connections as required.</p>
<p>
When your connection is dropped, any instance-owned objects on the server are released. For example, server-side cursors or any objects created in <i>TempDB</i> are dropped by the server. If you must maintain access to these objects, you cannot close your connection.</p>
<p>
RDO does not manage connections for you in the sense that it does not cache recently closed connections in anticipation of their use at a later time. When you use the Close method to close a connection, or the last reference to an rdoConnection object goes out of scope, the connection is closed — permanently and immediately.</p>
