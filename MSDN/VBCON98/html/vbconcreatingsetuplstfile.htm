The Bootstrap Files and Setup1 Files sections of the Setup.lst file contain a complete list of the files that the setup programs (setup.exe and setup1.exe) need to install on the user's computer. Each file is listed individually, on its own line, and must use the following format:</p>
<p>
File<i>x</i><b>=</b><i> file</i>,<i>install</i>,<i>path</i>,<i>register</i>,<i>shared</i>,<i>date,size</i>[,<i>version</i>]</p>
<table border=1 cellpadding=5 cols=2 frame=below rules=rows>
<tr valign=top>
<td class=label width=21%><b>Part</b></td>
<td class=label width=79%><b>Meaning</b></td>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=21%>File<i>x</i></td>
<td width=79%>A keyword that must appear at the beginning of each line. <i>X</i> is a sequence number, starting at 1 in each section and moving in ascending order. You cannot skip values.</td>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=21%>File</td>
<td width=79%>The name of the file as it will appear after installation on the user's computer. This is usually the same as the Install argument. If you want this file to be extracted from a cab, place an @ at the beginning of the name (for example, @my.exe).</td>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=21%>Install</td>
<td width=79%>The name of the file as it appears on any distribution media.</td>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=21%>Path</td>
<td width=79%>The directory to which the file should be installed. Either an actual directory path, a macro indicating a user-specified path, or a combination of the two. See "Path Argument Macros in Setup.lst Files" later in this chapter for more information on the available macros.</td>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=21%>Register</td>
<td width=79%>A key that indicates how the file is to be included in the user's system registry. See "Registry Keys in Setup.lst Files" later in this chapter for more information.</td>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=21%>Shared</td>
<td width=79%>Specifies that the file should be installed as shared.</td>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=21%>Date</td>
<td width=79%>The last date on which the file was modified, as it would appear in Windows Explorer. This information helps you to verify that you have the correct versions of the files on the setup disks.</td>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=21%>Size</td>
<td width=79%>The file size as it would appear in Windows Explorer. The setup program uses this information to calculate how much disk space your application requires on the user's machine.</td>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=21%>Version</td>
<td width=79%>An optional internal version number of the file. Note that this is not necessarily the same number as the display version number you see by checking the file's properties.</td>
</tr>
