The FSO object model has these objects:</p>
<table border=1 cellpadding=5 cols=2 frame=below rules=rows>
<tr valign=top>
<td class=label width=22%><b>Object</b></td>
<td class=label width=78%><b>Description</b></td>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=22%>Drive</td>
<td width=78%>Allows you to gather information about drives attached to the system, such as how much room is available, what its share name is, and so forth. Note that a "drive" isn't necessarily a hard disk. It can be a CD-ROM drive, a RAM disk, and so forth. Also, drives aren't required to be physically attached to the system; they can be also be logically connected through a LAN.</td>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=22%>Folder</td>
<td width=78%>Allows you to create, delete, or move folders, plus query the system as to their names, paths, and so on.</td>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=22%>Files</td>
<td width=78%>Allows you to create, delete, or move files, plus query the system as to their names, paths, and so on.</td>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=22%>FileSystemObject</td>
<td width=78%>The main object of the group, full of methods that allow you to create, delete, gain information about, and generally manipulate drives, folders, and files. Many of the methods associated with this object duplicate those in the other objects.</td>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=22%>TextStream</td>
<td width=78%>Enables you to read and write text files.</td>
