Unless you're creating Visual Basic applications strictly for your own use, the value of your creations is going to be judged by others. The user interface of your application has the greatest impact on the user's opinion — no matter how technically brilliant or well optimized your code may be, if the user finds your application difficult to use, it won't be well received.</p>
<p>
As a programmer, you are undoubtedly familiar with the technological aspects of computers. It's easy to forget that most users don't understand (and probably don't care) about the technology behind an application. They see an application as a means to an end: a way to accomplish a task, ideally more easily than they would without the aid of a computer. A well-designed user interface insulates the user from the underlying technology, making it easy to perform the intended task.</p>
<p>
In designing the user interface for your application, you need to keep the user in mind. How easily can a user discover the various features of your application without instruction? How will your application respond when errors occur? What will you provide in terms of help or user assistance? Is the design aesthetically pleasing to the user? The answers to these and other questions relating to user-focused design are covered in this section.
