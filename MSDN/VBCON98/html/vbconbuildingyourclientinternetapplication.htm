<p>
DHTML applications are compiled the same way any Visual Basic project is compiled — by choosing Make from the File menu. A DHTML application must be built as an in-process component, or a DLL file.</p>
<h2>Project Files in DHTML Applications</h2>
<p>
Like standard Visual Basic projects, DHTML application projects have code modules and visual designers — in this case, the DHTML Page designer. Visual Basic creates a page designer for each HTML page in your application. For each page designer, Visual Basic stores the following:
<ul type=disc>
<li>
A .dsr file. <i>.Dsr files</i> are plain text files that contain the source code for the designer and references to the HTML pages they contain.<br><br></li>
<li>
A generated <i>.dsx file</i> that contains binary information about the designer.<br><br></li>
<li>
The HTML pages associated with an application are saved to the location you specify.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Any files associated with the HTML pages are also a part of your project, in that they must be deployed with the project. For example, if your HTML page references a series of images, the image files themselves must be deployed with the project. See "Deploying Your DHTML Application" later in this chapter for more information.</p>
<h2>Compiled Files in DHTML Applications</h2>
<p>
When you compile a DHTML application, Visual Basic creates a DLL containing the page designer and its code. The HTML pages and their associated files are stored separately from the DLL and must be deployed with it.</p>
<p>
During compile, Visual Basic creates several additional files. These include your project file, a .vbw file that contains layout information on your project, an .exp file, and a library file.</p>
<p class=label>
<b>To build your DHTML application</b>
<ol>
<li>
If the project is still in run mode, click the End button to return to design mode.<br><br></li>
<li>
Set the <b>BuildFile</b> property to the full path and file name to which you want to build the project.<p class=atl>
<B><b>Note</b></B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By default, the BuildFile property is set to the value of the SourceFile property.</p></li>
<li>
On the File menu, click <b>Make <i>Project</i>.dll</b> to open the <b>Make Project</b> dialog box. Click <b>OK</b> to make the DLL file.</li>
</ol>
