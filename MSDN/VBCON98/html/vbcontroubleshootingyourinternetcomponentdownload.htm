A few of the more common problems in Internet Component Download and their solutions are listed in this section. These include:
<ul type=disc>
<li>
You receive an error deleting or renaming the Visual Basic run-time library when simulating a clean machine.<br><br></li>
<li>
You receive the error message "The Dynamic Link Library could not be found in the specified path."<br><br></li>
<li>
You receive the error message "An error has occurred copying MSVBVM60.DLL. Ensure the location specified below is correct."<br><br></li>
<li>
Internet Explorer prompts "Opening file xxx.VBD. What would you like to do with this file? Open it or save to disk?"<br><br></li>
<li>
You receive the error message "Internet Explorer is opening a file of unknown type: xxx.VBD"</li>
</ul>
<h3>Errors Deleting or Renaming the Visual Basic Run Time</h3>
<p>
You can receive these errors when you attempt to rename or delete the Visual Basic runtime (MSVBVM60.DLL) when simulating a clean machine. In most cases, these errors occur because the file is in use. You cannot delete the Visual Basic runtime when Visual Basic is running. In addition, this error may occur if the browser is viewing an ActiveX document or has currently done so.</p>
<p>
To fix this error, close Visual Basic or close your browser and try to delete the file again.</p>
<h3>Error: "The Dynamic Link Library could not be found in the specified path."</h3>
<p>
This error generally occurs during testing when the ActiveX document you have been trying to download is still present on the machine.</p>
<p>
To fix this problem, delete the ActiveX document from either the OCCache folder or the Downloaded Program Files folder, then restart your download.</p>
<h3>Error: "An error has occurred copying Msvbvm60.dll. Ensure the location specified below is correct:"</h3>
<p>
This error typically occurs when there is insufficient disk space on the machine to which you are attempting to download. To fix this error, free up disk space and restart your download.</p>
<h3>Prompt: "Opening file <i>DocumentName</i>.VBD. What would you like to do with this file? Open it or save it to disk?</h3>
<p>
This error occurs when the Visual Basic runtime library (MSVBVM60.DLL) is not installed. Generally, this occurs when the safety level in Internet Explorer is set to High. To correct this, you must set the safety level in Internet Explorer to Medium or None.</p>
<h3>Error: "Internet Explorer is opening file of unknown type: <i>DocumentName</i>.VBD from…"</h3>
<p>
This error can occur when you download an ActiveX document. The most common of these are listed below, with information on how to solve the problem.</p>

Select "Download from alternate web site" from the File Source window when packaging your project in the Package and Deployment wizard and try your download again.</td>

Other solutions you can try include:
<ul type=disc>
<li>
Turn on version numbering in your ActiveX document project and put the version number in a field so it displays on the main form of your downloaded page. This lets you check to find out if your project downloaded or if you are seeing an older version.<br><br></li>
<li>
Always close and reopen the browser between download attempts to clear the cache.<br><br></li>
<li>
Make sure you are using the latest versions of the controls and DLLs that ship with Visual Basic in your ActiveX document.</li>
</ul>
