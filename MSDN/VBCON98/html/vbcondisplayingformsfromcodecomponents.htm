<p>
Code components can display modal or modeless forms, subject to certain restrictions.</p>
<h2>In-Process Components that Show Modeless Forms</h2>
<p>
Modeless forms displayed by in-process components cannot function correctly unless they can communicate with the client's message loop. Therefore, in-process components created with Visual Basic can display modeless forms only in client processes that support such communication.</p>
<p>
The following applications support the display of modeless forms by in-process components:
<ul type=disc>
<li>
Applications created with Visual Basic 5.0 or later.<br><br></li>
<li>
Microsoft Office 97 or later.<br><br></li>
<li>
Applications that have the Visual Basic Technology logo. (That is, that license Visual Basic for Applications version 5.0 or later.)</li>
</ul>
<p>
Applications that do not support the display of modeless forms by in-process components include:
<ul type=disc>
<li>
Applications created with earlier versions of Visual Basic.<br><br></li>
<li>
Earlier versions of Microsoft Office.<br><br></li>
<li>
Version 3.<i>x</i> of Microsoft Internet Explorer.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Determining Support for Modeless Forms at Run Time</h3>
<p>
To allow in-process components to detect at run time whether a client application supports the display of modeless forms, Visual Basic provides the Boolean NonModalAllowed property of the App object.</p>
<p>
An in-process component should test this property before showing a modeless form. If the value is True, the form can be shown vbModeless. If the value is false, showing a modeless form will cause run-time error 369. The component should degrade gracefully by showing the form vbModal instead.</p>
<h3>Important Debugging Limitation</h3>
<p>
When you’re debugging an in-process component in the development environment, using a non–Visual Basic application as an out-of-process test program, modeless forms will appear to work even if the non-Visual Basic application doesn’t support them.</p>
<p>
Testing the NonModalAllowed property of the App object is of no use in this situation; the property will return True regardless of the client. The reason for this is that when debugging an in-process component with an out-of-process test application, Visual Basic cannot determine whether the test application supports modeless forms.</p>
<p>
Before attempting to write an in-process component that will show modeless forms, for use with a specific non–Visual Basic application, you should compile a small test DLL with a method that displays the value of the NonModalAllowed property of the App object in a message box. Call this method from the non-Visual Basic application, to determine whether it supports modeless forms.</p>
<h2>Forms Displayed by Out-Of-Process Components</h2>
<p>
Modal and modeless forms displayed as a result of method calls to out-of-process components will not necessarily appear in front of the client application’s forms. The reason is that Automation does not define a z-order relationship between forms in different applications.</p>
<p>
