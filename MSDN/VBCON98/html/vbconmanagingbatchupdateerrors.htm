The Status property is used to track changes made to individual rows in a Client Batch cursor's result set. If you create a Client Batch cursor and use the Edit, Delete, or AddNew methods followed by the Update method, RDO sets the row's Status property to indicate what operation has taken place on the row.</p>
<p>
Initially, rdoResultset rows fetched from the remote server are marked as rdRowUnmodified. However, once you make a change to the result set, RDO changes the Status property to reflect the operation. For example, if you use the AddNew and Update methods on the rdoResultset object, the Status property is set to rdRowNew. If you wish to have RDO and the Client Batch cursor library ignore a change you have made, you can set the Status property to rdRowUnmodified before using the BatchUpdate method.</p>
<p>
When the BatchUpdate method returns, the Status property of each row indicates the degree of success or failure of each update. Your code should examine each row's Status property and take appropriate action based on each of the following possible status codes:
<ul type=disc>
<li>
<b>rdRowUnmodified.</b> The row has not been modified or has been modified successfully. No action is required.<br><br></li>
<li>
<b>rdRowModified.</b> The row has been modified, but not updated in the database. This status would indicate that the row needs to be updated, but either has not because the BatchUpdate method has not yet been executed or failed to complete the update operation.<br><br></li>
<li>
<b>rdRowNew.</b> The row has been inserted with the AddNew method, but not updated in the database. This status would indicate that the row needs to be added to the database, but either has not because the BatchUpdate method has not yet been executed or failed to be added.<br><br></li>
<li>
<b>rdRowDeleted.</b> The row has been deleted with the Delete method, but not updated in the database. This status would indicate that the row needs to be deleted from the database, but either has not because the BatchUpdate method has not yet been executed or failed to be deleted.<br><br></li>
<li>
<b>rdRowDBDeleted.</b> The row has been deleted locally and in the database. No action is required.</li>
</ul>
