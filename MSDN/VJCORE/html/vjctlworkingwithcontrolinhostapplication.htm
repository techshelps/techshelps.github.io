<h2><a name="vjctlworkingwithcontrolinhostapplication"></a>Working with a Control in a Host Application</h2>
<p>
You can work with your control in a host application, such as Visual J++, Visual Basic, or Internet Explorer, as you would with any control. To run any control created in Visual J++, the following must reside on the host computer:
<ul type=disc>
<li>
The Microsoft Virtual Machine for Java (VM) available with Visual J++ 6.0. A redistributable VM is available as the file Msjavx86.exe. This version of the VM is compatible with both Internet Explorer 3.02 and 4.0, but some control features might not be available under version 3.02.</li>
</ul>
<p>
In addition, for each control you must distribute the following files:
<ul type=disc>
<li>
The .class files for all the classes in your control's project.<br><br></li>
<li>
The type library (.tlb file) generated for your project during the build process.<br><br></li>
<li>
The .dat files generated during the build process for your control.<br><br></li>
<li>
The VJPROJS.SRG file, which contains registration information.</li>
</ul>
<p class=indent>
<b>Note</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you are running the control on the computer where you built the control project, all of these files are already available.</p>
<p>
After installing the files on the host computer, you must register the control as described in <a href="vjctlregisteringcontrol.htm">Registering a Control</a>. You can then create instances of the control. In many host applications, you can add the control to a toolbox. For example, in Visual Basic, you can right-click the Toolbox, choose Components, and then select your control.</p>
<h3>Using a Control in Internet Explorer</h3>
<p>
To use a control in Internet Explorer, create an &lt;OBJECT&gt; element. In the CLASSID attribute, identify your control in one of the following ways:
<ul type=disc>
<li>
<b>By progID</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Use a CLASSID attribute such as the following:<pre><code>&lt;OBJECT CLASSID="progid:MyProject.MyControl"&gt;
&lt;/OBJECT&gt;
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<b>By ClassID</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Use a CLASSID attribute such as the following:<pre><code>&lt;OBJECT CLASSID="clsid:d0702fa0-fb3b-11d1-8f88-00aa00600a54"&gt;
&lt;/OBJECT&gt;

</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<b>Using your control's class name</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This syntax requires the version of the Microsoft Virtual Machine for Java that ships with Visual J++ 6.0 or later. Use a CLASSID attribute that includes the JAVA moniker, as in the following example:<pre><code>&lt;OBJECT CLASSID="JAVA:MyControl"&gt;
&lt;/OBJECT&gt;
</code></pre>
</li>
</ul>
