<p>
J/Direct also imposes security restrictions on classes that are marked using the @dll.struct directive. Because structures only become unsafe when they are instantiated, these security checks are more efficient than the checks used for J/Direct methods. The following two security checks are performed on @dll.struct classes:</p>
<table border=1 cellpadding=5 cols=2 frame=below rules=rows>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=18%>Load time</td>
<td width=82%>Classes marked with the @dll.struct directive will load only if the context indicates full trust.</td>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=18%>Link time</td>
<td width=82%>Code that is not fully trusted cannot link to classes declared using the @dll.struct directive. The Microsoft VM will throw a NoClassDefFoundError if such an attempt is made.</td>
</tr>
</table><br>
