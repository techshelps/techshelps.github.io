<p>
When syntax errors occur in your code, the Visual J++ compiler alerts you to these errors by displaying a message that indicates that your application was not successfully updated, and by displaying a list of errors in the Visual J++ task list.</p>
<p>
However, often the errors that occur within your code are not language syntax errors, but are instead errors in logic — infinite loops, for example. To address bugs like these, you use the features supported by the Visual J++ debugger. </p>
<p>
See <a href="vjhowbasicdebuggingprocedures.htm">Basic Debugging Procedures</a> to learn more about using the integrated debugger with Visual J++ projects. These procedures show you how to set breakpoints, step through code, view run-time values of member variables, and much more. For more information about the general features the integrated debugger shares with other products, see the tables in <a href="vjhowthedebuggingprocess.htm">The Debugging Process</a>.</p>
<p>
The online documentation also provides scenarios that have been created to show you how to use the debugger’s features with specific types of Visual J++ projects. Details for recreating example projects can be found throughout the procedures in the following scenarios:
