<h2><a name="vjconsecuritychecksatlinktime"></a>Security Checks at Link Time</h2>
<p>
Linking is what occurs when one Java class invokes or accesses (using the Reflection API) a member of another class. At link time, the Microsoft VM checks to see whether the class being referenced is accessible and whether the arguments being passed are of the correct type and number. The class is considered accessible if it is in the same package or if it is declared public. </p>
<p>
With the standard Java language, you are limited to a choice of two options for class accessibility: you can either declare a class public (so that anyone can link to it) or you can declare a class without the public modifier (so that only classes in the same package can link to it). However, with Microsoft Internet Explorer 4.0, there is now a third option. You can declare the class as "public for fully trusted callers only." You can declare any class with this type of accessibility, even if the class does not use J/Direct. To declare the class, place the following directive at the beginning of the class: </p>
<pre><code>/** @security(checkClassLinking=on) */
</code></pre>
<p>
It is important to notice that this security check only prevents untrusted callers from directly calling the "protected" class. It does not prevent indirect calls. A third (fully trusted) class can forward a call from an untrusted caller to the "protected" class. However, there is a safeguard. The intermediate class must either be installed on the target computer's CLASSPATH, or it must be digitally signed for maximum trust and installed using the browser.</p>
