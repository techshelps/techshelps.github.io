<h1><a name="vjconusinginitformmethod"></a>Using the initForm Method</h1>
<p>
The initForm method plays a central role in the programming model for all user interface programming in WFC. When using the Visual J++ Forms Designer for Win32-based applications, initForm is found in the Form-derived class that represents your main form. In the com.ms.wfc.html package, this method is found in your DhDocument-derived class (for example, Class1 in the code-behind HTML template provided by Visual J++) and is called from the constructor of the class. </p>
<p>
You should use the initForm method to initialize the Java components that represent the HTML elements you want to access and code to. As with the initForm method in Form-derived classes, there are certain restrictions when calling WFC methods from initForm in DhDocument. As a rule, you should call only methods in initForm that set properties. Moreover, you should bind only to elements on the HTML page using the setBoundElements method.</p>
<p>
Specifically, this means that calling any method that resets or removes a property or element is strictly not supported in initForm. This also applies to any methods that attempt to locate elements on the existing HTML page (such as DhDocument.findElement).</p>
<p>
The reason for this is that the document on the existing HTML page is not merged with your DhDocument-derived class until the DhDocument.onDocumentLoad method is called. You can use the onDocumentLoad method to retrieve properties and manipulate or locate elements in the existing HTML document. For information on using the initForm and onDocumentLoad methods on server-side classes, see <a href="vjhowserverdhtml.htm">Using the com.ms.wfc.html Package on a Server</a>.</p>
