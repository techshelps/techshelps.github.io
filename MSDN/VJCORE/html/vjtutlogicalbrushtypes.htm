<h1><a name="vjtutlogicalbrushtypes"></a>Logical Brush Types</h1>
<p>
Logical brushes come in three varieties: solid, pattern, and hatched.</p>
<p>
A <i>solid</i> brush consists of a color or pattern defined by some element of the Windows user interface (for example, you can paint a shape with the color and pattern conventionally used by Windows to display disabled buttons).</p>
<p>
A <i>hatched</i> brush consists of a combination of a color and of one of the six patterns defined by Win32. </p>
<p>
A <i>pattern</i> brush consists of a bitmap that is used as the basis for a pattern that fills a shape. Where the area to be filled is larger than the bitmap, the bitmap is tiled horizontally and vertically across the display. Pattern brushes enable you to create custom brushes that consist of any pattern that you define.</p>
