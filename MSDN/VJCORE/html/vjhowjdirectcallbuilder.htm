<h1><a name="vjhowjdirectcallbuilder"></a>J/Direct Call Builder</h1>
<p>
Using the J/Direct Call Builder, you can quickly create <a href="vjconwritingwindowsbasedapplicationswithjdirect.htm">J/Direct</a> calls to the Win32 API. The J/Direct Call Builder automatically inserts Java definitions for the Win32 API elements into your code, along with the appropriate @dll.import tags.</p>
<p class=label>
<b>To access the Win32 API with the J/Direct Call Builder</b>
<ol>
<li>
To open the J/Direct Call Builder, point to <b>Other Windows</b> on the <b>View</b> menu and click <b>J/Direct Call Builder</b>.<br><br></li>
<li>
By default, the J/Direct Call Builder displays elements defined in the following Win32 DLLs: advapi32.dll, gdi32.dll, kernel32.dll, shell32.dll, spoolss.dll, user32.dll, and winmm.dll. (These DLLs are specified by the WIN32.TXT file, which is selected under <b>Source</b>.)<br><br></li>
<li>
The <b>Target</b> box identifies the class to contain the J/Direct calls. By default, a class named Win32 will be added to your project and will contain these calls. (If your solution contains multiple Java projects, the Win32 class is added to the first project.)<p class=tl>
To specify a different target class, click the ellipses button (<b>...</b>).</P><ul type=disc>
<li>
In the <b>Select Class</b> dialog box, select whether you want to view your classes in <b>Project View</b> or <b>Class View</b>. Project view displays a hierarchical list of the .java files in your solution, where each file node lists the names of the classes contained in that file. Class view displays a hierarchical list of class names.<br><br></li>
<li>
Once you have chosen a view, select the name of the class to contain the J/Direct calls. (To copy the calls to the Windows Clipboard instead of to a class, select <b>Clipboard</b>.)<br><br></li>
<li>
Click <b>OK</b>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
To filter the display of Win32 methods, structs, and constants, select or clear the <b>Methods</b>, <b>Structs</b>, and <b>Constants</b> options.<br><br></li>
<li>
Now select the method, struct, or constant that you want to insert. (You can select multiple items using the SHIFT and CTRL keys.) Note that a Win32 struct will be added as a nested class inside your class.<p class=atl>
<B><b>Note</b></B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To search for an item by its initial characters, type the characters into the <b>Find</b> box. The first item that matches these characters is automatically selected.</p></li>
<li>
To insert the associated Java definition into your class, click <b>Copy To Target</b>. (You can also double-click the method, struct, or constant to insert it into your class.)</li>
</ol>
<p>
When a Win32 API element is selected in the J/Direct Call Builder, the lower preview pane displays the associated Java definition. You can copy and paste this text into any file. To quickly find the online reference information for a Win32 API element, right-click the item and click <b>Display API Help</b> on the shortcut menu.</p>
