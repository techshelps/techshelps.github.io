<H2>Step 1 -- Determining Your Modem ID Strings </H2><P>You must put one or more modem ID strings in your INF file that uniquely identify each modem or modem model the INF file can install. This is required of non-Plug and Play modems as well as Plug and Play (PnP) modems, and enables Windows 95 modem autodetection and enumeration to function properly. </P>
<P>There are several different modem ID strings that can be obtained from one particular modem model, and there are several different ways you can place those modem ID strings in your INF file. </P>
<UL><LI>     First, you need to determine the modem ID string values you can use in your INF file by experimenting with your modem. </LI><LI>     Second, you need to decide which of those modem ID string values to use in your INF file and where to place them in the INF (this issue is covered in <I>Step 2 -- Creating the Modem INF File</I>). </LI></UL><P></P>
<P>Before you start, identify the kind of modem you are working with. </P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
