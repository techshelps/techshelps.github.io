<H3>Generic Windows 95 Device Driver </H3><P>Certain devices, such as modems and disk drives, are automatically supported by Windows 95. Note that in the case of modems, Windows provides generic drivers but it is recommended that manufacturers provide specific INFs for their modems with the appropriate AT commands. If the configuration information on the PC card is complete, the PCMCIA bus enumerator will initialize the device and Configuration Manager will pass the configuration information to one of these drivers. For example, if the PC card is an IDE drive, Configuration Manager may assign I/O port 1F0h and IRQ 14 (representing the primary IDE controller) and will pass this information to the Windows 95 I/O sub-system (IOS). Specialized functions on the cards may be implemented using mini drivers (refer to other sections in the Windows 95 DDK for more information). </P>
<P>Device classes that do not have standard configurations (for example, network or SCSI adapters) are not automatically supported by Windows 95 — the drivers must be supplied by the hardware manufacturer. </P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
