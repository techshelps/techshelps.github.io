<H3>Point and Print Installation of Printers Over a Network </H3><P>Point and Print installation of printers over a network is a possibility with Windows 95. For printers being shared by other computers, Windows 95 provides the ability to fully install printer drivers from the print server directly, with correct initial driver settings, without requiring the client machine to provide diskettes containing printer driver files. </P>
<P>In order to do this, a Windows 95 Network Print Provider must be installed on the client machines. </P>
<P>Windows 95 supports Point and Print installation for the following Server/Client configurations: </P>
<UL><LI>     Windows 95 server and Windows 95 clients. </LI><LI>     Netware 3.x and 4.x server and Windows 95 clients. </LI></UL><P></P>
<H4><A NAME="sec0"></A>Windows 95 Server and Windows 95 Client Installation </H4><P>On the server, install the Windows 95 printer driver and share the printer. </P>
<P>On a client, a user can use either of two methods, which are summarized in the following table: </P>

<H4><A NAME="sec1"></A>Netware 3.x and 4.x Server and Windows 95 Client Installation </H4><P>The server may either be a Windows 95 machine running the Netware compatible server or it may be a Novell Netware server. </P>
<P>In the case of a Windows 95 machine running the Netware compatible server, the procedure is the same as that described in the section "Windows 95 Server and Windows 95 Client Installation." </P>
<P>If the server is a Novell Netware server, you will have to use a Windows 95 machine to log on to the Novell Netware server with privileges to administer the Novell server and then use the following procedure: </P>
<P>    1.     On the Windows 95 machine, use the Explorer to find the Netware server. </P>
<P>    2.     Double-click on the Netware server icon to see the Netware print queue. </P>
<P>    3.     Right-click on the print queue and then select Configure from the Point and Print Setup menu. </P>
<P>    4.     Follow the prompts through the steps required to configure the server to support point and print printer installation from the server for other Windows 95 Netware clients. It is important to set the driver path <B>before</B> you select the model. </P>
<P></P>
<P>Installation from Windows 95 client machines running Windows 95 Netware client services is just as described in the section above, "Windows 95 Server and Windows 95 Client Installation." </P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
