<H3>Root Keys, Subkeys, and Values </H3><P>The registry consists of a hierarchically arranged set of keys. Each key has a name and can have associated subkeys and values. A key represents a <I>branch</I> in the registry hierarchy. A <I>root key</I> is a predefined value that identifies a topmost branch in the registry hierarchy. For example, the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE key identifies the branch that contains hardware and software information about the given computer. The keys and values you access are always within a branch of a root key. </P>
<P>To access keys and values in the registry you must open a key. Opening a key creates a handle that you can use to open other keys or to examine and set values. The predefined root keys are always considered to be open. </P>
<P>You can create new keys and new values in any open key. Each value has a corresponding value name and data type. The <I>value name</I> identifies the value and the <I>data type</I> specifies the format of the data, whether a null-terminated string (REG_SZ) or binary data (REG_BINARY). Other values such as REG_DWORD are valid as well, although internally any value that is not REG_SZ is treated as REG_BINARY. Any You can also delete keys and values, but you cannot delete the root keys. </P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
