<H2>Road Map for Building an IR Communications Driver </H2><P>The Infrared Communications for Windows 95 installation disk image is distributed in two ways by OEMs: </P>
<UL><LI>     OEMs who produce add-on IR devices such as IR dongles for computers running Windows 95 will distribute the installation disk with their IR dongle. End users who purchase the IR dongle for a computer running Windows 95 use the installation diskette to add the IR Communications software when they install the IR dongle. </LI><LI>     OEMs who produce Windows 95 systems with built-in IR devices use the installation diskette to create a reference system for adding IR Communications for Windows 95 in the factory. In this case, the installation disk image will be used to create an IR Communications installation diskette to ship with the systems in case reinstallation is ever necessary. </LI></UL><P></P>
<P>The following steps are required to adapt Windows 95 Infrared Communications to your hardware. </P>
<P>    1.     Install the Windows 95 Infrared Communications DDK; see <I>Step 1. Installing the Infrared Communications DDK</I>. </P>
<P>    2.     Adapt the sample source code in OEMDONGL.C, which is part of the IrFramer, to your hardware; see <I>Step 2. Adapting the OEMDONGL.C Source Code</I>. </P>
<P>    3.     Build a version of OEMDONGL.VXD, the OEM-provided part of the IrFramer, that is adapted to your infrared hardware; <I>Step 3. Building Your Version of OEMDONGL.VXD</I>. </P>
<P>    4.     Create an Infrared Communications for Windows 95 installation diskette; see <I>Step 4. Creating an Installation Diskette and Installing the IR Communications Software</I>. </P>
<P>    5.     Install IR Communications on two Windows 95 computers that have your dongles attached and then experiment with your hardware, using different transmission speeds and framer capability settings. See <I>Step 5. Using the IR Communications Software to Experiment with Your IR Device</I>. </P>
