<H3>IR Communications Driver Install and Uninstall is Simple </H3><P>Setup minimizes the number of questions that must be answered during the installation process to the minimum. The goal is to make IR installation as simple as possible. Please be sure to set up from a floppy, local drive or mapped network drive. Setup does not currently support UNC path names for the source of installation. </P>
<P>The Uninstall feature of Setup enables you to remove an installed version of the IR Communications driver by using the Add/Remove Programs icon in the Windows 95 Control Panel, rather than manually deleting files and registry keys. </P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
