<H2>Limits of the INF File Editor </H2><P>Note that several classes of devices -- namely printers and network adapters -- have INF file extensions specific to those devices which are not described in this chapter. For a description of the printer INF extensions, see the topic "Router and Local Print Provider" in the Windows 95 DDK help reference for the print spooler and printer drivers. For a description of the network INF extensions, see the topic "Network Driver Installer" in the Windows 95 DDK help reference for networks. </P>
<P>There are also some special cases of INF files, such as INF files for multifunction boards, that require you to add items to the INF file you create with Infedit. </P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
