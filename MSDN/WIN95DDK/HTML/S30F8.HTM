<P>This service has been provided for FSDs to block a thread. This service does not return until the corresponding wake call has been issued on the blocked key via the IFSMgr_Wakeup service. The important difference between this service and the IFSMgr_Block service is that this service blocks with events disabled. FSDs that use this service must be very careful about when they use this service to prevent the possibility of deadlocks occurring in the system. </P>
