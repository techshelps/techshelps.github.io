<H3>How Does EUDC Work? </H3><P>If a font is selected and an EUDC character is specified by a GDI function, GDI handles the EUDC character as follows: </P>
<P>    1.     If the selected font is a DBCS TrueType or WIFE font that has a typeface-specific TrueType EUDC font associated with it, GDI retrieves character data from the typeface-specific EUDC font. </P>
<P>    2.     If the selected font is a DBCS TrueType font that has its own EUDC characters, GDI retrieves the character data from the EUDC font. (GDI checks the <I>Private Use Area</I> bit in the <B>aulUnicodeRange</B> field of the Windows Metrics table to determine whether the DBCS TrueType font contains EUDC characters. For more information, please refer to Font Signatures in .) If the character is not defined, GDI carries out the default character procedure for the selected font. </P>
<P>    3.     If the selected font does not have a typeface-specific EUDC font associated with it, GDI retrieves character data from the system default EUDC font. </P>
<P>    4.     If the EUDC character is not in the system default EUDC font, GDI carries out the default character procedure for the selected font. </P>
