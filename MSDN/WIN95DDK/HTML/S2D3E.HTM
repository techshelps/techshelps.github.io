<H3>Explorer </H3><H4><A NAME="sec0"></A>Navigating Networks (Browsing) </H4><P>Network browsing is achieved using the Shell Explorer. The top level entry for each network provider is the network provider's name. The explorer uses the enumeration APIs to browse the networks. Expanding a network resource that is a container will cause one level down to be expanded (enumerated). Each network resource displays an icon based upon its resource type. The icon can be taken from a standard icon set supplied by the Shell. </P>
<H4><A NAME="sec1"></A>Making Connections Whilst Browsing in the Explorer </H4><P>There are two ways to initiate connecting to a network resource whilst browsing: </P>
<P>    1    For a network resource that is connectable, there is a connect verb in the network resource's context pane. The user can select the connect verb. </P>
<P>    2    The user can try to expand a network resource that requires a connection to the network in order to browse the objects that it contains. Browsing in this context will typically be files and directories. </P>
<P></P>
<P>There are three methods of attempting a connection: </P>
<P>    1    If demanded by the NP, the Shell can bring up an NP provided dialog. This takes precedence over any other method. </P>
<P>    2    The connection is attempted with the minimum necessary interaction with the user by using default values. To change or see these values, the user does so through the connection's properties pages. This connection method occurs, if possible, when the user attempts to expand a network resource. The default values are targeted at the browsing user, and hence are: use any cached authentication information, not make the connection persistent, and not associate a local DOS device. </P>
<P>    3    The connection is attempted where the user is given full control of the values. This method is attempted when the user selects the connect verb. If authentication is required, any cached authentication information is taken, but the user is given the opportunity to change his authentication information. The user is given the option of selecting a local DOS device to associate with the connection, as well as the option to select whether or not the connection is persistent. </P>
<P></P>
<H4><A NAME="sec2"></A>Remembering a Network Resource on the Desktop </H4><P>Only network resources that are containers or are children of connectable containers are remembered on the desktop in a fashion meaningful to the MPR. Opening a remembered container opens an Explorer window focused on the World, expanded down to that container, therefore showing its contents. Authentication (perhaps even multiple authentications) may be necessary to accomplish this. </P>
<P>An attempt to remember a network resource (typically by dragging the network resource to the desktop) will as a minimum remember the network and the resource name in a link. If the resource is currently connected to, or the user has some level of authentication to the resource, then the authentication information and local DOS device (if any) will also be remembered in the link. </P>
<H4><A NAME="sec3"></A>Connecting to a Network Resource on the Desktop </H4><P>An attempt to access a network resource through a desktop resource will first be done by establishing a connection to the resource. The connection is established using default values in the same manner as for browsing (using any information stored in the link, as described in the previous section). </P>
<H4><A NAME="sec4"></A>Network Specific UI </H4><P>Each NP can provide its own network specific information on a dialog using NPDeviceMode. This will be invoked as the properties of the network in the Shell Explorer hierarchy. </P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
