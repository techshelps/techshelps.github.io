<P>VoiceMixerMid is the Manufacturer ID (MID) of the mixer device. </P>
<P>VoiceMixerPid is the Product ID (PID) of the mixer device. </P>
<P>VoiceMixerLineID is the line ID of the volume control. </P>
<P>When the TAPI line is initialized, Unimodem looks for a volume control on this mixer line. If the volume is set to it's minimum, Unimodem will move set it to it's maximum. When speakerphone is enabled, the control is not muted. Then speakerphone is disabled, the control is muted. When the TAPI line is closed, this control is not muted. </P>
<P>The mixer is not used at any other time by Unimodem. It is not used to control speakerphone volume. Speakerphone volume is set through the <B>SpeakerPhoneSetVolumeGain</B> command. </P>
