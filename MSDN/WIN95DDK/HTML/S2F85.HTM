<H2>About Port Drivers </H2><P>A port driver manages and controls the adapter for a given block device. The port driver detects and initializes the adapter, handles interrupts, transmits I/O requests to the device, and carries out adapter-level error recovery and logging. A port driver typically works with a specific, proprietary adapter and therefore is retained in memory and used by Windows 95 only if the given adapter is present in the system. </P>
<P>This part of the Windows 95 DDK <I>Design and Implementation Guide</I> describes the responsibilities and requirements of a port driver and explains how to build and test a port driver for your adapter. </P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
