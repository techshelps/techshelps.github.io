<H3>OEM-Provided Support for Other IR Devices Built as a Dynamically-Loaded VxD </H3><P>A VxD must be provided to support IR devices other than the devices listed above. Sample source code for an OEM-provided VxD that supports the ACTiSYS ACT200L Infrared Wireless Interface is in the DDK, in the file OEMDONGL.C. OEMs and IHVs can adapt this code to their device. Also, a wrapper that IHVs and OEMs can link to their OEMDONGL.C module is provided that will make the OEM-provided part of the IrFramer an independent dynamic-load VxD. This will allow the driver for the IR adapter to be dynamically loaded and unloaded. </P>
<P>The IR Communications core architecture, and the place of the optional OEM-provided part of the serial IrFramer component in it, are shown in the illustration below. </P>

<UL><LI>     Infrared Monitor (IrMon) implements the user interface for IR. Using IrMon, the user can see what devices are in range, determine the link quality, and enable or disable the IR communication features. </LI><LI>     IrEnum is used during discovery to enumerate all visible devices on the "IR bus," thus providing Plug and Play support. </LI><LI>     IrComm simulates three-wire and nine-wire serial connections and parallel port connections of the IR media. By simulating the status connections available in a standard nine-wire RS-232 connection, software can operate as if IR is a 100% compatible serial cable. </LI><LI>     IrLMP provides for multiple sessions over the single link provided by IrLAP. </LI><LI>     IrLAP implements a reliable link (single session) between two IrDA devices. </LI><LI>     IrFramer provides for packetization and control of IR adapters. </LI></UL><P></P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
