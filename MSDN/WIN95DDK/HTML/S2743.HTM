<H3>Installation and the Registry </H3><P>A VCOMM device (such as a COM port, LPT port, or modem) is installed into Windows 95 in one of the following ways: </P>
<UL><LI>     It is detected during Windows 95 Setup. </LI><LI>     It is Plug and Play, and detected by it respective "bus enumerator" when first physically installed. </LI><LI>     It is detected or manually installed by the Hardware Installation Wizard or Modem Installation Wizard in the Control Panel. </LI></UL><P></P>
<P>Each installed VCOMM device is represented by two separate registry keys: one hardware key and one software key (also known as a "driver key"). </P>
<P>The hardware key is located under the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Enum branch, along with hardware keys for all other devices that have been detected or enumerated in the system. Hardware keys for non-Plug and Play VCOMM devices are found under Enum\Root. Plug and Play device keys are found in their respective bus enumerator branches, for example, Enum\ISA, Enum\PCMCIA, Enum\PCI, and Enum\SERENUM. Examples of common Windows 95 VCOMM hardware keys are: </P>

<P>Hardware keys have a variety of subkeys and values. Most of these are created by the Plug and Play subsystem for its internal usage, and are common to all device classes. See the Plug and Play documentation for information about these. However, VCOMM stores two values in the hardware key for its use: </P>

<P>When a VCOMM device is installed from an INF into Windows 95, its software key is created under HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\Class. For each installed COM or LPT port, there is a software key created under \ports, for example, \ports\0000. For each installed modem, there is a key under \modem; for example, \modem\0000. A pointer to a device's software key is stored in its hardware key as the value "Driver". </P>
<P>The software key contains subkeys and values installed by the device's INF file, class installer, and driver. The following values are common to all or most VCOMM devices in the software key: </P>
