<H3>Step 8: Add Private Data for PDEVICE, Brushes, and Pens </H3><P>The size of the <B>PDEVICE</B> structure that the DIB engine expects is declared in the <B>dpDeviceSize</B> field of the <B>GDIINFO</B> block returned by the DIB engine. If the driver needs private data in the <B>PDEVICE</B>, it can allocate it. The <B>dpDeviceSize</B> bytes must be in the DIB engine format and must be built using <B>CreateDIBPDevice</B>. Any private data should go after this in the structure and the minidriver must initialize the data itself. </P>
<P>The sizes of the brushes and pens that the DIB engine uses can be found by hooking the first call to <B>RealizeObject</B> and looking at the return value (for size) from the DIB engine. Any private data should go after this in the structure. The minidriver can set a bit in the Flags field to indicate that the pen or brush has additional data. </P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
