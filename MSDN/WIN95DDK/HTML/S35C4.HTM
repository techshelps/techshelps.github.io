<H3>_VWIN32_WaitSingleObject </H3><P>This function only returns when the specified object is in the signaled state or when the time-out interval elapses. Uses EAX, ECX, EDX, and Flags. </P>
<UL><LI>     For information about the return value, see the Win32 ring 3 function <B>WaitForSingleObject</B> in the Microsoft Win32 Software Development Kit (SDK). </LI></UL><P></P>
<P>EBX </P>
<P>VxD handle which can be waited on. A VxD handle is a ring 0 event handle created by the function <B>OpenVxDHandle</B>. </P>
<P>EDX </P>
<P>The time-out interval, in milliseconds. The function returns if the interval elapses, even if the object's state is nonsignaled. If zero, the function tests the object's state and returns immediately. If -1, the function's time-out interval never elapses. </P>
<P>EAX </P>
<P>Flag that indicates if this is an alertable wait. Specifies whether the function returns when the system queues an I/O completion routine for execution by the calling thread. If TRUE, the function returns and the completion routine is executed. If FALSE, the function does not return, and the completion routine is not executed. </P>
<P>A completion routine is queued, but is not executed. The thread must run at ring 3 for this to happen. A completion routine is queued for execution when the <B>ReadFileEx</B> or <B>WriteFileEx</B> function in which it was specified has been completed. The wait function returns and the completion routine is executed only if this flag is TRUE, and the calling thread is the thread that initiated the read or write operation. </P>
<P>This service can only be called when the current VM is the system VM. </P>
