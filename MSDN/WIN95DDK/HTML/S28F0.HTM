<H2>Two Different Ways of Using the IR Communications DDK </H2><P>You can use the files in the DDK tree structure in two ways: </P>
<UL><LI>     You can use the DDK to simply install the IR Communications driver and start running IR-capable applications. OEMs or IHVs that want to test their device for compatibility with one of the IR devices listed in <I>Instant Support for Some IR Hardware in Individual VxDs</I> may use the DDK in this way. Complete instructions for using the DDK in this way are in the DDK documentation file DRVRELNO.DOC, which is in the RETAIL subdirectory of the DDK. </LI><LI>     IHVs and OEMs with IR devices that are not listed in <I>Instant Support for Some IR Hardware in Individual VxDs</I>, or OEMs and IHVs who are listed but want to build a new version of their IR communications driver, can use the DDK to build a new dynamically-loadable VxD that will enable their device to run with the IR Communications driver. Such IHVs and OEMs can also use the DDK to build IR Communications driver installation diskettes they can distribute with their IR devices. </LI></UL><P></P>
<P>The rest of these DDK Release Notes document is structured as a road map. A road map is a sequence of steps you carry out to accomplish your goals with the DDK. </P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
