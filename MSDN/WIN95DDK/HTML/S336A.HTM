Also see priority inversion prevention. </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP"><P>priority inversion prevention </P></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP"><P>A technique the VMM uses to prevent a form of deadlock in which a low priority thread that owns a resource is unable to run because of its low priority, and a higher priority thread that also needs the resource remains blocked while waiting for the resource to be freed. </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP"><P>real-time priority class </P></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP"><P>A group of priority values associated with threads that perform time-critical tasks. </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP"><P>round robin </P></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP"><P>The sequential, cyclical allocation of processor time to all threads of the same priority. </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP"><P>schedule </P></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP"><P>Allocating processor time to a virtual machine or thread. </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP"><P>static boost </P></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP"><P>Raising or lowering a thread's time-slice priority with no time decay. </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP"><P>suspend </P></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP"><P>To halt a process temporarily. </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP"><P>system idle priority </P></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP"><P>A priority of 0, which is reserved for system use. </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP"><P>system thread </P></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP"><P>The first thread created in the system virtual machine. </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP"><P>thread </P></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP"><P>The basic entity to which the VMM allocates processor time. A thread can execute any part of the application's code, including a part currently being executed by another thread.
