<H2>About SCSI Miniport Drivers </H2><P>SCSI miniport drivers are HBA-specific but OS-independent. That is, each miniport driver links itself against the SCSI port driver and calls only the port driver's <B>ScsiPort</B><I>Xxx</I> routines to communicate with the system. HBA miniport drivers can be compiled to run on machines running Windows 95 or Windows NT. Each platform provides an OS-dependent port driver that exports the <B>ScsiPort</B><I>Xxx</I> routines. </P>
<P>Every SCSI miniport driver must have at least the following system-defined routines: </P>
<UL><LI>     DriverEntry to initialize the miniport driver </LI><LI>     HwFindAdapter to determine how (or whether) driver-supported HBA(s) are configured in the machine </LI><LI>     HwInitialize to initialize the HBA(s) </LI><LI>     HwStartIo to start operations on the HBA for an incoming request </LI><LI>     HwResetBus to handle bus-reset requests </LI></UL><P></P>
<P>Depending on the HBA and the driver designer, SCSI miniport drivers also can have any or all of the following system-defined routines: </P>
<UL><LI>     HwInterrupt to handle HBA-generated interrupts, which is optional if and only if the miniport manages all I/O operations on its HBA by polling </LI></UL><P></P>
<P>However, using polling exclusively has an adverse effect on a miniport's performance and on its HBA's I/O throughput. </P>
<UL><LI>     HwDmaStarted to set up an HBA transfer after the system DMA controller has been programmed by the port driver </LI><LI>     HwDisableInterruptsCallback and HwEnableInterruptsCallback to handle deferred I/O processing if a particular operation takes a long time </LI><LI>     HwTimer to time operations on the HBA that require long delays 
<P>A miniport should have a HwTimer routine if it has no HwInterrupt routine so it can use the HwTimer routine for efficient polling of the HBA. </P></LI><LI>     HwAdapterState, defined for compatibility with future MS-DOS versions </LI></UL><P></P>
<P>The following sections describe the requirements for and functionality of each of these miniport driver routines. For reference information about the services the SCSI port driver offers to a miniport driver, see <I>Introduction to SCSI Port Driver Services Reference</I>. </P>
