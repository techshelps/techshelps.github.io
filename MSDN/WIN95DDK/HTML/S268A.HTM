<H2>About Image Color Matching </H2><P>Microsoft&reg; Windows&reg; 95 includes Image Color Matching (ICM) support, providing consistent, predictable color rendering from digital image input, through monitor preview, to output. The Windows 95 Color Matching Module (CMM) supporting ICM is licensed from the Eastman Kodak company. </P>
<P>The key to ICM support is the use of a profile, which represents the color properties of a monitor, printer, or digital image input device (such as a scanner). Color profiles, which can be provided by a vendor as part of the software for a particular monitor, printer, or scanner, are installed in the \%Windows%\System\Color directory. For information on how to install a color profile along with a color printer device driver, see <I>Introduction to Printer Drivers and Image Color Matching</I> in the Windows 95 DDK <I>Design and Implementation Guide</I>. </P>
<P>The International Color Consortium (ICC) is made up of computer and imaging industry leaders (including Kodak, Microsoft, Apple Computer, Sun Microsystems, and Silicon Graphics, among others) and industry standard-setting bodies. Windows 95 ICM support uses color profiles that comply with the <I>ICC Profile Format Specification</I>. ICC maintains an Internet Web site at the URL http://www.color.org. A copy of the <I>ICC Profile Format Specification, Version 3.2</I>, can be downloaded from that site. </P>
