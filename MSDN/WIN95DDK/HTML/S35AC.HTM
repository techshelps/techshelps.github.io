<P>Used by virtual devices to ensure a minimum accuracy for system timing. When this service is called, if the interrupt period specified is lower than the current timer interrupt frequency, the interrupt period will be set to the new frequency. Uses Flags. </P>

<P>Desired interrupt period. </P>
<P>Until a matching call to the <B>VTD_End_Min_Int_Period</B> service is made, the timer interrupt frequency is guaranteed to never be slower than the value specified. </P>
<P>A virtual device should call this service only once before calling <B>VTD_End_Min_Int_Period</B>. </P>
<P>Typically the <B>Begin_Min_Int_Period</B> and <B>End_Min_Int_Period</B> services are used by devices such as execution profilers that need extremely accurate timing. VMM system time-out services rely on the VTD to keep time. Therefore, if the timer interrupts are more frequent, the accuracy of the time-out services will be greater. </P>
<P>Fast timer interrupt periods can be very expensive in terms of total system performance. For example, on some machines a timer interrupt of 1 millisecond will degrade total machine throughput by 10 percent, and increase disk I/O by 50 percent. </P>
