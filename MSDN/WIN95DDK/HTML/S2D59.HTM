<H3>WNetCancelConnection2 </H3><P>This function breaks an existing network connection. It may also be used to remove a persistent connection for which there is no existing network connection. </P>
<P>When <B>WNetCancelConnection2</B> is called it removes the connection entirely if it is to a redirected local device or a non-reference counted session, or if CONNECT_REFCOUNT bit is not set in the <I>dwFlags</I> parameter. Otherwise <B>WNetCancelConnection2</B> decrements the reference count to the session and removes the session when it is no longer being referenced. </P>

<P>The name of either the redirected local device or the remote network resource to disconnect from. In the former case, only the redirection specified is broken, in the latter case only the deviceless connection to the remote network resource is broken. If <B>WNetUseConnection</B> was called to make the connection with a non-empty <I>lpLocalName</I> field, then <I>lpName</I> is set to this, otherwise it should be the name that was returned in the <I>lpAccessName</I> field. </P>
