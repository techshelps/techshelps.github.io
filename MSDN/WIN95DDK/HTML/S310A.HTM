</PRE>
<P>This service maps a long name format case-preserved unicode name into an uppercased 'basis' name which is also in unicode but in the FCB-format i.e. it has a 'primary' name with 8 characters and a 3-character 'extension' immediately following it with no intervening dot character. For this service, the source and destination buffers must be different. </P>
<P>The following rules are used to create the basis name: </P>
<P>    1    Leading dots and trailing dots are ignored in generating the basis name. </P>
<P>    2    Embedded whitespace characters are ignored in generating the basis name. </P>
<P>    3    The first three non-whitespace characters after the last embedded dot in the name form the 'extension'. </P>
<P>    4    The first 8 characters of the name form the 'primary' name. If there are dot characters before the first 8 characters (excluding leading dots), then the 'primary' name is that part of the name until the first dot character is hit. </P>
<P>    5    The long name syntax allows for certain special characters which are not allowed in the old DOS syntax. These characters are all replaced by an '_' character. In addition, any unicode character which is part of the newly formed basis name but is not translatable in the current OEM codepage is replaced by an '_' character. </P>
<P></P>
<P><I>pBasisName</I> </P>
<P>Supplies a flat pointer to the buffer the basis name is to be returned in. This buffer must be at least 22 bytes long. </P>
<P><I>pUniName</I> </P>
<P>Supplies a flat pointer to the unicode name from which the basis name needs to be generated. </P>
<P><I>length</I> </P>
<P>Supplies the length in bytes of the unicode input name. </P>
