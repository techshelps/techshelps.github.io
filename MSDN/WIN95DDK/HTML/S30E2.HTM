<P>This service is called to disconnect a resource previously connected using the IFSMgr_SetupConnection service. For this service to work, the same IO request structure that was passed to the IFSMgr_SetupConnection service must be passed in. The IFS relies on the validity of certain fields in the associated IFS request structure that were initialized when the connection was originally established. This service can be only called to disconnect a connection that was previously established using the IFSMgr_SetupConnection service. </P>

<P>Supplies pointer to IO request structure. This should be the same IOREQ structure that was used to do the connection via the IFSMgr_SetupConnection service. </P>
