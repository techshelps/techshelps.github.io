<H2>About Class and Device Installers </H2><P>Class and device installers are dynamic-link libraries that work in conjunction with the Device Manager to install, configure, and remove devices or classes of devices in the system. Windows 95 provides a set of default installers that the Device Manager can use to install devices belonging to the default classes. Additionally the Device Manager supports a set of default device installation functions that can be used on a device of any class. If your device or class of device has features that are not supported by the default installers, you can create a new installer for your device or class and direct Device Manager to use the installer whenever the user installs your device or class. </P>
<P>This chapter describes class and device installers and explains how create and register new installers for use by the Device Manager. </P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
