</PRE>
<P>This service is called by the IOS to notify the IFS manager of the arrival of a plug-and-play drive. This service should not be called by other VxDs directly. VxDs should interface with the IOS and let the IOS do the notification to the IFS manager. When this service is completed, the new drive has been registered as a valid IFS drive. </P>
<P><I>drive</I> </P>
<P>Supplies the 0-based logical drive number of the new device. </P>
<P><I>fDialog</I> </P>
<P>Indicates whether the dialog to query the user in the case there are open files or pending i/o operations should be put up or not. The dialog should be put up if this flag is true (i.e. non-zero). If the flag is false (i.e. zero), the dialog should not be put up. If the dialog is to be suppressed and the volume has open files or pending i/o, the IFS manager returns immediately indicating a failure on the query. </P>
<UL><LI>     Returns 0 if the query was successful. Returns a non-zero value if the query was failed. </LI></UL><P></P>
