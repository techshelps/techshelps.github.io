<P>Relinquishes regions above the last V86 page to the V86MMGR's mapper services for use as a mapper region. This service is only available for Windows version 3.1 and later. Uses Flags. </P>

<P><I>FirstPageNum</I> and <I>NumPages</I> </P>
<P>Page number of the first page in the region, and the number of pages in the region. </P>
<P>Virtuals devices other than the V86MMGR can relinquish regions above the last V86 page to the V86MMGR's mapper services for use as a mapper region. These regions usually overlap with V86MMGR XMS UMB import pages, but this is not required. A virtual device can hand over a page that it has already marked as owned by the device in the Device_V86_Pages array. The V86MMGR marks the page as one it owns (even though it did not actually do the <B>_Assign_Device_V86_Pages</B> for it). </P>
<P>Once a region is relinquished, the virtual device must not attempt to access it. These regions may only be marked as in-use by the V86MMGR XMS driver. This happens when the region overlaps XMS UMB import pages. </P>
<P>This routine has a global effect. It does not take a virtual machine handle argument. </P>
