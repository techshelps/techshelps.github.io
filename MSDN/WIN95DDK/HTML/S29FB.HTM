</PRE>
<P>In Windows 95 and NT-SUR, this string is sent before every send and before every answer. In the next version of windows, this string may not be sent before answer if the fax is configured to be in auto-answer mode (in which case the Unimodem driver would have already setup the modem appropriately). The command should reset the modem to the following state: </P>
<UL><LI>     Load factory defaults </LI><LI>     Disable auto-answer </LI><LI>     Echo OFF </LI><LI>     Verbose ON </LI><LI>     Quiet OFF </LI></UL><P></P>
<P>In Windows 95 and NT SUR, the default ResetCommand string is obtained as follows: "AT&amp;FS0=0E0V1Q0". If that fails, it tries "AT&amp;FS0=0E0". If that fails, it tries "AT&amp;FE0". </P>
<P>If that fails the modem initialization fails. This entire behavior can be changed by directly placing a ResetCommand entry in the modems INF file, in which case it will try to use the latter string. A null string ("") is a valid entry - in which case the fax driver will not issue a reset command. </P>
