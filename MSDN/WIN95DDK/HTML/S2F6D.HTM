<H3>Non-Requirements </H3><P>This design does not need to work in the NT/Win32 environment. However, any common areas, such as user level entry points, should be the same. </P>
<P>The API for enumeration and browsing of network servers and network file resources in the Win32 API base specification are not part of this design. This design's functionality provides indirect support for the implementation of some of those APIs, but does not address this implementation directly. </P>
<P>The design does not specify the interface between the redirector(s) and the transport stack. However, we do have a goal of getting all the important outside vendors to use TDI as this interface. </P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
