<P><I>dwDriverIdentifier</I> </P>
<P>Handle returned to the application opening the driver. </P>
<P><I>hDriver</I> </P>
<P>Handle created by the system. This handle is returned to the application. A unique handle is created each time the driver is opened. </P>
<P><I>lParam1</I> </P>
<P>Address of a zero-terminated string. The string contains any characters that follow the filename in the SYSTEM.INI file. If the device driver was opened by filename, or if there is no additional information, a NULL string or a NULL pointer is specified. Device drivers should verify that <I>lParam1</I> is not NULL before dereferencing it. </P>
<P><I>lParam2</I> </P>
<P>Address of an <B>ICOPEN</B> structure, or zero if the driver is opened only for configuration by the Multimedia property sheet of the Control Panel. If an <B>ICOPEN</B> structure is specified, the driver should verify the <B>fccType</B> member contains 'vidc'. This indicates the driver is opened as a video compressor. </P>
