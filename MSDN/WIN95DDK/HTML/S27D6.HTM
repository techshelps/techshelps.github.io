<H3>Lines, Curves, and Polygons </H3><P>GDI requires all display drivers to provide an <B>Output</B> function that supports a minimum set of line, curve, and polygon drawing capabilities. In particular, a display driver must be able to draw scan lines and polylines. A scan line is a horizontal line that is exactly one pixel wide and which can be either solid or styled. A polyline is a sequence of solid lines, each one pixel wide and each connected at an endpoint to the next line in the sequence. </P>
<P>GDI may call the <B>Output</B> function whenever an application calls a function that draws lines, curves, or polygons. If the display driver supports all capabilities, GDI calls the <B>Output</B> function for each request. Otherwise, GDI simulates output that the driver does not support by combining scan lines and polylines. </P>
<P>Since GDI can use scan lines and polylines to simulate all other line, curve, and polygon output, many display drivers do not support additional capabilities unless the display hardware can produce faster and higher-quality results than GDI. The only drawback to using display hardware is that the display driver must be able to produce the same results in memory bitmaps as on the screen. </P>
<P>GDI checks the <B>dpCurve</B>, <B>dpLines</B>, and <B>dpPolygonals</B> members of the <B>GDIINFO</B> structure to determine what line, curve, and polygon capability the display driver has. </P>
<H4><A NAME="sec0"></A>Curves </H4><P>GDI checks the <B>dpCurve</B> member to determine whether the display driver supports circles, ellipses, pie wedges, chord arcs, and B&amp;eacute;zier splines. This member also specifies whether the display driver can draw wide or styled borders for curves and fill the interiors of curves. </P>
<P>If a display driver does not support circles, GDI can use an ellipse to draw a circle. If the display hardware can fill ellipses, the display driver should set the interiors bit. GDI can use an alternate-fill polygon to draw wide borders (both solid and styled) just as efficiently as if the driver supported them correctly. </P>
<H4><A NAME="sec1"></A>Polylines </H4><P>GDI checks the <B>dpLines</B> member to determine whether the display driver supports polylines. This member also specifies whether the display driver can draw wide or styled lines and fill the interiors of wide lines. A display driver must support polylines. </P>
<P>If a display driver supports styled lines, the line segments drawn by the display hardware must be as specified by the <B>dpStyleLen</B> member. </P>
<H4><A NAME="sec2"></A>Polygons </H4><P>GDI checks the <B>dpPolygonals</B> member to determine whether the display driver supports rectangles, scan lines, alternate-fill polygons, and winding-number-fill polygons. This member also specifies whether the display driver can draw wide or style borders for polygons, and fill the interiors of polygons. The display driver must support scan lines. </P>
<P>If the display driver does not draw its own wide borders, GDI simulates wide borders using alternate-fill polygons. Some display drivers intentionally take advantage of this by supporting alternate-fill polygons, but not wide borders. </P>
<H4><A NAME="sec3"></A>Hardware Capabilities </H4><P>The hardware for some displays supports many of the line, curve, and polygon capabilities that Windows itself supports or expects the display driver to support. A display driver should take advantage of display hardware whenever possible because it often dramatically improves performance. </P>
<P>The only disadvantage to using display hardware is if the hardware cannot produce its output both on the screen and in memory bitmaps. Windows requires that for any figure drawn on the screen, the display driver must also be able to draw it in a memory bitmap. If the hardware cannot access memory bitmaps, the display driver must include code that emulates the algorithms used by the display hardware. Depending on the complexity of the hardware code, this may be a difficult and costly task. </P>
<H4><A NAME="sec4"></A>Partial Support for Capabilities </H4><P>A display driver does not have to provide complete support for a given capability. Instead, a driver's <B>Ouput</B> function can provide support for a few specific cases and return all others to GDI for simulation. In such cases, the display driver sets bits in the <B>GDIINFO</B> structure as if it provided complete support, but the driver's <B>Output</B> function returns -1 to GDI for all cases that need simulation. </P>
<P>For example, if display hardware can draw polygons with 256 vertices but not with 257, the <B>Output</B> function can use the display hardware to draw the smaller polygons and return -1 to let GDI simulate the rest. </P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
