<H3>Installing Video Compression and Decompression Drivers </H3><P>Video compression drivers are listed in the [drivers] section of the SYSTEM.INI file. Driver entries have the form: </P>
<P>VIDC.<I>FOURCC</I>=<I>driver_filename</I> </P>
<P>The VIDC key word identifies the entry as a video compression or decompression driver. The <I>FOURCC</I> portion is typically the four-character code used to identify the driver but it is not restricted to it. (This entry must have one to four characters and a period "."separates it from the VIDC keyword.) The <I>driver_filename</I> portion of the entry is the filename of the driver. </P>
<P>Drivers can use an OEMSETUP.INF to install this entry. </P>
<P>When ICM locates a driver, it first uses the driver entry with the four-character code matching the four-character code specified by the application. If that driver is not suitable, ICM ignores the four-character code in the entry and will try other VIDC entries until it finds a suitable driver. </P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
