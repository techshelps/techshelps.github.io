<H3>Adding Elements to the Printer INF File </H3><P>An INF file that installs a printer can include a color profile for the printer with two added elements: </P>
<UL><LI>     The name of the profile specified in the list of dependent files for the printer (which will allow the profile to be propagated/copied along with other printer driver files for "point and print" printer driver installation in Windows 95). </LI><LI>     The destination directory for the profile specified as the \Windows\System\Color directory. </LI></UL><P></P>
<P>Further information and examples for each of these elements is given in the sections below. </P>
<H4><A NAME="sec0"></A>Including the Profile in the Dependent File List </H4><P>The color profile must be included in the list of dependent files (that is, included in the CopyFiles= list entry in the INF file). For general information about Windows 95 INF files, see <I>About INF Files and the INF File Editor</I>. For an example CopyFiles= list entry that includes a color profile, see the entry for the Kodak&reg; ColorEase printer in the MSPRINT.INF file. </P>
<P>Multiple color profiles, which are used for different media types or driver configurations, can be included in the list of dependent files. </P>
<H4><A NAME="sec1"></A>Copying the Profile to the Correct Subdirectory </H4><P>The color profile must copied to the \Windows\System\Color directory. For an example of a qualified directory name in the INF file, see the entry for the Kodak ColorEase printer in the MSPRINT.INF file. </P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
