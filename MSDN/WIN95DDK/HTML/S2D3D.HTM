<H2>User Interface </H2><P>This section describes the user interface common to all networks. </P>
<P>The description primarily aims to describe how the Explorer browses networks, makes and breaks connections to network resources and how authentication is done. </P>
<P>A goal is to have as much common presentation between networks as possible without preventing NPs from using their own dialogs where necessary for network specific operations (such as authentication or browsing). To this end dialogs are provided by the MPR which can be used by any NP for connecting and authentication. </P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
