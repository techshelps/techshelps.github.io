<H3>Driver Registration </H3><P>When the IOS first loads a device driver, whether at boot time or later, it sends a SYS_DYNAMIC_DEVICE_INIT message to the driver. In response to this message, the driver is expected to register with the I/O supervisor. Registered device drivers receive notifications of certain events and configuration changes. </P>
<P>During registration, every driver must provide an entry point which the IOS can call to report asynchronous events. Asynchronous events include such things as device arrival, device departure, and time-out requests. If a driver also wishes to process I/O requests for a given device, it must also provide an I/O request entry point. </P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
