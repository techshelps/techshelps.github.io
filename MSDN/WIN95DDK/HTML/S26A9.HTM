<H3>Using Soft Keyboard </H3><P>    1.     The IME may need to create a better user interface for a soft keyboard, or it may need to use the system predefined soft keyboard. If IME needs to use the system predefined soft keyboard, it needs to specify UI_CAP_SOFTKBD in the <B>fdwUICaps</B> member of the <B>IMEINFO</B> structure when calling <B>ImeInquire</B>. </P>
<P>    2.     The IME can call <B>ImmCreateSoftKeyboard</B> to create a window for the soft keyboard, and it can call <B>ImmShowSoftKeyboard</B> to show or hide it. The soft keyboard window is one component of the UI window, so the owner should be the UI window. </P>
<P>    3.     The IME may need to decide whether to destroy the window whenever the focus is gone. The soft keyboard may occupy some system resources. </P>
<P>    4.     There are different types of soft keyboard. One type may be designed for a specific country or for a special purpose. The way to change reading characters may be different for each type of soft keyboard. There are two ways to change reading characters: use IMC_SETSOFKBDSUBTYPE or IMC_SETSOFKBDDATA. Different types of soft keyboards have different window procedures and present different user interfaces to the user. </P>
