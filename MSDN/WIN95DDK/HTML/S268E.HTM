<H3>IME Aware Applications </H3><P>There are the following types of applications: </P>
<UL><LI>     IME unaware applications : This type of application never intends to control the IME. However, if the application accepts DBCS characters, the user can enter any DBCS character into the application using IME. </LI><LI>     IME half-aware applications: This type of application typically controls various contexts of IME, such as open and close, composition form, and so on, but it does not display any user interface for IME. </LI><LI>     IME full-aware applications: This type of application is typically responsible for displaying any information given to it by IME. </LI></UL><P></P>
<P>In Windows 95, one IME unaware application is supported with one default IME window and one default input context. </P>
<P>An IME half-aware application creates its own IME windows using the predefined "IME" class, and may or may not handle its own input context. </P>
<P>An IME full-aware application handles the input context by itself. It displays any necessary information given by the input context. It does not use the IME window. </P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
