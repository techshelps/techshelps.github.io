<H2>Introduction to the Windows 95 IR Communications Driver </H2><P>Congratulations! You are the proud owner of the Microsoft&reg; Windows&reg; 95 Infrared (IR) communications driver. After you install the IR communications driver you can start replacing your serial and parallel cable connections with wireless IR links. </P>
<P>Wireless communications between computers is a new thing. And you're part of it! Have fun experimenting with wireless IR links between your computers and printers. </P>
<P>The Version 1.0 IR communications driver is a set of software components that you can add to a Windows 95 computer to enable that computer to send and receive data over IR communications links. Installing the IR communications driver is as simple as running the Setup program that is one of the driver components. </P>
<P>The IR communications driver supports IR communications links running up to 115.2 kilobytes per second (Kbps). The infrared hardware can be built into your Windows 95 computer or added by attaching an infrared adapter to a serial or parallel port. A future release of the IR communications driver will add support for high-speed IR devices which run at 1.152 and 4.0 megabytes per second (Mbps). </P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
