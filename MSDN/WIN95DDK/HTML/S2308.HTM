<H2>Creating a Device Driver </H2><P>You create a device driver either by adapting a sample driver, or writing a driver from scratch. You can write Windows device drivers in assembly language or in a high-level language such as the C language. Assembly language programmers can use the CMACROS assembly-language macro package. </P>
<P>To create a device driver, you need to: </P>
<P>    1.     Read the chapter in this manual that describes the driver for your type of device. </P>
<P>    2.     Write the required driver functions. </P>
<P>    3.     Create and compile the required resources. </P>
<P>Every device driver must have at least a VERSIONINFO resource that contains the version stamp for the driver. Setup and Control Panel both look for this resource when installing drivers. </P>
<P>    4.     Create a module-definition file that identifies the appropriate module name for your driver, and exports the required functions. </P>
<P>    5.     Assemble and link your driver. </P>
<P>    6.     Test your driver using the debugging version of Windows. </P>
<P>    7.     Create an installation file (*.INF) for your driver and related files. </P>
<P>    8.     Create your final distribution disk or disks. </P>
