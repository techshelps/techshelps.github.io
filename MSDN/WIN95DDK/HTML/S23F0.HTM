<H2>Multiple Logical Devices - non-overlapping resources </H2><P>This is the most common flavor of multifunction cards and the one recommended for full Windows 95 Plug and Play compatibility. The Plug and Play ISA specification and the PCI specifications define a standard way for identifying and configuring the various logical devices on a given physical board. The logical devices included in these boards must be functionally independent, electrically isolated, consume different resources and are treated as separate devices with independent INFs and drivers. </P>
<P>For example a display adapter that has video acceleration functions on a separate chip will specify two separate logical devices with distinct device IDs. Each logical device will be supported by a dedicated driver. The two drivers may interact among themselves via a private interface. </P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
