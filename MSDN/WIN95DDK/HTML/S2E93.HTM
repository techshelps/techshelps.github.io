<H2>About the Pen Calibration Application </H2><P>The pen calibration application is an extension to the Windows 95 Control Panel pen icon. When the user opens the General panel of the Control Panel Pen property sheet, one of the controls on the panel is the <B>Align Now</B> button. The pen calibration applet (PENCAL.DLL) executes when the user selects the <B>Align Now</B> button. </P>
<P>The pen calibration source code is in the Windows 95 DDK directory \PEN\SAMPLES\PENCAL. In general, there are two reasons why you may need to change the pen calibration application: </P>
<UL><LI>     Your digitizer may have resolutions other than 640x480; the pen calibration application is limited to aligning the pen for 640x480 digitizers only. </LI><LI>     The calibration requirements for your digitizer may include gathering data items that are not part of the <B>DRV_CALBSTRUCT</B> structure the pen calibration applet uses to communicate calibration to the pen Unidriver. For a definition of the members of the <B>DRV_CALBSTRUCT</B> structure, see the "Reference" section in <I>About the Pen Driver</I>. </LI></UL><P></P>
<P><B>Note </B></P>
<P>The purpose of pen calibration is to align the cursor display with the location of the pen tip on devices that have the display integrated with the digitizer. The pen calibration applet cannot be used on opaque tablets and the Align Now button is inactive in the Windows 95 Control Panel Pen property sheet when an opaque tablet is installed. </P>
