<H2>About Selector Management </H2><P>A selector identifies a protected-mode segment. The VMM provides services for creating and destroying selectors, and for converting between selector:offset and flat addresses. Because virtual devices use a flat memory model, these services are used primarily to share memory with 16-bit protected mode applications. </P>
<P>Each segment has a base linear address, limit, and specific permissions. The limit (size) is measured either in bytes or pages depending on the segment's granularity. The properties of a segment are contained in a hardware-defined data structure called a segment descriptor. </P>
<P>Segment descriptors are contained in two arrays called the global descriptor table (GDT) and the local descriptor table (LDT). There is only one GDT, whereas there is a different LDT for each protected mode virtual machine (VM). If bit 2 (value 4) of a selector is zero, the selector is an index into the GDT; otherwise it is an index into the current LDT. </P>
<P>Virtual devices should not modify the GDT or LDT directly. To define a new segment, use the <B>_Allocate_GDT_Selector</B> or <B>_Allocate_LDT_Selector</B> service. You can modify a segment descriptor by using the <B>_SetDescriptor</B> service. For example, you might allocate multiple selectors and then use the <B>_SetDescriptor</B> service to change the base address and limit associated with all but the first selector. You can retrieve the descriptor associated with a selector by using the <B>_GetDescriptor</B> service. To free a selector, use the <B>_Free_GDT_Selector</B> or <B>_Free_LDT_Selector</B> service. </P>
<P>A segment descriptor is a 64-bit structure consisting of several bit fields. You can use the <B>_BuildDescriptorDWORDs</B> service to initialize a selector, rather than performing the necessary bit field operations yourself. You can use the return value of this service when you allocate or change a descriptor. </P>
<P>You can give an application read-only access to system data without allocating a selector. The <B>_GetAppFlatDSAlias</B> service returns a selector that maps the entire linear address space. The selector has read-only access to ensure system integrity. To give an application read-write access to system data, you should allocate a selector with an appropriate base address and limit. </P>
<P>A virtual device can convert a selector:offset address to a flat linear address by using the <B>_SelectorMapFlat</B> service. </P>
