<H3>WNetGetResourceParent </H3><P>This function can be called to navigate up from a resource, and enables browsing to commence based upon the name of a network resource. It also allows navigating up from a browsed resource to find connectable resources. </P>
<P><B>WNetGetResourceParent</B> can be called for names that were returned from a call to <B>WNetEnumResource. </B>Unlike WNetGetResourceInformation, if the resource syntactically has a parent, then this is returned by <B>WNetGetResourceParent</B>, whether or not the parent actually exists or not. </P>
<P><BR></P>
<PRE>DWORD WNetGetResourceParent(
    LPNETRESOURCE lpNetResource,
    LPVOID lpBuffer,
    LPDWORD lpBufferSize
    );
</PRE>
<P><I>lpNetResource</I> </P>
<P>This specifies the network resource for which the parent name is required. The <B>NETRESOURCE</B> could have been obtained via a previous <B>WNetEnumResource</B>, or constructed by the caller. The <I>lpRemoteName</I> field of the <B>NETRESOURCE</B> specifies the remote name of the network resource whose parent name is required. If the calling program knows the values for the <I>lpProvider</I>, and dwType fields (as it typically should, since it will have previously called <B>WNetGetResourceInformation</B>), then it should fill them in. Otherwise, it should set them to NULL. All other fields in the <B>NETRESOURCE</B> are ignored and do not have to be filled in. </P>
<P><I>lpBuffer</I> </P>
<P>A pointer to the buffer to receive the result, which is returned as a single <B>NETRESOURCE</B> entry representing the parent resource. The <I>lpRemoteName</I>, <I>lpProvider</I>, <I>dwType</I> and <I>dwUsage</I> fields are returned, all other fields being set to NULL. The remote name returned is in the same syntax as that returned from an enumeration, so that the caller can do a case sensitive string compare to determine whether an enumerated resouce is this resource. The provider name is returned only if it is known which network the resource belongs to. If several networks could own the resource, (as may be the case for a resource such as "\\server"), then <I>lpProvider</I> will be set to NULL. If a resource has no parent on any of the networks, then <I>lpRemoteName </I>is returned as NULL. If it is known that a network owns a parent of the resource, but that the resource itself is not valid, then <I>lpProvider</I> is returned as a non-null value together with a return status of WN_BAD_NETNAME. Note that if a network thinks that the object is on the network, but has no parent (e.g. a server that is not part of a workgroup), then there is the possibility that this API may return with <I>lpRemoteName</I> and <I>lpProvider</I> both set to NULL. The RESOURCEUSAGE_CONNECTABLE value in the <I>dwUsage</I> field does not indicate that the resource can currently be connected to, but that the resource is connectable when it is available on the network. </P>
<P><I>lpBufferSize</I> </P>
<P>This specifies the size in bytes of the buffer passed to the function call. If the result is WN_MORE_DATA, this will contain the buffer size required (in bytes) to hold the <B>NETRESOURCE</B> information. </P>
<UL><LI>     WN_SUCCESS if the call is successful. </LI></UL>
