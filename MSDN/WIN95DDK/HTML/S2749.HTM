<H3>Windows 95 LPT Contention Handler </H3><P>The role of the Windows 95 LPT contention handler (VPD) is to manage contention for LPT ports by VMs. </P>
<P>A VM is automatically granted port access if the port is not currently owned by another VM or VxD. </P>
<P>If there is a VxD owner, VPD sends it <B>RESOURCE_STEAL_REQUEST</B>. If this request succeeds, the port is assigned to the VM. Otherwise, the request fails and is reported to the user with a dialog message. </P>
<P>When a VxD or another VM attempts to steal a VM-owned port, VPD responds as follows: </P>
<UL><LI>     Warn: VPD displays a dialog box asking if the port should be assigned to the requesting VxD or VM. </LI><LI>     Fail: If the request is made by a VM, port access is silently trapped. If the request is made by a VxD, the acquire or steal call fails. </LI><LI>     Idle: The port is reassigned automatically if the port has been idle longer for a time-out period specified in Control Panel. Otherwise, the acquire/release request fails for a VxD, or port access is silently trapped for a VM. This is the default setting, with a default time-out period of 2 seconds. </LI></UL><P></P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
