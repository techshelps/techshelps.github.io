<H2>Step 8 -- Distributing Your INF File </H2><P>Since Windows 95 contains pre-existing modem INF files, care should be taken to avoid possible conflicts. If you plan to provide INF files for new modems not currently part of Windows 95 follow these steps. For information relevant to distributing your modem INF file on a diskette, see <I>Key Modem INF File Issues</I>. </P>
<UL><LI>     Users will normally install new INF files from a floppy disk or INF downloaded from your company BBS or other distribution point. For a new modem not currently listed in Windows 95, create an INF containing that modem exclusively. </LI><LI>     Carefully search all pre-existing Windows 95 INFs for all new modem IDs in the new modem using the batch file outlined above or a suitable grep search utility. If rank 1 ID matches are found in other INF files, review the section above on resolving rank 1 ID matches. This is a good reason for modem manufacturers to change modem ID strings for each new modem released so that a simple rank 0 (unique) ID can be assigned to the new INF. In checking for matching ID strings you MUST check for ALL ID strings which may be present in the new modem. For example, PCMCIA modems have both tuple ID strings and Unimodem ID strings. Plug and Play modems likewise have more than one ID string and all must be checked and listed by appropriate INF ID rank. </LI><LI>     The new INF should contain entries covering ONLY that modem and should not contain entries for modems already listed in Windows 95. When a customer is prompted for a disk or directory from which to install the new INF, Windows 95 will automatically copy the new INF file to the correct INF subdirectory and rename it using the format OEMnnn.INF. Thus a permanent copy of the new INF file is stored with Windows 95. For this reason, copying the new file explicitly to the INF subdirectory is not necessary. </LI><LI>     DO NOT confuse the use of the CopyFiles entry discussed above with this process of copying and creating the OEMnnn. INF. The CopyFiles statement is only used for copying special VXD and other drivers which a modem might need. For example, some modems use a special parallel port driver or DSP-based driver. Copyfiles is used to transfer those drivers to Windows 95. </LI><LI>     Send Microsoft a copy of the new INF for potential inclusion in the Microsoft WDL (Windows Drivers Library) and subsequent updates of Windows 95. </LI></UL><P></P>
