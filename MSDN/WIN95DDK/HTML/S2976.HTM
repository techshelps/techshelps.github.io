<H2>Introduction </H2><P>The Windows&reg; 95 Modem Development Kit (MDK) provides the tools, sample INF files, and information you need to build and test Windows 95 format INF files for AT and AT+V command modems. AT command modems are data modems and AT+V command modems are voice modems. </P>
<P>Windows 95 INF files are required for modems to be used by programs which call the Windows Telephony API (TAPI) to make data/fax/voice calls, including the Windows 95 applets HyperTerminal, Dial-up Networking, Phone Dialer, The Microsoft Network as well as other Win32&reg; communications applications written for Windows 95. </P>
<P>The MDK is constantly being improved and the latest version of the MDK is available on an Internet FTP server at the URL ftp://ftp.microsoft.com/developr/drg/modem. </P>
<P>The current MDK, available on the FTP site, is a complete revision of the MDK that was supplied with the first release of the Windows 95 DDK. </P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
