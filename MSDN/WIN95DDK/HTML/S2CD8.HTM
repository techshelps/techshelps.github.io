<P>Address of an <B>ICDRAW</B> structure. </P>

<P>Size, in bytes, of the <B>ICDRAW</B> structure. </P>
<P>If the ICDRAW_UPDATE flag is set in <B>dwFlags</B> member of the <B>ICDRAW</B> structure, the area of the screen used for drawing is invalid and needs to be updated. The extent of updating depends on the contents of the <B>lpData</B> member. </P>
<P>If <B>lpData</B> is NULL, the driver should update the entire destination rectangle with the current image. If the driver does maintain a copy of the image in an offscreen buffer, it can fail this message. If <B>lpData</B> is not NULL, the driver should draw the data and make sure the entire destination is updated. </P>
<P>If the ICDRAW_HURRYUP flag is set in the <B>dwFlags</B> member, the calling application wants the driver to proceed as quickly as possible, possibly not even updating the screen. </P>
<P>If the ICDRAW_PREROLL flag is set in the <B>dwFlags</B> member, this video frame is preliminary information and should not be displayed if possible. For example, if play is to start from frame 10, and frame 0 is the nearest previous keyframe, frames 0 through 9 will have the ICDRAW_PREROLL flag set. </P>
<P>If you want the driver to decompress data into a buffer, send the ICM_DECOMPRESS message. </P>
