<P>Reserved. Should be ignored. </P>
<P>An asynchronous ACM driver must support this message. If the driver is converting data, it should stop immediately and mark all pending stream headers as done by clearing the ACMSTREAMHEADER_STATUSF_INQUEUE bit in the <B>fdwStatus</B> member of the <B>ACMDRVSTREAMHEADER</B> structure for each buffer. The driver should set the <B>cbSrcLengthUsed</B> and <B>cbDstLengthUsed</B> members of the structure appropriately. The driver should then notify the client by using <B>DriverCallback</B> to send an MM_ACM_DONE message for each buffer. </P>
<P>Note that the following parameters for the ACMDM_STREAM_RESET message will be validated before calling the driver: </P>
<UL><LI>     The <I>lParam1</I> parameter will contain a valid pointer to an <B>ACMDRVSTREAMINSTANCE</B> structure, with the same information as the corresponding ACMDM_STREAM_OPEN message. </LI><LI>     A driver will never be called to reset an asynchronous conversion stream unless the driver sets the ACMDRIVERDETAILS_SUPPORTF_ASYNC flag in the <B>fdwSupport</B> member of the <B>ACMDRIVERDETAILS</B> structure that is returned by the driver during the ACMDM_DRIVER_DETAILS message. </LI><LI>     A driver will never be called to reset a conversion stream that was not opened for asynchronous conversions. </LI></UL><P></P>
<P>The driver does not need to check for these conditions. </P>
