<H3>Profile Selection Interfaces </H3><P>The programming elements that graphics device interface (GDI) uses to obtain information used in ICM profile matching are the DeviceCapabilities function and the printer driver's DEVMODE structure. Windows 95 introduces two new DeviceCapabilities values, DC_ICC_MANUFACTURER and DC_ICC_MODEL. (DC_ICC_MANUFACTURER and DC_ICC_MODEL are defined as 23 and 24, respectively). A brief discussion of each is listed below. For a complete description of the DeviceCapabilities function, see the Win32 SDK and Windows 95 DDK documentation. Use of these values is strongly recommended, but not required. Cases in which printer drivers do not support these DeviceCapabilities values are discussed in a later section. </P>
<P>DC_ICC_MANUFACTURER returns a double-word value containing 4 bytes, which are interpreted as the 4-byte manufacturer tag that is used for color profile matching. DC_ICC_MODEL returns a double-word value containing 4 bytes, which are interpreted as the 4-byte model tag used for color profile matching. </P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
