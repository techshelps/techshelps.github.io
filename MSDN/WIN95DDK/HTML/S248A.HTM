<H2>Configuration Manager </H2><P>The Configuration Manager is the central component of the Plug and Play architecture. Working in conjunction with other components, the Configuration Manager finds workable configurations for all devices of the computer so that each device can use its assigned IRQ number, I/O port addresses, and other resources without conflict with other devices. The Configuration Manager also helps monitor the computer for changes in the number and type of devices present and manages the reconfiguration of the devices as needed when changes take place. </P>
<P>The Configuration Manager works in conjunction with enumerators, resource arbitrators, device loaders, and device drivers to create and maintain the configuration. It provides services and messages that these components use to carry out their configuration tasks. This chapter describes these services and messages and explains how they are used. </P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
