<H2>Pen Device Support Components </H2><P>The Windows pen device driver supports digitizing pen hardware from various manufacturers, and is a Unidriver. The pen calibration application enables the user to calibrate a digitizer by touching targets on the digitizer; the calibration information obtained is used by the driver in reporting pen position coordinates to Windows. The executable pen device support components are listed in the following table. </P>

<P>The terms <I>pen Unidriver</I> and <I>pen device driver</I> describe the combination of all three components. <I>Pen system</I> refers to the pen services of Microsoft Windows 95 provided by the PENWIN.DLL library. </P>
<P>After the Microsoft Windows 95 Device Driver Kit (DDK) is installed, the source code for the sample pen Unidriver components are in sub directories under the directory \PEN\SAMPLES. The virtual pen driver source code is in the \PEN\SAMPLES\VPEND sub directory, the pen driver source code is in the \PEN\SAMPLES\PEN sub directory, the pen driver interface source code is in the \PEN\SAMPLES\PENUI subdirectory, and the calibration application source code is in the \PEN\SAMPLES\PENCAL sub directory. The common header files for all the components are in \PEN\INC. </P>
<P>The Unidriver architecture allows the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) to quickly create a custom pen device driver tailored for a specific device. The OEM developer need only remove unnecessary portions from the code and optionally modify or enhance other portions. For more information on how to modify the Unidriver source code for a specific pen device, see . </P>
<P>Regardless of the pen driver an OEM develops, the OEM must ensure that its hardware supports the documented procedures of the pen Unidriver. </P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
