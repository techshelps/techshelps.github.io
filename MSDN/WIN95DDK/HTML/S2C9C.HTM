<H3>The Structure of a Video Compression and Decompression Driver </H3><P>Video compression and decompression drivers are dynamic-link libraries (DLLs) usually written in C or assembly language, or a combination of the two languages. </P>
<P>As installable drivers, these drivers will provide a <B>DriverProc</B> entry point. For general information about installable drivers, the <B>DriverProc</B> entry point, and system messages sent to this entry point, see . </P>
<P>This chapter includes supplemental information for the system messages. This information describes specifically how compression and decompression drivers should respond to the system messages that are critical to their proper operation. </P>
<P>Video compression and decompression drivers also use the <B>DriverProc</B> entry point to process messages specifically for video compression and decompression. Information on how drivers use the <B>DriverProc</B> entry point to process these messages is contained in this chapter. </P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
