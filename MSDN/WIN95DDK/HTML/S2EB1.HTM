<H2>About Printer Minidrivers </H2><P>A <I>printer minidriver</I> is an executable file that provides device-driver support for a particular type or class of printer. It contains data that describes the capabilities, commands, and resident fonts of the printer. A printer minidriver also includes a set of required entry points that the Microsoft Windows&reg; graphic device interface GDI calls to retrieve information about the printer and to send information to the printer. </P>
<P>Although it contains the required entry points, a minidriver does not actually carry out the actions requested by GDI. Instead, the minidriver calls the <I>Universal Printer Driver</I> (<I>Unidriver</I>), providing the information that the Unidriver needs to carry out the requested actions on the device (such as printing text, rendering bitmaps, or advancing a page). </P>
<P>The Unidriver greatly simplifies the task of developing a Windows printer driver. Instead of developing code to support all of the functions that GDI requires, a driver developer need only create a minidriver that provides the information about the printer. By using the Unidriver, a driver developer who understands the hardware and command set for a printer can develop a driver with comparatively little effort. </P>
<P></P>
<P><B>Note </B></P>
<P>The Windows 95 Unidriver does not support color Desk jet printers, plotters, Adobe PostScript&reg; printers, and printers that use printer-control languages which are similar to PostScript. For these devices, a vendor may use the Microsoft-provided drivers (see <I>About Windows 95 Printer Drivers</I> for a list of the names of these drivers). You may need to create a Windows printer driver that fully implements all of the functions required by GDI for these three types of printers, see <I>About Windows 95 Printer Drivers</I> for more information. </P>
