<H3>Resource Map </H3><P>This entry in the INF is used in the [InstallSection.mf] section. When installing an EISA Multifunction Card, the resources are not really assigned to the parent board but rather to the independent functions. The EISA enumerator, however, reports only the parent device and reports all resources as belonging to the common parent. This section will tell the configuration manager how to divide the parent resource between the children. the resource map is a binary format record added using an addreg command, where each byte represents the ordinal of the EISA resource record belonging to the child. This is not a bitmap, it is a list of ordinals. There is a limit of 256 EISA ordinal values. </P>
