<H2>Introduction </H2><P>The Advanced SCSI Programming Interface (ASPI) has become an industry standard SCSI software interface in the DOS, Windows, OS/2, and Netware environments. ASPI allows developers to write device drivers and applications which are independent of the specific host adapter platform used to connect SCSI peripherals. With ASPI, there is a single driver managing the host bus adapter, eliminating conflicts when multiple applications try to access the SCSI bus at the same time. </P>
<P>With the arrival of Windows NT and Windows 95, ASPI must be extended to allow applications to take full advantage of these new, 32-bit operating systems. This specification describes the Advanced SCSI Programming Interface (ASPI) for the Win32 environment. </P>
<P></P>
<P><B>Note: </B></P>
<P>This specification defines the protocol between ASPI client applications and the ASPI Manager wnaspi32.dll. The specification does not describe the protocol between wnaspi32.dll and the target Win32 environment, since this implementation may vary between operating systems. </P>
