<H2>Modifying the Pen Driver User Interface </H2><P>The pen driver user interface is displayed as part of the installation process when Pen Services for Windows 95 is installed. After that, the interface is available to the user through the Pen icon in the Windows 95 Control Panel. When the user double-clicks on the Pen icon, the Pen Properties property sheet is displayed with several tabs. Click on the General tab and then click on the Pen Options button and the Pen Driver Configuration Dialog generated by PENUI.DLL will be displayed. </P>
<P>The version of PENUI.DLL supplied with the sample pen driver generates a dialog with three parts: </P>
<UL><LI>     The Model drop down list displays the manufacturer and model of all the digitizers supported by the driver so the user can select the digitizer they are using. For the sample pen driver, this list has four choices: Wacom\SD-510C, Wacom\HD-648A, Wacom\HD-UD-0608-R, and Compaq\Concerto. There is also a choice that disables the tablet hardware. </LI><LI>     The Serial Device buttons enable the user to specify which COM port the digitizer is connected to. In Windows 95, the digitizer is not a Plug and Play device, so the system does not detect which COM port a digitizer is connected to. </LI><LI>     The Pressure check box enables the user to specify whether or not their digitizer senses stylus pressure and reports different levels of pressure to the pen driver. </LI></UL><P></P>
<P>If your pen driver needs the user to specify more information about the hardware than the three items above, then you will have to change the source code and produce a PENUI.DLL that displays a different dialog. For example, if your tablet does not have support for stylus pressure sensitivity, then you will probably want to eliminate the check box in the dialog that prompts the user to check the Pressure option. Or, if your tablet does support pressure sensitivity, you may want to change the prompt from "Pressure" to a more self-descriptive prompt such as "Pressure sensitivity" or "Pressure sensitivity support." </P>
<P>You may also want to change the items in the Model drop down list, so it includes the name of your digitizer and does not present the names of digitizers that are incompatible with yours. </P>
<P>This section gives more information about the source code in the DDK \PEN\SAMPLES\PENUI directory so it will be easier for you to make these changes. </P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
