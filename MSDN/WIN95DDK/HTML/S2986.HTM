<H3>Tools for Creating Modem INF Files </H3><P>Three tools that can be used to create modem INF files are: </P>
<UL><LI>     Use a text editor to work directly on the INF file; the editor must be able to save the INF file as ASCII text. If you are experienced in working with INF files, this may be quickest and most flexible tool for creating your INF file. Notepad is an example of an ASCII text editor on your Windows 95 computer, but you can use any editor you are used to that saves a file as pure ASCII text. </LI><LI>     Use the Infedit tool, which presents a graphical user interface that prompts you for information to put into an INF file and builds the INF file for you. InfEdit is a great tool to use to create your INF file if you have never worked with INF files before or have trouble working with INF files because InfEdit takes care of a lot of the structural details for you. InfEdit is available on the Windows 95 DDK. </LI><LI>     Use Profile Calculator to compose profile-type values to put in your INF file. </LI></UL><P></P>
<P>Note that you can alternately use your text editor and InfEdit to work on the same INF file. For example, you open a modem INF file with InfEdit (from WINDOWS\INF) and do some editing there, save the new version of the INF, reopen it in your text editor, and do the rest of the edits there. If you want to do cut and paste edits, you will have to do those in your text editor. </P>
<H4><A NAME="sec0"></A>Using the Infedit Tool </H4><P>For full instructions for using the Infedit user interface to build or adapt an INF file, see <I>About INF Files and the INF File Editor</I>. An example of building a complete INF file from scratch using Infedit is given in <I>Getting Started Using Infedit</I>. </P>
<H4><A NAME="sec1"></A>Using the Profile Calculator </H4><P>Full instructions for using the Profile Calculator user interface to build and analyze profile string values is in the Help file PROFILE.HLP that comes with the Profile Calculator. There is also a README file that comes with the Profile Calculator that contains the same information as the .HLP file. Following are some excerpts from PROFILE.HLP which introduce you to the tool. </P>
<P>Profile Calculator can be used to create, edit or translate properties lines within Windows 95 modem INF files. Modem INF properties lines contain device properties settings that are transferred from an INF file to the Windows 95 Registry at the time a device is installed. A properties line is a single line in an INF file without text wrapping. The following are examples of typical properties lines in a modem INF: </P>
<P><BR></P>
<PRE>HKR,, VoiceProfile, 1, 27,03,00,00
HKR,, Properties, 1, 80,01,00,00, ff,00,00,00, 00,00,00,00, 07,00,00,00, 07,00,00,00, 77,03,00,00, 00,c2,01,00, 40,38,00,00
</PRE>
<P>The Profile Calculator graphical user interface translates the double-word hexadecimal values that are in a properties line to text values and associates labels with the values that describe what each value represents. </P>
<P>Profile Calculator can translate text values you input into an INF properties line that you can cut and paste into your INF file. Profile Calculator can also translate existing properties line values into text so you can interpret and analyze the property values. </P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
