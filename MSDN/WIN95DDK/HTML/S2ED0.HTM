<H2>About the Router and the Local Print Provider </H2><P>The Print Request Router (PPR) routes a data stream to the local print provider or to a network print provider. All printing tasks initiated by an application or a Windows 95 system component go through the PRR as the first step towards getting the job done in the spooler process. For an example of how the PRR is involved in both the process of spooling a print job and in the process of playing back (despooling) a print job, see <I>Typical Printing Process Scenario Using a Raw Spool File</I> and <I>Typical Printing Process Scenario Using an EMF Spool File</I>. </P>
<P>Microsoft provides the executable Print Request Router, which cannot be replaced by an IHV. </P>
<P>The local print provider puts jobs into spool files, manages despooling (playback of spooled files), and administers print jobs and open printers. For an example of how the local print provider puts jobs into spool files and manages the playback of spooled files, see <I>Typical Printing Process Scenario Using a Raw Spool File</I> and <I>Typical Printing Process Scenario Using an EMF Spool File</I>. </P>
<P>Microsoft provides the local print provider, which cannot be replaced by an IHV. </P>
<P>This section lists the APIs exported by the Microsoft-provided local print provider and then gives more details about how the router and local print provider administer print jobs and open printers. </P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
