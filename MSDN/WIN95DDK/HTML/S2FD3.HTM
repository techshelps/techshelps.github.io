<H3>Resolution of ISO 9660 Ambiguities for Wide Characters </H3><P>This specification resolves ISO 9660 ambiguities with respect to wide (16-bit) character sets, such as the UCS-2 character set. </P>
<H4><A NAME="sec0"></A>Wide Character Byte Ordering </H4><P>All UCS-2 characters shall be recorded according to ISO 9660:1988 section 7.2.2, 16-bit numerical value, most significant byte first ("Big Endian"). </P>
<H4><A NAME="sec1"></A>Allowed Character Set </H4><P>All UCS-2 code points shall be allowed except for the following UCS-2 code points: </P>
<P>All code points between (00)(00) and (00)(1F), inclusive. (Control Characters) </P>
<P>(00)(2A) '*'(Asterisk) </P>
<P>(00)(2F) '/' (Forward Slash) </P>
<P>(00)(3A) ':' (Colon) </P>
<P>(00)(3B) ';' (Semicolon) </P>
<P>(00)(3F) '?' (Question Mark) </P>
<P>(00)(5C) '\' (Backslash) </P>
<H4><A NAME="sec2"></A>Special Directory Identifiers </H4><P>Section 7.6 of ISO 9660 describes the recording of reserved directory identifiers for the root, current, and parent directory identifiers as single (00) or single (01) bytes. </P>
<P>In a wide character set, it is not possible to represent a character in a single byte. The following portions of the ISO 9660:1988 specification referring to reserved directory identifiers are ambiguous. </P>
<P>The ISO 9660:1988 sections in question are as follows: </P>
<UL><LI>     6.8.2.2 Identification of directories </LI><LI>     7.6.2 Reserved Directory Identifiers </LI><LI>     9.1.11 File Identifier </LI><LI>     9.4.5 Directory Identifier </LI></UL><P></P>
<P>These special case directory identifiers are not intended to represent characters in a graphic character set. These characters are placeholders, not characters. Therefore, these definitions remain unchanged on a volume recorded in Unicode. </P>
<P>Simply put, Special Directory Identifiers shall remain as 8-bit values, even on a UCS-2 volume, where other characters have been expanded to 16-bits. </P>
<H5><A NAME="sec3"></A>Root Directory </H5><P>The Directory Identifier of a Directory Record describing the Root Directory shall consist of a single (00) byte. </P>
<H5><A NAME="sec4"></A>Current Directory </H5><P>The Directory Identifier of the first Directory Record of each directory shall consist of a single (00) byte. </P>
<H5><A NAME="sec5"></A>Parent Directory </H5><P>The Directory Identifier of the second Directory Record of each directory shall consist of a single (01) byte. </P>
<H4><A NAME="sec6"></A>Separator Characters </H4><P>The separator characters SEPARATOR 1 and SEPARATOR 2 are specified as 8-bit characters, which can not be represented in a wide character set, so the ISO 9660:1988 specification sections referring to SEPARATOR 1 and SEPARATOR 2 are ambiguous. The ISO 9660:1988 sections in question are as follows: </P>
<UL><LI>     7.4.3 Separators </LI><LI>     7.5.1 File Identifier format </LI><LI>     7.5.2 File Identifier length </LI><LI>     8.4.24 Abstract File Identifier </LI><LI>     8.4.25 Bibliographic File Identifier </LI><LI>     8.5.17 Copyright File Identifier </LI><LI>     8.5.19 Bibliographic File Identifier </LI><LI>     9.1.11 File Identifier </LI></UL><P></P>
<P>The values SEPARATOR 1 and SEPARATOR 2 shall be represented differently depending on the d1 character set. </P>
<P>In the case of an SVD identifying a UCS-2 character set, the values of SEPARATOR 1 and SEPARATOR 2 shall be recorded as a UCS-2 character with an equivalent code point value. </P>
<P>Otherwise, the definitions of SEPARATOR 1 and SEPARATOR 2 shall be recorded according to section 7.4.3 of ISO 9660:1988. </P>
<P>Simply put, SEPARATOR 1 and SEPARATOR 2 shall be expanded to 16-bits. </P>

<H4><A NAME="sec7"></A>Sort Ordering </H4><P>ISO 9660 specifies the order of path table records within a path table, and specifies the order of directory records within a directory. These sorting algorithms assume an 8-bit character set is used. These sorting algorithms are ambiguous when used with wide characters. </P>
<P>The ISO 9660:1988 sections in question are as follows: </P>
<UL><LI>     6.9.1 Order of Path Table Records </LI><LI>     9.3 Order of Directory Records </LI></UL><P></P>
<P>The only change required is to redefine the value of the sort justification pad byte to zero (00). </P>
<P>Simply put, comparing the byte contents in all positions remains a suitable sorting algorithm for the descriptor fields recorded in a UCS-2 SVD Directory Hierarchy. This is one of the primary reasons for selecting the Big Endian format to represent all UCS-2 characters. </P>
<H5><A NAME="sec8"></A>Natural Language Sorting </H5><P>On a Unicode volume, the 16-bit UCS-2 code points are used to determine the Order of Path Table Records and the Order of Directory Records. </P>
<P>No attempt will be made to provide natural language sorting on the media. Natural language sorting may optionally be provided by a display application as desired. </P>
<H5><A NAME="sec9"></A>Justification Pad Bytes </H5><P>The sort ordering algorithms as specified in ISO 9660:1988 sections 6.9.1 and 9.3 are acceptable except for the value of the justification "pad byte". </P>
<P>The value of the justification "pad byte" as specified in ISO 9660:1988 section 6.9.1 shall be (00). This is changed from a value of (20) as specified in that same section. </P>
<P>The value of the justification "pad byte" as specified in ISO 9660:1988 section 9.3 subsections (a) and (b) shall be (00). This is changed from a value of (20) as specified in those same sections. </P>
<P>The value of the justification "pad byte" as specified in ISO 9660:1988 section 9.3 subsections (c) shall be (00). This is changed from a value of (30) as specified in that same section. </P>
<P>Simply put, set all the justification "pad bytes" to zero to simplify sorting. </P>
<H5><A NAME="sec10"></A>Mandatory Sort Ordering. </H5><P>Correct sort ordering is mandatory on UCS-2 volumes. </P>
<H5><A NAME="sec11"></A>Descriptor Fields affected by the UCS-2 Escape Sequence </H5><P>If a UCS-2 escape sequence is detected in a supplementary volume descriptor, the following descriptor fields referenced from that supplementary volume descriptor shall contain UCS-2 characters. </P>
<P>ISO 9660:1988 Section 8.5.4 System Identifier </P>

<H4><A NAME="sec12"></A>Relaxation of ISO 9660 Restrictions on UCS-2 Volumes </H4><P>Several ISO 9660 restrictions will be relaxed to achieve a more useful recording specification. Joliet receiving systems shall be capable of receiving media recorded with restrictions which have been relaxed relative to ISO 9660. </P>
<H5><A NAME="sec13"></A>Maximum File Identifier Length Increased </H5><P>Joliet receiving systems shall receive directory hierarchies recorded with file identifiers longer than those allowed by ISO 9660 receiving systems. </P>
<P>ISO 9660 (Section 7.5.1) states that the sum of the following shall not exceed 30: </P>
<UL><LI>     If there is a file name, the length of the file name. </LI><LI>     If there is a file name extension, the length of the file name extension. </LI></UL><P></P>
<P>On Joliet compliant media, however, the sum as calculated above shall not exceed 128, to allow for longer file identifiers. </P>
<P>The above lengths shall be expressed as a number of bytes. </P>
<H5><A NAME="sec14"></A>Maximum Directory Identifier Length Increased </H5><P>Joliet receiving systems shall receive directory hierarchies recorded with file names longer than those allowed by ISO 9660 receiving systems. </P>
<P>ISO 9660 (Section 7.6.3) states that the length of a directory identifier shall not exceed 31. </P>
<P>On Joliet compliant media, however, the length of a directory identifier shall not exceed 128, to allow for longer directory identifiers. </P>
<P>The above lengths shall be expressed as a number of bytes. </P>
<H5><A NAME="sec15"></A>Directory Names May Have File Name Extensions </H5><P>ISO 9660 does not allow directory identifiers to contain file name extensions. </P>
<P>On Joliet compliant media, however, directory identifiers may contain file name extensions. </P>
<P>The Joliet directory identifier format shall be calculated according to ISO 9660 section 7.5.1 "File Identifier format", with the exception that the length of a directory identifier may exceed 31, but shall not exceed 128. </P>
<P>In addition, the Joliet directory identifier format shall comply with ISO 9660 section 7.6.2 "Reserved Directory Identifiers". </P>
<P>The directory identifier length shall be calculated according to ISO 9660 section 7.5.2 "File Identifier length". </P>
<P>The above lengths shall be expressed as a number of bytes. </P>
<H5><A NAME="sec16"></A>Maximum Directory Hierarchy Depth May Exceed 8 Levels </H5><P>ISO 9660 (Section 6.8.2.1) specifies restrictions regarding the Depth of Directory Hierarchy. This section of ISO 9660 specifies that this number of levels in the hierarchy shall not exceed eight. </P>
<P>On Joliet compliant media, however, the number of levels in the hierarchy may exceed eight. </P>
<P>Joliet compliant media shall comply with the remainder of ISO 9660 section 6.8.2.1, so that for each file recorded, the sum of the following shall not exceed 240: </P>
<UL><LI>     the length of the file identifier; </LI><LI>     the length of the directory identifiers of all relevant directories; </LI><LI>     the number of relevant directories. </LI></UL><P></P>
<P>The above lengths shall be expressed as a number of bytes. </P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
