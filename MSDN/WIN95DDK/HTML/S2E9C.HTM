<H3>Printer Installation Changes </H3><P>Installing printers by adding data to WIN.INI is no longer recommended. </P>
<P>Through its Plug and Play components, Windows 95 supports automatically identifying and installing printers that report device IDs as described in the IEEE 1284 specification, or prompting the user for an installation diskette if needed). Printer extensions have been added to the Windows 95 INF file format to promote Plug and Play printer installation. The OEMSETUP.INF format for printer driver installation used in Windows 3.1 is supported in Windows 95, but all vendors are encouraged to use the new Windows 95 INF file format and the new printer extensions. </P>
<P>Win32 API support for installing printers is part of Windows 95. </P>
<P>Printers can be installed over a network by using the Windows 95 Point and Print feature. </P>
<P>For detailed information about all of these Windows 95 printer installation changes, see <I>About the Router and the Local Print Provider</I>. </P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
