<H3>WNetGetResourceInformation </H3><P>Called to find out enumeration information for a network resource. This is typically used when an object is typed in by a user. Calling this function in conjunction with <B>WNetGetResourceParent</B> determines the placement and nature of the resource in the browse hierarchy. Unlike <B>WNetGetResourceParent</B>, <B>WNetGetResourceInformation</B> always tries to determine the network provider that owns the resource and the type of the resource, although it may not be currently accessible (or even exist if the type of the resource was specified by the caller). </P>
<P><BR></P>
<PRE>DWORD WNetGetResourceInformation (
    LPNETRESOURCE lpNetResource,
    LPVOID lpBuffer,
    LPDWORD cbBuffer,
    LPTSTR *lplpSystem
    );
</PRE>
<P><I>lpNetResource</I> </P>
<P>This specifies the network resource for which the information is required. The <I>lpRemoteName</I> field of the <B>NETRESOURCE</B> specifies the remote name of the network resource. This would have typically been typed in by a user. If the calling program knows the values for the <I>lpProvider</I>, and dwType fields, then it should fill them in, because this operation can be expensive, especially without the dwType . Otherwise, it should set them to NULL. All other fields in the <B>NETRESOURCE</B> are ignored and do not have to be filled in. </P>
<P><I>lpBuffer</I> </P>
<P>A pointer to the buffer to receive the result. The first field in the buffer is a <B>NETRESOURCE</B> structure. The <I>dwScope</I>, <I>lpRemoteName</I>, <I>lpProvider</I>, <I>dwType</I> and <I>dwUsage</I> fields are returned, all other fields being set to NULL. The remote name returned is in the same syntax as that returned from an enumeration, so that the caller can do a case sensitive string compare to determine whether an enumerated resouce is this resource. The provider name is always returned when it is known which network the resource belongs to. If the resource cannot be found on any of the networks, then <I>lpRemoteName </I>is returned as NULL, and <I>lpProvider</I> may not be NULL if a parent for the resource is known to be on one of the networks. <I>dwScope</I> is returned as RESOURCE_CONTEXT if the network resource is part of the user's network context, otherwise it is returned as zero. </P>
<P><I>cbBuffer</I> </P>
<P>This specifies the size of the buffer passed to the function call. If the buffer is too small to receive even one entry, this variable receives the required size of the buffer. </P>
<P><I>lplpSystem</I> </P>
<P>Returned pointer to a string in the buffer pointed to by <I>lpBuffer</I> that specifies the part of the resource that is accessed through system resource type specific APIs rather than WNet APIs. For example, if the input remote resource name was "\\server\share\dir", then <I>lpRemoteName</I> is returned pointing to "\\server\share" and <I>lplpSystem</I> points to "\dir", both strings being stored in the buffer pointed to by <I>lpBuffer</I>. </P>
