<H2>Introduction </H2><P>Windows&reg; 95 supplies a default port monitor, language monitor, and print processor. The topic "Spooler Components and IHV Development Opportunities" in  gives the reasons you may want to develop one or more of these components for your device and package each component as a separate DLL. Once you have developed such a DLL, there are two methods of installing the component so it will be part of the spooler's environment: </P>
<UL><LI>     Use Win32 APIs such as <B>AddPrintProcessor</B> and <B>AddMonitor</B>. </LI><LI>     Use the printer-specific extensions to INF files provided by the Windows 95 printer installer. </LI></UL><P></P>
<P>Although this part of the Windows 95 DDK is about the print spooler subsystem (of which print processors, language monitors, and port monitors are part), it is not possible to discuss vendor-provided monitor and print processor installation without discussing Windows 95 printer installation in general and printer driver installation in particular. There are several ways to install a printer under Windows 95: </P>
<UL><LI>     A printer which is not locally attached may be selected from the Explorer and have support (drivers) installed. For more information, see . </LI><LI>     Any Win32 application can call <B>AddPrinter</B>, <B>AddPrinterDriver</B>, <B>AddPrintProcessor</B>, and <B>AddMonitor</B> and other such functions to install printer support explicitly. Under Windows 95, applications should not attempt to install printer support by writing directly to WIN.INI. For more information, see . </LI><LI>     The printer may be detected via Plug and Play if it is locally attached and supports the IEEE 1284 specification for supplying a device ID value. For more information, see . </LI><LI>     Printer support (drivers) may be manually installed using the icon labeled "Add Printer" in the Printers folder. For more information, see  and . </LI></UL><P></P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
