<H2>Legacy multifunction devices </H2><P>Windows 95 provides a mechanism which allows mapping a single physical device to multiple logical devices even when the appropriate identification and configuration structures are missing or lacking. In this case the Windows 95 configuration manager creates the various logical devices based on information included in the INF file of the physical device. The class for these cards is defined in the INF as "Multifunction" and the Ids and the specific driver and configuration information for each of the logical devices is included in the INF as well. When Windows 95 detects a "multifunction" device it will install each of the logical devices listed in the INF separately, then enumerate each of them every boot or whenever the physical device is plugged in (in the case of hot plug-able devices). The following section describes the structure of the INF file for multifunction devices and provides an example of a multifunction PCMCIA card. </P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
