<H2>About the Pen Driver </H2><P>The main purposes of the pen driver (PENC.DRV) are to: </P>
<UL><LI>     Send data received from the virtual pen driver to Windows 95 clients, such as the Pen Services for Windows 95 system component, PENWIN.DLL. </LI><LI>     Respond to messages sent by clients using the Windows <B>SendDriverMessage</B> function. </LI></UL><P></P>
<P>The pen driver is completely independent of the hardware. The OEM developer need not modify any portion of the PENC.DRV module so this chapter may be of little interest to a pen device OEM. The purpose of this chapter is to document the Windows messages that the pen driver recognizes in case the OEM wants to write a pen application (for example, an application that tests or demonstrates the vendor's pen device). The Windows messages recognized by the pen driver are documented in summary form in Appendix D of the <I>Programmer's Guide to Pen Services for Microsoft Windows 95</I>. This chapter of the Windows 95 DDK gives more details about each message. </P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
