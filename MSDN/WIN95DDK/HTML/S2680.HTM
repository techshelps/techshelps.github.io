<P>Specifies the dimensions, attributes, and bits of a physical bitmap. </P>
<P><B>bmWidthBytes</B> </P>
<P>Number of bytes in each raster line of the bitmap. The number of bytes must be even; all raster lines must be aligned on 16-bit boundaries. </P>
<P><B>bmBits</B> </P>
<P>Address of an array of bits that specifies the pixels of the bitmap. The array must be aligned on a 16-bit boundary. </P>
<P><B>bmWidthPlanes</B> </P>
<P>Size, in bytes, of each color plane. It is equal to the product of <B>bmWidthBytes</B>*<B>bmHeight</B>. </P>
<P><B>bmlpPDevice</B> </P>
<P>Address of the <B>PDEVICE</B> structure that specifies the device for which this bitmap is compatible. </P>
<P><B>bmSegmentIndex</B> </P>
<P>Segment or selector offset for segments in the bitmap array. If the bitmap is less than 64K, this member is zero. </P>
<P><B>bmScanSegment</B> </P>
<P>The number of raster lines contained in each segment of the bitmap array. If the bitmap is less than 64K, this member is zero. </P>
<P><B>bmFillBytes</B> </P>
<P>The number of extra bytes in each segment. GDI allocates storage for the bitmap array in 16-byte multiples. </P>
<P>If the bitmap bits exceed 64K, GDI allocates a two or more segments to store the bitmap. In such cases, the <B>bmScanSegment</B> member specifies the number of raster lines stored in each segment, with <B>bmFillBytes</B> that specifies any additional bytes needed to round the segment size out to a multiple of 16; no segment contains more than 64K. The total number of segments is equal to the quotient of <B>bmHeight</B> divided by <B>bmScanSegment</B> rounded up by one if the remainder is not zero. The selector (or segment address) for each segment is a multiple of <B>bmSegmentIndex</B>. </P>
<P>GDI stores the bits in the bitmap array as raster lines, with the raster line representing the top of the bitmap stored first. If the bitmap has more than one plane, GDI stores the first raster lines for all planes at the beginning of the array, stores the second raster lines next, and so on. The following shows the layout for a 4-plane bitmap: </P>
<P><BR></P>
<PRE>Plane 0, first raster line
Plane 1, first raster line
Plane 2, first raster line
Plane 3, first raster line
Plane 0, second raster line
        .
        .
        .
Plane 0, last raster line
Plane 1, last raster line
Plane 2, last raster line
Plane 3, last raster line
</PRE>
<P>If the bitmap array exceeds 64K, GDI splits the raster lines across several segments but retains the storage order, placing the first raster lines in the first segment and the last raster lines in the last segment. When GDI splits the raster lines, it ensures that matching raster lines from the various planes are always in the same segment. If necessary, GDI leaves a number of empty bytes (as specified by <B>bmFillBytes</B>) at the end of the segment to round out the segment size to a multiple of 16. </P>
