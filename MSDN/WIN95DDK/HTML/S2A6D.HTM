<H3>Providing a Device Information File </H3><P>The setup disk for your pointing device must contain a device information file (.INF). The file provides information that the Windows 95 operating system needs to install your device driver software and to support your pointing device. The Windows 95 device driver kit (DDK) includes a sample mouse minidriver and accompanying device information file. You should use the sample device information file as a model for creating one of your own. For general information on device information files, including a description of each section and entry, see . </P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
