<H3>Family and Home Scenarios </H3><P>After the board meeting, a business traveler takes her family's IR-capable digital camera and one of the family's IR-capable handheld computers out of her luggage and heads for the sprawling combination super mall/amusement park. </P>
<P>She doesn't have much time so she immediately goes to an IR-capable information kiosk and downloads a user interface onto her handheld through the IR port (she has her choice of languages to have the interface presented in, and chooses English). She uses the interface to navigate symbolically through the acres of attractions and query the information kiosk for squirts of detailed information about some of the attractions. </P>
<P>When she locates an attraction her kids are interested in, she walks there and takes some snapshots. When she gets back to the hotel, she squirts the best of the snapshots from her IR-capable digital camera to the IR-capable laptop. She uses the hotel business center to send an e-mail message home that asks her son to pick her up at the airport, with the digital snapshots as attachments. </P>
<P>While waiting at the airport for his mom's late flight, her son plays another episode of interactive Cyberdoom with a friend. Each has an IR-capable handheld PC. </P>
<P>She then drops the two young men off at the local college campus in time for a lecture. In the lecture hall, they use their handhelds to download the class handouts and the next homework assignment from the professor's IR-capable portable computer. They collaborate on the assignment during the lecture and on the way out squirt the completed assignment back onto the professor's computer. </P>
<P>In the off-campus CyberCafe, they start going over the lecture notes they downloaded and surf the Internet using the cafe's IR access point, looking for information that will invalidate what they have just been told by their professor. </P>
<P>Meanwhile, Mom gets home and joins her daughter in the room with the family's IR-capable entertainment center. Her daughter is using her new IR-capable power glove to draw stick figures and choreograph them dancing to the beat of a commercial rap song and Mom offers a few new twists. </P>
<P>In the meantime, they've forgotten all about getting dinner ready. Luckily, they have a kitchen full of IR-capable appliances and a meal-preparation sequence pre-programmed on one of the family handhelds. </P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
