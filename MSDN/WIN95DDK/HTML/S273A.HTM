<H3>Port Driver Services </H3><P>Port drivers use port driver services to initialize and block access to hardware. A port driver calls the <B>_VCOMM_Register_Port_Driver</B> service when it is loaded. A port driver calls the <B>_VCOMM_Add_Port</B> service once for each port it supports. </P>
<P>The <B>_VCOMM_Acquire_Port</B> and <B>_VCOMM_Release_Port</B> services enable port drivers to acquire and release exclusive access to communications devices. A port driver should acquire a port when its <B>PortOpen</B> function is called, and release a port when its <B>PortClose</B> function is called. Other VxDs that access communications hardware directly should also call these services. </P>
<P>VCOMM relies on the virtual communications device (VCD) to block access to communications devices. The <B>_VCOMM_Acquire_Port</B> service has no effect when used with communications resources that VCD does not support, although the service still returns a handle in such cases. </P>
