<P>Contains instance information for an open Audio Compression Manager (ACM) driver conversion stream. This structure is passed as the <I>lParam1</I> parameter for all ACM driver messages for conversion streams. Except where noted, no members of this structure can be modified by the driver, because they are intended for state information about a conversion stream and are maintained by the ACM. </P>
<P><B>cbStruct</B> </P>
<P>Size, in bytes, of the <B>ACMDRVSTREAMINSTANCE</B> structure. This member is initialized by the ACM before calling the driver. This member can be greater than the size, in bytes, of the base <B>ACMDRVSTREAMINSTANCE</B> structure. An ACM driver should ignore any members that are not contained in the base <B>ACMDRVSTREAMINSTANCE</B> structure. This member should not be modified by the driver. </P>
<P><B>pwfxSrc</B> </P>
<P>Address of a <B>WAVEFORMATEX</B> structure that defines the source format for a conversion stream. This member will never be NULL. This member should not be modified by the driver. </P>
<P><B>pwfxDst</B> </P>
<P>Address of a <B>WAVEFORMATEX</B> structure that defines the destination format for a conversion stream. This member will never be NULL. This member should not be modified by the driver. </P>
<P><B>pwfltr</B> </P>
<P>Address of an optional <B>WAVEFILTER</B> structure that defines the filter to be used on a conversion stream. This member will be NULL if no filter is being used on the conversion stream. This member should not be modified by the driver. </P>
<P><B>dwCallback</B> </P>
<P>Specifies the address of a callback function, a window handle, or a handle to an event, depending on the flags specified in the <B>fdwOpen</B> member. The driver uses this information to notify the client via the <B>DriverCallback</B> function. Note that this member is valid only for streams opened with the ACM_STREAMOPEN_ASYNC flag. If this member is zero, no callback should be performed on a open, close, or buffer-completion operation for a conversion stream. </P>
<P><B>dwInstance</B> </P>
<P>Specifies 32 bits of instance information for the client. This instance information must be returned to the client whenever the driver notifies the client via the <B>DriverCallback</B> function. </P>
<P><B>fdwOpen</B> </P>
<P>This member defines flags used for opening an ACM conversion stream. This member is identical to the <I>fdwOpen</I> parameter passed to <B>acmStreamOpen</B>. This member should not be modified by the driver. </P>

<P><B>fdwDriver</B> </P>
<P>32 bits of driver-defined flags. This member is intended for drivers to use for driver-specific flags. However, this member can be any instance data specified by the driver. Note that this member is set by the driver and can be modified during any conversion-stream driver messages. This member will be passed back with all conversion-stream driver messages unmodified by the ACM while the conversion stream remains open. </P>
<P><B>dwDriver</B> </P>
<P>32 bits of driver-defined data. This can be any instance data specified by the driver. Note that this member is set by the driver and can be modified during any conversion- stream driver messages. This member will be passed back with all conversion-stream driver messages unmodified by the ACM while the conversion stream remains open. </P>
<P><B>has</B> </P>
<P>Client handle to the open conversion stream assigned by the ACM. This handle must be used when notifying the client with the <B>DriverCallback</B> function for asynchronous conversions. </P>
<P>The <B>ACMDRVSTREAMINSTANCE</B> structure is used to contain instance data for a conversion stream. This structure will be passed as the <I>lParam1</I> parameter of all conversion-stream driver messages. No members of this structure will change from the initial state passed to the ACMDM_STREAM_OPEN message. Therefore, a driver never needs to validate information in this structure after succeeding the ACMDM_STREAM_OPEN message. </P>
<P>The <B>fdwDriver</B> and <B>dwDriver</B> members of the <B>ACMDRVSTREAMINSTANCE</B> structure can be modified by the driver at any time. All remaining members must not be modified by the driver under any circumstances. </P>
