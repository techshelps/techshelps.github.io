</PRE>
<P>The hardware information structure is used by the virtual pen driver for hardware-specific information. The pen driver does not use this structure. </P>
<P><B>ddCom_Port</B> </P>
<P>The COM port number used by the pen hardware. <B>ddCom_Port</B> is 0 if the hardware does not use a COM port, 1 for COM 1, 2 for COM 2, etc. </P>
<P><B>com_base</B> </P>
<P>If <B>ddCom_Port</B> does not equal zero, <B>com_base</B> contains the base I/O address (in hexadecimal) that the port uses. For instance, the COM1 base I/O address is 3F8. </P>
<P><B>ddIRQ_Number</B> </P>
<P>The IRQ number that the system uses. For instance, for COM1, the typical IRQ number is 4. </P>
<P><B>ddPauseTime</B> </P>
<P>Time required to reset the digitizer during initialization. </P>
<P><B>ddReserved</B> </P>
<P>Not used. Should be set to zero. </P>
<P><B>ddOrientation</B> </P>
<P>Screen orientation. <B>ddOrientation</B> is an integer value from 0 to 3. </P>
<P><B>calibrate</B> </P>
<P>A <B>DRV_CALBSTRUCT</B> structure that contains the current calibration information. The DRV_GetCalibration message is used to fill the <B>DRV_CALBSTRUCT</B> structure with calibration information. </P>
<P><B>ddBufferZoneX</B> </P>
<P>Represents the number of units (in 0.001 inch) to reduce the active area in the x-direction. <B>ddBufferZoneX</B> applies only to opaque tablets. Creating a buffer zone around the edge of the active area makes it easier for the user to move the pen to the edge of the screen. </P>
<P><B>ddBufferZoneY</B> </P>
<P>Represents the number of units (in 0.001 inch) to reduce the active area in the y-direction. See the definition of the <B>ddBufferZoneX</B> member for more information. </P>
<P><B>ddHardwarePacketSize</B> </P>
<P>The number of bytes the serial device sends before the driver has received a complete pen packet. </P>
<P><B>ddComPortSettings</B> </P>
<P>Defines the baud, parity, data, and stop bits of the serial transmission. The high-order word is baud divisor based on 19200. For example, 1 indicates 19200 and 2 indicates 9600. The low-order word is the control register values for parity, data, and stop bits. </P>
<P><B>dwHwFlags</B> </P>
<P>A bitwise-OR combination of hardware flags. The hardware capability flag constants used by the sample pen virtual driver are defined in the in PENDRV.H. </P>
<P><B>ddHardwareType</B> </P>
<P>Denotes the type of hardware. The hardware capability flag constants HW_PUSHMODEL and HW_TIMERMODEL in PENDRV.H define the types of hardware used by the sample pen driver. For more information, see <I>About the Virtual Pen Driver</I>. </P>
<P><B>ddTimerTickRate</B> </P>
<P>Sets the rate in timer ticks at which the callback function receives control. For more information, see <I>About the Virtual Pen Driver</I>. </P>
<P><B>ddDelayTime</B> </P>
<P>Sets the amount of time (in milliseconds) that must elapse waiting for a hardware interrupt before generating events from a timer tick. If <B>ddDelayTime</B> milliseconds elapse without receiving a hardware event, the VxD assumes the pen has moved beyond the tablet's range of sensitivity or has stopped moving. For more information, see <I>About the Virtual Pen Driver</I>. </P>
<P><B>ddVpenD_IRQ_Handle</B> </P>
<P>The IRQ handle. </P>
<P><B>ddSystemVMHandle</B> </P>
<P>The system VM handle. </P>
