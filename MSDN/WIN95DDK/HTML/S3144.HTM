<H3>Volume Name Conventions </H3><P>The volume name identifies the file system that is being referenced. For local file systems the volume name is the "drive:" syntax. For network file systems the volume name identifies the network file resource. There is no consistent naming convention that has been followed by network vendors. Each network defined the convention for volume names in a different way. To get around this, a typed naming convention is being defined that will support the different naming conventions used by different networks. </P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
