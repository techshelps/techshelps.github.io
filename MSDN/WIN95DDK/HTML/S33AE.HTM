<PRE>VMMcall _EnterMustComplete
</PRE>
<P>Increments the must-complete count for the current thread, causing it to enter a must-complete section. Uses the C calling convention. Uses EAX, ECX, EDX, and Flags. </P>
<UL><LI>     No return value. </LI></UL><P></P>
<P>A virtual device can call this service recursively. </P>
<P>For each call to _<B>EnterMustComplete</B>, there must be a corresponding call to _<B>LeaveMustComplete</B>. </P>
<P>This service ensures that the thread is not suspended or killed (via <B>Suspend_VM</B> or <B>Nuke_VM</B>) by another thread while executing a section of critical code. This service is usually used to protect a thread while it owns an important shared resource or state information. If the thread were killed or suspended while it owned such a resource, all other threads would be blocked. </P>
<P>While in a must complete, any suspends or nukes will be postponed until the last <B>_LeaveMustComplete</B>. A must-complete does not change priorities or thread switching in any way. </P>
<P>A VxD can also enter a must complete section automatically by using the MUTEX_MUST_COMPLETE flag with the <B>_CreateMutex</B> service. </P>
<P>See also <B>_EnterMutex</B>, <B>_LeaveMustComplete</B> </P>
