<H3>Accepting New Calibration Settings </H3><P>The Joystick option of the Control Panel calculates calibration values for joysticks drivers. (If you need this program for developing a joystick driver, contact Microsoft Product Support Services and ask for the multimedia joystick control panel applet.) A joystick driver can use the calibration values to convert the actual values returned by the hardware device to the logical values expected by the joystick interface. A driver establishes the logical value range in its response to the JDD_GETDEVCAPS message. </P>
<P>The calibration settings consist of base and delta values for each coordinate. The base value represents the lowest logical value the driver returns; the delta value is the multiplier to use when converting the actual value returned by the device to a logical value appropriate for the established value range. </P>
<P>Immediately after MMSYSTEM loads the joystick driver, it reads the calibration values from the SYSTEM.INI file and sends them to the driver with the JDD_SETCALIBRATION message. MMSYSTEM sends the JDD_SETCALIBRATION message with two <B>JOYCALIBRATE</B> structures (pointers to them are passed in the <I>lParam1</I> and <I>lParam2</I> parameters). The first structure contains the new calibration settings the driver should adopt. The joystick driver should fill the second structure with the previous calibration settings. </P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
