<P>If a procedure is marked ASYNC_SERVICE, then it must be re-entrant, must not call synchronous services, and must restrict itself to locked code and data. Asynchronous services may be called by interrupt handling routines when processing interrupts. Therefore, virtual devices which export asynchronous services must be prepared for the service to be called any time interrupts are disabled. </P>
<P>Marking a procedure as PCALL, SCALL, or CCALL indicates to the ArgVar, LocalVar, EnterProc, LeaveProc and Return macros how code should be generated to access procedure parameters and local variables, and how code should be generated to return to the calling procedure. </P>
<P>If a procedure is marked ESP, then extra care must be taken to maintain the assumptions made by the ArgVar and LocalVar macros. All stack pushes must be performed with the SaveReg macro, and all stack pops must be performed with the RestoreReg macro. You may not adjust the stack manually, and you may not jump over code that adjusts the stack. These are relatively severe restrictions, but that's the way it is. If you can't live within them, then don't use the ESP attribute. Nobody's forcing you. </P>
<P>If a procedure will be passed to Hook_Device_Service, Hook_V86_Fault, Hook_PM_Fault, or Hook_VMM_Fault, then it must be marked with the HOOK_PROC attribute so that the service can be unhooked. This is important, even if you do not plan to unhook the service or fault yourself. Failure to comply may prevent other virtual devices from unhooking the service. The hook_var parameter is the name of the variable into which the address of the previous hook will be stored. See the discussion of hook procedure in the Overview for additional information about hook procedures. </P>
<P>If a segment type is provided, then the procedure will be placed in the segment named VxD_segment_type_CODE_SEG. This is provided for convenience in procedure-level page tuning. </P>
