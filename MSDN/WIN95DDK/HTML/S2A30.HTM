<H3>Virtual Mouse Device </H3><P>The virtual mouse device (VMOUSE) is a nonreplaceable system component that virtualizes the mouse hardware, making it possible for all VMs to share the mouse. It supports the mouse for non-system VMs as well as for the system VM. VMOUSE provides built-in support for Microsoft compatible pointing devices, including the Microsoft BallPoint, attached to COM1, COM2, PS/2 mouse ports, and Microsoft InPort adapters. Together, VMOUSE and the Windows Shell provide the following features for all devices supported by VMOUSE: </P>
<UL><LI>     Mouse tracking speed (sensitivity) </LI><LI>     Swapping of left and right mouse buttons </LI><LI>     Mouse trails (with display driver support) </LI><LI>     Color cursor </LI><LI>     Sizeable cursor </LI><LI>     MouseKeys (numeric keypad controls cursor movement) </LI><LI>     SerialKeys (alternative input device controls cursor and mouse buttons) </LI></UL><P></P>
<P>VMOUSE automatically draws the mouse cursor for non-system VMs. (The Windows display driver draws the cursor for Windows.) It supports VGA modes 0 through 7 and 0Dh through 13h. In graphics modes, VMOUSE draws an arrow cursor; in text modes, it draws a block cursor. </P>
<P>VMOUSE supports Functions 0 through 39 of the Interrupt 33h mouse application programming interface (API) for applications running in non-system VMs. For more information about VMOUSE, see . </P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
