<H3>Recognizing the Different Types of Modem ID Strings </H3><P>There are three types of modem ID strings: </P>
<UL><LI>     PNP HardwareID strings. </LI><LI>     PNP CompatibleID strings. </LI><LI>     UnimodemID strings. </LI></UL><P></P>
<P>You may choose to include only one type in your modem INF file, two of the types, or all three of the types. For more information, see <I>General Strategies for Using Modem ID Strings</I>. </P>
<P>A PNP HardwareID string uniquely identifies a particular manufacturer's modem model and is written into the registry by the Windows 95 Plug and Play system during hardware enumeration. </P>
<P>A PNP CompatibleID string is also written into the registry by the Windows 95 Plug and Play system during hardware enumeration if the modem is a PNP Serenum or ISA PNP type. This type of modem ID string identifies a modem model whose ID is shared by other models or OEMs. </P>
<P>A Unimodem ID string is obtained by interrogating a modem with AT commands and can be obtained from both Plug and Play modems and non-Plug and Play modems. This occurs during autodetection (or detection) of the modem, which happens at a different time than enumeration. </P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
