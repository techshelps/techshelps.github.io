<H3>Pen User Interface </H3><P>The pen user interface (PENUI.DLL) library contains the user-interface functions of the pen Unidriver. These functions provide a simple configuration dialog box that queries for the pen device model, the COM port, and whether or not the pen device supports pressure sensitivity. </P>
<P>If desired, an OEM developer can replace or enhance the user interface, perhaps by providing a dialog box (for Windows version 3.1) or property sheet (for Windows 95), thus gaining additional marketability and user recognition. The pen Unidriver maintains its interface code as a separate library to facilitate such enhancements or a complete replacement of the library by the OEM. </P>
<P>The sample pen user interface source code that is in the directory \PEN\SAMPLES\PENUI of the installed Windows 95 DDK can be enhanced or used as a model for the source code of a DLL that completely replaces the pen user interface library. </P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
