<H3>Installable File System Services </h3>

<P>The IFS services are functions within the IFS
manager that are exported to FSDs. These functions are provided
to help the FSD support the routines called by the IFS. Some
services are C callable and use C parameter passing and C return
conventions. C callable services use the C6 386 _cdecl calling
sequence. Return values for C callable services are usually
returned in EAX for long and EDX:EAX for quad-words. Services
that are C callable have C prototypes defined for them and
preserve the normal C registers i.e EBX, ESI, EDI and the segment
registers. Other services use register conventions and are
callable only from assembly language. </p>
