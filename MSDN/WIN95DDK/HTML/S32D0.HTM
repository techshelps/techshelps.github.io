<P>Unhooks a device service that was previously hooked with the <B>Hook_Device_Service </B>service. Uses Flags. </P>
<UL><LI>     Clears the carry flag if successful; otherwise sets the carry flag because of one of the following errors: 
<P>The service number is invalid. </P>

<P>The hook procedure could not be found in the chain. </P>

<P>A non-HookProc hook existed in the chain. </P></LI></UL><P></P>

<P>The highword is the VxD ID and the low word is the service number. If the VxD ID is UNDEFINED_DEVICE_ID, then the EDI register should contain the address of the eight character space-padded VxDName. </P>
<P><I>Service</I> </P>
<P>Name of the service being unhooked. </P>
<P><I>HookProc</I> </P>
<P>Hook procedure to remove from the list. </P>
<P>In order for <B>Hook_Device_Service</B> to succeed, the hook to be unhooked and all hooks that were made after the specified hook must have been declared as Hook_Proc's using the <B>BeginProc</B> macro. This macro is provided to correctly generate the procedure header necessary for creating a hook chain that can be processed quickly and still allows hooks to be removed from the chain. </P>
