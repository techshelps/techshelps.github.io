<H3>Device Configuration Tuples </H3><P>Each device is configured based on a set of logical configurations. These are the possible configurations that can be used by the device. A logical configuration must be determined for a PC card that a device ID has been created for and this configuration must be passed to Configuration Manager. The configuration information for a PC card is derived from the Configuration and Configuration Table Entry tuples. The order of the Configuration Table Entry tuples specifies the preference for each configuration. </P>
<P>To support devices that do not have valid (or correct) configuration tuples, the registry may contain overriding logical configurations for the device. This overriding configuration is located using the device ID and may be set up based on information in the INF file when the device is first installed. </P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
