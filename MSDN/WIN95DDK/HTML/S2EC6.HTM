<H2>Printer System Components </H2><P>The print spooler accepts a data stream prepared by GDI and/or a printer driver for output on a particular type of printer. </P>
<P>The spooler has two main functions: </P>
<UL><LI>     To deliver data to printers for printing, either directly or by playing back spooled files. The spooler manages the events and format conversions that result in the data being output on an application-designated printer. </LI><LI>     To manage a dynamic environment made up of printers, printer drivers, print providers, monitors, ports, and print jobs. The spooler maintains Registry information from which it can derive how many of these components are in the printer subsystem at any time and the unique name of each component. The spooler also keeps track of the current status of each component. </LI></UL><P></P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
