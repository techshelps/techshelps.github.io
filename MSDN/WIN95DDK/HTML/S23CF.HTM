<P>The <B>Posdup</B> section provides a method for identifying devices which can may appear to be separate devices but in fact are the same device. This can occur when a device is detected and is also enumerated. Typically, detection cannot identify the device exactly but enumeration can. In these cases the Device Manager will detect a conflict. The Device Manager will look at this list and search the root branch of the registry for devices listed in this section. If one is found and the resource in use by these devices overlap, the device manager will assume it has detected a duplicate and will move the root branch entry to the enumerator branch. </P>
