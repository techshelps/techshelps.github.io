<P>The size of the <B>NETCONNECTINFOSTRUCT </B>structure in bytes. This is filled in by the caller to indicate the size of the structure passed in.

<P><I>dwSpeed</I> </P>
<P>The speed of the media to the network resource in units of 100 bps (for example, a 1,200 baud point to point link returns 12). </P>
<P><I>dwDelay</I> </P>
<P>The delay introduced by the network when sending information (the time between starting sending data and the time that it starts being received) in units of a millisecond. This is in addition to any latency that was incorporated into the calculation of <I>dwSpeed</I>, so the value returned will be 0 for accessing most resources. </P>
<P><I>dwOptDataSize</I> </P>
<P>A recommendation for the size of data in bytes that is most efficiently sent through the network when an application makes a single request to the network resource. For example, for a disk network resource, this value might be 2048 or 512 when writing a block of data. </P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
