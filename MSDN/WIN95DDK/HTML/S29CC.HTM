<H2>Step 6 -- Testing Your Modem Installation With the MCT </H2><P>The current Modem Compatibility Test (MCT) is part of the Windows 95 DDK. The MCT is constantly evolving and being improved as Microsoft encounters modems with new features. Be sure you are always using the most current version of the MCT. </P>
<P>You can use the MCT to test whether your INF file properly installs your modem on a Windows 95 platform. </P>
<P>    1.    Save your INF file as a text-only ASCII format document, using filename extension ".INF" and a filename prefix of ".MDM." Do not use the filename "MODEMS.INF". </P>
<P>    2.    Open the Modems control panel and click the New button, and then the Select button. Your manufacturer name should now appear in the lefthand listbox. Click on it to see your models appear in the list in the righthand listbox. </P>
<P>    3.    Select one of your modem models and click the OK button. This will install the modem into the registry. Also try uninstalling the modem. For Plug and Play modems, try autodetection and enumeration. </P>
<P>    4.    Specify the correct port name when prompted. When complete, the new modem will appear in the "Installed Modems" list. </P>
<P>    5.    Run the Modem Compatibility Tests (MCTs) to confirm that the INF settings are correct. You can debug your INF file using the instructions below. </P>
<P>    6.    You should also test your modem INF using Windows 95 features which make modem connections using 32-bit TAPI access, including the HyperTerminal and Remote Access Services (RAS). Be sure to try different modem setting configurations (different speaker volumes and modes, baud rates, error control and compression settings, flow control settings, and so on). </P>
<P></P>
<P>It is important that between each MCT session, you erase all INF files with the name OEM*.INF from the \WINDOWS\INF directory. During the modem installation process, a copy of your INF file is renamed to OEM*.INF and copied to that directory. If, between MCT sessions, you change your INF file, you do not want an old version of the INF file left on the Windows 95 computer. </P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
