<H3>Setting Breakpoints </H3><P>You can set breakpoints using the <B>bp</B> and <B>br</B> commands. With each breakpoint, you can specify breakpoint commands, a string of debugger commands that are executed when a breakpoint is hit. For example, the following command sets a breakpoint that stops execution in the function _MyEntryPoint and displays the registers and stack: </P>
<P><BR></P>
<PRE>bp _MyEntryPoint+346 "r;k"
</PRE>
<P>Semicolons (;) separate commands from one another. All text is converted to uppercase except for text surrounded by single quotation marks ('). Two single quotation marks ('') or two double quotation marks ("") in a row act as an escape character and add one single quotation mark or one double quotation mark to the string. The maximum length of a breakpoint command is 80 characters. If the breakpoint has no breakpoint command string, WDEB386 executes the default (<B>zd</B>) command. </P>
<P>The conditional execution command (<B>j</B>) is very useful in breakpoint commands. This command executes the command list if the expression evaluates to TRUE (nonzero); otherwise, it continues to the next command in the command line (not including the ones in the command list parameter). If the command list contains more than one command, it must be enclosed in single or double quotation marks. Use a semicolon (;) to separate commands. No quotation marks are required if the command list contains zero or one command. The conditional execution command can be used in breakpoint commands to halt execution when an expression becomes true or in the default command. </P>
<P>Any operator, number, or symbol value can be used in the conditional expression. Always put a zero in front of a hexadecimal number that begins with a nonnumeric character. Doing so will prevent the debugger from treating the number as a symbol and searching all the loaded symbol files. For example, using 0f000 is faster than f000. </P>
<P>For example, the following command stops execution and display registers only if the variable _MyVar is equal to 3 when control enters the _MyEntryPoint function. Otherwise, it displays the current value and continues: </P>
<P><BR></P>
<PRE>bp _MyEntryPoint "j _MyVar == 3 r;'? "_MyVar=%x" _MyVar;g'"
</PRE></FONT></BODY></HTML>
