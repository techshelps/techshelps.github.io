<H3>Where can I find more information on the Windows 95 network architecture? </H3><P>A good introduction to Windows 95 networking is in the Windows 95 Resource Kit. The CD-ROM version of Windows 95 contains the Windows 95 Resource Kit as a help file. The help file is located in the Admin\Reskit\Helpfile directory on the CD-ROM and is called Win95rk.hlp. Open this file and select the <I>Windows 95 Reference</I> section and then <I>Windows 95 Network Architecture</I>. </P>
