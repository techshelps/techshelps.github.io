<H3>Notifying Clients with the DriverCallback Function </H3><P>Audio device drivers need to notify clients when certain events occur, such as when a waveform data block has been played or when a MIDI input event is received. When the client opens a device, the client specifies how it wants to be notified. There are three ways a driver can notify a client application: </P>
<UL><LI>     By calling a client-specified callback function </LI><LI>     By sending a message to a client-specified window </LI><LI>     By unblocking a client-specified task </LI></UL><P></P>
<P>To make the job of notifying clients easier, MMSYSTEM provides the <B>DriverCallback</B> function. <B>DriverCallback</B> takes information supplied by the client when it opened a device and notifies the client accordingly. </P>
<P>Clients must be notified when the following conditions occur: </P>
<UL><LI>     When a device is opened. </LI><LI>     When a device is closed. </LI><LI>     When the driver is finished with a data block. </LI><LI>     When the driver receives data that should be passed directly back to the application, such as when a MIDI input driver receives a MIDI event from an input port. </LI></UL><P></P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
