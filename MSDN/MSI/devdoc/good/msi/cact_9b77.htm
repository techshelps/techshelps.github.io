<p>
Custom actions can be scheduled to run during any of the various phases of the install process. For more information about the phases of an installation, see <a href="over_9jjh.htm">Installation Mechanism</a>.</p>
<p>
If a custom action only sets properties, sets directories, or manipulates the installation database, then it should be scheduled to run during the acquisition phase when the database is processed. However, if a custom action performs any system changes directly, it should be scheduled to run during the execution stage when the install script is processed.</p>
<p>
The installer does not provide the script engine but can use it if it is installed. Authors wishing to make use of a scripting language during installation should be certain that the appropriate scripting engine is available.</p>
<p>
There are special restrictions that apply to deferred custom actions. See <a href="cact_101f.htm">Information for Custom Actions</a> for more information.</p>
<p>
You can also schedule custom actions to run during rollback. This is described in more detail in <a href="cact_2ho3.htm">Rollback of Custom Actions</a>.</p>
