<p>
Typically properties are used in conditional expressions in the database to convey additional installation logic. For example, the <a href="tref_0a91.htm">Feature table</a> is linked to the <a href="tref_83qd.htm">Condition table</a>. This can be used to indicate if a feature should be installed depending upon the values of one or more properties.</p>
<p>
Similarly, in the six sequence tables, there is a column for a conditional expression. A dialog listed in a sequence table with <b>Installed AND NOT Resume AND NOT Preselected</b> in the condition column would only display if all of the following conditions were met.
<ul>
<li>
The product is already installed.</li>
<li>
The installation session is not resuming a partially completed install.</li>
<li>
The needed options were not already set on the command line when the installation was initiated.</li>
</ul>
<p>
This would be useful for a maintenance dialog.</p>
<p>
The full syntax for conditional expressions is described in <a href="qref_6je6.htm"><b>MsiEvaluateCondition</b></a>.</p>
