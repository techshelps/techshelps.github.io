<p>
Controls on the same dialog box can communicate with each other by means of ControlEvents. </p>
<p>
Each ControlEvent has one publisher (a control or the installer itself) and can have several subscribers. The kind of ControlEvents published by a control is determined by the type of the control. Theoretically any control can subscribe to any ControlEvent, although many combinations are not practical. </p>
<p>
A control can subscribe to a ControlEvent in the following ways:
<ul>
<li>
If a control is listed in the <a href="tref_6m3p.htm">EventMapping table</a> with a ControlEvent, it describes the <a href="hand_8mrb.htm">attribute</a> of the control that must be changed when the ControlEvent is published.</li>
<li>
If a control is listed in the <a href="tref_6k11.htm">ControlEvent table</a> with a ControlEvent, it means that activating the control (clicking the button) triggers a ControlEvent with the described parameter.</li>
</ul>
<p>
A custom control can publish its own ControlEvents and other controls (custom or regular) can subscribe to them.</p>
<p>
The publisher of a ControlEvent can hide/show or enable/disable its subscribers when its state requires it.</p>
<p>
It is perfectly reasonable to have a control on a dialog box that publishes some ControlEvent but to have no subscribers to the control. In contrast, if a control subscribes to a ControlEvent that is not published by the handler and a publishing control is not present on the same dialog box, it can result in an error (especially if the control attempts to trigger that event).</p>
<p>
For a more comprehensive explanation on a specific control, see the <a href="href_2z6t.htm#_msi_controlevents_list">ControlEvents list</a>.</p>
