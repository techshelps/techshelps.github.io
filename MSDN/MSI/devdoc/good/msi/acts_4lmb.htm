<p>
In the Microsoft® Windows® installer, actions serve the same purpose as functions in a programming language. An action encapsulates a typical function you can perform during installation or maintenance of your application. There is a very close relationship between actions and the installer database. In fact, many of the tables in the database can be viewed as serving the singular purpose of containing parameters used by a corresponding action. Almost all of the standard actions are linked to at least one of the tables.</p>
<p>
Examples of installer standard actions include:
<ul>
<li>
<a href="aref_7uzy.htm">CreateShortcuts action</a>: Manages the creation of shortcuts to files installed with the current application. This action uses the <a href="tref_2i91.htm">Shortcut table</a> for its data.</li>
<li>
<a href="aref_3hym.htm">InstallFiles action</a>: Copies selected files from the source directory to the destination directory. This action uses the <a href="tref_4n6t.htm">File table</a> for its data.</li>
<li>
<a href="aref_1cmm.htm">WriteRegistryValues action</a>: Sets up registry information that the application requires in the registry. This action uses the <a href="tref_3obp.htm">Registry table</a> for its data. <p>
<b>Note</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;The need to write registry values into the HKCU and HKLM hives of the registry at installation will diminish in the future as part of the ZAW effort.
</li>
</ul>
