<p>
Custom actions that schedule system operations by inserting rows into the appropriate tables are automatically rolled back if the installation is unsuccessful. However, if a custom action performs operations on its own or issues commands to other services, these operations or commands cannot be automatically rolled back. You must provide a custom action that performs the necessary operations during rollback processing.</p>
<p>
A rollback custom action is designated as described in <a href="cact_1dbn.htm">Custom Action Types</a>. When this action is invoked during the installation sequence, its execution is deferred until rollback as described in <a href="cact_9b77.htm">Deferred Execution of Custom Actions</a>.</p>
