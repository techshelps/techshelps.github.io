<dd>
One of the methods of advertising. Publishing does not populate the user interface. However, if another application attempts to open the published application, enough information is present to assign the published application. The published application can then be used as if it is installed. A published application can also be opened through its file association or Multipurpose Internet Mail Extension (MIME) type, or a user might instigate the installation from a list of published applications. See also advertise, assign, just-in-time installation, and publish.</dd>
