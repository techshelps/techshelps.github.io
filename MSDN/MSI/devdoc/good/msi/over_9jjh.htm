<p>
There are two phases of an installation process: acquisition and execution. A rollback phase may also occur if the installation is unsuccessful.</p>
<p>
The exact installation procedure is determined during the acquisition phase. At the beginning of the acquisition phase, an application or a user instructs Microsoft® Windows® installer to install a feature or an application. The installer complies with this request by beginning the required action sequence. The actions query the database and generate a script that gives a step-by-step procedure for performing the installation. For information on installing an application, see <a href="over_392m.htm">Initializing an Application</a> and <a href="over_37e6.htm">Installing an Application</a>.</p>
<p>
During the execution phase, the installer passes the information to a process with elevated privileges to generate an installation script. The process with elevated privileges then runs the script. On a secure system, this gives a user with limited privileges the ability to instigate an installation without compromising system integrity.</p>
<p>
If an installation is unsuccessful, the installer automatically restores the original state of the computer. When the installer processes the installation script it simultaneously generates a rollback script. In addition to the rollback script, the installer saves a copy of every file it deletes during the installation. These files are kept in a hidden, system directory called Config.msi. Once the installation is complete, the rollback script and the saved files are deleted.</p>
