<h2><a name="_msi_authoring_a_conditional_please_wait_._._._message_box"></a>Authoring a Conditional "Please Wait . . ." Message Box</h2>
<p>
<span style=color:#FF0000>[This is preliminary documentation and subject to change.]</span> </p>
<p>
The following example illustrates how to author a conditional message box that pops up and warns the user that a background task is still running whenever the user activates a displayed control prematurely. </p>
<p>
The example also illustrates how the <a href="href_95ro.htm">SpawnWaitDialog ControlEvent</a> can in general be used to protect a control that triggers an action dependent upon the completion of a background task. </p>
<p>
In this example, a <a href="hand_9llz.htm">Selection Dialog</a> containing three pushbutton controls labeled Install Now, Next, and Disk Cost is displayed to the user during the installation process. However, the installer also carries out a disk space costing task in the background while displaying this dialog box. The author wishes to protect these buttons from activation and wants a "Please wait" message box to pop up if the user pushes any of the buttons before the costing has completed. The author also wants this message box to contain a Cancel button and to disappear as soon as the background  task is finished .</p>
<h5><img src="../../images/wedge.gif" border=0>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To display a dialog box asking the user to wait while background disk costing is completed</h5>
<ol>
<li>
Use the authoring capabilities of the installer to add a new modal dialog box, named WaitForCosting, into the <a href="tref_51wl.htm">Dialog table</a>. The dialog box should display a text string that says "Please wait while disk space costing is completed." </li>
<li>
Add a single pushbutton control to this dialog, labeled Cancel, by authoring it into the <a href="tref_6nad.htm">Control table</a>.</li>
<li>
Link the Cancel pushbutton to a control event that closes the WaitForCosting dialog box by authoring an <a href="href_9a0k.htm">EndDialog ControlEvent</a> into the <a href="tref_6k11.htm">ControlEvent table</a>. Set the argument of the EndDialog Control event to be Exit.</li>
<li>
Link a <a href="href_95ro.htm">SpawnWaitDialog ControlEvent</a> to the existing Install Now, Next, and Disk Cost pushbutton controls displayed in the <a href="hand_9llz.htm">Selection Dialog</a> box. Set the argument of this control event in the ControlEvent table to be the WaitForCosting dialog and set the expression in the Condition column of the table to be: <a href="pref_7kah.htm">CostingComplete</a> =1.</li>
</ol>
