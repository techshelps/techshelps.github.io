<p>
This property is the full path of the current patch package. Setting this property causes the installer to apply the patch.</p>
<h4>Set By</h4>
<p>
The PATCH property is set by the command line or with <a href="msi_5fe0.htm">MsiApplyPatch</a>. The PATCH property is set only during the first application of the patch. The patch will continue to be applied for each subsequent configuration of the product, but the PATCH property will not be set.</p>
<h4>Used By</h4>
<p>
</p>
<h4>Remarks</h4>
<p>
The PATCH property can be used in conditional expressions to control an action or user interface that is performed only during the first application of the patch.</p>
<p>
Since the list delimiter for transforms, sources and patches is a semicolon, this character should not be used for these filenames or paths.</p>
