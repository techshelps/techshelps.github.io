<p>
The property value denotes a list of features, delimited by commas, that are to be reinstalled. The features listed are to be found in the <b>Feature</b> column of the <a href="tref_0a91.htm">Feature</a> table. Optionally, the value could be <b>All</b> to denote reinstalling all features. Thus, if you wish to reinstall all features you would provide the command line <b>REINSTALL=All</b> to the installer.</p>
<h4>Set By</h4>
<p>
Command line.</p>
<h4>Used By</h4>
<p>
MsiEngine uses this value to determine which features are to be reinstalled.</p>
<h4>Default Value</h4>
<p>
None.</p>
<h4>Remarks</h4>
<p>
Note that the feature names are case-sensitive. </p>
<p>
If the REINSTALL property is set, the <a href="pref_7bll.htm">REINSTALLMODE</a> property should also be set, to indicate the type of reinstall to be performed. If the REINSTALLMODE property is not set, then by default all files that are currently installed will be reinstalled, IF the currently installed file is a lesser version (or is not present). By default, no registry entries will be rewritten.</p>
<p>
Note that even if REINSTALL is set to "ALL", only those features that were already installed previously will be reinstalled. Thus, if REINSTALL is set for a product that is yet to be installed, no installation action will take place at all.</p>
