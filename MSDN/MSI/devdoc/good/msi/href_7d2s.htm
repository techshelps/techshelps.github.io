<p>
The dialog is reset. In other words all the controls on the dialog are called to undo the property changes they have performed. It should reset all the property values to what they were when the dialog was created. </p>
<p>
There is one case that is not handled properly. If there are at least two controls on the same dialog linked indirectly to the same property and at least one of them started with some other property originally, this property value is sometimes reset to its second value. Since this case is very esoteric, it is not worth the special code to handle it.</p>
