<h1><a name="_mfc_class_library_reference_introduction"></a>Class Library Reference</h1>
<p>
The <i>Class Library Reference</i> covers the classes, global functions, global variables, and macros that make up the Microsoft<sup>®</sup> Foundation Class Library, version 6.0. The <a href="_mfc_hierarchy_chart.htm">class hierarchy chart</a> details the class relationships in the class library.</p>
<p>
The <a href="_mfc_class_library_overview.htm">Class Library Overview</a> lists the classes in helpful categories. Use these lists to help locate a class that contains the functionality you are interested in. <object id=alink_1 type="application/x-oleobject"

</object><a href=JavaScript:alink_1.Click()>Visual C++ Programmer's Guide</a> explains how to use the class library to program for Microsoft Windows NT<sup>®</sup>, Microsoft Windows<sup>®</sup> 95, and other Win32<sup>®</sup> platforms. Practical examples and techniques are supplied in the tutorials in <object id=alink_2 type="application/x-oleobject"

<p>
The remainder of the <i>Class Library Reference</i> consists of an alphabetical listing of the classes and an <a href="_mfc_mfc_macros_and_globals.htm">MFC Macros and Globals</a> section that explains the global functions, global variables, and macros used with the class library.</p>
<p>
The individual hierarchy charts included with each class are useful for locating base classes. The <i>Class Library Reference</i> usually does not describe inherited member functions, inherited operators, and overridden virtual member functions. For information on these functions, refer to the base classes depicted in the hierarchy diagrams.</p>
<p>
In the alphabetical listing section, each class description includes a member summary by category, followed by alphabetical listings of member functions, overloaded operators, and data members.</p>
<p>
Public and protected class members are documented only when they are normally used in application programs or derived classes. Occasionally, private members are listed because they override a public or protected member in the base class. See the class header files for a complete listing of class members.</p>
<p>
Some C-language structures defined by Windows are so widely applicable that their descriptions have been reproduced completely in a section following the alphabetical reference.</p>
<p>
Please note that the “See Also” sections refer to Win32 API functions by prefacing them with the scope resolution operator (<b>::</b>), for example, <b>::EqualRect</b>. More information on these functions can be found in the Win32 SDK documentation.</p>
