<pre><code>SockAuth <br> <br>This sample is distantly related to the httpauth sample which <br>demonstrates the use of the SSPI package to implement the client side <br>of NTLM authentication when interacting with IIS.  However, this sample <br>shows both the client and server conversations with the security <br>provider when just a socket connection is used. <br> <br>The server side, in this sample, authenticates the client and provides <br>evidence of this by reporting the client's user name back to the client <br>via the socket connection. <br> <br>KerbAuth Directory <br> <br>This directory contains a modified version of security.c file, which  <br>enables the sample to use Kerberos Security Package to obtain security <br>services. <br>Note the two changes: <br>    *  The package name is "kerberos" <br>    *  The TOKEN_SOURCE needs to be a valid principal name of the form <br>        "Domain\User" <br> <br> <br>NegoAuth Directory <br> <br>This directory contains a modified version of security.c file, which <br>enables the sample to use Negotiate Security Package (SPNEGO) to obtain <br>security services. <br>Note the two changes: <br>    *   The package name is "negotiate" <br>    *   The TOKEN_SOURCE needs to be a valid principal name of the form <br>        "Domain\User" <br> <br> <br>Please copy the appropriate security.c to try out the sample using different <br>security packages. </code></pre>
