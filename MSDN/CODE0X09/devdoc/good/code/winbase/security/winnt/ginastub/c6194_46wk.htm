<pre><code>This sample illustrates a pass-thru "stub" gina which can be used <br>in some cases to simplify gina development. <br> <br>A common use for a gina is to implement code which requires the <br>credentials of the user logging onto the workstation.  The credentials <br>may be required for syncronization with foreign account databases <br>or custom authentication activities. <br> <br>In this example case, it is possible to implement a simple gina <br>stub layer which simply passes control for the required functions <br>to the previously installed gina, and captures the interesting <br>parameters from that gina.  In this scenario, the existing functionality <br>in the existent gina is retained.  In addition, the development time <br>is reduced drastically, as existing functionality does not need to <br>be duplicated. <br> <br>When dealing with credentials, take steps to maintain the security <br>of the credentials.  For instance, if transporting credentials over <br>a network, be sure to encrypt the credentials. <br> </code></pre>
