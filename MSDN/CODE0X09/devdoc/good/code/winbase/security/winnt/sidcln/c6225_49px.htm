<pre><code>Security Functions <br> <br> <br>SUMMARY <br>======= <br> <br>The SIDCLN sample demonstrates some of the security functions. It <br>provides a sample utility that recovers on-disk resources that remain  <br>allocated to deleted user accounts. <br> <br>MORE INFORMATION <br>================ <br> <br>The on-disk resources recovered are: <br> <br> - Files that are still owned by accounts that have been deleted are <br>   assigned ownership to the account logged on when this sample is run. <br> <br> - ACEs for deleted accounts are deleted from the ACLs of files to which <br>   the deleted accounts had been granted authorizations (such as Read <br>   access). <br> <br>It may be that running this sample as a utility has no practical value in  <br>many environments, as the number of files belonging to deleted user accounts  <br>will often be quite small and the number of bytes recovered on disk by  <br>editing out ACEs for deleted accounts may not be worth the time it takes to  <br>run this sample. This time can be significant when processing an entire hard  <br>disk or partition. <br> <br>Note: This sample is not a supported utility. <br> <br>Usage <br>----- <br> <br>You must log on using an account that has the privilege to take file <br>ownership and edit ACLs, such as Administrator. <br> <br>The ACL editing part of this sample can only be exercised for files on an  <br>NTFS partition. <br> <br>Typical test scenario <br>--------------------- <br> <br>Create a user account or two and log on as each of these accounts in turn.  <br>While logged on for each account, go to an NTFS partition and create a  <br>couple of files so the test accounts each own a few files. Use the File  <br>Manager or Windows Explorer to edit permissions for those files, so that  <br>each test user has some authorities (such as Read) explicitly granted for  <br>those files. Log on as Administrator and authorize each test user to a few  <br>Administrator-owned files. Delete the test accounts. Run the sample in the  <br>directories where you put the files that the test accounts own. </code></pre>
