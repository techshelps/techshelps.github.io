<pre><code>File Security <br> <br> <br>The SECFILE sample demonstrates the following security-related activities: <br> <br> - Constructing well-known security identifiers (SIDs) <br> - Obtaining the current user's SID <br> - Building a discretionary access control list (DACL) <br> - Building a security descriptor (SD) <br> <br>You should use this sample in conjunction with the Win32 Programmer's Reference. <br>Looking at the documentation and an example function call should make both  <br>the documentation and the sample clearer. <br> <br>This sample only works on an NTFS partition. No other file system supports  <br>security. You can use File Manager or the Windows Explorer to check the  <br>security on the file after you run the sample. One thing you may notice is  <br>that the user "Everyone" has "Special" access instead of "Read" access.  <br>That's because the system considers "Read" access to include both read and  <br>execute rights. To modify the sample to give "Everyone" "Read" access,  <br>change the statement: <br> <br>    #define WORLD_ACCESS  GENERIC_READ <br> <br>to the following: <br> <br>    #define WORLD_ACCESS  (GENERIC_READ | GENERIC_EXECUTE) </code></pre>
