<pre><code>How to Share Memory Between Processes. <br> <br> <br>SUMMARY <br>======= <br> <br>The MEMORY sample demonstrates the use of the file mapping functions to  <br>create named shared memory. <br> <br>MORE INFORMATION <br>================ <br> <br>This sample consists of a client and a server. <br> <br>Server <br>------ <br> <br>The server sets up the named share memory. A server can be created by  <br>selecting Server from the Create menu. This opens up a MDI child and swaps  <br>the menu bar to the server menu bar. To set up the equivalent of a named  <br>shared memory: <br> <br>  - Select Create File from the Server menu. This brings up the File Type  <br>    dialog box. The user may create either a memory page file or a physical  <br>    file by clicking on the Page File or the Map File button respectively to  <br>    back up the soon-to-be-created named shared memory. If the Map File  <br>    button is selected, the named shared memory will be backed up by a  <br>    physical file on the disk. On the other hand, if the Page File button  <br>    is clicked, the memory will be backed up by the memory page file. <br> <br>  - Select Create File Mapping from the Server menu. This brings up the Map  <br>    Name dialog box. The user then specifies a name for the file-mapping  <br>    object which will be created for the file created in step 1 above. This  <br>    name will be used to identify the shared memory by the clients in the  <br>    other processes. <br> <br>  - Select Map View of File from the Server menu. This maps the file-mapping  <br>    object created in the step above into the process virtual address space. <br> <br>  - Select Access from the Server menu. This creates a MLE inside the MDI  <br>    Server child. Whatever was written in the MLE is put in the map file  <br>    object. <br> <br>Client <br>------ <br> <br>The client connects to the named shared memory created by the server  <br>process. A client can be created by selecting Client from the Create menu.  <br>This opens up an MDI child and swaps the menu bar to the client menu bar. To  <br>set up the connection to the named share memory: <br> <br>  - Select Open File Mapping from the Client menu. This brings up the Map  <br>    Name dialog box. The user can then enter the name of the file-mapping  <br>    object which the client wanted to connect to. <br> <br>  - Select Map View of File from the Client menu. This maps the file-mapping <br>    object opened in the step above into the process virtual address space. <br> <br>  - Select Access from the Client menu. This creates a MLE inside the MDI  <br>    Server child. Whatever was written in the file-mapping object by the  <br>    server will be shown in this MLE. The client synchronizes with the  <br>    server at regular intervals. <br> <br>  - Select Refresh Now from the Client menu to refresh the contents of the  <br>    file-mapping object immediately. </code></pre>
