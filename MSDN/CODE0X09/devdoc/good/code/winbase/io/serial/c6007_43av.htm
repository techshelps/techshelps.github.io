<pre><code>Communications Demonstration <br> <br> <br>SUMMARY <br>======= <br> <br>The COMM sample (TTY) is designed to demonstrate using the Win32  <br>communications functions while maintaining a common code base with  <br>16-bit Windows code. <br> <br>MORE INFORMATION <br>================ <br> <br>The program performs communications using the functions OpenFile, ReadFile,  <br>SetCommState, SetCommMask, WaitCommEvent, WriteFile, and CloseFile. <br> <br>The program creates a background thread to watch for COMM receiver events  <br>and posts a notification message to the main terminal window. Foreground  <br>character processing is written to the communications port. <br> <br>Simple TTY character translation is performed and a screen buffer is  <br>implemented for use as the I/O window. <br> <br>Overlapped file I/O techniques are demonstrated. <br> <br>Usage: <br> <br>The baud rate, data bits, stop bits, parity, port, RTS/CTS handshaking,  <br>DTR/DSR handshaking, and XON/XOFF handshaking can be changed under the  <br>Settings menu item. <br> <br>Once the communications settings are set, the Action menu item can be  <br>selected to connect or disconnect the program. <br> </code></pre>
