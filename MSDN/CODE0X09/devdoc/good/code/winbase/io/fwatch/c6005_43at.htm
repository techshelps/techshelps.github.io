<pre><code>FWATCH demonstrates the usage of the ReadDirectoryChangesW API. <br> <br>The FWATCH sample will display changes to watched directories and files in <br>the command window. The directories and files to be watched are specified <br>in the FWATCH.INI file which can be left in the application directory.  <br> <br>FWATCH.INI is set by default to look at 3 directories: <br>c:\dir1 <br>c:\dir2 <br>c:\dir3 <br> <br>and three files in each of these directories: <br>file1.txt <br>file2.txt <br>file3.txt <br> <br>Once FWATCH.EXE is started, open any of the above text files with NOTEPAD, make  <br>some changes to the file, and then save it. You should see a notification in the  <br>FWATCH console window immediately. You will be advised of exactly which file  <br>changed, what the new (current) size is, and when the last write occured. <br> <br>To exit the application, type "q". <br> <br>FWATCH creates the directories and files mentioned above. Use File Manager or  <br>a similiar utility to remove the directories/files after using FWATCH. <br> <br>FWATCH will work only on Windows NT version 3.51 SP3 or greater. </code></pre>
