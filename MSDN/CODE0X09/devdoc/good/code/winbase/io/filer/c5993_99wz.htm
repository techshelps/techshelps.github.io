<pre><code>File I/O API Demonstration <br> <br> <br>SUMMARY <br>======= <br> <br>The FILER sample is a basic file management applet, such as File Manager or <br>Norton Commander. It demonstrates many of the new File I/O API, and their <br>related algorithms, such as drive enumeration, .EXE version information <br>retrieval, and directory tree walking. It also demonstrates many intensive <br>User algorithms, such as child management, subclassing, synchronization and <br>control window management. <br> <br>MORE INFORMATION <br>================ <br> <br>FILER presents the user with two fixed child windows, each of which the user  <br>may associate with a drive from the drives available on the system. The  <br>Drive toolbar describes the available drives on the system. Users select  <br>drives from the toolbar or the Drives menu. The Function toolbar corresponds  <br>to the file I/O options in the File menu. <br> <br>Each of the Drive child windows contains a Directory ListBox, and a File  <br>ListBox, for browsing through the files on the selected drive. <br> <br>FILER gives the user the option to open (execute or edit), copy, delete,  <br>move, and rename files, create and remove directories, and display any  <br>version information embedded in the files. The active Drive child acts as  <br>the source, and the inactive Drive child acts as the default destination  <br>of file I/O operations. <br> <br>The Drive children may also be configured side by side or with one above the  <br>other, and the File and Directory ListBoxes in each may swap positions. <br> <br>All features of FILER may be selected from the mouse, keyboard, or menu  <br>items. </code></pre>
