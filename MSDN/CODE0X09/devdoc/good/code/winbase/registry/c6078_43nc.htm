<pre><code>Using the Win32 API to Access the Registry <br> <br> <br>SUMMARY <br>======= <br> <br>The REGISTRY sample is a simple utility which demonstrates the functions  <br>needed to access the registry. The sample goes up and down the branches of  <br>the registry tree, displaying the individual key's data values. The sample  <br>can also print specified trees to a file named Registry.Txt. <br> <br>MORE INFORMATION <br>================ <br> <br>Usage <br>----- <br> <br>Start the sample. A dialog box appears with several edit fields, list boxes, <br>and buttons. The list box at the center of the dialog box (labeled CHILD  <br>KEYS at the bottom) always holds the child keys of the current key.  <br>Initially, it has four entries, representing the predefined key handles of  <br>the registry:  <br> <br>    HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE  <br>    HKEY_CURRENT_USER  <br>    HKEY_USERS <br>    HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT <br> <br>If you double-click on any of these entries, or highlight one and press the  <br>Next/Down button; the key that you selected appears in the Key Name edit  <br>field, and the children of that selected key replace the entries in the  <br>CHILD KEYS list box. To proceed deeper into the tree, double-click another  <br>child. To back out of the registry, double-click on the ".." at the top of  <br>the list box, or press the Back/Up button. <br> <br>If the current key has values associated with it, the name of the values is  <br>listed in the right list box (labeled VALUES). If it has no values, VALUES  <br>is followed by a "0". Once you come to a key that does have values  <br>associated with it, you can double-click on any of the values in this list  <br>box. At the bottom of the dialog box are two edit fields: Value: Data Type  <br>and Value: Data Entry. By double-clicking a value entry, these edit fields  <br>are filled with the data's type and the data's value.  <br> <br>If the current key has a class type associated with it, it appears in the  <br>Class edit field. The ACL edit field is not implemented at this time. </code></pre>
