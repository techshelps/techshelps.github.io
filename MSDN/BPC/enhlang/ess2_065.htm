<p>To broadcast an asset live, use the keyword, <i>now</i>. This keyword indicates that the event in which <i>now</i> appears should take place immediately. You would use this keyword in the course of live broadcasts, or to broadcast an enhancement that has been corrected or updated.
</p>


<p>
<b>Applies To</b>
</p>

<p>
All events.
</p>


<p>
<b>Syntax</b>
</p>

<i><b>now</b> event syntax ;</i>

<p>
<b>Example</b>
</p>

<p>
The following statement causes the file "Scoreboard.htm" to be broadcast immediately:
</p>

<p>
<font face="Lucida Sans Typewriter, Courier New">
now "Scoreboard.htm";
</font>
</p>

<p>
Obviously, time expressed in this form cannot be preceded by the keyword <B>before</B>.
</p>

<p>
A trigger can also be broadcast immediately. For example, the following statement sends the file immediately, and then sends the specified trigger, <b>NavTarget</b>, to display the file in the portion of the viewing area titled "Left:"
</p>

<p>
<font face="Lucida Sans Typewriter, Courier New">
now trigger (3 "Left" "Segment7.htm");
</font>
</p>

<p>
To send a trigger only&#151;that is, in the event the file targeted in the trigger has already been downloaded to the viewer's machine&#151;use the keyword <B>only</B>, as in the following example:
</p>

<p>
<font face="Lucida Sans Typewriter, Courier New">
now trigger (3 "Left" "Segment7.htm") only;
</font>
</p>
