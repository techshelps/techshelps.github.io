<p>
To specify how long the files of an interactive show remain on a viewer's computer, use the reserved variable, <b>Timeout</b>.
</p>

<p>
Files created for an interactive show are generally needed only for the duration of a specific program. To prevent these files from accumulating over time and quickly filling the viewer's hard disk, a <i>garbage collector</i> removes files when their <i>timeout value</i> has been exceeded.
</p>

<p>
The timeout value is an absolute time relative to the beginning of a program (0 seconds or 00:00:00.0 in SMPTE time code).
</p>

<p>
By default, all files transmitted by the Stream Compiler are given a default timeout value which can be set by the built-in variable <b>Timeout</b>.
</p>


<p>
<b>Syntax</b>
</p>

<p>
<i><b>Timeout</b> = hh:mm:ff ;</i>
</p>

<p>
where <i>hh</i> is an integer denoting hours, <i>mm</i> is an integer denoting minutes, and <i>ff</i> is an integer denoting frames. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Examples</b>
</p>

<p>
The <b>Timeout</b> value you set is active upon only those files that come after the occurrence of the <b>Timeout</b> line of text. For example,

<p>
<font face="Lucida Sans Typewriter, Courier New">
00:01:56.40	"storm010.htm" ;
<br>
<b>Timeout</b> = 00:31:00.0;
<br>
00:02:10.20	"storm020.htm" ;
<br>
00:03:06.60	"storm030.htm" ;
</font>
</p>


<p>
At 31 minutes into the show, files storm020.htm and storm030.htm will be deleted from the viewer's hard drive, but not storm010.htm, since it appears before the occurrence of <b>Timeout</b>. This is useful if there are certain files you want to leave on the viewer's computer after the show is over.
</p>

<p>
Conversely, if <b>Timeout</b> appears as one of the first statements in the list, then all subsequent transmitted files are assigned a timeout value causing them to expire 31 minutes after the show begins. In most cases, it is sufficient to specify a global timeout in this way.
</p>

<p>
The default value of <b>Timeout</b> can be changed to a different value at any point in the list of statements. Statements specified subsequent to the change in the value of <b>Timeout</b> will transmit files with the new timeout value.
</p>

<p>
<b>Timeout</b> can also be overridden for individual files, without changing the default timeout value, by appending the following phrase to a statement that causes the file to be transmitted:
</p>

<p>
<i><b>Timeout</b> = time ;</i>
</p>

<p>
where <i>time</i> is an expression of time relative to the start of the program. For example, the following statement causes the file Test4.htm and all its dependencies to be completely transmitted by 1:20 (relative to start of program), and to be deleted after the tenth minute of the program, instead of at the default timeout time:
</p>

<p>
<font face="Lucida Sans Typewriter, Courier New">
before 00:01:20.00 "Test4.htm" timeout 00:10:00.0;
</font>
</p>


<p>
The <b>Timeout</b> override applies to all files and their dependencies listed in the statement.
