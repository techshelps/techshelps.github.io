<p>
To specify that you want hypertext references (HREFs) within an asset to be downloaded as dependencies of that asset, use the reserved variable, <b>HRef</b>.
</p>

<p>
This setting applies to the downloading of those HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) files that have jumps to other HTML files (in which case the jump, defined using the HTML tag &lt;A&gt;, makes use of the parameter HREF to define the destination of the jump). In the course of an interactive show, when an HTML file is downloaded ahead of time, its dependencies (files that appear within it, such as animations and graphics) are also downloaded. But HREF&#151;that parameter in an HTML jump that specifies the destination of the jump&#151;is a different matter.
</p>

<p>
To make this more clear, it might help to look at an example of HTML code that uses an HREF parameter. In the following HTML code, the anchor tag that makes the text "Restless savannah nights" clickable, includes the HREF parameter, which defines the destination of the jump, namely, nocturnal.htm.
</p>

<p>
<blockquote>
For more information about the nocturnal habits of lions, see &lt;A <b>HREF</b>="nocturnal.htm"&gt;Restless savannah nights&lt;/A&gt;.
</blockquote>
</p>

<p>
Technically, the destination file <i>nocturnal.htm</i> is not a dependency of the HTML file it appears in, but you can choose to have it treated as such using in your stream script the reserved variable <b>HRef</b>. If you exclude the <b>HRef</b> reserved variable altogether, thereby choosing not to have HREFs downloaded as dependencies, they will be downloaded when the trigger fires to display the parent HTML file that the they appear in.
</p>

<p>
<b>Syntax</b>
</p>

<p>
<i><b>HRef</b> = parameter ;</i> 
</p>

<p>
where <i>parameter</i> can be one of the following two options:
<br>
<br>
</p>

<p>
<i>After</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When an HTML file is downloaded, any HTML files referenced in jumps within that "parent" file are downloaded immediately after the parent is downloaded.
</p>

<p>
<i>Before</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When an HTML file is downloaded, any HTML files referenced in jumps within that "parent" file are downloaded immediately before the parent is downloaded.
<br>
<br>
</p>


<p>
To not have HREF destination files downloaded as dependencies of a parent HTML file, simply do not include the HRef reserved variable in your stream script.
</p>
