<p>
To display a page in either the base page or a specific target of the interactive show, use the trigger <i>Nav</i>.
</p>

<p>
The Nav trigger serves one of the two following purposes:
</p>


<ul>
	<li>Navigates the highest-level window of the browser to the specified URL (Uniform Resource Locator). (This produces the same result as setting TARGET=&quot;_top&quot; in an HREF link.) In such a case, this trigger can be used to reset the entire interactive show. However, it is not normally needed, because the Program Guide contains the base URL for each show, and updates the container automatically when the viewer changes channels or when a new show begins on the same channel.
	<li>Causes the file specified by a <i>URL</i> to be loaded into the screen area specified by <i>target</i>. The screen area that is targeted is defined in the HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) base page using any of the following tags: &lt;FRAME&gt;, &lt;IFRAME&gt;, &lt;SPAN&gt;, &lt;DIV&gt;. Using this type of trigger, it is possible to sequence complex interactive content without any scripting.
	<li>
</ul>

<p>
By default, this trigger type causes both the enhancement and its dependencies to display on the consumer's receiver, such as a WebTV<font size="-2">&#174;</font> Plus set-top box or a broadcast-enabled computer. If the enhancement and dependencies of the trigger have not yet been broadcast to the viewer's receiver prior to the trigger firing, they are broadcast when the trigger fires and are then displayed in the specified frame.
</p>

<p>
<b>Syntax</b>
</p>



<p>
<b>trigger (</b><i>2</i> <b>"&lt;</b><i>URL</i><b>&gt;  [targ:</b><i>target</i><b>]") ;</b>
</p>

<p>
Where
</p>

<dl>

<dt>
<i>2</i>
</dt>
<dd>
is the key denoting that the trigger is <b>Nav</b>.
</dd>

<dt>
<i>URL</i>
</dt>
<dd>
is a string indicating the location of the HTML page that is to be displayed. This location can be either a fully specified URL, or a URL relative to the spool directory, C:\Program Files\TV Viewer\Enhspool\.
</dd>


<dt>
<i>target</i>
</dt>

<dd>
is an optional parameter indicating the name of the screen area that the enhancement will appear in. When this parameter is absent, the event will display the specified URL in the highest-level window of the browser.
</dd>
</dl>


<p>
<b>Remarks</b>
</p>


<p>
Broadcast Architecture also supports the following alternative formats for Nav triggers:
</p>

<p>
<b>trigger (</b><i>3</i> <b>"</b><i>target</i> <i>URL</i><b>") ;</b>
</p>

<p>
Where all parameters are the same as described preceding, but the key value is three. This format has been kept for compatibility with earlier versions of Broadcast Architecture.
</p>

<p>
<b>trigger (</b><i>2</i> <b>"[</b><i>target</i><b>]  </b><i>URL</i><b>") ;</b>
</p>

<p>
Where all parameters are the same as described preceding. This is the ASF (Advanced Streaming Format) format used by NetShow.
</p>

<p>
<b>Examples</b>
</p>

<p>
In this example, the main HTML page of the interactive show, default.htm, has already been downloaded and is resident in the show's folder, Tales of the Thames\. This trigger is set to fire every 60 seconds until the end of the show.
</p>

<p>
<font face="Lucida Sans Typewriter, Courier New">
00:05:32.20	trigger (2 "&lt;Tales of the Thames\default.htm&gt;") repeat 00:01:00.00 until 00:30:00.00 ;
</font>
</p>


<p>
The following statement causes the file "Left_07.htm" and its dependencies to be broadcast <I>by</I> 10:30, and then triggered <I>at</I> 10:30 to appear in the screen area labeled "Left":
</p>

<p>
<font face="Lucida Sans Typewriter, Courier New">
trigger (2 "&lt;Left_07.htm&gt; [targ:Left]");
</font>
</p>

<p>
Assuming the HTML file Left_07.htm has only one dependency&#151;one that makes reference to the dependency file banner.gif&#151;the following three statements collectively are equal to the single statement above (provided the necessary bandwidth is available):
<p>

<p>
<font face="Lucida Sans Typewriter, Courier New">
00:10:19:00 "banner.gif";<BR>
00:10:26:00 "Left_07.htm";<BR>
00:10:30:00 trigger (2 "&lt;Left_07.htm&gt; [targ:Left]") only;
</font>
</p>
