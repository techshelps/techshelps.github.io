<p>To repeat an event at a regular interval, use the keyword, <i>repeat</i>. This keyword indicates that the event in which <i>repeat</i> appears should be repeated at the interval indicated or the number of times specified. If a viewer tunes in late to a program, the files necessary to display the enhancements may not be available. For this reason, it is important to repeat the transmission of files as frequently as possible.
</p>

<p>
<b>Applies To</b>
</p>

<p>
All events.
</p>


<p>
<b>Syntax</b>
</p>

<p>
<i><b>repeat</b> interval <b>until</b> endtime ;</i>
</p>


<p>
<b>Examples</b>
</p>

<p>
In the following example, the statement causes the file "Segment2.htm" to begin transmission thirty seconds into the program and be retransmitted every minute until the end of the show, as defined by the built-in variable <b>ShowLength</b>:
</p>

<p>
<font face="Lucida Sans Typewriter, Courier New">       00:00:30:00 "Segment2.htm" repeat 60 until ShowLength;</font>
<br>
<br>
<br>
</p>

<p>
This construct also works with the <b>before</b> keyword. For example, the following statement transmits "Segment5.htm" and its dependencies by 5:20 in the program, and repeats the transmission of the file and its dependencies once a minute until the end of the program:
</p>

<p>
<font face="Lucida Sans Typewriter, Courier New">       before 00:05:20:00 "Segment5.htm" repeat 60 until ShowLength;</font>
</p>


<!--<p>
The file name can also be replaced by a list of files. See <a href="_CDK_Specify_a_list_of_files">Specify a List of Files</a>.
<br>
<br>
<br>
</p>-->

<p>
The <b>repeat</b>...<b>until</b> construct also works with trigger statements, and may appear in the same statement with or without a timeout override.
