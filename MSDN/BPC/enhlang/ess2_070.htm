<p>To prevent dependencies from being broadcast with an asset, use the keyword, <i>only</i>. This keyword indicates that any assets or enhancements named in the event in which <i>only</i> appears should be handled alone; their associated dependencies should not also be acted upon by the event. In the case of a download event, this keyword is useful for managing bandwidth if the asset being broadcast has numerous dependencies.</p>

<p>
When used in a trigger event, the keyword <b>only</b> can be used to keep the trigger from downloading again files that have already been downloaded.
</p>


<p>
<b>Applies To</b>
</p>

<p>
All events.
</p>


<p>
<b>Syntax</b>
</p>

<p>
<i>event syntax <b>only</b>;</i>
</p>


<p>
<b>Example</b>
</p>

<p>
In the following example, the file default.htm&#151;without any of its dependencies&#151;is broadcast at the 10:30:00 mark in the show:
</p>

<p>
<font face="Lucida Sans Typewriter, Courier New">
00:10:30:00 "default.htm" only;
</font>
</p>


<p>
In the following example, the statement assumes that the file Left_07.htm and its dependencies already exist on the client, and transmits only the trigger itself, <b>Navigate Target</b>, causing the file and its dependencies to display in the frame titled "Left:"

</p>

<p>
<font face="Lucida Sans Typewriter, Courier New">
00:10:30:00 trigger ( 3 "Left" "Left_07.htm") only;
</font>
</p>
