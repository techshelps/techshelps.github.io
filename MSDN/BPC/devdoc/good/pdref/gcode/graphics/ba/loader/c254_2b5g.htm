<pre><code>Loader DLL to demonstrate loading data into the Guide database 
 
 
SUMMARY 
======= 
 
Load is a sample loader that shows how to create a loader that edits data for the Guide database. It is designed to run with version 1.0 of Broadcast Architecture running under the Microsoft Windows 98 operating system. 
 
MORE INFORMATION 
================ 
 
The following information describes the Load sample. 
 
Requirements 
----------------------------- 
Load.exe must be compiled using Microsoft Visual C++ 5.0 with Microsoft Foundation Classes (MFC). In addition, the Data Access Objects (DAO) Software Development Kit (SDK) must be installed. 
 
You must configure your environment before compiling Load.exe. First, make sure that the environment variable INCLUDE points to the Visual C++ Include directory, the DAO SDK Include directory, and the MFC Include directory. Similarly, make sure the environment variable LIB points to the Visual C++ Lib directory, the DAO SDK Lib directory, and the MFC Lib directory. 
 
To Compile Load 
----------------------------- 
 
Use the following command to compile the sample: 
 
   nmake load.mak 
 
For make options, see the makefile header comments. 
 
If the build tools cannot find Sdkutil.lib, use the Samples\Com\Common sample to build Sdkutil.lib. 
 
To Run Load 
----------------------------- 
 
Load runs under the Broadcast Architecture program Loadstub.exe. The first step is to copy Load to the TV Viewer directory on your Windows 98 system. Next, you must add a registry key under HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\TV Services\Guide\Loaders. The name of the key is the GUID that you want to use for this loader. Under this new key, add a string value called Name. The data in this entry is the complete path to Load.dll. 
 
Here is an example of a registry entry: 
 
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\TV Services\Guide\Loaders\{1234 9ABC 9998 DDD} 
Namec:\Windows\Program Files\TV Viewer\Load.dll 
 
Now you can run Loadstub with the GUID in the /L: command line parameter. Here is the command line for running the loader with the previous registry entry: 
 
loadstub /L:{1234 9ABC 9998 DDD} 
 
Load Files 
------------- 
Load.cpp is the main program file for the loader. It contains the entry function called from Loadstub and routines to manipulate the database.
