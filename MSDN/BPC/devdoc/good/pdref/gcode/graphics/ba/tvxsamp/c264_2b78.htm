<pre><code>An MFC sample that connects to and controls TV Viewer. 
 
Summary 
======= 
TVXSamp is an MFC application that connects to and controls an instance of TV Viewer. The sample has a single dialog box with buttons you can push to test its functionality. On startup, TVXSamp gets a reference to a currently running instance of TV Viewer. It uses this reference to call methods of the TV Viewer dispatch interface, ITVViewer.  
 
For more information, see `` TV Viewer `` and `` Creating TV Viewer Controls `` 
in the Broadcast Architecture Programmer's Reference. 
 
More Information 
================ 
The following information describes the TVXSamp sample. 
 
 
To Compile TVXSamp 
------------------ 
From the command prompt, use the following command: 
 
nmake 
 
 
To Run TVXSamp 
-------------- 
You must start TV Viewer before you run TVXSamp.exe. Otherwise, TVXSamp will not be able to connect to TV Viewer and a run-time error will occur. 
 
Start TVXSamp.exe either from the command line by typing "TVXSamp", or by double-clicking the TVXSamp icon from Windows Explorer. A dialog box will appear, containing the following buttons: 
 
[Toggle TV Mode] 
Toggles TV Viewer between full screen and desktop mode. 
 
[Tune to TV Config] 
Tunes TV Viewer to the TV Config channel, 1. 
 
[Tune Back to Previous Channel] 
Tunes TV Viewer to the previous channel. This is the same  
functionality as a Back button in a Web browser. 
 
 
TVXSamp Files 
============= 
 
Tvdisp.h 
This is the header file for the TV Viewer dispatch interface.  
It is created from Tvdisp.odl 
 
TVXSamp.h 
    This is the main header file for the application.  It includes other 
    project specific headers (including Resource.h) and declares the 
    CTVXSampApp application class. 
 
TVXSamp.cpp 
    This is the main application source file that contains the application 
    class CTVXSampApp. 
 
TVXSamp.rc 
    This is a listing of all of the Microsoft Windows resources that the 
    program uses.  It includes the icons, bitmaps, and cursors that are stored 
    in the RES subdirectory.  This file can be directly edited in Microsoft 
Developer Studio. 
 
res\TVXSamp.ico 
    This is an icon file, which is used as the application's icon.  This 
    icon is included by the main resource file TVXSamp.rc. 
 
res\TVXSamp.rc2 
    This file contains resources that are not edited by Microsoft  
Developer Studio.  You should place all resources not 
editable by the resource editor in this file. 
 
TVXSamp.reg 
    This is an example .REG file that shows you the kind of registration 
    settings the framework will set for you.  You can use this as a .REG 
    file to go along with your application. 
 
TVXSamp.odl 
    This file contains the Object Description Language source code for the 
    type library of your application. 
 
TVXSamp.clw 
    This file contains information used by ClassWizard to edit existing 
    classes or add new classes.  ClassWizard also uses this file to store 
    information needed to create and edit message maps and dialog data 
    maps and to create prototype member functions. 
 
 
///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////// 
 
AppWizard creates one dialog class and automation proxy class: 
 
TVXSampDlg.h, TVXSampDlg.cpp - the dialog 
    These files contain your CTVXSampDlg class.  This class defines 
    the behavior of your application's main dialog.  The dialog's 
    template is in TVXSamp.rc, which can be edited in Microsoft 
Developer Studio. 
 
DlgProxy.h, DlgProxy.cpp - the automation object 
    These files contain your CTVXSampDlgAutoProxy class.  This class 
    is called the "automation proxy" class for your dialog, because it 
    takes care of exposing the automation methods and properties that 
    automation controllers can use to access your dialog.  These methods 
    and properties are not exposed from the dialog class directly, because 
    in the case of a modal dialog-based MFC application it is cleaner and 
    easier to keep the OLE automation object separate from the user interface. 
 
 
///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////// 
Other standard files: 
 
StdAfx.h, StdAfx.cpp 
    These files are used to build a precompiled header (PCH) file 
    named TVXSamp.pch and a precompiled types file named StdAfx.obj. 
 
Resource.h 
    This is the standard header file, which defines new resource IDs. 
    Microsoft Developer Studio reads and updates this file.
