A <a href="glos_9mic.htm#_bpc_tuning_space_gly"><i>tuning space</i></a> enables a <a href="glos_9egp.htm#_bpc_broadcast_client_gly"><i>broadcast client</i></a> to resolve overlapping channel numbers used by multiple broadcast sources. For example, suppose a computer has both an analog television tuner and a satellite tuner card installed. If the two broadcast systems each have a channel 1, a conflict occurs. To prevent such conflicts, Broadcast Architecture defines each input source as a separate tuning space, assigning it a unique identifier. </p>
<p>
Each tuning space has both a unique numerical identifier, and a human-readable name such as analog tuner, cable, or satellite.</p>
<p>
You can use methods of the TSS object library to map a tuning space identifier to its user-readable name and vice versa. For example, if your application needs to present a list of tuning spaces to users, it can look up the tuning spaces in the Guide database and then map each tuning space to a human-readable name. Conversely, when a user selects a tuning space, your application needs to map the tuning space name to its identifier before your application can tune to a channel in that space.</p>
<p>
To map an identifier to the tuning space name, your application calls the <a href="tssr_3ycy.htm"><b>ITelevisionServices::TuningSpaceNameFromNumber</b></a> method. To map a name to its corresponding identifier, your application calls the <a href="tssr_8x7p.htm"><b>ITelevisionServices::TuningSpaceNumberFromName</b></a> method.</p>
