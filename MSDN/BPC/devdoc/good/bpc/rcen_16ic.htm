<p>
The <b>Annc </b>object wraps an enhancement announcement. The fields of the announcement are stored as properties in the object. The <b>Annc </b>object also provides file-access methods that enable your application to save an announcement to a file or load an announcement from a file.</p>
<p>
Saving an announcement to a file enables you to broadcast the announcement at a later time, as is typically the case. Announcements are saved as text files. By convention, announcement files have the extension .ann.</p>
