<p>
The generic filter will be provided in future releases of the Broadcast Architecture software. It will be programmable to match any announcement field, either as a regular or numeric expression. The disposition of the broadcast (such as receiving application, working directory) may also be specified.</p>
<p>
This interface is currently in development, pending decisions on the announcement protocol.</p>
<p>
The current version of the generic filter allows matching for any arbitrary line. In contrast, the <b>ISDP</b> interface contains specified properties including telephone, address, start time, stop time, and others. With this interface, searching is not required; instead the generic filter will contain properties that roughly correspond to those of the <b>ISDP</b> interface, except that search strings, rather than values, are specified.</p>
<p>
For example, the generic filter will include a Uniform Resource Locator (URL) match string that corresponds to the session URL string in the ISDP interface. The URL match string might contain http://www.microsoft.com/*.* to indicate all files at the Microsoft site. Each of these fixed properties will have a regular expression for matching.</p>
<p>
For extensible attributes, the <b>a</b> field allows arbitrary fields. An arbitrary field can contain anything. The interfaces supports as many <b>a</b> lines as needed. The line may take either of the following forms:</p>
<p>
<b>a=</b><i>flag</i><br>
<b>a=</b><i>attribute</i><b>:</b><i>value</i></p>
<p>
For example, the line <b>a=difficulty:friendly</b> specifies <b>friendly</b> as the value of the attribute <b>difficulty</b>.</p>
