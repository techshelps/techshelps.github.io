The design of Broadcast Architecture enables personal computers to receive video and digital data from virtually any broadcast source, including existing satellite, cable, and terrestrial television networks. Effective with the Microsoft® Windows® 98 operating system, every copy of Windows shipped includes extensions that support Broadcast Architecture. Any computer running these extensions, and equipped with enabling hardware, can receive interactive entertainment and information delivered through high-speed, nationwide broadcast channels. </p>

Broadcast Architecture offers an evolutionary step in the progress of computers and television. By using Broadcast Architecture, you can build upon your existing content and technologies, while creating added value by combining them in new ways. At the same time, Broadcast Architecture suggests new avenues for the distribution of home entertainment, news, information, education, software, and general retail merchandise. </p>
