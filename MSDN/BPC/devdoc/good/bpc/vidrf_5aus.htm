<p>
You can add the Video control to Microsoft® Foundation Classes (MFC) and Active Template Library (ATL) projects in the Microsoft® Visual C++® development system. To do this, use the following procedure.</p>
<h5><img src="../../images/wedge.gif" border=0>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To add the Video control to a Visual C++ project</h5>
<ol>
<li>
Open or create a Visual C++ project.</li>
<li>
Select <b>Add To Project</b> from the Project menu.</li>
<li>
Select <b>Components and Controls</b> from the pop-up menu. <p>
A dialog box appears displaying a set of folders containing components. Open the folder titled Registered ActiveX Controls.
</li>
<li>
Select Vid Control from the list and click the Insert button. If Vid Control is not included in the list, verify that the WebTV for Windows component of Windows 98 is installed.<p>
The Confirm Classes dialog box appears, which enables you to select which of the Video control's classes you would like to add to your application.  
</li>
<li>
Select the check boxes next to the classes you want to add to your project. Note that several of the classes listed are reserved for future use and are not currently implemented. For a list of the Video control's reserved classes, see <a href="vidrf_8sz0.htm">Reserved Classes in the Video Control</a>.<p>
Visual C++ automatically generates header and implementation files for the classes you select and adds them to your project.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
Once the Video control has been added to your project, you can create instances of Video control objects, access the Video control's methods, properties, and events, and add the Video control to user interfaces.</p>
<p>
<b>Note</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;To access objects that are not part of the Video control, such as <b>BPCVBIControl</b> and <b>BPCSuspend</b>, run Mytyplib.exe on Vidsvr.odl and insert the generated files into your project. In addition, you can use the header file Bpcsusp.h, which wraps the <b>IBPCSuspend</b> interface and provides additional suspend functionality.</p>
<p>
The software included with the Broadcast Architecture Programmer's Reference includes a sample MFC application, VideoMFC.exe, that uses the Video control. For more information about this sample, see <a href="using_8i2b.htm">Broadcast Architecture Sample Applications</a>.</p>
