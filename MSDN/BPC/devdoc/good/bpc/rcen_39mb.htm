<p>
The stream compiler objects are a set of Component Object Model (COM) objects that provide functionality to create, edit, and save enhancement streams. You can use these objects to create enhancement stream authoring tools. </p>
<p>
The following topics illustrate how to use the stream compiler objects to implement various types of stream-authoring functionality: 
<ul>
<li>
<a href="rcen_82el.htm">Adding Events to an Enhancement Stream</a> explains how to use the stream compiler objects to add events to an enhancement stream.</li>
<li>
<a href="rcen_9zcd.htm">Locating an Event in the Enhancement Stream</a> explains how to find a particular event in the enhancement stream.</li>
<li>
<a href="rcen_61bh.htm">Editing and Deleting Events in an Enhancement Stream</a> explains how to change or remove an event from the enhancement stream.</li>
<li>
<a href="rcen_9mk3.htm">Creating Enhancement Announcements</a> describes how to create the enhancement announcement files that are transmitted during an announcement event.</li>
<li>
<a href="rcen_54ok.htm">Adding User-Defined Comments to an Event</a> explains how to add subevents to an event using the stream compiler objects.</li>
<li>
<a href="rcen_1s38.htm">Editing the Dependencies of an Event</a> describes how to modify the dependencies files of an event. You can use this to set custom dependencies for the event, or to modify the dependency list generated by the stream compiler objects.</li>
<li>
<a href="rcen_1ewi.htm">Including One Enhancement Stream in Another</a> describes how to include enhancement streams within other enhancement streams. You can use this technique to combine enhancement streams, or to build a playlist that runs several shows.</li>
<li>
<a href="rcen_6wqb.htm">Merging Enhancement Streams</a> explains how to combine events from two or more enhancement streams into a single stream.</li>
<li>
<a href="rcen_2f5k.htm">Converting Events to Low-level Syntax</a> describes high-level and low-level stream syntax and explains how to convert an enhancement stream or event to low-level format.</li>
<li>
<a href="rcen_4jzh.htm">Loading or Saving an Enhancement Stream</a> explains how to read an enhancement stream from a text file and save the stream to disk.</li>
</ul>
