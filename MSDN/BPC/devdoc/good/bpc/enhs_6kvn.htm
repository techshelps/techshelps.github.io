<p>
Sometimes a user may wish to combine enhancement streams. For example, if multiple production teams are working on different aspects of the interactive show or if the user is creating a master enhancement stream that comprises several consecutively-broadcast shows. </p>
<p>
When your application combines two streams it should resolve time and resource conflicts. For example, if events in the combined streams occur simultaneously, your application should shift one of the events to occur slightly earlier or slightly later so that they do not occur at the same time.</p>
<p>
The stream compiler objects provide two ways to combine streams: merging and including. The difference between merging and including a stream is how you specify the relative starting time of the added stream. When two files are merged, the starting time of the added stream is specified in <a href="rcen_3v03.htm"><b>EnhEvents.LoadBias</b></a>. If you are including one stream within another, the second stream's start time is relative to the time the stream was included.</p>
<p>
For more information about using the enhancement stream objects to combine streams, see <a href="rcen_6wqb.htm">Merging Enhancement Streams</a> and <a href="rcen_1ewi.htm">Including One Enhancement Stream in Another</a>.</p>
