In Broadcast Architecture, one receiver for all remote controls connects to the computer through the keyboard, mouse, and possibly joystick ports. Alternatively, the receiver can use a driver supplied by its hardware vendor that emulates these ports. This design allows each remote device to send data to each computer port. For example, a remote control might act as a mouse but might also send special keyboard scan codes. (For more information on these codes, see <a href="hwreq_820j.htm">New Windows Keys</a>.)</p>
<p>
The following illustration shows the relationship between the remote controls, the receiver, and the computer.</p>
