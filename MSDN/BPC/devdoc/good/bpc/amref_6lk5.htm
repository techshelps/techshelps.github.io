<p>
This section documents features of the filters based on the Microsoft® DirectShow™ application programming interface (API) found on the broadcast client. Applications access these filters through the Microsoft® ActiveX® control for video (the Video control). Applications use these filters to control playback and display of video and audio. In addition to the filters described here, broadcast clients use filters that are part of the Microsoft® Windows® 98 operating system. To locate a description of these filters, see <a href="abou1_9asr.htm">Further General Information</a>.</p>
<p>
<b>Note</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;For reference purposes, each filter description following includes the name of the file containing that filter. However, you do not typically address a filter through that file name. Instead, you rely on the Video control to work with the Video Access server to set the connections for your application.</p>
