<p>
In order to display a video stream, your application must first set an input device or source for that stream. Your application does this by setting the <a href="vidrf_1yd0.htm"><b>BPCVid.Input</b></a> property of the Video control equal to one of the available devices in the <a href="vidrf_0xwz.htm"><b>BPCDevices</b></a> collection. </p>
<p>
There are many different types of input devices. Your application must ensure that any device it selects as an input device supports the operations that it is trying to perform. To do so, your application can use properties of the form <b>Has</b><i>Xxxx</i>, which indicate whether the current device supports the property <i>Xxxx</i>.</p>
<p>
For example, the <a href="vidrf_1ar0.htm"><b>BPCDeviceBase.HasChannel</b></a> indicates whether the device supports channels and can be tuned by calling <a href="vidrf_20x8.htm"><b>BPCDeviceBase.Channel</b></a>. The <b>HasChannel</b> property of a television <a href="glos_9mic.htm#_bpc_tuner_gly"><i>tuner</i></a> card is True. </p>
<p>
If there are multiple tuners available on a broadcast client, your application can use the <a href="vidrf_4q91.htm"><b>BPCDeviceBase.ChannelAvailable</b></a> method to determine whether a device can tune to the specified channel.</p>
<p>
Once your application has selected a device that supports the intended video stream from <b>BPCDevices</b>, your application can set that device as the input device. This process is illustrated in the following example:</p>
<pre><code>'Search the collection for a device that 
'supports channels. When one is found, set the 
'that device as the input device.
 
For Each Device In vid.Devices
  If Device.HasChannel Then
    vid.Input = Device
    Exit For
  End If
Next
 </code></pre>
