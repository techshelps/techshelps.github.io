<h1><a name="_bpc_broadcast_architecture_sample_applications"></a>Broadcast Architecture Sample Applications</h1>
<p>
<span style=color:#FF0000>[This is preliminary documentation and subject to change.]</span> </p>
<p>
A group of sample applications, controls, and libraries for use with Broadcast Architecture is provided on the compact disc with the Microsoft® Platform Software Development Kit (SDK). </p>
<p>
Text files including sources, libraries, and control files needed to create executable versions of the samples reside in the <i>SDKdir</i>\Samples\Graphics\Ba directory. Note that <i>SDKdir</i> in this path represents either the Mssdk directory on the Platform SDK compact disc, or the directory you selected for installing the Platform SDK.</p>
<p>
The samples are as follows:
<ul>
<li>
Four samples developed in different ways demonstrate how to use the Video control to display video. These samples are located in the UseVideo subdirectory: <ul>
<li>
The Vid_Tune subdirectory contains a Microsoft® Visual Basic® group comprising a Visual Basic control and a Visual Basic project to test the control. The Visual Basic control contains a Video control as a constituent control. </li>
<li>
The VidCntrl subdirectory contains a Visual Basic project that uses the Video control. </li>
<li>
The VideoMFC subdirectory contains a Microsoft® Visual C++® project workspace that uses the Video control. </li>
<li>
The WebTune subdirectory contains a Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) document that Internet Explorer uses to display a Video control.</li>
</ul>
<p>
For more information on how to run each sample, see the Readme.txt file in the UseVideo subdirectory.
</li>
<li>
Two samples developed in different ways, Load and Download, demonstrate how to write Guide database loaders. The Loader subdirectory contains source code for the Load sample, a simplified loader that gives an unobstructed view of how certain loader functions work. The Download subdirectory contains source code for the Download sample, which shows how to write a full-featured loader. For more information on each sample, see the Readme.txt file in the subdirectory for that sample.</li>
<li>
The sample application Schsamp.dll is a Microsoft® ActiveX® component that schedules a show reminder. It is located in the subdirectory Schsamp.<b> </b>For information on how to compile and run Schsamp.dll, see the Readme.txt file in that subdirectory.</li>
<li>
The sample application Lr.exe runs a VCR using a remote control. It is located in the subdirectory Record. For information on how to compile and run Lr.exe, see the Readme.txt file in that subdirectory.</li>
<li>
The sample MFC application Tvxsamp.exe demonstrates how to connect to and control Microsoft® WebTV® for Windows®. It is located in the subdirectory Tvxsamp.<b> </b>For information on how to compile and run Tvxsamp.exe, see the Readme.txt file in that subdirectory.</li>
<li>
The sample applications Enhancement Stream Editor and Stream Player create and test an enhancement stream. They demonstrate how an application can use the Stream Compiler object library to implement stream authoring functionality. Both of these samples are located in the subdirectory Enhance\Author. For more information on how to compile and run these samples, see the Editor.txt and Player.txt; for more detailed information on what the samples do, see the Readme.txt file in the Enhance\Author subdirectory.</li>
<li>
The sample application Validator checks the syntax of an enhancement stream file. If errors are found, Validator displays them to the user. The user can then use Validator to correct the syntax and recheck the file. This sample is located in the Enhance\Validate directory. For more information on how to run and compile this sample, see the Readme.txt file in that directory.</li>
<li>
The sample stream authoring tool Quizstr.exe generates a custom enhancement stream for a quiz show. It is located in the directory Enhance\Quizstr. For information on how to compile and run Quizstr.exe, see the Readme.txt file in that subdirectory.</li>
<li>
The sample applications Wsend and Wlisten send and receive multicast data. In addition, Wsend sends data to the Microsoft® Multicast Router using a tunnel. The sample library Brtest includes functions used by Wsend and Wlisten. These samples are located in the subdirectories Brtest, Wsend, and Wlisten. For more information on how to compile and run each sample, see the Readme.txt file in the subdirectory for that sample.</li>
</ul>
