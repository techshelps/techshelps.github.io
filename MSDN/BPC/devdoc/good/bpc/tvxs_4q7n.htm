<p>
Microsoft® WebTV® for Windows® sends event notifications for such events as tuning to a new channel and navigating to a new enhancement page. Your control receives notification of WebTV for Windows events by doing the following:
<ol>
<li>
Implementing the <a href="tvxrf_0ujw.htm"><b>ITVControl</b></a> interface.</li>
<li>
Obtaining a reference to WebTV for Windows as described in <a href="tvxs_3m43.htm">Connecting to WebTV for Windows</a>. Your control must obtain this reference before it can call the methods exposed by <b>ITVViewer </b>or register an <b>ITVControl</b> notification sink.</li>
<li>
Registering its implementation of <b>ITVControl</b> as a notification sink with WebTV for Windows. This enables your control to receive WebTV for Windows event notifications.</li>
</ol>
<p>
For a detailed description of how this is done, see <a href="tvxrf_08vf.htm">Registering an <b>ITVControl</b> Sink</a>.</p>
<p>
<b>Note</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, WebTV for Windows only sends notifications to applications running in the same process as WebTV for Windows. An example of such an application is a Microsoft® ActiveX® control or component called from an enhancement page that is currently being displayed by WebTV for Windows.</p>
