A <a href="glos_2hyx.htm#_bpc_show_reminder_gly"><i>show reminder</i></a> is a task set in <a href="glos_9mic.htm#_bpc_task_scheduler_gly"><i>Task Scheduler</i></a> that at a specific time starts an application to remind users a show is about to begin. Broadcast Architecture provides two technologies that you can use to set a show reminder, <a href="tvxrf_2yb7.htm">Microsoft WebTV for Windows</a> and <a href="tssr_4z03.htm">Television System Services (TSS)</a>.</p>
<p>
The process of setting a reminder that appears in the Microsoft® WebTV® for Windows® user interface is identical to the process that occurs when a user sets a reminder by clicking a <b>Remind </b>button in the <a href="glos_3ptl.htm#_bpc_program_guide_gly"><i>Program Guide</i></a> user interface displayed by WebTV for Windows. To set such a show reminder, your application calls the <a href="tvxrf_88c2.htm"><b>ITVViewer</b></a> dispatch interface exposed by WebTV for Windows. A show reminder set using this interface is visible from the WebTV for Windows search page. Such a reminder also causes an icon indicating that the reminder has been set to appear in the Program Guide. </p>
<p>
The disadvantage to using WebTV for Windows to set a reminder is that the programming is more complex. Your application must ensure that WebTV for Windows is currently running, get a reference to <b>ITVViewer,</b> and implement the <a href="tvxrf_0ov9.htm"><b>IEPGEpisode</b></a> interface. For more information on this process, see <a href="tvxrf_0qlu.htm">Using <b>ITVViewer</b> to Schedule a Show Reminder</a>.</p>
<p>
If your application is relatively simple, for example a Microsoft® ActiveX® control or Java applet on an <a href="glos_86m1.htm#_bpc_enhancement_gly"><i>enhancement</i></a> page, you may find it more convenient to use TSS to schedule your show reminders. If you want TSS-set reminders to appear in the WebTV for Windows user interface as icons or on the search page, you must set reminders that meet the standards described in <a href="sched_1kmr.htm">Setting a Reminder That Appears in WebTV for Windows</a>. WebTV for Windows only displays reminders set by WebTV for Windows in these fashions. </p>
<p>
You can, however, use WebTV for Windows to display a message for a TSS-set reminder to the user, regardless of whether the TSS-set show reminders meet these standards. In other words, if you specify Tvx.exe in the command line for the reminder, WebTV for Windows will always attempt to display a reminder message when the reminder runs.</p>
