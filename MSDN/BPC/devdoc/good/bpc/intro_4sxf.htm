<p>
The operating-system software that forms part of Broadcast Architecture is intentionally based on industry standards, as described in <a href="intro_22sz.htm">Sticking to Standard Technologies</a>. These standards guarantee developers, manufacturers, and viewers a stable, well-supported platform that will gracefully evolve to support new technologies as they appear. </p>
<p>
In some areas, extensions to these standard technologies have been required. These extensions include:
<ul>
<li>
Extensions to accommodate the very large bandwidth occupied by high-quality digital audio and video streams, and to provide for flexible control over these streams. These extensions are special filters based on the Microsoft® DirectShow™ application programming interface (API). To locate more information on DirectShow, see <a href="abou1_9asr.htm">Further General Information</a>. </li>
<li>
Extensions to support interactions with users. Broadcast clients use specialized software to control, process, and display high-bandwidth broadcast streams. Some of this software, such as the <a href="glos_7ddl.htm#_bpc_guide_database_gly"><i>Guide database</i></a> system, also handles user interactions. The Guide database provides a single secure repository for program data. At the same time, any <a href="glos_2hyx.htm#_bpc_service_provider_gly"><i>service provider</i></a> can deliver application data to the database by writing a loader program.</li>
<li>
Extensions to support Television System Services (TSS), which allows users to tune to, schedule, and control available broadcasts. For more information, see <a href="tssr_4z03.htm">Television System Services</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Microsoft also provides other types of system software extensions, such as a transport layer specifically designed for broadcast needs. Because such components all function as part of the Microsoft® Windows® 98 operating system, third-party programmers can easily write programs that take advantage of them. </p>
<p>
Microsoft makes interfaces that support operating-system extensions available through the Microsoft® Platform Software Development Kit (SDK) and the Device-Driver Kit (DDK) for Windows 98. The Broadcast Architecture Programmer's Reference and the Broadcast Architecture DDK documentation cover these interfaces.</p>
