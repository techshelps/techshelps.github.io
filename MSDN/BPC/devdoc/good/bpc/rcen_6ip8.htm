<p>
The <b>ipsend </b>object provides methods that enable your application to monitor the status of an Enhancement control running in the same process as the <b>ipsend </b>object. If your application is using an Enhancement control, for example to review a newly created interactive show, you can use this functionality to monitor when the control is created, connects to a data stream, handles a trigger, is destroyed, and so on.</p>
<p>
In order for your application to be able to monitor the control status, it must set <a href="rcen_7u43.htm"><b>ipsend.ReportStatus</b></a> to a non-zero value. This causes in-process enhancement controls to send status messages. By default, such messages are not sent.</p>
<p>
<b>Note</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;If your application sets <b>ReportStatus </b>to a non-zero value, it must reset this value to zero when it no longer needs enhancement status reports or before it terminates. Otherwise, the <b>ipsend </b>object will not exit memory because of circular references to an internal status object.</p>
<p>
Once your application has set <b>ReportStatus </b>to a non-zero value, it will receive <a href="rcen_6dk4.htm"><b>ipsend.StatusChanged</b></a> events whenever the enhancement control's state changes. You can implement an event handler in your application to process this event.</p>
<p>
Your application can also check the status of the enhancement control using the <a href="rcen_214j.htm"><b>ipsend.Status</b></a> property. Once <b>ReportStatus </b>is set to a non-zero value, this property will contain the current status of the enhancement control running in the same process as <b>ipsend</b>.</p>
<p>
<b>Note</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;If you have multiple enhancement controls running in the same process as <b>ipsend</b>, the <b>ipsend </b>object cannot distinguish between status change notifications for each enhancement control. To avoid confusion, it is recommended that you have only one enhancement control running in-process with <b>ipsend</b>.</p>
