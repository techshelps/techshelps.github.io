<p>
Content server applications running on a network that includes a Microsoft® Multicast Router (MMR) can send data to the MMR for routing to the broadcast network. </p>
<p>
The software supporting Broadcast Architecture includes a sample, called Wsend that is a simple content server application. Another projects in the software supporting Broadcast Architecture, called Wlisten is a test program that you can use to monitor multicast packets sent by your content server application. A third project, Brtest, creates a library of objects used by WSend and Wlisten. To locate the source code for these samples, see <a href="using_8i2b.htm">Broadcast Architecture Sample Applications</a>. </p>
<p>
Content server applications are very diverse, and no one series of steps to create one can be recommended. How content server applications incorporate code to send data to the MMR differs widely. The WSend sample is a simple example of a content server application, designed to illustrate the use of the MMR access functions. For an overview on how to create a content server application, see <a href="srvap_3zw3.htm">Writing Content Server Applications</a>. </p>
<p>
