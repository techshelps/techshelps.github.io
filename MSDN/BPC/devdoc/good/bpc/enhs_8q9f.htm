<p>
An enhancement stream is a script that synchronizes enhancements with video. The following topics are intended for independent software vendors (ISVs) and tools vendors who want to develop enhancement authoring tools for users who produce interactive video, such as a video production company. </p>
<p>
The primary function of an enhancement stream authoring tool is to produce valid Enhancement Stream language statements that correctly display the interactive show. You can also incorporate functionality to test the enhancement stream and transmit it to broadcast clients.</p>
<p>
Because the Enhancement Stream language is a text-based syntax, an authoring tool can be a simple text editor. This, however, requires the user to be fluent in the Enhancement Stream language and to validate the syntax themselves. Many users prefer to use a robust editor that automatically generates and validates the enhancement stream syntax based on their directions.</p>
<p>
The following topics assume a working knowledge of interactive shows and enhancement stream. For general information about enhancements, see <a href="rcen_450z.htm">Video Enhancements</a>.</p>
