<p>
Broadcast Architecture currently provides a loader that adds Gemstar G-Guide programming data to the Guide database. This loader loads information from a data file that can be downloaded from the World Wide Web or received over the vertical blanking interval of a television broadcast. </p>
<p>
For this loader, a data location may be stored in an entry under the loader's registry key. This data location is the name of the file to use for input, for example C:\ProgramFiles\Program GuideData\Ssdata.bin. For more information on loader registry keys, see <a href="pgsrv_1fi1.htm">Loaders Subkey</a>. </p>
<p>
The data file created for the Gemstar G-Guide loader can come by a number of means, for example by television tuner signal or Internet channel.</p>
