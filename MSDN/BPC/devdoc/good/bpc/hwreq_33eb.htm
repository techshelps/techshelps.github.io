If a video card supports analog connections, it should allocate connections of input sources to output sinks. Actual device connections vary somewhat based on consumer equipment. However, some connections of inputs to outputs are fixed, in that they interconnect specific devices, such as computer encoders to decoders. There are many possible input sources and output sinks for analog connections, such as a VCR for playing, a VCR for recording, a laser disk player, a camcorder, a game console box, a cable box, a cassette tape deck, and an FM audio tuner.</p>
<p>
The following table shows suggested allocations of input lines to output lines for video and matches video input sources and output sinks with typical uses.</p>
