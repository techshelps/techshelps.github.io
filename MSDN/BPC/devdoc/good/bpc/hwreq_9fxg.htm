This section describes the functionality of a keyboard and the requirements it must meet to support Broadcast Architecture.</p>

<h4><a name="_bpc_keyboard_functionality"></a>Keyboard Functionality</h4>
<p>
The broadcast client keyboard has the same functionality as a standard computer keyboard, with some additional support for special keys. For more information on these keys, see <a href="hwreq_820j.htm">New Windows Keys</a>. </p>
<p>
Consumers expect the keyboard to be very durable, with a long battery life. The keyboard must be capable of use from the lap or a coffee table. It can possibly be integrated with a pointing device. If the keyboard is so integrated, radio frequency and infrared create one-way signals to the computer. Therefore, status lights cannot be controlled on the keyboard.</p>

<h4><a name="_bpc_keyboard_requirements"></a>Keyboard Requirements</h4>
<p>
The keyboard must:
<ul>
<li>
Be wireless</li>
<li>
Have a long battery life</li>
<li>
Support Windows keys</li>
<li>
Support television-related keys</li>
<li>
Optionally, have an integrated pointing device</li>
</ul>
