<p>
Broadcast Architecture components are not sold directly to the end user, with possible future exceptions being keyboards and pointing devices. Rather, OEMs and hardware vendors license the technology from a network provider, where applicable. OEMs also license <a href="glos_4xo9.htm#_bpc_microsoft_broadcast_data_network_gly"><i>Microsoft Broadcast Data Network</i></a> (MSBDN) designs and services from Microsoft. </p>
<p>
OEMs and hardware vendors are free to build, sell, install, and service their own products compatible with Broadcast Architecture. Because hardware designs and software components are available to numerous OEMs, competition is expected to drive the development of many feature enhancements, and to create distinct price points from which the end user can choose.</p>
