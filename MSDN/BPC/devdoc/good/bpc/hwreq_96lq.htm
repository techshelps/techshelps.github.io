<p>
The recommended hardware configuration for a broadcast client is:
<ul>
<li>
Intel Pentium 150 megahertz processor.</li>
<li>
PCI bus with at least four slots available.</li>
<li>
Computer case of the consumer electronics type, with low-noise fan or noiseless cooling system. A user should not perceive broadcast client noise from a distance of 6 feet in a quiet living-room environment.</li>
<li>
Support for Simply Interactive PC (SIPC) initiatives such as OnNow, Drive Bay, 1394, and Universal Serial Bus (USB) to provide a more consumer-friendly appearance for the client.</li>
<li>
16 megabytes (MB) RAM or more.</li>
<li>
Hard disk of 2 gigabytes (GB) or larger with a fast data transfer rate.</li>
<li>
3.5-inch 1.44 MB floppy drive.</li>
<li>
6x-speed CD-ROM drive or digital video disk (DVD).</li>
<li>
31-inch monitor capable of 800 x 600 resolution with a noninterlaced refresh rate of 60 hertz.</li>
<li>
Internal fax modem with a speed of 28,800 baud or higher that is compatible with the AT command set. Modem functionality can be incorporated on expansion cards for the broadcast client, so the modem does not need to be a separate peripheral.</li>
<li>
Wireless keyboard that responds to radio or infrared frequencies, that is battery-operated, and that has a built-in pointing device.</li>
<li>
Wireless, television-style remote control.</li>
<li>
Combination remote control and wireless mouse with power and sleep button, TV buttons (channel up and down, volume up and down, and mute. This remote control/mouse should be battery operated. </li>
<li>
Sound-system expansion card with: <ul>
<li>
Digital audio, specifically Pulse Code Modulated (PCM) digital input</li>
<li>
MIDI port</li>
<li>
MIDI-controlled wave-table synthesizer</li>
<li>
Multiple analog and digital audio inputs</li>
<li>
Audio mixer and preamplifier that is software-controllable and low-noise </li>
<li>
Multiple audio outputs </li>
</ul>
<p>
Sound-card functionality can be incorporated on motherboard or expansion cards for the broadcast client, so the sound card does not need to be a separate peripheral. 
</li>
<li>
Built-in microphone or a front-mounted microphone jack suitable for teleconferencing, education, karaoke, and other applications requiring sound input.</li>
<li>
Audio compression using the AC-3 algorithm for DVD compatibility. </li>
<li>
Infrared remote control capable of controlling consumer electronic devices.</li>
</ul>
