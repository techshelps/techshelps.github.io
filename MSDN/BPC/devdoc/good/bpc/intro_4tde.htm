Broadcast Architecture applies the versatility and power of computers in home or office to provide capabilities far beyond what televisions equipped with set-top boxes can achieve. Even before new programming becomes available, broadcast clients provide an appealing integration of excellent picture and sound quality with a state-of-the-art multimedia computer.</p>
<p>
The computer gives viewers a great deal of flexibility in planning television programming, and it displays <a href="glos_3ptl.htm#_bpc_program_guide_gly"><i>Program Guide</i></a> information very conveniently and clearly. Using a modem connection to the Internet, data services of all kinds are available today. </p>

<h4><a name="_bpc_state_of_the_art_computer_capabilities"></a>State-of-the-Art Computer Capabilities</h4>
<p>
To start with, you have all the power of a state-of-the-art computer, including multimedia and game playing. New power-saving instant response technology keeps the system available at all times. The Internet is fully accessible by modem, and some Internet content is already coordinated with television, as in the case of the MSNBC news network.</p>

<p>
In addition, broadcast clients offer an incremental, flexible, and affordable migration path to higher resolution television. Instead of buying a whole new, very expensive digital set every time broadcast technology shifts to a new standard, all users have to do is plug a new card into their computers.</p>

<h4><a name="_bpc_powerful_control_over_programming_choices"></a>Powerful Control over Programming Choices</h4>
<p>
Broadcast clients display program guide information of many different sorts in a single form. In this combined program guide, shows can easily be previewed, scheduled, and if appropriate paid for. </p>
<p>
Broadcast clients offer the convenience and ease of use of finding, selecting, and scheduling entertainment and information in one place, using one familiar interface. </p>
