<p>
This section describes the functionality of a remote control and the requirements it must meet to support Broadcast Architecture.</p>

<h4><a name="_bpc_functionality_for_the_pointing_device_remote_control"></a>Functionality for the Pointing Device/Remote Control</h4>
<p>
The integration of the pointing device and remote control are necessary so broadcast client users can navigate within computer applications, television programs, and television applications.</p>
<p>
Consumers expect the pointing device/remote control to be very durable, with a long battery life. The type of pointing device used can be a directional keypad, a touch pad, a trackball, or some other device with similar functionality. The device must be hand-held. It can resemble a standard television remote control, with the addition of special keys to handle tasks for television and computer applications. For more information on these keys, see <a href="hwreq_820j.htm">New Windows Keys</a>.</p>

<h4><a name="_bpc_requirements_for_the_pointing_device_remote_control"></a>Requirements for the Pointing Device/Remote Control</h4>
<p>
The pointing device/remote control must have the following features:
<ul>
<li>
Mouse compatibility.</li>
<li>
Long battery life.</li>
<li>
Numeric keys. Touch tone labeling of numeric keys, as used on telephones, is suggested.</li>
<li>
Television-related keys. </li>
<li>
Navigation keys.</li>
<li>
Compatibility with Simply Interactive PC (SIPC) remote-control guidelines, as described in <i>SIPC Remote Control Design Guide.</i></li>
