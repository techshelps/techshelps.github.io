The <b>BPCVBIControl</b> object provides methods that your application can use to tune the television tuner to a specific channel in order to receive data transmitted over the <a href="glos_1a49.htm#_bpc_vertical_blanking_interval_gly"><i>vertical blanking interval (VBI)</i></a>. <b>BPCVBIControl</b> does not receive or parse VBI data, it simply tunes to the specified channel</p>
<p>
The <b>BPCVBIControl</b> object has the following methods.</p>

<h4>Remarks</h4>
<p>
Because the tuner is a nonsharable device, only one instance of <b>BPCVBIControl</b> can exist at a time. If you attempt to create a second instance, the second create will fail. </p>
<p>
The <b>BPCVBIControl</b> object does not implement a resource conflict mechanism (Such as <b>BPCDevices </b>does with GotControl and LostControl events). Consequently, applications using this object must do so in a singular, or atomic, fashion, and ensure that no other applications are accessing <b>BPCVBIControl </b>simultaneously.</p>
<p>
Displaying video is a higher priority operation tuning to a VBI-data channel. In other words, if the user is watching video on channel A, your application cannot use <b>BPCVBIControl</b> to tune to channel B. VBI data can only be received either when the user is watching video on the channel transmitting the VBI data, or when the user is not watching television. </p>
<p>
When you release the <b>BPCVBIControl</b> object, the tuner receives VBI data using settings specified in the <b>VBITS</b> and <b>VBIChan</b> registry entries, if any. These entries are both type REG_DWORD. <b>VBITS </b>indicates the default VBI tuning space and <b>VBIChan </b>the default VBI channel. These entries are located in the HKLM\Software\Microsoft\TV Services registry key.</p>
<p>
If the <b>VBITS </b>and <b>VBIChan </b>registry entries exist, the television tuner will automatically tune to the specified VBI channel whenever the user is not watching television and no other applications are using video. If these entries do not exist, the tuner stops the graph and releases the devices when there are no video clients.</p>
<p>
<b>Note</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;The <a href="vidrf_92ec.htm"><b>BPCSuspend</b></a> object has higher priority than the <b>BPCVBIControl</b> and can preempt it. In other words, you can suspend the video server even if it is currently being used by the <b>BPCVBIControl</b>. </p>
