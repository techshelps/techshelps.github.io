<p>
<span style=color:#FF0000>[This is preliminary documentation and subject to change.]</span> </p>
<p>
A content server program forwards a file to be broadcast to the Microsoft® Multicast Router at times, and on IP addresses indicated in the content lookup database. </p>
<p>
The information used to determine what time and IP address to use might include:
<ul>
<li>
The data service and channel on which the stream of data from the file should be broadcast.</li>
<li>
Bandwidth assurance information: Should bandwidth be reserved, or can this stream be broadcast <a href="glos_44ft.htm#_bpc_opportunistic_bandwidth_gly"><i>opportunistically</i></a>? </li>
<li>
Bandwidth requirements: If bandwidth needs to be reserved, how much and for how long?</li>
<li>
The specific IP multicast address to be reserved, if one is necessary. </li>
<li>
The time or times this stream should be broadcast.</li>
<li>
The global announcement associated with this stream, if any, along with a specification of when, how many times, and at what intervals the announcement should be sent. </li>
<li>
The local announcement associated with this stream, if any, along with a specification of when, how many times, and at what intervals the announcement should be sent. </li>
<li>
Stream reuse information: Should this stream be saved for future broadcast or deleted after sending?</li>
</ul>
<p>
The content server application is responsible for such things as error checking, and error correction, encryption, key generation, and key encryption, when this is appropriate.</p>
<p>
The content service provider communicates with the Microsoft Multicast Router (MMR) through TCP/IP. Using TCP/IP lets the content server application run on any computer that has a TCP/IP network connection to the MMR computer. </p>
