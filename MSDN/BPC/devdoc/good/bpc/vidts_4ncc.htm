<p>
Before your application can present video and audio on a computer, you must first obtain the Microsoft® ActiveX® control for video (the Video control) and install an instance of the Video control on the application's user interface. </p>
<p>
The best way to install the Video control depends on how you develop your application. With the Microsoft® Visual Basic® development system, you obtain the Video control by selecting the <b>Microsoft BPC Video Server and Control</b> module. You locate this module by selecting the <b>Components</b> item from the <b>Project</b> menu of Visual Basic. In the <b>Components</b> dialog box that appears, you find this module in the <b>Controls</b> tab. Selecting this module causes the Video control to appear in the Visual Basic Toolbox as an icon that consists of blue letters that spell out VID. If you place the mouse pointer on this icon for one second or longer, the name of this control appears as <a href="vidrf_36zo.htm"><b>BPCVid</b></a>. After the Video control is in the toolbox, you can install, position, size, and name the instance of the Video control in your application the same way that you perform those operations for any other control.</p>
<p>
In applications written using MFC, you install the Video control by inserting <b>Vid Control</b> in your application. You locate the Video control by choosing the menu command <b>Project</b>, <b>Add To Project</b>, <b>Components and Controls</b> in the Microsoft® Visual C++® development system. In the Components and Controls Gallery dialog box that appears, you find the Video control in the Registered ActiveX Controls directory. When you insert the Video control in your application, you must generate the <b>CBPCVid</b>, <b>CBPCDevices</b>, and <b>CBPCDeviceBase </b>classes. You must also include the header files that define those classes in any source files that use them. Inserting the Video control causes it to appear in the Controls box as an icon that consists of blue letters that spell out VID. If you place the mouse pointer on this icon for one second or longer, the name of this control appears as Vid. After the Video control is in the controls box, you can install, position, size, and name the instance of the Video control in your application the same way that you perform those operations for any other control. </p>
<p>
To direct a Web browser to embed the Video control, initialize it, and position it in your Web page, you insert an OBJECT tag in your hypertext markup language (HTML) document and supply attribute values that specify the object type, location, initial data, and so on. The following is a description of the necessary attributes for the Video control:
<ul>
<li>
The CLASSID attribute is the Globally Unique Identifier (GUID) of the Video control. The Video control's GUID is 31263ec0-2957-11cf-a1e5-00aa9ec79700. This attribute enables the Web browser to obtain the Video control from the registry.</li>
<li>
The ID attribute is the name of the instance of the Video control.</li>
<li>
The WIDTH and HEIGHT attributes dictate the dimensions of the Video control.</li>
<li>
The ALIGN attribute dictates the position of the Video control in the page of the Web browser.</li>
</ul>
<p>
You can use Microsoft ActiveX Control Pad to create an HTML document and embed an instance of the Video control in that document by inserting <b>Vid Control</b>. </p>
