<p>
Broadcast Architecture defines a data format, the <a href="glos_2hyx.htm#_bpc_show_reference_gly"><i>show reference</i></a>, to describe a broadcast episode or episodes by using such information as the time and channel of the show and so on. A show reference is an ASCII string that contains multiple fields. Each field is separated from the next by an exclamation mark ( <b>!</b> ). </p>
<p>
The TSS object library provides methods that build a show reference from its constituent fields, that parse show references, and that build database queries from a show reference. These queries can then be run on the Guide database to return the collection of episodes to which the show reference refers.</p>
<p>
The show reference methods are as follows:
<ul>
<li>
<a href="tssr_24md.htm"><b>ITelevisionServices::MakeLocalBroadcastSchedule</b></a> </li>
<li>
<a href="tssr_3zvp.htm"><b>ITelevisionServices::MakeRemoteBroadcastSchedule</b></a> </li>
<li>
<a href="tssr_3f51.htm"><b>ITelevisionServices::SplitBroadcastSchedule</b></a> </li>
<li>
<a href="tssr_5ckl.htm"><b>ITelevisionServices::SplitSimpleBroadcastSchedule</b></a> </li>
<li>
<a href="tssr_8rlg.htm"><b>ITelevisionServices::ResolveBroadcast</b></a> </li>
<li>
<a href="tssr_2yyh.htm"><b>ITelevisionServices::ResolveBroadcastInclusively</b></a></li>
<li>
<a href="tssr_82yb.htm"><b>ITelevisionServices::ResolveScheduledReminders</b></a> </li>
<li>
<a href="tssr_3ycy.htm"><b>ITelevisionServices::TuningSpaceNameFromNumber</b></a></li>
<li>
<a href="tssr_8x7p.htm"><b>ITelevisionServices::TuningSpaceNumberFromName</b></a> </li>
</ul>
<p>
The <b>ITelevisionServices::MakeLocalBroadcastSchedule</b> method builds a show reference where a show's channel number, <a href="glos_9mic.htm#_bpc_tuning_space_gly"><i>tuning space</i></a>, and station are known. The <b>ITelevisionServices::MakeRemoteBroadcastSchedule</b> method also builds a show reference but substitutes wildcard values for the channel number, tuning space, and station. Your application can call <b>MakeLocalBroadcastSchedule</b> if you are certain that all users are located in your local broadcast area. Otherwise, your application should call <b>MakeRemoteBroadcastSchedule</b>. When WebTV for Windows uses a show reference created by <b>MakeRemoteBroadcastSchedule</b>,<b> </b>it queries the user's Guide database to fill in the wildcard values with local broadcasting information. </p>
<p>
Your application can access the information in a show reference, for example the episode title, by parsing the show reference. To parse show references, the TSS object library offers the <b>ITelevisionServices::SplitBroadcastSchedule</b> method, which splits a show reference into its constituent fields. <b>SplitBroadcastSchedule</b> returns a pointer to an <b>ITaskTrigger</b> interface that specifies time, date, and other task trigger properties, such as a schedule of how often a show task repeats. For example, a task initiating a show might run at 7 P.M. on the twenty-third day of every month starting 7/22/97. The <b>ITelevisionServices::SplitSimpleBroadcastSchedule</b> method performs the same service but returns time and date information as a Microsoft® Visual Basic® <b>DATE</b> variable instead of as an <b>ITaskTrigger</b> pointer. Although <b>SplitSimpleBroadcastSchedule</b> provides less information than <b>SplitBroadcastSchedule</b>, <b>SplitSimpleBroadcastSchedule</b> can be called by Visual Basic applications that cannot access <b>ITaskTrigger</b>. To locate more information about <b>ITaskTrigger</b>, see <a href="abou1_66t0.htm">Further Information on Television Services for the Client</a>.</p>
<p>
The <b>ITelevisionServices::ResolveBroadcast</b> method generates a query from a show reference. By running this query on the Guide database, you can retrieve the episode or the list of episodes that match a particular show reference. This functionality is useful in situations where a reference refers to several episodes, which occurs if some of the reference's fields are wildcard values. For example, a show reference that specifies the time and title, but not the date, of a show can refer to all the weekly or monthly episodes of that show.</p>
<p>
The <b>ITelevisionServices::ResolveBroadcastInclusively</b> method is identical in function to <b>ResolveBroadcast</b> except that it returns all episodes that match the show reference and that play during the specified time, instead of starting at the specified time.</p>
<p>
The <b>ITelevisionServices::ResolveScheduledReminders</b> method returns a Data Access Objects (DAO) <b>QueryDef</b> query that generates a list of the show reminders scheduled. To locate more information on DAO, see <a href="abou1_9asr.htm">Further General Information</a>.</p>
<p>
In addition, the TSS object library provides two methods, <b>ITelevisionServices::TuningSpaceNameFromNumber</b> and <b>ITelevisionServices::TuningSpaceNumberFromName</b>, which map the number of a tuning space in the Guide database to its human-readable name (for example cable, TV tuner, or satellite) and the reverse. Your application can use these methods to convert tuning space identifiers into device names to display a list of possible broadcast devices to the user. When the user has selected a device name, your application can call <b>TuningSpaceNumberFromName </b>to recover the tuning space in order to tune to a channel in that space or to reference the space in the Guide database.</p>
