<p>
The broadcast client consists of a number of functional subsystems. These subsystems provide the capabilities needed to receive and use audio, video, and other data from a <a href="glos_9egp.htm#_bpc_broadcast_server_gly"><i>broadcast server</i></a> on a client running the Microsoft® Windows® 98 operating system.</p>
<p>
The following illustration shows an overview of the Broadcast Architecture subsystems.</p>

<p>
Of the components in these subsystems, some are supplied with Broadcast Architecture, and others come from the Microsoft® Windows® 98 operating system or third party developers. In order to give a complete overview of the broadcast client, the following sections briefly describe all components regardless of their source. The subsystems covered are:
<ul>
<li>
<a href="barch_9bu5.htm">Broadcast Data Receiver Subsystem</a> describes the components that receive data and pass it on to the other subsystems.</li>
<li>
<a href="barch_33cd.htm">Data Services Subsystem</a> describes the components that process the computing data within the broadcast data stream, in other words, the data that does not present audio or video.</li>
<li>
<a href="barch_9wa5.htm">Broadcast Client Presentation Subsystem</a> describes the Microsoft® DirectShow™ filter graph used in a broadcast client and the components that present audio and video. </li>
<li>
<a href="barch_3oa5.htm">Television Client Services Subsystem</a> describes components for configuring and controlling television channels.</li>
<li>
<a href="barch_7b8t.htm">WebTV for Windows Subsystem</a> describes <a href="glos_4xo9.htm#_bpc_microsoft_webtv_for_windows_gly"><i>Microsoft WebTV for Windows</i></a> and its components.</li>
</ul>
