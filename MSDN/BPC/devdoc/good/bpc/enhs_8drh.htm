<p>
Authoring an enhancement stream often requires the user to make alterations to the stream. These corrections may be due to a changing format for the show, errors discovered during testing, or the need to stay within a budgeted bandwidth. </p>
<p>
Your authoring tool should provide a way for users to delete or change the properties of stream events.</p>
<p>
If you are using the stream compiler objects to build your authoring tool, you can edit an event by locating its corresponding <a href="rcen_0g6s.htm"><b>EnhEvent</b></a><b> </b>object in the <a href="rcen_8s4z.htm"><b>EnhEvents</b></a> collection and changing the values of its properties. To delete an event, call the <a href="rcen_6jxh.htm"><b>EnhEvent.Delete</b></a> method of the event the application is deleting.</p>
<p>
For more information on using the stream compiler objects to edit or delete events from the stream, see <a href="rcen_9zcd.htm">Locating an Event in the Enhancement Stream</a> and <a href="rcen_61bh.htm">Editing and Deleting Events in an Enhancement Stream</a>.</p>
