<p>
Your loader DLL should send broadcast window messages when loader events occur. These messages can be sent using either the <b>SendMessageTimeout</b> or <b>PostMessage</b> function, both part of the Microsoft® Win32® application programming interface (API). To locate more information about <b>SendMessageTimeout</b> and <b>PostMessage</b>, see <a href="abou1_71mc.htm">Further Information on Program Guide Services for the Client</a>. </p>
<p>
The following table lists and describes the possible broadcast messages and the events they indicate.</p>
