<h2><a name="_bpc_modem_requirements"></a>Modem Requirements</h2>
<p>
<span style=color:#FF0000>[This is preliminary documentation and subject to change.]</span> </p>
<p>
At a minimum, the modem must support the following:
<ul>
<li>
The Microsoft® Windows® 98 operating system, including Telephony Application Programming Interface (TAPI) and communications under the Microsoft® Win32® API. Most modems are compatible with Windows 98.<p>
A modem is a device used for data or fax transmission. In Windows 98, such a modem uses TAPI functions for call control and a combination of Win32 communications and Windows Sockets (WinSock) for data transactions. 
<p>
If Windows 98 does not support a modem, or the modem is not directly compatible with a supported model, the modem manufacturer must supply a driver for the modem. This driver must supply the Service Provider Interface (SPI) functions called by TAPI. However, from a practical standpoint, such drivers are rarely required. Most commercially available modems comply with Windows 98, because almost all comply closely with the international standards to use the UNIMODEM service provider included in Windows 98.
</li>
<li>
Dial-up to the billing center for the broadcast network. The modem must be able to communicate with the network billing center. </li>
<li>
Dial-up connection by the user to online services and Internet service providers, such as the Microsoft® MSN™ online service. Communications speed of 9600 baud or higher is strongly recommended.</li>
</ul>
<p>
The modem must also provide the following capabilities as minimum requirements.</p>

<h4><a name="_bpc_modem_operation_modes_gly"></a>Modem Operation Modes</h4>
<ul>
<li>
V.22 operation at 1200 baud</li>
<li>

<li>
V.32 operation at 9600 baud</li>
</ul>

<h4><a name="_bpc_modem_protocol_gly"></a>Modem Protocol</h4>

</ul>

<h4><a name="_bpc_connectors"></a>Connectors</h4>
<p>
The connection to the modem from the telephone line must be a standard RJ-11 jack.</p>
