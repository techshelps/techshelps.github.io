To enable users to again manually operate the remote control, your application should send a command to the remote control that puts the remote control in manual mode. Once the remote control is in manual mode, your application no longer requires a connection to the serial port connected to the remote control. To close the serial port connection, your application should call the <b>CloseHandle</b> function, part of the Microsoft® Win32® application programming interface (API), and pass the handle to the opened serial port. Your application should also reset the connection flag to indicate the connection to the serial port is closed and the remote control is in manual mode.</p>
