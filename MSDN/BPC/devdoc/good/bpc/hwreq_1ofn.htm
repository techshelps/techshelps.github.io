<p>
These optional features, although not required for modem operation, enhance the modem's value and customer satisfaction:
<ul>
<li>
VoiceView technical support. This feature permits a voice call to be suspended while modem data exchanges take place. Generally, the primary users of this feature are telephone support personnel who want to interrogate or alter a customer's computer during a support call. Microsoft® Technical Support provides hardware and software tools to enable this feature for support of products for the Microsoft® Windows® 95 and Windows 98 operating systems. </li>
<li>
Capability to send and receive faxes. If the modem has this feature, it should possess at least class 1 fax capability, and it should be able to originate and receive group 3 fax calls.</li>
<li>
Packaging within the computer. While an external modem fulfills the minimum requirements for Broadcast Architecture, use of an internally mounted modem with an ISA bus simplifies user installation.</li>
</ul>
