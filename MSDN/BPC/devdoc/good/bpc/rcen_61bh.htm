<p>
<span style=color:#FF0000>[This is preliminary documentation and subject to change.]</span> </p>
<p>
After your application has added events to the enhancement stream, it may need to modify or delete these events. To do this, you must first locate the event as described in <a href="rcen_9zcd.htm">Locating an Event in the Enhancement Stream</a>. </p>
<p>
Once you have located the event, you can edit the event by changing the values of its properties. The following example retrieves the last-added event in a stream and changes its <b>Timeout</b> property to 15 seconds. </p>
<pre><code>Set e = evs.LastAdd
e.Timeout = 15
 </code></pre>
<p>
For a complete list of the properties that you can edit, see <a href="rcen_0g6s.htm"><b>EnhEvent</b></a>.</p>
<p>
To delete an event from the enhancement stream, locate the event and then call its <a href="rcen_6jxh.htm"><b>EnhEvent.Delete</b></a> method. This is demonstrated in the following example.</p>
<pre><code>'TODO: locate event
'delete the event from the stream
e.Delete
 </code></pre>
<p>
You cannot access the event once it has been deleted. To verify the event was deleted, check that the <a href="rcen_3gc4.htm"><b>EnhEvents.Count</b></a> property is decremented. </p>
