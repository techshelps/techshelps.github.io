<p>
You can also use the Video control to send video streams to an output device. For example, your application can record a television broadcast by setting a tuner card as the input device and a VCR as the output device.</p>
<p>
<b>Note</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;Broadcast Architecture does not support functionality to enable infrared (IR) frequency transmission, such as might be used to emulate a remote control signal and control consumer electronics. Thus, although you can set a VCR or other output device to receive a video stream, the user still has to turn on the VCR and start recording manually. </p>
<p>
Setting an output device is similar to setting an input device, but instead of using the <a href="vidrf_1yd0.htm"><b>BPCVid.Input</b></a> property your application uses the <a href="vidrf_8d6c.htm"><b>BPCVid.Output</b></a> property. </p>
<p>
The following example searches the Devices collection for a device that supports output. When one is found, the example sets that device as the output device.</p>
<pre><code>For Each Device In vid.Devices
  If Device.IsOutput Then
    vid.Output = Device
    Exit For
  End If
Next
 </code></pre>
