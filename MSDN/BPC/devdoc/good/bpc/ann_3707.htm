<p>
The broadcast of any data stream must be preceded by an announcement of the impending broadcast, describing the sender, address, time, contents, and other pertinent details. By examining these announcements, the broadcast client can select which data streams to keep and which data streams to ignore.</p>
<p>
Announcement Listener and its supporting components are designed to provide interfaces for capturing and processing data introduced by specific announcements.</p>
<p>
Announcement Listener enables installation of custom-defined filters to select announcements. Filters can be enabled and disabled individually. Announcement Listener allows arbitrary data formats, both streaming and file-based.</p>
<p>
The following sections provide an overview of announcements:
<ul>
<li>
<a href="ann_4x6b.htm">Announcement Channels</a> </li>
<li>
<a href="ann_9a5w.htm">Announcement Format</a> </li>
