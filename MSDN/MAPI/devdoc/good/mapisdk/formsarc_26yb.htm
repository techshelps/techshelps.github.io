<h1><a name="_mapi1book_forms"></a>Forms</h1>
<p>
After reading this overview of the MAPI form architecture, you will have an understanding of what MAPI forms are and how they interact with other components of the MAPI subsystem. The purpose of this section is to give you the conceptual knowledge you need to implement your own MAPI form servers.</p>
<p>
Before reading this section, you should familiarize yourself with the material in the <a href="concepts_2wqb.htm">About MAPI Forms</a> topic.</p>
<p>
<b>Note</b>  Because the MAPI form architecture is based on the OLE component object model, developing form server applications requires knowledge of OLE programming. For more information on OLE, see the COM and ActiveX Object Services section in the Platform SDK.</p>
