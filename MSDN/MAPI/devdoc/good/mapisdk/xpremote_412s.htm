<h2><a name="_mapi1book_advertising_a_remote_transport"></a>Advertising a Remote Transport</h2>
<p>
Remote viewer applications need a way to identify which transport providers support remote functionality. In order to advertise this ability to remote viewers, remote transport providers must set the STATUS_REMOTE_ACCESS bit in the <a href="propb_2zj9.htm">PR_STATUS_CODE</a> property and the STATUS_VALIDATE_STATE bit set in the <a href="propb_3lkj.htm">PR_RESOURCE_METHODS</a> property of the transport provider's row in the status table. </p>
<p>
Remote transport providers must also include in the status row the <a href="propa_5ick.htm">PR_HEADER_FOLDER_ENTRYID</a> property. This property indicates the entry identifier of the folder that is used for downloading by remote viewer applications. This entry identifier is registered with MAPI when the transport provider is initialized. When the user opens the folder, the remote viewer application calls the <a href="inter023_146x.htm"><b>IMAPISession::OpenEntry</b></a> method passing in the folder's entry identifier. MAPI then forwards the call to the transport provider which registered the folder's entry identifier. The transport should return a view of the contents of the folder. This folder's contents table should contain the list of messages in the folder.</p>
