<h2><a name="_mapi1book_mapiaddress_vb_"></a>MAPIAddress (VB)</h2>
<p>
The Visual Basic <b>MAPIAddress</b> function enables users to create or modify a set of recipients. <b>MAPIAddress</b> generates an address-book dialog box that shows the contents of the recipient set and allows the user to select new entries or change existing entries. </p>

<h4>Parameters</h4>
<dl>
<dt>
<i>Session</i></dt>
<dd>
[in] Session handle that represents a Simple MAPI session or zero. If the value of the <i>Session</i> parameter is zero, MAPI logs on the user and creates a session that exists only for the duration of the call. This temporary session can be an existing shared session or a new one. If necessary, a logon dialog box is displayed. </dd>
<dt>
<i>UIParam</i></dt>
<dd>
[in] Parent window handle or zero, indicating that if a dialog box is displayed, it is application modal. If no dialog box is displayed during the call, the <i>UIParam</i> parameter is ignored.</dd>
<dt>
<i>Caption</i></dt>
<dd>
[in] Caption of the address-list dialog box. If this parameter is an empty string, the default value "Address Book" is used.</dd>
<dt>
<i>EditFields</i></dt>
<dd>
[in] The number of edit controls that should be present in the address list. The values 0 through 4are valid. If the value of the <i>nEditFields</i> parameter is 4, each recipient class supported by the underlying messaging system has an edit control. If the value of <i>EditFields</i> is zero, only address list browsing is possible. Values of 1, 2, or 3 control the number of edit controls present.
<p>
However, if the number of recipient classes in the <i>Recipients</i> parameter is greater than the value of <i>EditFields</i>, the number of classes in <i>Recipients</i> is used to indicate the number of edit controls instead of the value of <i>EditFields. </i>If the value of <i>EditFields</i> is 1 and more than one kind of entry exists in <i>Recipients</i>, then the <i>Labels</i> parameter is ignored.

<p>
Entries selected for the different controls are differentiated by the <b>ulRecipClass</b> member in the returned recipient structure. 
</dd>
<dt>
<i>Label</i></dt>
<dd>
[in] Edit control label in the address-list dialog box. The <i>Label</i> parameter is ignored and should be an empty string except when the value of the <i>EditFields</i> parameter is 1. If you want a default control label "To:", <i>Label</i> should be an empty string. </dd>
<dt>
<i>RecipCount</i></dt>
<dd>
[in] The number of entries in the <i>Recipients </i>parameter. If the value of the <i>RecipCount</i> parameter is zero, <i>Recipients</i> is ignored.</dd>
<dt>
<i>Recipients</i></dt>
<dd>
[in] The initial array of recipient entries to be used to populate edit controls in the address-list dialog box. Recipient entries need not be grouped by recipient class. If the value of the greatest recipient class present is greater than the value of the <i>EditFields</i> parameter, the <i>EditFields</i> and <i>Label</i> parameters are ignored. This array is redimensioned as necessary to accommodate the entries made by the user in the address-list dialog box.</dd>
<dt>
<i>Flags</i></dt>
<dd>
[in] Bitmask of flags. The following flags can be set:
<dl>
<dt>
MAPI_LOGON_UI</dt>
<dd>
A dialog box should be displayed to prompt the user to log on if required. When the MAPI_LOGON_UI flag is not set, the client application does not display a logon dialog box and returns an error value if the user is not logged on. </dd>
<dt>
MAPI_NEW_SESSION</dt>
<dd>
An attempt should be made to create a new session rather than acquire the environment's shared session. If the MAPI_NEW_SESSION flag is not set, <b>MAPIAddress</b> uses an existing shared session.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dt>
<i>Reserved</i></dt>
<dd>
Reserved; must be zero.
</dd>
</dl>
<h4>Return Values</h4>
<dl>
<dt>
MAPI_E_FAILURE</dt>
<dd>
One or more unspecified errors occurred while building recipient lists or browsing the address book. No list of recipients was returned.</dd>
<dt>
MAPI_E_INSUFFICIENT_MEMORY</dt>
<dd>
There was insufficient memory to proceed. No list of recipients was returned.</dd>
<dt>
MAPI_E_INVALID_EDITFIELDS</dt>
<dd>
The value of the <i>nEditFields</i> parameter was outside the range of 0 through 4. No list of recipients was returned.</dd>
<dt>
MAPI_E_INVALID_RECIPS</dt>
<dd>
One or more of the recipients in the address list was not valid or the <i>Recipients</i> parameter was not a valid array. No list of recipients was returned.</dd>
<dt>
MAPI_E_INVALID_SESSION</dt>
<dd>
An invalid session handle was used for the <i>lhSession</i> parameter. No list of recipients was returned.</dd>
<dt>
MAPI_E_LOGIN_FAILURE</dt>
<dd>
There was no default logon, and the user failed to log on successfully when the logon dialog box was displayed. No list of recipients was returned.</dd>
<dt>
MAPI_E_NOT_SUPPORTED</dt>
<dd>
The operation was not supported by the underlying messaging system. A list of recipients might have been returned.</dd>
<dt>
MAPI_E_USER_ABORT</dt>
<dd>
The user canceled one of the dialog boxes. No list of recipients was returned.</dd>
<dt>
SUCCESS_SUCCESS</dt>
<dd>
The call succeeded and a list of address entries was returned.
</dd>
</dl>
<h4>Remarks</h4>
<p>
The <b>MAPIAddress</b> function makes it possible for users to create or modify a set of address-list entries using a standard address-list dialog box. The dialog box cannot be suppressed, but function parameters allow the caller to set characteristics of the dialog box.</p>
<p>
The call is made with an initial, and possibly empty, set of recipients. The address-list dialog box shows the contents of the recipient set; users can choose new entries to add to the set. The final set of recipients is returned to the caller in the <i>RecipCount</i> and <i>Recipients </i>parameters, destroying their initial values. </p>
<p>
The declaration of this function for the 32-bit Visual Basic runtime is:</p>
<p>
