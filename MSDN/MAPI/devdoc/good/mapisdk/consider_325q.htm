<h2><a name="_mapi1book_timing_a_notification"></a>Timing a Notification</h2>
<p>
Because event notification is an asynchronous process, you can be notified at any time, not necessarily immediately after the event has occurred. The timing of calls to your <a href="inter010_4y2h.htm"><b>IMAPIAdviseSink::OnNotify</b></a><b> </b>method varies depending on the service provider implementing the advise source. Service providers can notify your client either:
<ul>
<li>
Simultaneously with the event.</li>
<li>
Directly after the event.</li>
<li>
At some later point following the event, possibly after an <b>Unadvise</b> call.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Most service providers call <b>OnNotify</b> after the MAPI method responsible for the event has returned to its caller. For example, notifications on messages are sent either when changes to the message are saved, after the <b>IMAPIProp::SaveChanges</b> call, or when the message is released, after the <b>IUnknown::Release</b> call. Until the notification is sent, no changes are visible in the message store. </p>
<p>
You can receive notifications from an advise source after you have called <b>Unadvise</b> to cancel a registration. Be sure to release your advise sink only after its reference count has fallen to zero, not following a successful <b>Unadvise</b> call. Do not assume that because you have called <b>Unadvise</b> that the advise sink is no longer necessary. </p>
