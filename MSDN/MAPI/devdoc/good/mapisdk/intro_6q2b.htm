<h2><a name="_mapi1book_environment_issues_affecting_client_applications"></a>Environment Issues Affecting Client Applications</h2>
<p>
MAPI-compliant client applications can run in multiple environments, depending on the environment used for development. A client written in a 16-bit development environment can operate either in a native 16-bit Windows environment or in any 32-bit environment under 16-bit compatibility mode. Compatibility mode allows a 16-bit application to simulate a 32-bit application. A client written in a 32-bit development environment can run on any 32-bit operating system, such as Windows NT or Windows 95.</p>
<p>
The environment into which a client installs the MAPI SDK affects the scope of usable <a href="glossary_4s37.htm#_mapi1book_gly_service_provider">service providers</a>. If the MAPI SDK is installed in a generic 32-bit environment or in the 16-bit compatibility mode environment, a client can use two types of service providers: 
<ul>
<li>
Service providers written for 32-bit operating environments</li>
<li>
Single-source service providers</li>
</ul>
<p>
Single-source service providers are built with a single set of source files. This set of source files can be used to build binaries that will run in any environment. </p>
<p>
If the MAPI SDK is installed in a 16-bit environment, a client can use only a 16-bit service provider.</p>
