<h4>Remarks </h4>
<p>
It is recommended that attachment subobjects expose the PR_ATTACH_PATHNAME property. Setting PR_ATTACH_PATHNAME indicates that the attachment data is not included with the message but is available on a common file server. PR_ATTACH_PATHNAME is required in conjunction with any of the <a href="propa_7o6c.htm">PR_ATTACH_METHOD</a> flags that indicate attachment by reference: ATTACH_BY_REFERENCE, ATTACH_BY_REF_RESOLVE, or ATTACH_BY_REF_ONLY. </p>
<p>
Each directory or filename is restricted to an eight-character name plus a three-character extension. The overall path is restricted to 256 characters. For a platform that supports long filenames, set both the PR_ATTACH_PATHNAME and <a href="propa_23dx.htm">PR_ATTACH_LONG_PATHNAME</a> properties. </p>
<p>
Client applications should use a universal naming convention (UNC) in most cases when the file is shared, and should use an absolute path when the file is local and in some shared cases, such as with NetWare. </p>
<p>
MAPI works only with paths, filenames, and other strings passed to it in the ANSI character set. Clients that use paths and filenames in an OEM character set must convert them to ANSI before calling MAPI. </p>
