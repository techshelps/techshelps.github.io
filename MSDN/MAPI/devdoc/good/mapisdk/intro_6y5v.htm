<h2><a name="_mapi1book_mapi_installation_defaults"></a>MAPI Installation Defaults</h2>
<p>
MAPI supplies a default profile provider implementation and a set of <a href="glossary_4s2r.htm#_mapi1book_gly_common_dialog_box">common dialog boxes</a>. Typically, <a href="glossary_4s37.htm#_mapi1book_gly_service_provider">service providers</a> will use what MAPI provides. However, it is possible to replace either the profile provider implementation or the set of common dialog boxes. A provider can specify versions of these components in the <b>[MAPI]</b> section of the WIN.INI file or the system registry. Service providers that use the default components need not include this section.</p>
<p>
The following entries can be included in the <b>[MAPI]</b> section:</p>
<pre><code>Profile DLL=<i>full path to file</i>
Dialogs=<i>full path to file</i>
ProfileDirectory16=<i>full path to file</i>
 </code></pre>
<p>
The Profile DLL entry specifies the name of the DLL for the MAPI profile provider. The default setting is MAPI.DLL for 16-bit platforms and MAPI32.DLL for 32-bit platforms. The filename included in the path should be the profile provider's base DLL name, that is the DLL name without the suffix. </p>
<p>
The Dialogs entry specifies the name of the DLL that contains the implementation for the common dialog boxes. The default setting is WMSUI.DLL for 16-bit platforms and WMSUI32.DLL for 32-bit platforms. </p>
<p>
The ProfileDirectory16 entry specifies the path to the directory where the profile files are kept. This entry is supported for 16-bit Windows environments only. The default location is a subdirectory named MAPI under the Windows directory. The ProfileDirectory16 entry can be set either by the user or automatically — for example, by a network logon script. Specifying an explicit path for profile files allows you as a service provider to store these files on a server computer rather than locally, allowing them to be accessed from anywhere in the network. </p>
