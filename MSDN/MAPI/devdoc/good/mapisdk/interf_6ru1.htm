<h1><a name="_mapi1book_objects_implemented_by_mapi"></a>Objects Implemented by MAPI</h1>
<p>
MAPI implements several objects for use by client applications and service providers. The session object allows clients to use session services, to access tables, and to communicate with service providers. The address book object provides clients with integrated access to all of the different address book providers. </p>
<p>
Multiple table and status objects are supplied by MAPI for clients to use for viewing and monitoring session and service provider information. For example, MAPI provides a profile table with information about all of the profiles that are installed on the computer and a message service table with information about all of the message services in the current profile. MAPI provides three different status objects: one that represents the overall subsystem, one for the MAPI spooler, and one for the integrated address book.  </p>
<p>
MAPI implements four different objects for managing the configuration of message services, service providers, and profiles. Both clients and service providers use provider administration and profile section objects; these objects enable them to configure service providers and access profile properties. Clients only use message service and profile administration objects, the objects that support the administration of message services and profiles. </p>
<p>
MAPI provides two objects for service providers: a support object and a Tnef object. All service providers use one or more support objects; there are four different support object implementations. MAPI supplies an implementation to support configuration as well as specific implementations to support address book, message store, and transport providers. The Tnef object is used by transport providers that support the Transport Neutral Encapsulation Format (TNEF).</p>
<p>
Two utility objects, table data and property data, are typically used by service providers. Table data objects help in the implementation of table objects; property data objects help to set and view property access and help in the implementation of <a href="inter022_00tq.htm"><b>IMAPIProp : IUnknown</b></a>, the base property interface. </p>
<p>
The following table summarizes the purpose for each object implemented by MAPI.</p>
