<h2><a name="_mapi1book_implementing_security_with_transport_providers"></a>Implementing Security with Transport Providers</h2>
<p>
If the messaging system requires it, the transport provider is responsible for implementing an appropriate level of security for access to the messaging system. Each incoming or outgoing message sent through a transport provider by the MAPI spooler is handled in the context of a provider logon session. The transport provider can display a logon dialog box to the user that prompts for a user's credentials before establishing such a connection. Alternatively, the transport provider can store the user's previously entered credentials in the secure property range within a profile section and use them for access without prompting.</p>
<p>
When implementing your transport provider's security, consider the following:
<ul>
<li>
With multiple installed service providers, there can be a multitude of names and passwords associated with a user.</li>
<li>
MAPI allows multiple sessions with multiple identities. Providers are encouraged to support multiple sessions but are not required to do so.</li>
<li>
Each session with a transport provider is associated by MAPI with a discrete section in the user's profile. The transport provider can use the <a href="inter025_6rvy.htm"><b>IMAPISupport::OpenProfileSection</b></a> method to gain access to this section, which can be used to store any information associated with this session, including credentials.</li>
<li>
With multiple installed transport providers, it is not necessarily true that the user only has a single e-mail address. A user can have a separate e-mail address for each installed transport provider, or a different address for each session on a single provider.</li>
</ul>
<p>
For more information on storing credentials in profile sections, see <a href="intro_6vqr.htm">Message Services and Profiles</a>, and the <a href="inter036_11v4.htm"><b>IProfSect : IMAPIProp</b></a> interface.</p>
