<h2><a name="_mapi1book_pr_send_rich_info"></a>PR_SEND_RICH_INFO</h2>
<p>
The PR_SEND_RICH_INFO property contains TRUE if the recipient can receive all message content, including Rich Text Format and OLE objects. </p>

<h4>Remarks </h4>
<p>
It is recommended that distribution list and messaging user objects expose the PR_SEND_RICH_INFO property. </p>
<p>
PR_SEND_RICH_INFO indicates whether the sender considers the recipient to be MAPI-enabled. </p>
<p>
When this property is set to TRUE, the transport and gateway can transmit the full content of the message, including Rich Text Format and OLE objects. The transport provider and gateway should use TNEF to encapsulate any properties that are not native to all the messaging systems involved. </p>
<p>
When this property is set to FALSE, the transport provider and gateway are free to discard message content that their native clients cannot use. For example, when the clients do not support Rich Text Format, the transport provider can send only plain text. </p>
<p>
When PR_SEND_RICH_INFO is not set, default behavior is determined by the implementation of the transport provider, MTA, or gateway. Address book providers are not required to support this property. For example, a tightly coupled address book and transport provider can choose to send TNEF but never use Rich Text Format. </p>
<p>
The client should not assume the transport provider and gateway will use TNEF on their own initiative. Some transport providers and gateways that support TNEF transmit it without regard to the value of PR_SEND_RICH_INFO, but others decline to construct or send TNEF if PR_SEND_RICH_INFO is not set to TRUE. </p>
<p>
<b>Note</b>  The setting of this property, and the decisions based on its value, are on a per-recipient basis. </p>
<p>
By default, MAPI sets the value of PR_SEND_RICH_INFO to TRUE. A client calling <a href="inter006_92zq.htm"><b>IAddrBook::CreateOneOff</b></a> or a provider calling <a href="inter025_37mu.htm"><b>IMAPISupport::CreateOneOff</b></a> can set the MAPI_SEND_NO_RICH_INFO bit in the <i>ulFlags</i> parameter, which causes MAPI to set PR_SEND_RICH_INFO to FALSE. One-offs created by the user interface use the value specified by the creating template. </p>
<p>
On calls to the <a href="inter006_64v9.htm"><b>IAddrBook::ResolveName</b></a> method when the name cannot be resolved but can be interpreted as an Internet address (SMTP), PR_SEND_RICH_INFO is set to FALSE. To be construed as an Internet address, the display name of the unresolved entry must be in the format <i>X@Y.Z</i>, such as "pete@pinecone.com". </p>
