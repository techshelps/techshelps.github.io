<p>
Some client applications benefit from having a transport provider with remote capabilities, including:
<ul>
<li>
Clients whose underlying messaging systems are slow.</li>
<li>
Clients with low bandwidth connections to their messaging servers.</li>
<li>
Clients with intermittant connections to messaging systems or networks.</li>
<li>
Clients that must, for whatever reasons, minimize the time spent connected to their message servers.</li>
</ul>
<p>
The most common situation where remote transport providers are used is when a client's connection to the messaging server is over a modem (low bandwidth) or is connected through a long-distance telephone call.</p>
<p>
MAPI provides a definition of a remote interface that transport providers implement in order to satisfy clients' needs in these circumstances. That interface is the <b>IMAPIFolder</b> interface, which enables a user to preview the contents of the messaging server without downloading entire messages or folders. This is the same interface that message store providers implement. By having a transport provider implement a special MAPI folder, it can provide access to messaging systems with special connection requirements. </p>
<p>
The topics in this section describe the remote transport architecture and provide information for implementing a remote transport provider.</p>
