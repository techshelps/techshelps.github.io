<h2><a name="_mapi1book_handling_named_property_errors"></a>Handling Named Property Errors</h2>
<p>
When a request is made to <a href="inter022_49f7.htm"><b>IMAPIProp::GetIDsFromNames</b></a> or <a href="inter022_7ib7.htm"><b>IMAPIProp::GetNamesFromIDs</b></a> that is too large for the implementer to handle, the error value MAPI_E_TOO_BIG is returned. Callers must divide their request into several requests, calling the appropriate method in a loop. </p>
<p>
When a call results in partial success, such as when the request is for names that map to specific identifiers and one or more names cannot be found, <b>GetNamesFromIDs</b> returns MAPI_W_ERRORS_RETURNED and places PT_ERROR in the property type for the missing property in the property tag array. </p>
<p>
Sometimes a client makes a call to <b>GetNamesFromIDs</b> that results in no properties being returned, such as when there are no properties in a specified property set or when all named properties are of a type excluded by the flags. Clients can expect service providers to:
<ul>
<li>
Return S_OK.</li>
<li>
Set the contents of the property tag array pointer to a newly allocated property tag array with its <b>cValues</b> member set to zero.</li>
<li>
Set the contents of the <a href="structyp_1iqs.htm"><b>MAPINAMEID</b></a> structure array to NULL.</li>
<li>
Set the contents of the count of <b>MAPINAMEID</b> structures to zero.</li>
</ul>
