<p>
The entries in this section control debugging features in the MAPI spooler.
<dl>
<dt>
<b>AlwaysRebuild</b> = <i>0|1</i></dt>
<dd>
If this entry is set to 1, the MAPI spooler rebuilds its merged outgoing queue on every outgoing queue notification. If it is 0, the queue is only rebuilt when opening a message store for the first time. The default value is 0 — rebuild the outgoing queue rarely.</dd>
<dt>
<b>AssertSessionLeaks</b> = <i>0|1</i></dt>
<dd>
If this entry is set to 1, the MAPI spooler asserts if it finds a reference count of greater than 1 when freeing memory for one of its <b>IMAPISession</b> objects. The default value is 0 — no assert for leaked spooler-side sessions.</dd>
<dt>
<b>LowPrioritySpooling</b> = <i>0|1</i></dt>
<dd>
If this entry is set to 1, the MAPI spooler gives its main thread below-normal base priority by calling the Win32 function <b>SetThreadPriority</b> and setting the THREAD_PRIORITY_BELOW_NORMAL value. If it is 0, the MAPI spooler runs at normal priority. The MAPI spooler continues to adjust its priority when flushing and performing other foreground operations regardless of this entry's value. The default value is 1 — the MAPI spooler runs at below-normal priority.</dd>
<dt>
<b>NonPersistanceTimeout</b> = <i>seconds</i></dt>
<dd>
This entry controls the length of time the MAPI spooler waits before exiting. The MAPI spooler exits after the last client session has logged off, but not immediately. The default value is 20 seconds.</dd>
<dt>
<b>SafeMode</b> = <i>0|1</i></dt>
<dd>
If this entry is set to 1, then during its startup the MAPI spooler aborts submission on all messages in the outgoing queue and restarts the submission process from scratch. Submission is not aborted during subsequent rebuilds of the outgoing queue. If it is 0, the submission state is left intact. The default value is 0 — do not abort submission when the outgoing queue changes.</dd>
<dt>
<b>TraceHeartbeat</b> = <i>0|1</i></dt>
<dd>
If this entry or <b>TraceEverything</b> is set to 1, the MAPI spooler generates debug trace output during its normal idle time processing. The default value is 0 — no traces are generated for normal idle processing.</dd>
<dt>
<b>TraceHooks</b> = <i>0|1</i></dt>
<dd>
If this entry or <b>TraceEverything</b> is set to 1, the MAPI spooler generates debug trace output for normal operations involving MAPI spooler hook providers. The default value is 0 — no trace output is generated for normal hook operation.</dd>
<dt>
<b>TraceUploads</b> = <i>0|1</i></dt>
<dd>
If this entry or <b>TraceEverything</b> is set to 1, the MAPI spooler generates debug trace output for normal message transmission steps through message transports. The default value is 0 — no trace output is generated for normal message transmission.  </dd>
<dt>
<b>TraceDownloads</b> = <i>0|1</i></dt>
<dd>
If this entry or <b>TraceEverything</b> is set to 1, the MAPI spooler generates debug trace output for normal message download steps from transport providers. The default value is 0 — no trace output is generated for normal downloading of messages.</dd>
<dt>
<b>TraceOutgoingQueues</b> = <i>0|1</i></dt>
<dd>
If this entry or <b>TraceEverything</b> is set to 1, the MAPI spooler generates debug trace output for normal notifications and other operations on the merged outgoing queue. The MAPI spooler maintains a merged outgoing queue that combines messages from outgoing queues of all open message stores that support message submission. The default value is 0 — no trace output is generated for normal outgoing queue processing.</dd>
<dt>
<b>TracePreprocessors</b> = <i>0|1</i></dt>
<dd>
If this entry or <b>TraceEverything</b> is set to 1, the MAPI spooler generates debug trace output when calling preprocessors. The default value is 0 — no trace output is generated for normal preprocessing operations.</dd>
<dt>
<b>TraceService</b> = <i>0|1</i></dt>
<dd>
If this entry or <b>TraceEverything</b> is set to 1, the MAPI spooler generates debug trace output when queuing, dequeueing, and processing service requests on behalf of MAPI and transport providers. The default value is 0 — no trace output is generated for normal service queue processing.</dd>
<dt>
<b>TraceVerbose</b> = <i>0|1</i></dt>
<dd>
If this entry or <b>TraceEverything</b> is set to 1, the MAPI spooler generates debug trace output in all categories for events that would otherwise be considered too frequent or insignificant to warrant trace output. The default value is 0 — the MAPI spooler does not generate trace output.</dd>
<dt>
<b>TraceYields</b> = <i>0|1</i></dt>
<dd>
If this entry or <b>TraceEverything</b> is set to 1, the MAPI spooler generates debug trace output when explicitly yielding the CPU to other processes, either on its own behalf or on behalf of a transport provider. The default value is 0 — no trace output is generated when yielding.</dd>
<dt>
<b>TraceEverything</b> = <i>0|1</i></dt>
<dd>
If this entry is set to 1, all the trace output requested by <b>TraceHeartbeat</b>, <b>TraceHooks</b>, <b>TraceUploads</b>, <b>TraceDownloads</b>, <b>TraceOutgoingQueues</b>, <b>TracePreprocessors</b>, <b>TraceService</b>, <b>TraceVerbose</b>, and <b>TraceYields</b> is generated, and the values of those entries are ignored. You cannot selectively turn off trace categories when <b>TraceEverything</b> is 1. The default value is 0 — entries for the individual categories control trace output.
