<h2><a name="_mapi1book_creating_a_recipient"></a>Creating a Recipient</h2>
<p>
Clients create recipients when they are addressing messages and when they are adding entries to modifiable address book containers. MAPI provides three methods for creating recipients:</p>
<p class=indent1>
<a href="inter006_92zq.htm"><b>IAddrBook::CreateOneOff</b></a></p>
<p class=indent1>
<a href="inter006_7b7d.htm"><b>IAddrBook::NewEntry</b></a></p>
<p class=indent1>
<a href="inter003_8b21.htm"><b>IABContainer::CreateEntry</b></a></p>
<p>
Call <b>IAddrBook::CreateOneOff</b> when you are creating recipients to be used to address messages. <b>CreateOneOff</b> creates a specially formatted one-off entry identifier to be associated with an address of a particular address type. For more information about one-offs and one-off entry identifiers, see <a href="extend_6j03.htm">One-Off Addresses</a> and <a href="extend_9ks3.htm">One-Off Entry Identifiers</a>.</p>
<p>
Call <a href="inter006_7b7d.htm"><b>IAddrBook::NewEntry</b></a> when you are creating recipients to be used either to address messages or to add to a container. <b>NewEntry</b> has three pairs of parameters that contain entry identifiers. These parameters are described as follows:</p>
<table cellspacing=4 cols=2>
<tr valign=top>
<th align=left width=37%>Parameter pair</th>
<th align=left width=63%>Description</th>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=37%><i>cbEidContainer</i> and <i>lpEidContainer</i> </td>
<td width=63%>Entry identifier for the container into which the new entry should be placed.</td>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=37%><i>cbEidNewEntryTpl</i> and <i>lpEidNewEntryTpl</i> </td>
<td width=63%>Entry identifier for the template to be used to create the new entry.</td>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=37%><i>lpcbEidNewEntry</i> and <i>lppEidNewEntry</i> </td>
<td width=63%>Entry identifier for the new entry. </td>
</tr>
</table><br>
<p>
To create a recipient for an outgoing message, set <i>cbEidContainer</i> to zero and <i>lpEidContainer</i> to NULL. <b>NewEntry</b> creates a recipient with an entry identifier that conforms to the one-off format, the same type of recipient that is produced by a call to <a href="inter006_92zq.htm"><b>IAddrBook::CreateOneOff</b></a>. </p>
<p>
To create a recipient to be inserted into a particular container, set <i>lpEidContainer</i> to the container's entry identifier and <i>cbEidContainer</i> to the number of bytes in the container's entry identifier.</p>
<p>
To use a template to create a recipient, set <i>lpEidNewEntryTpl</i> to the entry identifier of the template to be used and <i>cbEidNewEntryTpl</i> to the count of bytes in this entry identifier. Most modifiable address book containers support one or more templates for creating entries of a particular type. One-off templates are typically, but not always, dialog boxes. Entering information into the template produces a recipient with an address that is correctly formatted for the type.</p>
<p>
Obtain the template entry identifier from either:
<ul>
<li>
The <a href="propa_8cv8.htm">PR_ENTRYID</a> column in the container's one-off table, accessed by calling the container's <a href="inter022_15vd.htm"><b>IMAPIProp::OpenProperty</b></a> method and specifying <a href="propa_6h83.htm">PR_CREATE_TEMPLATES</a> as the property tag and IID_IMAPITable as the interface identifier. </li>
<li>
An address book provider's <a href="propa_433m.htm">PR_DEF_CREATE_MAILUSER</a> and <a href="propa_4hkc.htm">PR_DEF_CREATE_DL</a> properties which hold the entry identifiers for the provider's messaging user object and distribution list templates. </li>
</ul>
<p>
<b>Note</b>  Do not confuse a new entry template's entry identifier with a different type of entry identifier called a template identifier. A template identifier is used only by providers to maintain entries copied from other providers; it is never used by clients and it is not used to create new entries.</p>
<p>
To allow the user to determine the type of entry to be created, pass zero for <i>cbEidNewEntryTpl</i> and NULL for <i>lpEidNewEntryTpl</i>. When this occurs, <b>NewEntry</b> displays a common dialog box built from MAPI's one-off table — a hierarchical list of all of the templates supported by each address book provider in the profile. </p>
<p>
When an address type has been determined, either through the setting of the <i>lpEidNewEntryTpl</i> parameter or a selection by the user from the one-off table display, <b>NewEntry</b> displays the corresponding template using its display table. All new entry templates support the <a href="propa_692d.htm">PR_DETAILS_TABLE</a> property. </p>
<p>
To have <b>NewEntry</b> return the entry identifier of the created entry, pass a valid address for the <i>lpcbEidNewEntry</i> and <i>lppEidNewEntry</i> parameters. MAPI places the new entry identifier at the address pointed to by <i>lppEidNewEntry</i> and the byte count of the new entry identifier at the address pointed to by <i>lpcbEidNewEntry</i>.</p>
<p>
Call <a href="inter003_8b21.htm"><b>IABContainer::CreateEntry</b></a> to create a recipient and save it into a particular address book container. You can use this method only with modifiable containers — containers that have the AB_MODIFIABLE flag set in their <a href="propa_3m7n.htm">PR_CONTAINER_FLAGS</a> property. Address book providers with nonmodifiable containers do not support this method. Specify the entry identifier of the template for creating an entry of the desired type in the <i>lpEntryID</i> parameter. </p>
<p>
In the <i>ulCreateFlags</i> parameter, specify the type of duplicate entry checking required and whether or not new entries should replace existing ones. If <b>CreateEntry</b> fails to create a new object because of the duplicate entry checking imposed by the provider, do not expect to see an error or warning returned. Under these conditions, providers return a success code.</p>
<p>
If you are working directly with a container and you know exactly the types of addresses that the container can create, you can call <b>IABContainer::CreateEntry</b> and pass the entry identifier for the appropriate template. The address book provider sets some initial default properties; you can call <b>SetProps</b> to set others. The user is never involved. </p>
