<h2><a name="_mapi1book_registering_a_preprocessor"></a>Registering a Preprocessor</h2>
<p>
All preprocessors must be registered by transport providers. The transport provider for a preprocessor registers it along with its other logon processing at the time that the MAPI spooler logs on to the transport provider. To register a preprocessor, the transport provider calls its support object's <a href="inter025_53qq.htm"><b>IMAPISupport::RegisterPreprocessor</b></a> function. It passes in the name of the DLL in which the preprocessor is implemented and the names of the functions in that DLL that implement the preprocessor.</p>
<p>
The transport provider can also control what specific addresses or address types the preprocessor applies to. The preprocessor can apply to specific addresses by giving a specific <a href="structyp_3p9g.htm"><b>MAPIUID</b></a> structure to the <b>RegisterPreprocessor</b> method. The preprocessor can apply to specific address types by giving the string representation of the address type, for example SMTP. A preprocessor can apply to all address types by giving a null or empty string as the address type. The <b>RegisterPreprocessor</b> method must be called once for each <b>MAPIUID</b> or address type.</p>
