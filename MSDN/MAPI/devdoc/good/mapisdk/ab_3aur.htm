<p>
Your container's <a href="inter003_3uib.htm"><b>IABContainer::DeleteEntries</b></a> method is called to remove one or more recipients. <b>DeleteEntries</b> has two parameters: an array of entry identifiers representing the recipients to be deleted and a reserved flags value. Deleting a recipient affects the contents table of your container; in addition to deleting the recipient, your container must delete the contents table row that represents the recipient. When the row has been removed from the table, your container must issue a table notification to each registered client. </p>
<h5><img src="../../images/wedge.gif" border=0>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To implement IABContainer::DeleteEntries </h5>
<ol>
<li>
Delete each recipient represented by the entry identifier from your container.</li>
<li>
If your container's contents table is open:<ul>
<li>
Send an <i>fnevTableModified</i> notification with the <b>ulTableEvent</b> member set to TABLE_ROW_DELETED to registered clients for each deleted contents table row. If your provider uses the notification utility, call <a href="inter025_8fax.htm"><b>IMAPISupport::Notify</b></a> to send these notifications.</li>
<li>
If your provider supports object notifications, also send an <i>fnevObjectDeleted</i> notification.</li>
</ul>
<p>

</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p></body>
