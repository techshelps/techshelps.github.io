<h1><a name="_mapi1book_finding_information_about_objects"></a>Finding Information About Objects</h1>
<p>
Information about objects is documented in various sections. Because nearly all MAPI objects expose a single MAPI interface, the approach is to treat objects and the interfaces that they expose as synonymous. </p>
<p>
You can find information about objects and interfaces in the following sections:
<ul>
<li>
<a href="inter003_2h83.htm">MAPI Interfaces</a> in the Reference. For example, locate information about implementing and using a folder under its standard interface, <b>IMAPIFolder</b>. </li>
<li>
<a href="interf_8ecz.htm">Objects and Interfaces</a> in the Guide. This section introduces the Component Object Model as it relates to MAPI, describes MAPI's object hierarchy and containment model, maps objects to interfaces, and describes implementation responsibilities.</li>
<li>
<a href="property_1ik3.htm">Properties</a> in the Guide. This section describes how objects manage properties and how clients work with them. </li>
<li>
<a href="tables_28fn.htm">Tables</a> in the Guide. This section describes in detail how to implement and use a table object and discusses the composition and purpose of the different types of tables.</li>
<li>
<a href="formsarc_26yb.htm">Forms</a> in the Guide. This section describes the various objects used in the implementation and use of forms.</li>
