<h2><a name="_mapi1book_determining_a_tables_end"></a>Determining a Table's End</h2>
<p>
A common error is to assume that the end of the table has been reached when:
<ul>
<li>
<a href="inter026_7wkz.htm"><b>QueryRows</b></a> has been called in a loop, with the end of the loop determined by the row count returned by <a href="inter026_5tkk.htm"><b>IMAPITable::GetRowCount</b></a>. <p>
The count that <b>GetRowCount</b> returns does not always represent the exact number of rows in the table; it is an approximate count.
</li>
<li>
<b>QueryRows</b> has been called with a fixed number of rows and less rows are returned.<p>
It is not until <b>QueryRows</b> returns a row set with a row count equal to zero that there are no more rows to retrieve.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<b>Note</b>  The only time that a caller can assume that the cursor is positioned at the end of the table for a positive row count or at the beginning of the table for a negative row count is when the value S_OK and zero rows are returned. The value MAPI_E_NOT_FOUND is never returned.</p>
