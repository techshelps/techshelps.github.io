<h2><a name="_mapi1book_itabledata_hrmodifyrow"></a>ITableData::HrModifyRow</h2>
<p>
The <b>ITableData::HrModifyRow</b> method inserts a new table row, possibly replacing an existing row.</p>
<h4>Quick Info</h4>
<p>
See <a href="inter040_3s4u.htm"><b>ITableData : IUnknown</b></a>.</p>
<pre><code><b>HRESULT HrModifyRow(
  LPSRow</b><i> lpSRow  </i>
<b>);</b>
 </code></pre>
<h4>Parameters</h4>
<dl>
<dt>
<i>lpSRow</i></dt>
<dd>
[in] Pointer to an <a href="structyp_233r.htm"><b>SRow</b></a> structure describing the row to be added or to replace an existing row. One of the property value structures pointed to by the <b>lpProps</b> member of the <b>SRow</b> structure should contain the index column, the same property that was specified in the <i>ulPropTagIndexColumn</i> parameter in the call to <a href="function_8fs5.htm"><b>CreateTable</b></a>.
</dd>
</dl>
<h4>Return Values</h4>
<dl>
<dt>
S_OK</dt>
<dd>
The row was successfully inserted or modified.</dd>
<dt>
MAPI_E_INVALID_PARAMETER</dt>
<dd>
The passed-in row does not have an index column.
</dd>
</dl>
<h4>Remarks</h4>
<p>
The <b>ITableData::HrModifyRow</b> method inserts the row described by the <b>SRow</b> structure pointed to by the <i>lpSRow</i> parameter. If a row already exists in the table that has the same value for its index column as the row that is pointed to by <i>lpSRow</i>, the existing row is replaced. If no row exists that matches the one included in the <b>SRow</b> structure, <b>HrModifyRow</b> adds the row to the end of the table.</p>
<p>
All views of the table are modified to include the row pointed to by <i>lpSRow</i>. However, if a view has a restriction in place that excludes the row, it may not be visible to the user. </p>
<p>
The columns in the row pointed to by <i>lpSRow</i> do not have to be in the same order as the columns in the table. The caller can also include as columns properties that are not currently in the table. For existing views, <b>HrModifyRow</b> makes these new columns available but does not include them in the current column set. For future views, <b>HrModifyRow</b> includes the new columns in the column set.</p>
<p>
After <b>HrModifyRow</b> has added the row, notifications are sent to all clients or service providers with a view of the table and that have called the table's <a href="inter026_3spx.htm"><b>IMAPITable::Advise</b></a> method to register for notifications. </p>
