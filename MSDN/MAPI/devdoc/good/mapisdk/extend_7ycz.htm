<h2><a name="_mapi1book_gateway_mappable_properties"></a>Gateway Mappable Properties</h2>
<p>
Gateway-mappable properties are properties that may require translation when sent from one messaging domain to another. MAPI's gateway-mappable properties allow messages to include information that requires a gateway to ensure the destination messaging system uses it properly. Although gateway developers are not required to provide this translation capability, they should consider gateway-mappable properties as an opportunity to handle message content even better.</p>
<p>
MAPI specifies five types of gateway-mappable properties:
<ul>
<li>
Display name</li>
<li>
E-mail address</li>
<li>
E-mail type</li>
<li>
Entry identifier</li>
<li>
Search key</li>
</ul>
<p>
This is the set of addressing properties that are associated with recipients, senders, report recipients, and delegated senders and recipients. To help your client define these properties so that a gateway handles them specially, MAPI specifies a naming convention using named properties and property sets. Five property sets exist to hold named properties, the addressing properties that require mapping. There is one property set for each type of mappable property. The property sets that will hold these named addressing properties are as follows.</p>
