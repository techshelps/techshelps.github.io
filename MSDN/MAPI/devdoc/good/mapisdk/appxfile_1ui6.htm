<p>
The entries in this section control debugging features in the MAPI core and profile provider.
<dl>
<dt>
<b>CheckNotifKeysOften</b> = <i>0|1</i></dt>
<dd>
If this entry is set to 1, the MAPI notification support methods validate their lists of entries and registrations before and after making any changes to them. The default value is 0 — no checks are performed.</dd>
<dt>
<b>CheckNotifTasksOften</b> = <i>0|1</i></dt>
<dd>
If this entry is set to 1, the MAPI notification support methods validate their list of active tasks before and after making any changes to it. The default value is 0 — no checks are performed.</dd>
<dt>
<b>DebugSpooler</b> = <i>path</i></dt>
<dd>
If this entry is present, MAPI attempts to execute its value when it is time to launch the MAPI spooler instead of simply launching the executable. It can be used to launch a debugger, for instance. The default value is MAPISP32.EXE for Win32 or MAPISP.EXE for Win16.</dd>
<dt>
<b>DelaySpooler</b> = <i>seconds</i></dt>
<dd>
This entry controls how long the MAPI spooler waits. The MAPI spooler process waits for a period of time immediately after being launched. This entry speeds up client startup by reducing contention between the client and MAPI spooler for CPU time and other resources. The default value is 15 seconds.</dd>
<dt>
<b>FlushRegistry</b> = <i>0|1</i></dt>
<dd>
If this entry is set to 1, the MAPI profile provider flushes the registry whenever a writeable profile section is released and at certain other times. If it is 0, MAPI never flushes the registry. Unlike most entries, this works for retail MAPI as well as the debug builds. The default value is 0 — the registry is not flushed.</dd>
<dt>
<b>SkipSystem</b> = <i>0|1</i></dt>
<dd>
If this entry is set to 0, MAPI tries the system directory first when loading the MAPI spooler or any service provider. If it is 1, MAPI loads those components in typical path order. Since most such components are installed in the system directory, it is faster to check there first. Unlike most entries, this works for retail MAPI as well as the debug builds. The default value is 0 — try the system directory first.</dd>
<dt>
<b>SpoolerAutoStartTimeout</b> = <i>seconds</i></dt>
<dd>
This entry controls the length of time the client will wait for the MAPI spooler to start when it has been started automatically as the result of a client logon. The default value is 60 seconds.
</dd>
