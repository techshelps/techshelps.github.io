<p>
A transport provider is a dynamic-link library (DLL) which acts as an intermediary between the MAPI subsystem and one or more underlying messaging systems. A messaging system is some specific mechanism by which messages are sent and received. Some examples of messaging systems are:
<ul>
<li>
A shared network file system that the transport provider writes messages to directly.</li>
<li>
A TCP/IP network interface that the transport provider uses to connect to a messaging server.</li>
<li>
An online service that users dial into.</li>
<li>
A host-based messaging or office automation system.</li>
<li>
A set of remote procedure calls to a messaging server.</li>
<li>
Anything that can be used to transfer data from one computer to another.</li>
</ul>
<p>
A transport provider DLL must conform to the interface specified by MAPI. As a transport provider developer, you will implement this interface in terms of the functionality present in the messaging system.</p>
