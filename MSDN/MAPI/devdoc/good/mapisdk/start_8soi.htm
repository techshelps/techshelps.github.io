<h2><a name="_mapi1book_using_the_address_book_viewer"></a>Using the Address Book Viewer</h2>
<p>
To use the Address Book Viewer, start ABVIEW.EXE or ABVIEW32.EXE, depending on your platform. The Address Book Viewer uses a series of dialog boxes driven by menu selections to display and prompt for information. If you are not already running a messaging client application such as Microsoft Exchange, the Address Book Viewer will first prompt you for the name of a profile. If you are running a messaging client, the Address Book Viewer will use the profile that the client is currently using. </p>
<p>
If you are running the Address Book Viewer for the first time, select <b>Configure</b> from the <b>Help</b> menu and enter the DLL names of the Table Viewer and Property Viewer. Depending on your target platform, enter TBLVU32.DLL or TBLVU.DLL in the field labeled "Table Vu DLL" and PROPVU32.DLL or PROPVU.DLL in the field labeled "Property Vu DLL." All of the other fields may be left blank.</p>
<p>
After this initial configuration, you can use any of the three Address Book Viewer menus. There is a <b>File</b> menu to start and end MAPI session and a <b>Help</b> menu to display information about the Address Book Viewer and to perform configuration. The primary menu is the <b>Address Book</b> menu. With the selections from the <b>Address Book</b> menu, you can display the properties of containers, messaging users, and distribution lists and invoke several methods of the <b>IAddrBook</b> interface.</p>
<p>
The menus of the Address Book Viewer appear as follows:</p>
<p>

<p>
When you use the <b>File</b> menu to log on to MAPI, the Address Book Viewer calls <b>MAPILogonEx</b> to establish a MAPI session. If you're debugging an address book provider, its <b>ABProviderInit</b> function and <b>IABProvider::Logon</b> method are called at this point. The Address Book Viewer also calls <b>IMAPISession::OpenAddressBook</b> to make the address book accessible. When you log off, the Address Book Viewer releases its pointer to the address book, calls <b>IMAPISession::Logoff</b>, and then releases its session pointer. </p>
<p>
The <b>Address Book</b> menu provides selections for displaying information about the root container, for displaying messaging user or distribution list properties, for building a recipient list using one, two, or three wells, and for invoking the following <b>IAddrBook</b> methods:
<ul>
<li>
ResolveName</li>
<li>
CreateOneOff</li>
<li>
NewEntry</li>
</ul>
<p>

The <b>Help</b> menu provides two selections: <b>About</b> and <b>Config</b>. The About selection provides summary information about the Address Book Viewer including its full name and version. The Config selection displays a dialog box that you can use to configure the Address Book Viewer.
