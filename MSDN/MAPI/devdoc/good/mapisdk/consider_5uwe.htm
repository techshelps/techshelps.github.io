<p>
Address book notifications allow a client to learn of events that occur to any address book entry or to a particular entry. You can register for these notifications either through the MAPI address book by calling <a href="inter006_58v9.htm"><b>IAddrBook::Advise</b></a> or through an address book container's hierarchy or contents table by calling <a href="inter026_3spx.htm"><b>IMAPITable::Advise</b></a>. </p>
<p>
Specify the entry identifier of an address book container, distribution list, or messaging user if you are registering for notifications on a particular entry and NULL if registering for notifications on the entire address book. The entry identifier must represent a messaging user or distribution list in an address book container. <b>IAddrBook::Advise </b>examines this entry identifier to determine which address book provider is responsible for the corresponding object and forwards the call to the appropriate address book provider's <a href="inter004_87xh.htm"><b>IABLogon::Advise</b></a> method. </p>
<p>
Clients can register for the following types of events on address book entries:
<ul>
<li>
Critical error</li>
<li>
Any of the object events (created, modified, deleted, moved, or copied)</li>
<li>
Table modified</li>
</ul>
<p>
Typically, registration occurs only on address book container contents and hierarchy tables. It is rare that clients register with the lower level messaging user and distribution list objects. This is because: 
<ul>
<li>
Many address book providers do not support notifications on their messaging users and distribution lists.</li>
<li>
Table notifications are sufficient for tracking changes and reporting them to users.</li>
</ul>
