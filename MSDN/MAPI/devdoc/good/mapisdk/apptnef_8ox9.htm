<h2><a name="_mapi1book_attfrom"></a>attFrom</h2>
<p>
The <b>attFrom</b> attribute is encoded as a <b>TRP</b> structure which encodes the display name and e-mail address of the sender, followed by the display name and address of the sender, followed by any necessary padding. The format for <b>attFrom</b> is as follows:
<dl>
<dt>
<b>attFrom</b><i>:</i></dt>
<dd>
<i>TRP-structure </i>sender-display-name<i> sender-address </i>padding
</dd>
</dl>
<p>
The sender-display-name is a null-terminated string that is padded with an additional null character, if necessary, to reach a 2-byte boundary. The padding at the end of the <b>attFrom</b> encoding consists of as many null characters as needed to reach a <b>sizeof(TRP)</b> boundary.
<dl>
<dt>
<i>TRP-structure:</i></dt>
<dd>
<b>trpidOneOff</b> cbgrtrp cch cb
</dd>
</dl>
<p>
For the <b>attFrom</b> item, the <b>TRP</b>-structure is always a one-off encoding, so the trpid off the <b>TRP</b>-structure field is always <b>trpidOneOff</b>. The cbgrtrp, cch, and cb items correspond to the remaining fields of the <b>TRP</b> structure.</p>
<p>
The cbgrtrp field is calculated as the sum of <b>(sizeof(TRP) *2)</b>, the length of the null-terminated sender-display-name with its padding, and the length of the null-terminated sender-address.</p>
<p>
The cch field is calculated as the length of the null-terminated display-name with its padding.</p>
<p>
The cb field is calculated as the length of the null-terminated sender-address.
<dl>
<dt>
<i>sender-address:</i></dt>
<dd>
address-type <b>:</b> address <b>'\0'</b>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>
The sender-address is a string that is composed of four parts, the address-type, a literal colon (:), the address itself, and a terminating null character. For example, the string "fax:1-909-555-1234\0" would be a legal sender-address value.</p>
