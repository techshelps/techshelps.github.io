<h1><a name="_mapi1book_syntax_and_limitations_for_win32_functions_useful_in_mapi_development"></a>Syntax and Limitations for Win32 Functions Useful in MAPI Development</h1>
<p>
The remainder of this appendix lists Win32 functions useful to MAPI developers that have limits, adaptations, or differences when used in the MAPI development environment. Where applicable, these limitations are described. Where there are no limitations specifically defined, only the syntax of a function is included. For detailed descriptions of the Win32 functions, see the <i>Win32 Programmer's Reference.</i> </p>
<p>
Three limitations apply to most of the Win32 functions that MAPI implements. Error codes returned from these functions or from <b>GetLastError</b> come from MS-DOS and may not always match the Win32 counterpart. Second, MAPI works only with filenames, and other strings passed to it, in the ANSI character set. Applications that use filenames in the OEM character set must convert them to ANSI before calling MAPI. And third, security attributes are ignored. </p>
