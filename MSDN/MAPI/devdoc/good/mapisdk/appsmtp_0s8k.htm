<h2><a name="_mapi1book_message_text"></a>Message Text</h2>
<p>
For outbound messages in MIME mode, the content-type depends on whether there are attachments and what the message text looks like. If there are attachments, the Content-type is <i>multipart/mixed;</i> the message text and each attachment become a separate part of the message content, each with its own content-type. If there are no attachments, the content-type of the message is <i>text/plain</i> and there is only one part.</p>
<p>
The message text is not line-wrapped unless some line exceeds 140 characters in length. If one does, the entire text is wrapped to 76 columns and the <i>quoted-printable</i> encoding is used to preserve line breaks. The content-type depends on what characters are found in the message text, as follows:
<ul>
<li>
If only 7-bit characters are found and no line exceeds 140 characters in length, the message is ASCII text.<p>
<i>Content-type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii<br>
</i>(Content-Transfer-Encoding=7bit is assumed.)
</li>
<li>
If long lines or 8-bit characters are found, the message is text and the character set is determined by the locale. It should be chosen from the character sets defined by ISO standard 8859.<p>
<i>Content-type: text/plain; charset=iso-8859-1</i> (or another valid charset)<br>
<i>Content-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable</i>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
For inbound MIME messages, if the first message content part has <i>Content-type: text/*</i> (that is, any text type) and its character set is recognized, it is mapped to <a href="propa_9lvd.htm">PR_BODY</a>. A first message content part not meeting this criterion becomes an attachment. Any subsequent parts also become attachments.</p>
<p>
In uuencode mode, message text in outbound messages is line-wrapped to 78 columns, as for MS Mail 3.x. The content-type is "text/plain." To preserve the original message's paragraph breaks under these circumstances, observe the following conventions in the wrapped text. There are three possible reasons for ending a line of text, each with its own character sequence:
<ul>
<li>
Line-break. The original text contained a newline entered by the user (paragraph mark). In the transport, this maps to a newline with no preceding blanks. If the user enters a newline preceded by blanks, the blanks should be stripped out.</li>
<li>
Line-nobreak. The original text contained a word too long to fit on a single line of the message. In the transport, this maps to a newline preceded by two blanks.</li>
<li>
Line-wrap. The original text contained no newline, the text is too long to fit on a single line of the message, but it can be broken between two words. In the transport, this maps to a newline preceded by a single blank.</li>
</ul>
