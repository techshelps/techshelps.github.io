<p>
The PR_SUBJECT_PREFIX property contains a subject prefix that typically indicates some action on a message, such as "FW: " for forwarding. </p>

<h4>Remarks</h4>
<p>
The PR_SUBJECT_PREFIX property is recommended on all message objects. </p>
<p>
The subject prefix consists of one or more alphanumeric characters, followed by a colon and a space (which are part of the prefix). It must not contain any nonalphanumeric characters before the colon. Absence of a prefix can be represented by an empty string or by PR_SUBJECT_PREFIX not being set. </p>
<p>
If PR_SUBJECT_PREFIX is set explicitly, it can be of any length and use any alphanumeric characters, but it must match a substring at the beginning of the <a href="propb_3c8k.htm">PR_SUBJECT</a> property. If PR_SUBJECT_PREFIX is not set by the sender and must be computed, its contents are more restricted. The rule for computing the prefix is that PR_SUBJECT must begin with one, two, or three letters (alphabetic only) followed by a colon and a space. If such a substring is found at the beginning of PR_SUBJECT, it then becomes PR_SUBJECT_PREFIX (and also stays at the beginning of PR_SUBJECT). Otherwise PR_SUBJECT_PREFIX remains unset. </p>
<p>
PR_SUBJECT_PREFIX and <a href="propb_5xo4.htm">PR_NORMALIZED_SUBJECT</a> should be computed as part of the <a href="inter022_5rqr.htm"><b>IMAPIProp::SaveChanges</b></a> implementation. A client should not prompt <a href="inter022_44c3.htm"><b>IMAPIProp::GetProps</b></a> for their values until they have been committed by an <b>IMAPIProp::SaveChanges</b> call.</p>
<p>
The subject properties are typically small strings of fewer than 256 characters, and a message store provider is not obligated to support the OLE <b>IStream</b> interface on them. A client should always attempt access through the <b>IMAPIProp</b> interface first, and resort to <b>IStream</b> only if MAPI_E_NOT_ENOUGH_MEMORY is returned.</p>
