<h1><a name="_mapi1book_optional_features_for_address_book_providers"></a>Optional Features for Address Book Providers</h1>
<p>
There are many optional features for address book providers. Some of the more commonly implemented features include:
<ul>
<li>
Acting as a foreign provider by allowing entries from one of your containers to be added to another provider's container.</li>
<li>
Acting as a host provider by adding entries from another provider to one of your containers.</li>
<li>
Advanced searching.</li>
<li>
Prefix scrolling through contents tables.</li>
<li>
Support for distribution lists.</li>
<li>
Support for event notification.</li>
</ul>
<p>
The following table briefly describes these optional features and how you implement them:</p>

</table><br>
<p>
For event notification, your <b>IABLogon::Advise</b> method will be called by MAPI when a client calls <b>IAddrBook::Advise</b> to register for notifications on any one of your containers, messaging users, or distribution lists. However, because supporting event notification is optional, you can return MAPI_E_NO_SUPPORT from these methods. However, MAPI does recommend that you at least support notifications on your contents tables and encourages you to support all types of object notification except for <i>fnevSearchComplete</i> and the <i>fnevCriticalError</i> event to add value.</p>
