<h1><a name="_mapi1book_handling_attachments_with_cmc"></a>Handling Attachments with CMC</h1>
<p>
A CMC client application receives attachments in the form of an array of <a href="cmcref_26t0.htm"><b>CMC_attachment</b></a> structures on a message. Each element of this array specifies a file containing an attachment. The one exception to this rule is for embedded messages, which are received as a CMC message in the attachment extension.</p>
<p>
CMC clients have no explicit method for distinguishing between OLE 1 and OLE 2 attachments. You should try opening the attachment as an <b>IStorage</b> object to determine whether the attachment is an OLE 2 object. If this fails, your client should try opening it as an OLE 1 <b>IStream</b> object. If both of these fail, the attachment should be treated as an ordinary data file.</p>
