<h2><a name="_mapi1book_delegate_access"></a>Delegate Access</h2>
<p>
Delegate access refers to the user's ability to send a message as another user or receive a message for another user. Delegate access is a service provider-independent feature of MAPI that transport providers can support if they choose. However, no provider is required to do so. Delegate access is valuable when it is necessary for a user to send messages as, or filter incoming messages for, another user or when a user must access another user's message store. Before allowing a delegate user to connect to another user's store, the message store provider must verify that the delegate user has the proper authority. </p>
<p>
There are two groups of properties that are used to support delegate access:</p>
<p class=indent1>
<a href="propb_6w2t.htm">PR_SENT_REPRESENTING_ADDRTYPE</a></p>
<p class=indent1>
<a href="propb_0h83.htm">PR_SENT_REPRESENTING_EMAIL_ADDRESS</a></p>
<p class=indent1>
<a href="propb_17hg.htm">PR_SENT_REPRESENTING_ENTRYID</a></p>
<p class=indent1>
<a href="propb_799h.htm">PR_SENT_REPRESENTING_NAME</a></p>
<p class=indent1>
<a href="propb_5fax.htm">PR_SENT_REPRESENTING_SEARCH_KEY</a></p>
<p class=indent1>
<a href="propb_0fz9.htm">PR_RCVD_REPRESENTING_ADDRTYPE</a></p>
<p class=indent1>
<a href="propb_4a0j.htm">PR_RCVD_REPRESENTING_EMAIL_ADDRESS</a></p>
<p class=indent1>
<a href="propb_21lw.htm">PR_RCVD_REPRESENTING_ENTRYID</a></p>
<p class=indent1>
<a href="propb_6m1x.htm">PR_RCVD_REPRESENTING_NAME</a></p>
<p class=indent1>
<a href="propb_7qrd.htm">PR_RCVD_REPRESENTING_SEARCH_KEY</a></p>
<p>
On outgoing messages, the PR_SENT_REPRESENTING properties identify the messaging user that should act as the sender. Clients can set these properties as an option. If the PR_SENT_REPRESENTING properties are not set by the time the message reaches a transport provider that supports delegate access, it is the provider's responsibility to set them along with the PR_SENDER properties.</p>
<p>
On incoming messages, the PR_RCVD_REPRESENTING properties identify the user that should act as the recipient. Transport providers responsible for delivering delegate messages must set both the PR_RCVD_REPRESENTING and PR_RECEIVED_BY properties. Clients receiving a delegate message should copy the values of the PR_SENT_REPRESENTING properties to the corresponding PR_RCVD_REPRESENTING properties.</p>
<p>
For example, suppose John is receiving Sally's messages while Sally is on vacation. The PR_RCVD_REPRESENTING properties identify John as the delegate recipient. When John sends a reply to a message that he has received for Sally, the message's PR_SENDER properties identify John as the sender. Because John is representing Sally, the PR_SENT_REPRESENTING properties identify Sally.</p>
<p>
Transport providers handling incoming delegate messages should usually deliver these messages as the messaging user identified by the PR_SENT_REPRESENTING properties rather than as the user identified by the PR_SENDER properties. The exception to this rule is when it is necessary to match access privilege and transport types. In this case, a transport provider can choose a sending identity. </p>
<p>
If the PR_SENT_REPRESENTING properties are unavailable for an incoming delegate message, the transport provider handling delivery must set them, using the values of the corresponding PR_SENDER properties. If the PR_SENT_REPRESENTING properties are available but the transport provider does not support delegate access, it can use the PR_SENDER properties for delivery.</p>
