<p>
The <i>Messaging Application Programming Interface (MAPI) Programmer's Reference </i>is the documentation that accompanies the Platform SDK.</p>
<p>
The <i>MAPI Programmer's Reference</i> is organized as follows:
<ul>
<li>
Quick Start Procedures<p>
Topics in this section describe tasks commonly performed using the Platform SDK and include design tasks, implementation tasks, and references to sample source code. These procedures are not intended to supply the actual implementation details.
</li>
<li>
About Samples and Tools<p>
Topics in this section describe the MAPI sample source code included in the Platform SDK documentation and SDK tools.
</li>
<li>
Guide<p>
Aside from a discussion of key concepts and the MAPI architecture, this section includes topics for developers using CMC and Simple MAPI, developers using MAPI to write a client application or a service provider and developers working with forms. There are also topics that describe, at a conceptual level, the use and implementation of objects, interfaces, properties, and tables.
</li>
<li>
Reference<p>
This section consists of alphabetic listings of the MAPI programming elements such as interfaces, functions, properties and structures. Where appropriate, the reference pages include syntax, parameters and return values for each API element. 
</li>
<li>
Appendixes<p>
This section includes a wide range of topics, some of which are of interest to all MAPI programmers and some that are of interest to small groups of programmers.
</li>
<li>
Glossary<p>
This section provides definitions for commonly used MAPI terms and cross references to related topics in the Guide and Reference.
