<h2><a name="_mapi1book_notification_events"></a>Notification Events</h2>
<p>
When clients register for event notification, they must specify one or more events of interest. The events that they can specify depend on the set of events that the intended advise source supports. There are ten types of notifications that clients and service providers can register for, each represented by a constant. Status object notification is an exception. Status object notification is an internal MAPI notification; clients cannot register for it and service providers cannot generate it. The following table describes the types of events and the advise source objects that can support them. The event constant is included with the event type.</p>

<p>
The extended event is defined by a service provider to represent an event that cannot be covered by any of the other predefined events. Only clients that know before they register that a service provider supports an extended event can register for that event. It is not possible for clients to determine without advance knowledge if a service provider supports an extended event and, if it does, how to handle such an event when it is received.</p>
