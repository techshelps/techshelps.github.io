<h2><a name="_invalidating_an_object"></a>Invalidating an Object</h2>
<p>
As part of your provider's shutdown process, you might want to invalidate an object. Invalidating an object involves replacing its vtable with a vtable containing implementations for the three <b>IUnknown</b> methods: <b>AddRef</b>, <b>Release</b>, and <b>QueryInterface</b>. Invalidate an object by calling <a href="inter025_8d2c.htm"><b>IMAPISupport::MakeInvalid</b></a>, a method that is included in the support object of each of the three common provider types. Providers typically make this call in the implementation of their logon object's <b>Logoff</b> method. </p>
<p>
Invalidating an object gives MAPI the ultimate responsibility for freeing the memory associated with an object. You can free all of the resources connected with an object and then call <b>MakeInvalid</b> to invalidate all of the methods in its inherited interfaces. Calls to any of these methods will return MAPI_E_INVALID_OBJECT. Using <b>MakeInvalid</b> is an option that many service providers choose to ignore. </p>
