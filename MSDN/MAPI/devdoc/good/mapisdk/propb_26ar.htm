<h4>Remarks</h4>
<p>
A value of TRUE means that the <a href="propa_9lvd.htm">PR_BODY</a> property, the plain text version of this message, and the <a href="propb_7vhg.htm">PR_RTF_COMPRESSED</a> property, the Rich Text Format version, are identical except for white space in PR_BODY and formatting in PR_RTF_COMPRESSED. The text in the two versions consists of the same characters in the same sequence.</p>
<p>
A value of FALSE means that the two versions are not synchronized for text content but are capable of being synchronized by the <a href="function_4yg3.htm"><b>RTFSync</b></a> function. One version has been altered and the other version has not.</p>
<p>
No value, PR_RTF_IN_SYNC is not set at all, means that the two versions, if both exist or ever existed, cannot be synchronized. One version has been deleted or altered so radically that synchronization is no longer possible.</p>
<p>
A client application that has modified PR_RTF_COMPRESSED should set a value of FALSE in PR_RTF_IN_SYNC to force synchronization. RTF-aware message stores should perform the synchronization using <b>RTFSync</b> during an <a href="inter022_5rqr.htm"><b>IMAPIProp::SaveChanges</b></a> call. RTF-aware clients should check the setting of PR_RTF_IN_SYNC before reading PR_RTF_COMPRESSED, and call <b>RTFSync</b> first if necessary.</p>
<p>
If PR_BODY has had modifications to anything other than its white space, the message store must delete PR_RTF_IN_SYNC to terminate synchronization.</p>
