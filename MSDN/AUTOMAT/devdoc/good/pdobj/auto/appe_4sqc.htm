<h1><a name="_oa96_guid_management"></a>GUID Management</h1>
<p>
The problem with managing GUIDs is that they are pervasive, and their length prohibits simple comparisons.</p>
<p>
The single most important technique in managing GUIDs is to keep a central list of all the GUIDs that are implemented. For example, use the DEFINE_GUID macro or the Guidgen.exe tool with the<b> -n </b>option to generate the required number of GUIDs, and then enter the resulting strings in the first column of a spreadsheet. Each time a new GUID is used, enter a description of its purpose in the second column of the spreadsheet.</p>
<p>
<b>Note</b>  The DEFINE_GUIDE macro does not generate GUIDs. It defines a 128-bit number to a GUID with a human-readable name.</p>
<p>
A central spreadsheet of GUIDs has several advantages:
<ul>
<li>
Listing all the GUIDs in one location may prevent accidental reuse of a GUID. (This often happens when an application is cloned to create another one.)</li>
<li>
The spreadsheet can be used to compare GUIDs. To check the accuracy of a GUID, you can copy it from the location where it is being used (for example, a .reg file), paste it into the spreadsheet, and then compare the two cells with the <b>=</b> operator.</li>
<li>
A record of GUID usage can be helpful in case of future problems, and this single source of information will be available to find the GUID for an object.</li>
</ul>
