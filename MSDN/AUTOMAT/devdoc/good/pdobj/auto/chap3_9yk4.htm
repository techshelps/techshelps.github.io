<h3><a name="_oa96_creating_an_invisible_object"></a>Creating an Invisible Object</h3>
<p>
In the preceding section, Visual Basic was used to access and program a form-based interface for the Hello sample. The Hello Application object was started as invisible, and was later displayed when its <b>Visible </b>property was set to <b>True</b>.<b> </b>Some objects are not visible, and some objects are never displayed to the user. </p>
<p>
For example, a word-processing application may expose its spelling checker engine as an object. This object might support a method called CheckWord that takes a string as an argument. If the string is spelled correctly, the method returns <b>True</b>; otherwise, the method returns <b>False</b>. If the string is spelled incorrectly, it could be passed to another (hypothetical) method called SuggestWord that returns a suggestion for its correct spelling. The code might look something like this.</p>
<pre><code>Sub CheckSpelling ()
    Dim ObjVar As New SpellChecker
    Dim MyWord, Result

    MyWord = "potatoe"

    ' Check the spelling.
    Result = ObjVar.CheckWord MyWord
    ' If False, get suggestion.
    If Not Result Then
        MyWord = ObjVar.SuggestWord MyWord
    End If
End Sub
</code></pre>
<p>
In this example, the spelling checker is never displayed to the user. Its capabilities are exposed through the properties and methods of the spelling checker object.</p>
<p>
As shown in the example, invisible objects can be created and referenced in the same way as any other type of object.</p>
