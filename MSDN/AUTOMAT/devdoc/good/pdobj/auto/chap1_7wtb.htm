<h1><a name="_oa96_what_is_an_activex_client_"></a>What Is An ActiveX Client?</h1>
<p>
An ActiveX client is an application or programming tool that manipulates one or more ActiveX objects. The objects can exist in the same application or in another application. Clients can use existing objects, create new instances of objects, get and set properties, and invoke methods supported by the object.</p>
<p>
Visual Basic is an ActiveX client. You can use Visual Basic and similar programming tools to create packaged scripts that access Automation objects. You can also create clients by doing the following:
<ul>
<li>
Writing code within an application that accesses another application's exposed objects through Automation.</li>
<li>
Revising an existing programming tool, such as an embedded macro language, to add support for Automation.</li>
<li>
Developing a new application, such as a compiler or type information browser, that supports Automation.</li>
</ul>
