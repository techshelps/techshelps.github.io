<p>
This chapter describes the standard ActiveX objects, and discusses naming guidelines for creating objects that are unique to applications, especially user-interactive applications that support a multiple-document interface (MDI). If an ActiveX object is not user-interactive or supports only a single-document interface (SDI), the standards and guidelines should be adapted as appropriate.
<ul>
<li>
<i>Standard objects</i> comprise a set of objects defined by Automation. You can use them as appropriate to your application. The objects described in this chapter are oriented toward document-based, user-interactive applications. Other applications (such as noninteractive database servers) may have different requirements.</li>
<li>
<i>Naming guidelines</i> are recommendations meant to improve consistency across applications.</li>
</ul>
<p>
This chapter also provides examples in a hypothetical syntax derived from Visual Basic. The standards and guidelines are subject to change.</p>
