<p>
Automation provides interfaces for accessing exposed objects from an application or programming tool written in C or C++. The following sections show C++ code that uses the same type of access method as the Visual Basic code, which is described earlier in this chapter. Although the process is more complex with C++ than with Visual Basic, the approach is similar. This section shows the minimum code necessary to access and manipulate a remote object.</p>
<p>
You can use the <b>IDispatch</b> interface to access ActiveX objects, or you can access objects directly through the VTBL. Because VTBL references can be bound at compile time, VTBL access is generally faster than through <b>IDispatch</b>. Whenever possible, use the <b>ITypeInfo </b>or <b>ITypeInfo2</b> interfaces to get information about an object, including the VTBL addresses of the object's members. Then, use this information to access ActiveX objects through the VTBL.</p>
<p>
To create compilers and other programming tools that use information from type libraries, use the <b>ITypeComp </b>interface. This interface binds to exposed objects at compile time. For details on <b>ITypeComp</b>, see Chapter 9, "<a href="chap9_49pv.htm">Type Description Interfaces</a>." </p>
