<h1><a name="_oa96_troubleshooting"></a>Troubleshooting</h1>
<p>
The following problems are common with GUIDs.</p>
<h4>Problem</h4>
<p>
<b>GetObject</b> can't seem to create an instance of my application.</p>
<h4>Solution</h4>
<p>
Visual Basic uses the OLE calls listed in Appendix C to find the .exe file that creates an application instance.</p>
<h5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Visual Basic proceeds as follows</h5>
<ol>
<li>
Looks up the GUID for the object. (For the Hello application, Visual Basic maps the programmatic ID (ProgID) Hello.Application into a GUID.)</li>
<li>
Finds the object's server (the Hello.exe for the Hello application).</li>
<li>
Launches the application.</li>
</ol>
<p>
If an error occurs, check the following:
<ul>
<li>
Has the .reg file been run?</li>
<li>
Are the entries in the registry correct? </li>
<li>
Do all of the GUIDs match?</li>
<li>
Can the application be launched? The .exe file for the application, listed in the LocalServer entry, should either be on the path or it should be fully specified. For example:</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>c:\ole2\sample\hello\hello.bin
</code></pre>
<h4>Problem</h4>
<p>
When I use <b>GetObject,</b> the application launches, but the <b>GetObject</b> call fails.</p>
<h4>Solution</h4>
<p>
Normally, when an application is started, a class factory is registered using <b>CoRegisterClassObject</b>. Some applications register their class factories only when launched with the <b>/Automation</b> switch. If code was inherited, or a sample was copied, determine whether it checks for this switch. The <b>/Automation</b> option might appear in the .reg file, the registry, or in the development environment.</p>
<h4>Problem</h4>
<p>
<b>GetTypeInfoOfGuid()</b> fails to get the type information from my type library.</p>
<h4>Solution</h4>
<p>
When <b>GetTypeInfoOfGuid</b> is called, a GUID is provided. If this GUID doesn't match the GUID in the .tlb file, no type information will be returned. The GUID in the code may be declared in a header file. The GUID in the .tlb file can be checked by using Browse.exe, which is provided with OLE, or with the Visual Basic Object Browser.</p>
