<p>
Before an application can use OLE and Automation, the OLE objects must be registered with the user's system registration database. OLE provides sample registration files to perform this task for the OLE objects and the sample applications. Registration makes the following possible:
<ul>
<li>
ActiveX clients can create instances of the objects through <b>CoCreateInstance</b>.</li>
<li>
Automation tools can find the type libraries that are installed on the user's computer.</li>
<li>
OLE can find remoting code for the interfaces.</li>
</ul>
<p>
You can use the <b>DLLRegisterServer </b>function to register all objects implemented by a dynamic-link library (DLL). This function registers the class identifiers (CLSIDs) for each object, the programmatic identifiers (ProgIDs) for each application, and the type library. For details, refer to the description of <b>DLLRegisterServer</b> in <i>Programming with MFC</i>, provided with Microsoft Visual C++ version 4.1 and later product documentation.</p>
<p>
The following sections give a brief overview of the syntax used in registering ActiveX objects. Descriptions of the process are provided later in this chapter. For detailed information, refer to the <i>OLE Programmer's Reference </i>in the Win32 SDK, which can be found on the Microsoft Developer’s Network (MSDN).</p>
