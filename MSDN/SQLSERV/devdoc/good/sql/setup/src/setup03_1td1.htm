<h1><a name="_licensing_mode"></a>Licensing Mode</h1>
<p>
Microsoft SQL Server 6.0 (a Microsoft Back Office server product) requires a Server License, plus a Client Access License for each client computer that accesses the server. You must acquire these licenses prior to using the product. A Server License is provided with the server software. Client Access Licenses are purchased separately.</p>
<p>
Client Access Licenses can be used in one of two licensing modes. This choice of modes offers you the flexibility to choose the option that best meets your requirements:
<ul>
<li>
<i>Per Seat</i>. Each computer or workstation that will be accessing or otherwise using any SQL Server¾using either Microsoft-provided client software or third-party software¾requires a Client Access License.</li>
<li>
<i>Per Server</i>. You specify a maximum number of simultaneous user connections for the server. An equal number of Client Access Licenses are required for that server.</li>
</ul>
<p>
During installation of a server, you are asked to choose between these two licensing modes. Before the <b>setup</b> program can proceed, you must make your selection and then accept the terms of the license agreement. </p>
<p>
If you are unsure which licensing mode to choose, select the Per Server option. After installation of a server, you are permitted to convert from Per Server mode to Per Seat mode at no additional cost. This is a one-time, one-way conversion option. It is not necessary to notify Microsoft if you elect to make this change. To change licensing mode to Per Seat after installation, use the Licensing application in the Control Panel. For more information, see the online Help for the Licensing application.</p>
<p>
You are not legally permitted to change the licensing mode from Per Seat to Per Server. </p>
<p>
To review the licensing agreement, see the <i>Client License Access Agreement</i> or the online Help for the Licensing application in the Control Panel.</p>
