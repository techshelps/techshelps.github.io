<h1><a name="_remote_installation"></a>Remote Installation</h1>
<p>
You can use the SQL Server <b>setup</b> program to install the software on a remote computer. When you do so, you are prompted for the following information:
<dl>
<dt>
<b>Remote Server Name</b></dt>
<dd>
The computer name for the remote computer (for example, REMOTE).</dd>
<dt>
<b>SQL Installation Drive</b></dt>
<dd>
The remote logical drive on which to install the SQL Server software. The default is C.
<p>
For example, to install SQL Server on the default share for the D drive (D$) on a remote computer, you would specify remote logical drive D for the SQL Installation Drive.
</dd>
<dt>
<b>Windows NT Installation Drive</b></dt>
<dd>
The remote logical drive on which the Windows NT root is already installed. This is where the <b>setup</b> program copies SQL Server client dynamic-link libraries (DLLs) and DLLs required only during installation. The default is the current setting for the SQL Installation Drive.
<p>
For example, if the Windows NT root for a remote computer is on the default share for its D drive (D$), you would specify remote logical drive D for the Windows NT Installation Drive.
</dd>
<dt>
<b>Master Database Installation Drive</b></dt>
<dd>
The remote logical drive on which to install the SQL Server <i>master</i> database. The default is the current setting for the SQL Installation Drive.
<p>
For example, to install the <i>master</i> database on the default share for the D drive (D$) on a remote computer, you would specify remote logical drive D for the Master Database Installation Drive.
</dd>
<dt>
<b>Remote Logical Drive</b></dt>
<dd>
The remote logical drive for the currently selected option (the SQL Server Installation Drive, the Windows NT Installation Drive, or the Master Database Installation Drive).
<p>
The default remote logical drive for the SQL Server Installation Drive is C. The default for the other two options is the current setting of the SQL Server Installation Drive.

</dd>
</dl>
<p>
On the local computer, the <b>setup</b> program assigns as many as three unused drive letters to correspond to the logical drives on the remote computer. This is <i>not </i>the same drive letter as the remote logical drive (which corresponds to the actual drive on the remote computer on which the files are to be installed). For example, if you're installing SQL Server on the D drive of a remote computer named \\REMOTE from a local computer named \\LOCAL, you would enter REMOTE as the Remote Server Name and D as the SQL Installation Drive.</p>
<p>
On the local computer, the <b>setup</b> program assigns a unique logical drive letter (for example, X) for the drive on the remote computer (in this example, \\REMOTE\D$). You cannot change the logical drive letter assigned by the <b>setup</b> program. During the installation process, when prompting for a path, the <b>setup</b> program adds this unique logical drive letter to the default. In this example, when prompting for the SQL Server root directory, the <b>setup</b> program would use X:\SQL60 to correspond to \\REMOTE\D$\SQL60.</p>
<p>
After you've installed the software on the remote computer, you can use SQL Enterprise Manager or SQL Service Manager to start and stop the remote SQL Server.
