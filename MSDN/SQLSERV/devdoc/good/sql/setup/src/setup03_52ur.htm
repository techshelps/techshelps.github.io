<h1><a name="_network_support_setup03"></a>Network Support</h1>
<p>
Microsoft SQL Server uses network libraries, known as Net-Libraries, to pass network packets back and forth between clients and a SQL Server. The Net-Libraries, implemented as dynamic-link libraries (DLLs), perform the network operations required to communicate using specific interprocess communication (IPC) mechanism protocols.</p>
<p>
SQL Server includes a set of server Net-Libraries that enable simultaneous connections from clients running named pipes or other interprocess communication (IPC) mechanisms. Named pipes are installed by default (and it is recommended that named pipes not be removed, even if other Net-Libraries are chosen). During installation, the <b>setup</b> program gives you the option of setting up one or more of these other Net-Libraries on the server:
<dl>
<dt>
<b>Multi-Protocol</b></dt>
<dd>
The Multi-Protocol Net-Library takes advantage of the powerful remote procedure call (RPC) facility of Windows NT. Unlike other Net-Libraries, Multi-Protocol Net-Library need only be selected as an option from the Select Network Protocols dialog box; it does not require the entry of any configuration parameters. Multi-Protocol Net-Library:
<ul>
<li>
Communicates over most IPC mechanisms supported by Windows NT. (Note that for SQL Server 6.0, only TCP/IP Windows Sockets, NWLink IPX/SPX, and Named Pipes are considered tested and supported.)</li>
<li>
Allows the use of integrated security over all protocols that RPC supports (including Windows-based Novell clients using SPX or IPXODI).</li>
<li>
Supports encryption for both user password authentication and data.</li>
<li>
Offers performance comparable to native IPC Net-Libraries for most applications.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dt>
<b>NWLink IPX/SPX</b></dt>
<dd>
This Net-Library allows SQL Server to communicate using the NWLink IPX/SPX protocol.
<p>
If you set up SQL Server to listen on NWLink IPX/SPX, the <b>setup</b> program prompts you for the Novell Bindery service name in which to register SQL Server on the Novell network. The default service name is the computer name of the server computer. The Net-Library allows Novell SPX clients to connect.
</dd>
<dt>
<b>TCP/IP Sockets</b></dt>
<dd>
This Net-Library allows SQL Server to communicate using standard Windows Sockets as the IPC method across the TCP/IP protocol.
<p>
If you set up SQL Server to listen on TCP/IP, the <b>setup</b> program prompts you for the TCP/IP port number SQL Server will listen on when accepting connections from TCP/IP sockets clients. The default is 1433, the official Internet Assigned Number Authority (IANA) socket number for Microsoft SQL Server.
</dd>
<dt>
<b>Banyan VINES</b></dt>
<dd>
SQL Server supports Banyan VINES Sequenced Packet Protocol (SPP) as the IPC method across Banyan VINES IP network protocol. Banyan VINES support for Windows NT-based clients and servers is available only for SQL Server on the Intel platform; it is not currently available on the MIPS or Alpha AXP platforms.
<p>
If you set up SQL Server to listen on Banyan VINES, the <b>setup</b> program prompts you for a StreetTalk™ PC-based service name. This has the form <i>servicename@group@org</i>, where <i>servicename</i> is the StreetTalk PC-based service name used by SQL Server, <i>group</i> is the group, and <i>org</i> is the organization. The PC-based service name used by SQL Server must first be created using the MSERVICE program included with your VINES software. Also, to start SQL Server you must be logged in with administrative privileges.

<p>
Note that before you can configure SQL Server to listen on Banyan VINES, you must install the Banyan VINES software (available from Banyan).
</dd>
<dt>
<b>AppleTalk ADSP</b></dt>
<dd>
For Intel-, MIPS-, and Alpha AXP-based computers, server-side AppleTalk® (ADSP) Net-Libraries are provided for use with Microsoft SQL Server. The server-side AppleTalk Net-Library allows Apple® Macintosh®-based clients to connect to SQL Server via native AppleTalk (as opposed to TCP/IP).
<p>
If you set up SQL Server to listen on AppleTalk, the <b>setup</b> program prompts you for the AppleTalk service object name. The AppleTalk service object name is assigned by your system administrator, who might want to use the machine name of the server for consistency. For example:

<p>
ACCOUNTING1

<p>
Note that it is not necessary to enter the AppleTalk zone, because the local zone will be used when registering the service.
</dd>
<dt>
<b>DECnet</b></dt>
<dd>
For Intel-, MIPS-, and Alpha AXP-based computers, server-side DECnet™ sockets Net-Libraries provide connectivity with PATHWORKS networks by allowing clients running on VMS™ to connect to Microsoft SQL Server via DECnet sockets.
<p>
If you set up SQL Server to listen on DECnet sockets, the <b>setup</b> program prompts you for the DECnet object ID that SQL Server will listen on when accepting connections from clients under this Net-Library.

<p>
The value of the DECnet object ID is set by your System Administrator; it should not conflict with other services on the system listening on DECnet sockets. The object ID can be either numeric or alphanumeric. To specify a numeric ID, preface it with a pound (#) sign. For example:

<p>
#150

<p>
To specify an alphanumeric value, type the ID of your choice. For example:

<p>
SQL1

<p>
For detailed information about object IDs, see your VMS documentation.
</dd>
</dl>
<p>
A server can listen on multiple Net-Libraries at one time. In addition to listening on the other server Net-Libraries you select, by default SQL Server always listens on named pipes as well. </p>
<p>
By default, SQL Server listens on the standard pipe, <b>\\.\pipe\sql\query</b>, for named pipe connections. You can change the pipe name. You can also drop named pipe support and set SQL Server to listen only on other Net-Libraries.</p>
<p>
You cannot change Net-Library configurations during an upgrade. The existing Net-Library configurations are carried over and can be modified after upgrade using SQL Setup from the Microsoft SQL Server 6.0 program group. </p>
