<p>
The following procedure explains how to install Microsoft SQL Server client software on computers running the Windows NT or Windows 95 operating systems. You can run the <b>setup</b> program from a local drive or from a network drive. Remember that while running <b>setup</b>, you can choose the Help button or press f1 to access the <b>setup</b> program's online Help.</p>
<p>
<b>Note</b>  You do not need to install SQL Server client utilities on a computer that already has the SQL Server server components installed on it, since the client utilities are automatically installed with the server components. </p>
