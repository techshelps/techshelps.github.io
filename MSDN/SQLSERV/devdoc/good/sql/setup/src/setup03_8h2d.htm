<h2><a name="_per_server_mode"></a>Per Server Mode</h2>
<p>
With Per Server licensing, each Client Access License is assigned to a particular database server and allows one client to connect to that server for data access. You must have at least as many Client Access Licenses dedicated to that server as the maximum number of client computers that are connected to that server at one time. </p>
<p>
If you select the Per Server option, during server installation you specify the number of Client Access Licenses (corresponding to the maximum number of concurrent client connections) that you have purchased for that server.</p>
<p>
<b>Note</b>  When a server reaches the maximum number of concurrent connections, Microsoft SQL Server 6.0 displays an error message and will not allow another computer to connect until at least one currently connected client disconnects.</p>
<p>
This mode of licensing is available for Microsoft SQL Server 4.21a or later. The Per Server option is often the most economical one for networks in which clients tend to connect to only one occasional-use or special-purpose server.</p>
<p>
To review the Per Server licensing agreement, see the <i>Client License Access Agreement</i> or the online Help for the Licensing application in the Control Panel.</p>
