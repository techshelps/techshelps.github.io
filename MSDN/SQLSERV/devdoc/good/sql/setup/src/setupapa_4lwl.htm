<h2><a name="_dictionary_order.2c_.case.2d.insensitive"></a>Dictionary Order, Case-insensitive</h2>
<p>
This is the default sort order. With this sort order, characters are compared according to the following rules:
<ul>
<li>
Uppercase and lowercase characters are treated as equivalent.</li>
<li>
Characters with diacritical marks are treated as different from all other characters (except their corresponding uppercase or lowercase characters).</li>
</ul>
<p>
For example:</p>
<pre>A = a
Ä = ä
Å = å
a ¹ à ¹ á ¹ â ¹ ä ¹ å
A ¹ Ä ¹ Å
Jose = jose
Jose ¹ Josè</pre>
<p>
With this sort order, characters are compared according to the following rules:
<ul>
<li>
Uppercase characters are not given sorting preference over their corresponding lowercase characters (they can appear before or after them).</li>
<li>
Uppercase characters with diacritical marks are not given sorting preference over their corresponding lowercase characters (they can appear before or after them).</li>
<li>
Characters with diacritical marks are sorted after characters without diacritical marks. </li>
<li>
Characters with diacritical marks are sorted in the order they appear in the character set.</li>
</ul>
<p>
For example:</p>
<pre>A, a, à, á, â, Ä, ä, Å, å
a, A, à, á, â, Ä, ä, Å, å
A, a, à, á, â, ä, Ä, Å, å</pre>
