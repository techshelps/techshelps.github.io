<h2><a name="_node.2d.based_client_access"></a>Node-based Client Access</h2>
<p>
<i>Node-based client access</i> permits all data access connections originating from a single client (one unique workstation and/or computer) to be counted against a single Client Access License. Both client licensing modes provide support for node-based client access. </p>
<p>
Beginning with version 6.0, Microsoft SQL Server client access software supports this model. This capability is available for both ODBC and DB-Library and allows Microsoft SQL Server 6.0 to automatically detect multiple data access connections originating from the same networked client. When this occurs, those connections are then counted against a single Client Access License. Application coding changes are not required to take advantage of this new node-based client access capability.</p>
<p>
When counting Client Access Licenses, SQL Server takes advantage of this new data access client capability whenever possible. However, there are two client configurations in which clients will be counted on a per individual connection basis:
<ul>
<li>
<b>Previous versions of client access software</b><p>
Because these clients do not support node-based data access, SQL Server cannot detect multiple connections originating from the same node. Each connection counts as one client.
</li>
<li>
<b>Non-Microsoft client access software</b><p>
Data access software from other vendors may not support node-based data access. If it does not, each connection counts as one client.
</li>
</ul>
