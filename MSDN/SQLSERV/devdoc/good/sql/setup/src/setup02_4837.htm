<p>
To install the Microsoft SQL Server 6.0 server software on a Windows NT-based computer, you need the following hardware and software:</p>

<th align=left width=79%>Your choices</th>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=21%></td>
<td width=79%></td>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=21%>Computer</td>
<td width=79%>Refer to the Windows NT Hardware Compatibility List for the processor architecture that corresponds to the SQL Server platform you are installing (Intel, Alpha AXP, or MIPS). <p>
For example, if you are installing SQL Server for the Intel platform, you can choose any of the 32-bit Intel x86-based microprocessors, such as the 80486 or the Pentium. </p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=21%>Minimum memory</td>
<td width=79%>16 MB. Additional memory is recommended.<p>
If the server will be configured to participate in data replication as either a distribution server or a combined publication/distribution server, it must have at least 32 MB of memory, with at least 16 MB assigned to SQL Server.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=21%>Disk drive space</td>
<td width=79%>For a new installation, a minimum of 60 MB of available disk space for Intel-based computers, Alpha AXP-based computers, and MIPS-based computers. If you increase the size of the MASTER device from the default, additional space is required. <p>
If you install SQL Server Books Online to run from the hard disk, another 15 MB of available disk space is required; if you install SQL Server Books Online to run from the CD, only 1 MB of additional space is needed. </p>
<p>
For an upgrade from Microsoft SQL Server 4.2, approximately 50 MB of available hard disk space is required for all processor architectures. </p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=21%>Operating system</td>
<td width=79%>Microsoft SQL Server 6.0 software must be installed on a computer running the Microsoft Windows NT Server operating system, version 3.5 or later. Version 3.51 is recommended.<p>
Microsoft SQL Workstation 6.0 software can be installed on computers running the Windows NT Server or Windows NT Workstation operating systems, version 3.5 or later. Version 3.51 is recommended. </p>
<p>
SQL Server 32-bit client software can be installed on computers running the Windows NT Server, Microsoft Windows NT Workstation, or Microsoft Windows 95 operating systems. For more information see Chapter 6, <a href="setup06_9t0u.htm">Client Installation</a>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=21%>Network software</td>
<td width=79%>SQL Server runs on the Windows NT platform using the built-in network software. Unless Banyan® VINES® or DEC™ PATHWORKS™ will be used, additional network software is not required. Full support for Novell® NetWare® clients is provided via NWLink.</td>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=21%>Network adapter</td>
<td width=79%>Any of the network adapters supported by Windows NT. (If you're running a standalone SQL Server, you do not need a network adapter.) For information about supported network adapters, see your manuals for Windows NT.</td>
</tr>
</table><br>
<p>
<b>Note</b>  Microsoft SQL Server 6.0 is not recommended for installation on a Primary Domain Controller (PDC) or a Backup Domain Controller (BDC), because those computers perform the resource-intensive tasks of maintaining and replicating the network accounts database and performing network login authentications.</p>
