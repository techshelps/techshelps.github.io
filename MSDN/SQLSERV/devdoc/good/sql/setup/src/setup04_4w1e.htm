<h2><a name="_installing_alongside_sql_server_4..2"></a>Installing Alongside SQL Server 4.2</h2>
<p>
SQL Server 6.0 and SQL Server 4.2 can be installed alongside each other on the same server. Both can be run simultaneously. SQL Server 6.0 will be treated as a new installation and will not incorporate any configuration settings from the existing SQL Server 4.2 installation.</p>
<p>
In a side-by-side installation, each SQL Server version must be installed in its own directory tree. In many cases, SQL Server 4.2 will have been installed under the \SQL root directory (the old default) and SQL Server 6.0 will be installed under the \SQL60 root directory (the new default). </p>
<p>
Since both SQL Server 4.2 and SQL Server 6.0 use the same default named pipe, either SQL Server 6.0 or SQL Server 4.2 must be configured to use an alternate named pipe. For SQL Server 4.2, an alternate named pipe can be set by editing the Windows NT Registry. For SQL Server 6.0, an alternate named pipe can be set using the <b>setup</b> program's Change Network Support option. (It is not necessary to use the Registry Editor.) Note that if you change the named pipe a server listens on, clients that will connect to the server using named pipes must also be set up to connect to that server using the new pipe name.</p>
<p>
If you will be installing any other Net-Libraries, make sure they are configured using names and parameters that do not duplicate those used by the SQL Server 4.2 installation.</p>
<h5><img src="../../../../images/wedge.gif" border=0>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To install SQL Server 6.0 alongside an existing SQL Server 4.2 installation</h5>
<ol>
<li>
From the directory containing the software compatible with your hardware platform's processor architecture, run SETUP.EXE and complete each dialog box that appears.</li>
<li>
If you are installing the software on a remote computer, when the Options dialog box appears, choose the Remote button, complete the Remote Setup dialog box, and then choose the OK button. <p>
If you are installing the software on the local computer, skip this step. 
</li>
<li>
From the Options dialog box, select the Install SQL Server and Utilities option, and then choose the Continue button.<p>
Do not select the Upgrade SQL Server option.
</li>
<li>
Follow the on-screen instructions until the installation is complete.</li>
<li>
After SQL Server 6.0 is installed and the computer has been rebooted, change the default named pipe for one of the SQL Server installations on that computer.<p>
The default named pipe that a server listens on is <b>\\.\pipe\sql\query</b>.
<ul>
<li>
For SQL Server 4.2, an alternate named pipe can be set by editing the Windows NT Registry. Change the ListenOn value for the key HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\<br>
SOFTWARE\<br>
Microsoft\<br>
SQLServer\<br>
Server</li>
<li>
For SQL Server 6.0, an alternate named pipe can be set using the <b>setup</b> program's Change Network Support option. (It is not necessary to use the Registry Editor.)</li>
</ul>
<p>
For example, you might change the version 4.2 server to use <b>\\.\pipe\sql42\query</b>, but leave the version 6.0 server with the default, <b>\\.\pipe\sql\query</b>.
</li>
<li>
As necessary, set up clients to use the alternate pipe name.<p>
Because you have changed the named pipe that one of the SQL Servers listens on, clients that will connect to that server using named pipes must be configured to connect using the new pipe name. For Windows NT-, Windows 95-, and Windows-based computers, you can set the alternate pipe name by using the Advanced window of the SQL Server Client Configuration Utility. Use different server names for the different pipes that the client connects to.
<p>
For example, you might set up clients to use <i>terrier</i> for <b>\\terrier\pipe\sql\query</b> and <i>terrier42</i> for <b>\\terrier\pipe\sql42\query</b>.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
<b>Note</b>  Utilities such as SQL Performance Monitor will connect to the server that is using the default named pipe.</p>
