<p>
During SQL Server installation, the <b>setup</b> program asks you to provide the domain, username, and password of a Windows NT user account, which it then assigns to SQL Executive. (As an option, you can select the server's LocalSystem account, but using the LocalSystem account prevents the use of several features, such as replication and running scheduled tasks involving other servers.)</p>
<p>
Before installing SQL Server, use the User Manager application (included as part of Windows NT Server) to create a user account that you will assign to SQL Executive. This account will usually be a domain user account (although it can also be a user account on the local server). This account should be reserved for use by SQL Executive (users should not use it to log on). </p>
<p>
The SQL Executive user account must belong to the Administrators local group on the SQL Server computer. In addition, it is a good idea to select the Password Never Expires option, be granted the Log On As A Service right on the SQL Server computer, and have all logon hours allowed (although this is only necessary for domain accounts, since this option does not apply to accounts on the local server). </p>
<p>
Several SQL Servers can share the same user account. In fact, when setting up replication it is a good idea for a publication server and all its subscription servers to share the same account.</p>
<p>
During SQL Server installation, if you do not know (or have not yet created) this Windows NT user account, you can complete the installation without specifying a user account. In this case, the <b>setup</b> program will install SQL Executive using the computer's LocalSystem account. Later, you can use the Services application in the Control Panel (or the Services command in Server Manager) to assign an appropriate user account to SQL Executive. Note, however, that if SQL Executive is assigned the LocalSystem account, it runs in the security context of that account and can be prevented from accomplishing many connectivity-related tasks.</p>
<p>
When upgrading from SQL Server version 4.2<i>x</i> to SQL Server 6.0, you will be prompted for user account information in the same manner as for a new SQL Server 6.0 installation.</p>
<p>
For information about creating Windows NT user accounts, granting advanced user rights, setting password expiration, and managing group memberships, see your manuals for Windows NT or the User Manager online Help. </p>
<p>
<b>Note</b>  After you have assigned a domain user account to SQL Executive, if you start SQL Executive and the server cannot for any reason access a domain controller, the logon attempt will fail and SQL Executive will not start. You can start it by running the Services application from the Control Panel (or by using the Services command from Server Manager) and assigning the LocalSystem account to SQL Executive. However, remember that if SQL Executive is assigned the LocalSystem account, it runs in the security context of that account and can be prevented from accomplishing many connectivity-related tasks.</p>
<p>
It is important that the password for the Windows NT user account not be changed or allowed to expire. If SQL Executive will not run after having been assigned a Windows NT user account, the password may have been changed or there may not be a domain controller available to validate the logon. If the password has changed, use User Manager to set a new password for that account. Use the Services application in the Control Panel to reenter the new password for the SQL Executive service.</p>
