<p>
To perform an unattended installation, run SETUP.EXE from the command line using the following syntax:</p>
<p>
<b>setup /t IniFilePath =</b> <i>filename</i></p>
<p>
where <i>filename</i> is a fully qualified filename, including the path. The path can be a local path or a redirected path to a network drive, but it cannot be a UNC path. Note that IniFilePath is case-sensitive and must be typed with the capitalization exactly as shown. There must be a space on each side of the equal sign ( = ).</p>
<p>
For example, if you have created an initialization file named MYPC.INI and have saved it on drive E: in the \SETINI directory, from the directory containing the <b>setup</b> program for the server's processor architecture (that is, Intel, MIPS, or Alpha AXP), you would type:</p>
<pre>setup /t IniFilePath = e:\setini\mypc.ini
</pre>
<p>
After installation delete the setup initialization file, since it contains the password for the SQL Executive service logon account.</p>
