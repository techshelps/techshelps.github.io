<p>
For SQL Server to communicate over the network, the Server (network) service must be running. By default, Windows NT starts its built-in Server service automatically whenever the Windows NT starts. If necessary, you can find out whether the Server service has started by typing the following command at an operating-system prompt:</p>
<p>
<b>net start</b></p>
<p>
If the Server service has been started, it will be listed in the <b>net start</b> output along with the other running services, as shown here:</p>
<pre>C:\&gt; net start
These Windows NT services are started:

   ClipBook Server
   Computer Browser
   EventLog
   Messenger
   Network DDE
   Network DDE DSDM
   Server
   Workstation

The command completed successfully.
C:\&gt;
</pre>
<p>
If the Server service has not been started, start it by typing the following command at an operating-system prompt:</p>
<p>
<b>net start server</b></p>
<p>
You'll receive the following message to indicate that the service has been started:</p>
<pre>The Server service was started successfully.</pre>
<p>
You can also use the Services application in the Control Panel to check service status and to start and stop services. For details, see your manuals for Windows NT.</p>
