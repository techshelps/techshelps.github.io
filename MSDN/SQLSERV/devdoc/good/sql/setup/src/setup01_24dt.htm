Microsoft SQL Server 6.0 (pronounced "Sequel Server") provides a powerful client/server platform for delivering critical business applications efficiently across multiple environments. Microsoft SQL Server 6.0 builds on the power, scalability, and manageability of the Microsoft Windows NT operating system by providing the reliability and advanced capabilities of high-end, client/server database management.</p>
<p>
This manual tells you how to install Microsoft SQL Server 6.0 server software and client software. It details the minimum hardware and software requirements for servers and clients, discusses the options and decisions you will encounter during an installation, takes you through installation, describes how to upgrade an existing installation, provides details about the character set and sort order choices you have during server installation, shows you how to start SQL Server, and tells you how to perform an unattended installation (an optional installation method that lets you install SQL Server 6.0 without having to respond to prompts for information).</p>
