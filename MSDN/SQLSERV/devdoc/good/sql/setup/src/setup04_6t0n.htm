<h2><a name="_before_upgrading"></a>Before Upgrading</h2>
<p>
Before you begin an upgrade:
<ul>
<li>
Back up all databases (including the <i>master</i> database) before upgrading the server.</li>
<li>
If any databases are read only, run <b>sp_dboption</b> and set the <b>read only</b> option to <b>FALSE</b>. For information on <b>sp_dboption</b>, see the <i>Microsoft SQL Server Transact-SQL Reference</i>.</li>
<li>
Run the CHKUPG.EXE utility, which checks that database status is acceptable, that all necessary comments exist in the <i>syscomments </i>system table, and that there are no keyword conflicts. CHKUPG.EXE creates a report file. Review the report and take any action the report indicates is necessary to prepare the existing installation for an upgrade.<p>
For more information, see <a href="setup04_8fp5.htm">Running the CHKUPG.EXE Utility</a> later in this chapter.
</li>
<li>
Check that there is adequate physical disk space for the upgrade. <p>
At least 50 MB of free disk space is required to upgrade from SQL Server 4.2<i>x</i> to SQL Server 6.0.
<p>
The <i>master</i> database must have at least 7 MB free, but if that much database space is not available, the <b>setup</b> program automatically alters the <i>master</i> database to increase the space allocated to it. If necessary, <b>setup</b> also increases the size of the MASTER device (as long as adequate disk space is available).
</li>
<li>
Check that no applications that could be using any of the SQL Server DLLs are running on the server you are going to upgrade. (These applications include SQL Server, SQL Monitor, and SQL Server client applications such as <b>isql</b>, SQL Administrator, and SQL Object Manager.) Also check that Microsoft® Word for Windows® and the Microsoft® Visual C++ development system are not running, and that no applications are using the Microsoft Visual C++ run-time library (MSVCRT20.DLL).<p>
In general, it is a good idea to make sure no applications are running on the server you are upgrading.
</li>
<li>
Log on to the system under a user account that has administrative privileges.</li>
</ul>
<p>
