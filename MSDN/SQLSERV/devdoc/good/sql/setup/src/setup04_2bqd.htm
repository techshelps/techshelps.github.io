<h2><a name="_installing_the_server_software"></a>Installing the Server Software</h2>
<p>
Before you start the <b>setup</b> program, you must log on to the system using a username that has administrative privileges. (This is required only when installing server components; you can install the client components using any valid username.)</p>
<p>
The SQL Server 6.0 CD contains three separate SETUP directories, one for Intel-based computers (the \I386 directory), one for MIPS-based computers (the \MIPS directory), and one for Alpha AXP-based computers (the \ALPHA directory). You must install SQL Server from the directory containing the software compatible with your hardware platform. You cannot use a different processor architecture's <b>setup</b> program to install SQL Server.</p>
<h5><img src="../../../../images/wedge.gif" border=0>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To install Microsoft SQL Server 6.0</h5>
<ol>
<li>
From the directory containing the software compatible with your hardware platform's processor architecture, run SETUP.EXE and complete each dialog box that appears.</li>
<li>
If you are installing the software on a remote computer, when the Options dialog box appears, choose the Remote button, complete the Remote Setup dialog box, and then choose the OK button. <p>
If you are installing the software on the local computer, skip this step. 
</li>
<li>
From the Options dialog box, select the Install SQL Server and Utilities option, and then choose the Continue button. </li>
<li>
Follow the on-screen instructions. You can choose the Help button or press f1 to access the <b>setup</b> program's online Help.<p>
For information about each option presented during installation, see Chapter 3, <a href="setup03_46pf.htm">Server Options</a>. 
</li>
</ol>
<p>
<b>Note</b>  When you perform a new installation on a remote computer, the <b>setup</b> program configures the remote SQL Server as if the computer has 16 MB of memory. If this default is not correct, use SQL Enterprise Manager or the <b>sp_configure</b> system procedure on the remote SQL Server to change the setting of the <b>memory</b> configuration option. For information about setting the <b>memory</b> configuration option, see the <i>Microsoft SQL Server Transact-SQL Reference</i> or the <i>Microsoft SQL Server Administrator's Companion</i>.</p>
<p>
During installation, selecting the default character set and sort order results in a rapid installation (in most cases, 5 to 10 minutes or less). Choosing an alternate character set or sort order can result in a somewhat longer installation time (but still less than 30 minutes).</p>
<p>
After the server is installed, you may need to perform several configuration tasks, such as setting server configuration parameters, setting security parameters, and registering the server and adding it to a server group. For details see  <a href="setup04_7yr6.htm">Configuring SQL Server</a>, later in this chapter. </p>
