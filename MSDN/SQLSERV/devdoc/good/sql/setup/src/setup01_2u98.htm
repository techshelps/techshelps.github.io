<h1><a name="_how_to_use_this_manual"></a>How to Use This Manual</h1>
<p>
This manual is written for those who will install and upgrade Microsoft SQL Server 6.0 servers and clients. It assumes a working familiarity with database software and concepts, operating systems, network software and protocols, and microcomputer hardware.</p>
<p>
Chapter 1, "Introduction," provides a brief overview of the Microsoft SQL Server 6.0 product and this manual.</p>
<p>
Chapter 2,  <a href="setup02_7s6r.htm">Server Requirements</a>, lists the minimum requirements (hardware, software, file system, and so on) necessary for a SQL Server installation.</p>
<p>
Chapter 3,  <a href="setup03_46pf.htm">Server Options</a>, explains the options presented by the <b>setup</b> program during a server installation. It is important that you understand these choices before you begin installing the server components.</p>
<p>
Chapter 4,  <a href="setup04_8dri.htm">Server Installation</a>, explains how to install Microsoft SQL Server 6.0 server software components on computers running the Windows NT operating system. It also describes how to upgrade existing server installations or remove existing server installations.</p>
<p>
Chapter 5,  <a href="setup05_8qlu.htm">Starting the Server</a>, tells you how to start, pause, continue, and stop SQL Server. It also tells you how to start and stop SQL Executive.</p>
<p>
Chapter 6,  <a href="setup06_9t0u.htm">Client Installation</a>, presents client preinstallation requirements and tells you how to install Microsoft SQL Server client components on computers running the Windows NT, Windows, and MS-DOS operating systems. It also describes how to upgrade existing client installations.</p>
<p>
Chapter 7,  <a href="setup07_2s4n.htm">Installation Troubleshooting</a>, provides information that you will find helpful if you are unable to install SQL Server successfully. (If you are unable to correct your problem after following the instructions in this chapter, or if you are unable to connect to SQL Server after it is installed, see the <i>Microsoft SQL Server Administrator's Companion</i>, or contact your primary support provider.)</p>
<p>
Appendix A,  <a href="setupapa_0rxd.htm">Character Sets and Sort Orders</a>, details the character sets and sort orders you choose from during an installation. These determine the types of characters that SQL Server recognizes in your database data, the order in which SQL Server sorts data in response to queries, and the results that SQL Server returns for queries that involve character comparisons. </p>
<p>
Appendix B,  <a href="setupapb_48ki.htm">Unattended Installation</a>, tells you how to perform an unattended installation, which allows you to install SQL Server 6.0 without having to respond to prompts for information from the <b>setup</b> program.</p>
