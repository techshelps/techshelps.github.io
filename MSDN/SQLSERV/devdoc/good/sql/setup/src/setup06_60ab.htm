<p>
For Windows- and Windows for Workgroups-based clients, the default SQL Server root directory is C:\SQL60, although during installation you can specify a different directory. The only directory created under the root is C:\SQL60\BIN, which contains Windows-based client executable files and Windows dynamic-link library (DLL) files. A named pipe Net-Library is placed in the \WINDOWS\SYSTEM directory.</p>
<p>
During installation, this <b>setup</b> program creates the SQL Server Tools program group and installs ISQL/w and the SQL Client Configuration Utility. </p>
<p>
During installation, choose one of the following as the default Net-Library:
<ul>
<li>
Named Pipes</li>
<li>
Novell SPX</li>
<li>
Banyan VINES</li>
<li>
TCP/IP Sockets</li>
<li>
Multi-Protocol</li>
</ul>
<p>
After installation, you can use the SQL Client Configuration Utility to configure the client to use other Net-Libraries. For information on these Net-Libraries, see the <i>Microsoft SQL Server Administrator's Companion</i>.</p>
<p>
During 16-bit client software installation on Windows-based clients, the <b>setup</b> program gives you the option of installing SQL Server Books Online on the client's hard disk. This option adds the SQL Server Books Online icon to the Microsoft SQL Server Tools program group. By choosing this icon, you can view SQL Server documentation online.</p>
