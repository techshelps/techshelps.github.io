<h1><a name="_procedure_invocation_limitations_odbc05"></a>Procedure Invocation Limitations</h1>
<p>
For maximum interoperability, procedures should be invoked using the ODBC <b>{call </b><i>procedure</i><b>}</b> extension to the SQL language. If you prepare a procedure without using the <b>{call}</b> syntax, use the EXECUTE in front of each stored procedure. This is because the SQL&nbsp;Server driver surrounds a statement it is preparing with other SQL statements. Thus, the statement being prepared is no longer the first in the batch.</p>
<p>
With the SQL&nbsp;Server driver, there is no advantage to preparing a statement that invokes a procedure (instead of executing it directly). When the Generate Stored Procedures for Prepared Statements option is selected, the SQL&nbsp;Server driver prepares a statement by placing it in a procedure and compiling that procedure. Preparing a statement by placing it in a procedure and compiling it can be disabled, however. To ensure that stored procedures are never used to implement <b>SQLPrepare</b>, clear the Generate Stored Procedures check box in the SQL&nbsp;Server Setup dialog box, or set the SQL_USE_PROCEDURE_FOR_PREPARE option in <b>SQLSetConnectOption</b> to SQL_UP_OFF. This ensures that a prepared statement will be stored and executed at run time. Then stored procedures will not be used to implement <b>SQLPrepare</b>. In addition, all syntax error checking will be delayed until execution time. </p>
<p>
When a SET NOCOUNT ON statement is executed, multiple statements embedded in a stored procedure do not create multiple results as they should. The driver ignores row counts that are generated by SQL statements inside of a stored procedure.</p>
