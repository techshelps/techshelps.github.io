<p>
The driver creates temporary stored procedures (as opposed to regular stored procedures in earlier versions) on a <b>SQLPrepare</b>. These procedures are automatically deleted when the connection is abnormally terminated. Previously, stored procedures created on a <b>SQLPrepare</b> were orphaned at the server when the connection was abnormally terminated. In addition, the driver provides users with a driver-specific connection option (SQL_USE_PROCEDURE_FOR_PREPARE) that governs when these temporary stored procedures are deleted. By default, they are deleted when the connection is freed. When you are issuing several prepare/execute statements in a connection and need to conserve usage of <i>tempDB</i>, you can have the driver delete these procedures when an <i>hstmt</i> is closed.</p>
