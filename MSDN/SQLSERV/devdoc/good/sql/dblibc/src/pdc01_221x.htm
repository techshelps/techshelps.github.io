<h2><a name="_net_library_architecture"></a>Net-Library Architecture</h2>
<p>
Microsoft SQL Server Net-Library architecture for client/server applications is based on the Net-Library concept that abstracts the client and server applications from the underlying network protocols being used.</p>
<p>
Tabular Data Stream (TDS) is the data stream protocol used by Microsoft SQL Server to transfer requests and responses between the client and the server. TDS is a logical data stream protocol and must be supported by a physical network interprocess communication mechanism (IPC). The Net-Library architecture provides a method of sending TDS across a physical network connection, and it provides a transparent interface to DB-Library for C.</p>
