<p>
Microsoft SQL Server is a powerful structured query language (SQL) database server. With local area network (LAN) software, SQL Server allows clients running the Windows NT, Windows, Windows 95, or MS-DOS operating-systems to access its services. Developers can write applications for SQL Server by programming with DB-Library for C, the C-language version of the communication library for SQL Server or with DB-Library for Visual Basic, the Visual Basic version of the communication library for SQL Server. For more information about DB-Library for Visual Basic, see <i>Microsoft SQL Server Programming DB-Library for Visual Basic</i>. </p>
<p>
DB-Library for C is an application programming interface (API) that consists of C functions and macros that allow an application to interact with SQL Server. Included are functions that send Transact-SQL statements to SQL Server and functions that process the results of those statements. Other functions handle errors and convert data.</p>
<p>
DB-Library for C offers a rich set of functions for:
<ul>
<li>
Opening connections.</li>
<li>
Formatting queries.</li>
<li>
Sending query batches to the server and retrieving the resulting data.</li>
<li>
Using scrollable cursors.</li>
<li>
Bulk-copying data from files or program variables to and from the server.</li>
<li>
Controlling two-phase commit operations between several participating SQL Servers.</li>
<li>
Executing stored procedures or remote stored procedures.</li>
</ul>
<p>
These functions allow the application developer extremely fine-grained control of data flow back and forth between the client and the server. DB-Library supports multiple environments. C programmers can choose from among:
<ul>
<li>
A multithreaded dynamic-link library (DLL) for the Windows NT operating system</li>
<li>
Medium and large model static-link libraries for MS-DOS for both Microsoft and Borland® compilers</li>
<li>
A DLL for the Windows operating system</li>
</ul>
