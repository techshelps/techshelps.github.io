<h1><a name="_dbcount"></a>dbcount</h1>
<p>
Returns the number of rows affected by a Transact-SQL statement.</p>
<h4>Syntax</h4>
<p>
<b>DBINT dbcount ( PDBPROCESS </b><i>dbproc</i><b> );</b></p>
<p>
where
<dl>
<dt>
<i>dbproc</i></dt>
<dd>
Is the DBPROCESS structure that is the handle for a particular workstation/ SQL Server process. It contains all the information that DB-Library uses to manage communications and data between the workstation and SQL Server.
</dd>
</dl>
<h4>Returns</h4>
<p>
The number of rows affected by the current statement. Call <b>dbiscount</b> to determine if this count is correct.</p>
<h4>Remarks</h4>
<p>
Once the results of a statement have been processed, you can call <b>dbcount</b> to find out how many rows were affected by the statement. For example, if a SELECT statement was sent to SQL Server and you have read all the rows by calling <b>dbnextrow </b>until it returned NO_MORE_ROWS, you can call DBCOUNT to find out how many rows were retrieved.</p>
<p>
If the current statement doesn't immediately return rows (for example, a DELETE statement), you can call <b>dbcount</b> after <b>dbresults</b>.</p>
<p>
If the current statement executes a stored procedure, for example an EXEC or a call to a remote stored procedure, <b>dbcount</b> reports the number of rows returned by the last SELECT statement executed by the stored procedure. Note that a stored procedure without a SELECT statement can execute a SELECT anyway simply by calling another stored procedure with a SELECT.</p>
