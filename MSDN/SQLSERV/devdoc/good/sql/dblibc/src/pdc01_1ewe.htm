<h1><a name="_db_library_and_net_library_interaction"></a>DB-Library for C and Net-Library Interaction</h1>
<p>
When a call is made to open a connection to SQL Server (<b>dbopen</b>), DB-Library determines which client-side Net-Library should be loaded to communicate with SQL Server. </p>
<p>
Net-Libraries are linked dynamically at run time. With the Windows, Windows 95, and Windows NT operating systems, Net-Libraries are implemented as dynamic-link libraries (DLLs), and multiple Net-Libraries can be loaded simultaneously. With the MS-DOS operating system, Net-Libraries are implemented as terminate-and-stay-resident (TSR), and only one can be loaded at any given time.</p>
