<h1><a name="_dbwinexit"></a>dbwinexit (Windows only)</h1>
<p>
Informs DB-Library that the Windows application is about to exit.</p>
<h4>Syntax</h4>
<p>
<b>void dbwinexit ( void );</b></p>
<h4>Remarks</h4>
<p>
DB-Library for Windows maintains information about each application that has referenced it. DB-Library creates the information when a library application calls <b>dbinit</b>; it does this to prevent conflicts between applications that use DB-Library concurrently. In order for DB-Library to release this information, the application must call <b>dbwinexit</b> just before it exits. You should put the call to <b>dbwinexit</b> within the message handling code for the WM_DESTROY message. For example:</p>
<pre>case WM_DESTROY:
    dbwinexit();
    break;
</pre>
<p>
This call releases the memory DB-Library allocated to keep track of this application and makes that memory available to other applications. </p>
<p>
<b>Important</b>  Once your application has called <b>dbwinexit</b>, it cannot call any other DB-Library function. If you have called <b>dbwinexit</b> and then need to issue one or more DB-Library calls, you must call <b>dbinit</b> again to re-register your application.</p>
