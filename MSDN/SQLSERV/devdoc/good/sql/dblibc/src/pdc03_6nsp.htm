<p>
In MS-DOS, before you can communicate with SQL Server, you must load a Net-Library terminate-and-stay-resident utility (TSR). The most common Net-Library, used for accessing SQL Server over named pipes protocols is DBNMPIPE. To load and execute the named pipes Net-Library TSR just before you run your SQL Server application, type the following:</p>
<p>
dbnmpipe</p>
<p>
If the directory in which the TSR resides is not named in your PATH variable, you must type in the exact path to the TSR.</p>
<p>
Whether you load the TSR through AUTOEXEC.BAT or from the command line, you can unload it and recover the memory that it uses with the ENDDBLIB.EXE program. To do this, type:</p>
<p>
enddblib</p>
<p>
This program checks to make sure that the Net-Library TSR is loaded and then unloads it. If the Net-Library was not the last TSR loaded, the program does not unload it properly, causing unpredictable problems. ENDDBLIB will ask if you want to remove it anyway. You can suppress prompting and force ENDDBLIB to unload the TSR by using the <b>/q</b> (quiet) command line switch as follows:</p>
<p>
enddblib /q</p>
<p>
<b>Caution</b>  Do not unload a TSR if it was <i>not</i> the last one loaded.</p>
