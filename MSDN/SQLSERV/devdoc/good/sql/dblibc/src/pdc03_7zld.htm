<h2><a name="_include_files_pdc03_1"></a>Include Files</h2>
<p>
You can append the path to the INCLUDE environment variable to include the directory where the DB-Library SQLFRONT.H and SQLDB.H include files reside. Or you can use the <b>/I</b> compile line switch to point to the include file directory.</p>
<p>
Because your Win32-based applications must always include the WINDOWS.H, SQLFRONT.H, and SQLDB.H files, you don't need to define the DB-Library functions you use. These functions and their proper declarations are already defined in the include file. However, you must define an application's operating system before including the DB-Library include files. Include the following statements at the beginning of all DB-Library applications designed for the Win32 API:</p>
<p>
#define DBNTWIN32<br>
#include &lt;windows.h&gt;<br>
#include &lt;sqlfront.h&gt;<br>
#include &lt;sqldb.h&gt;</p>
<p>
You can also define the operating system by using the <b>/D</b> compile line switch (for example, <b>/DDBNTWIN32 </b>instead of a <b>#define</b> declaration).</p>
