<p>
DB-Library functions communicate with SQL Server through the DBPROCESS structure. The <b>dbopen</b> function allocates and initializes a DBPROCESS when it logs on to SQL Server. DBPROCESS serves as the connection between the application and SQL Server. Most DB-Library functions require DBPROCESS as the first parameter. An application can have more than one DBPROCESS if, for instance, it needs to update a database while still processing the results of a previous query. Each DBPROCESS is completely independent of any other.</p>
<p>
Another structure, LOGINREC, allocated by <b>dblogin</b>, is the login record that contains information the <b>dbopen</b> function uses to log on to SQL Server. It contains typical login information, such as the username and password. This information is also specified through DB-Library for C functions.</p>
<p>
<b>Note</b>  With the Windows NT and Windows 95 operating systems, each connection is a separate execution thread that is spawned when the connection to SQL Server is established with <b>dbopen</b> and terminated when the connection is closed using <b>dbclose</b>.</p>
