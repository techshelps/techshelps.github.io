<h3><a name="_adapting_the_gateway_resources_dll"></a>Adapting the Gateway Resources DLL</h3>
<p>
The sample resources DLL consists of four files:
<ul>
<li>
SAMP.RC, which encodes the language-independent features of the gateway and data source. Except where noted, the customization values described below are found in this file. In almost every case, these values correspond to attributes set or returned by the ODBC API. See the comments in this file for additional descriptions of individual values.</li>
<li>
LOCAL.RC, which includes the localizable strings used by the Open Data Services ODBC driver. If the customized Open Data Services ODBC driver is offered in multiple languages, only this file should need to change between languages.</li>
<li>
LIBMAIN.C, which is the shell program for the resources DLL. This should not be changed.</li>
<li>
ODSRC.H, which is the header file used by both the Open Data Services ODBC driver and the gateway resources DLL. This should not be changed.</li>
</ul>
