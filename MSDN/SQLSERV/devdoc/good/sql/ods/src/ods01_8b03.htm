Open Data Services accepts connections from all DB-Library - based client applications, regardless of the operating system on which the client application is running. Support for DB-Library client functions is an integral component of Open Data Services. Open Data Services also accepts connections from client applications that adhere to the Open Database Connectivity (ODBC) client API. Support for ODBC clients is available via an Open Data Services gateway driver for ODBC. You can customize the Open Data Services gateway driver for ODBC clients for your Open Data Services gateway applications. For information, see <a href="odse_08qb.htm">ODBC Drivers for SQL Server and Open Data Services</a>. </p>
<p>
With support for Windows NT - based installable networks, Open Data Services accepts connections from clients on any network protocol for which an installable network driver, known as a <i>Net-Library</i>, is provided. Open Data Services can listen for connection requests (from clients and from servers) on multiple network protocols simultaneously. </p>
