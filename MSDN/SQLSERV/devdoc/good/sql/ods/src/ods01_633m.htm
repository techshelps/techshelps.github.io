<p>
Another common application requirement is to execute an external command or executable file when the value of a field in a particular table reaches a certain level. An inventory application, for example, might reorder stock when the quantity on hand falls below a certain reorder point. The reordering process could involve an existing mainframe or minicomputer application instead of being entirely implemented on SQL Server. </p>
<p>
With Open Data Services, you can put a trigger on the table in question. The trigger compares the quantity on hand with the reorder point. When the quantity on hand falls below the reorder point, the trigger issues a remote stored procedure call to an Open Data Services server application, passing it the part number as a parameter. The remote stored procedure event handler then automatically executes the mainframe or minicomputer transaction that you have defined in your application, using the part number as an input parameter.</p>

<p>
The PROCSRV sample application provides a way to handle this type of SQL Server extension without any C programming. SQL Server can issue a remote stored procedure call to the PROCSRV <b>sp_exec</b> procedure. SQL Server passes the name of a command file or executable file on that server, along with any required input parameters. The <b>sp_exec</b> procedure automatically starts the requested command or executable file in response to the remote stored procedure event. SQL Server includes a similar extended stored procedure called <b>xp_cmdshell</b>.</p>
<p>
Using this procedure, a SQL Server installation can draw on a set of simple command or executable files in any language to perform functions that are external to the SQL Server environment.</p>
