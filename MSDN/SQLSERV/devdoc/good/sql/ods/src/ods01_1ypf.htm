<h1><a name="_server_connections"></a>Server Connections</h1>
<p>
Open Data Services server applications and SQL Server database servers communicate on the network using <i>remote stored procedures</i>. As with server-to-server communication between two SQL Server database servers, a remote stored procedure call establishes a network session between the two servers. The servers can communicate over any network protocol for which an installable Net-Library is provided, such as named pipes or sockets. When the Open Data Services server application is located on the same computer as SQL Server, a session is established in the same way, but, in the case of named pipes connections, communication takes place over a local named pipe.</p>
