<p>
Of the remaining event types, two are based on client activities and the rest are based on Open Data Services server activities:
<ul>
<li>
Client requests can generate an <i>attention event</i> and a <i>disconnect event</i>, allowing you to provide an attention event handler and a disconnect event handler that act on the status of the client connection.</li>
<li>
The Open Data Services server can generate a <i>start event</i>, a <i>stop event</i>, a <i>sleep</i> <i>event</i>, a <i>restart event</i>, or an <i>exit event</i>, allowing you to provide event handlers that act on the status of the Open Data Services server and your application.</li>
</ul>
<p>
For a complete list of all Open Data Services events, see <a href="odsb_8qib.htm">Events and Event Types</a>. </p>
<p>
Because SQL Server itself handles the main event, extended stored procedures can include pre- and post-event handlers. Pre- and post-event handler functions are defined the same as standard event handler functions. First the pre-handler is called, then SQL Server handles the main event, then the post-handler is called. For more information about pre- and post-event handlers, see <b>srv_pre_handle</b> and <b>srv_post_handle</b>.</p>
