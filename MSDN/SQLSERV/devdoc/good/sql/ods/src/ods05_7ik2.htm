<h2><a name="_installing_on_the_same_computer_as_sql.a0.server"></a>Installing on the Same Computer as SQL Server</h2>
<p>
To install an Open Data Services server application on the same computer as SQL Server, copy the application to a directory and include that directory in your path. For example, if you plan to use the sample applications, you could copy the files PROCSRV.EXE and GATEWAY.EXE to \SQL60\BINN.</p>
<p>
When two server processes, such as SQL Server and Open Data Services, share a single computer, they cannot use the same process identifier to listen for connection requests. If your network uses named pipes or sockets, you must assign a unique process identifier to each of them. In addition, you must add the alternate connection information to any computer that needs direct access to that server process. For more information, see <a href="ods06_5qpf.htm">Network Setup Options for Open Data Services Server Applications</a>. </p>
