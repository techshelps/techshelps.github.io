<h2><a name="_extended_stored_procedures"></a>Extended Stored Procedures</h2>
<p>
Open Data Services server applications can be integrated as a set of extended stored procedures as part of SQL Server. Extended stored procedures provide a way to extend SQL Server via the Open Data Services API, without providing a separate Open Data Services server application.</p>
<p>
Instead of running your application as a separate Open Data Services server application that uses the ODS Library as a base, you can include your application's dynamic-link library (DLL) file with the standard SQL Server DLL files and use SQL Server as a base. Each function within the DLL file can then be called as if it were a standard SQL Server stored procedure. </p>

<p>
The XP.DLL sample application provides a set of extended stored procedures.</p>
