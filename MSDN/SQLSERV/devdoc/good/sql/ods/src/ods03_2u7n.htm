<h2><a name="_threads"></a>Threads</h2>
<p>
The Win32 API supports 32-bit linear memory, greatly increasing the number of threads that an application can create per process.</p>
<p>
Open Data Services uses a thread management technique called <i>thread pooling </i>to make threads available to active client connections faster in environments that support a large number of users. As soon as a thread completes a single request, it becomes available to the thread pool. Open Data Services manages thread processing transparently. However, you can increase or decrease the total number of active threads available to your application. </p>
<p>
For more information about threads, refer to the <b>srv_config</b> function description in <a href="ods04a_278z.htm">Functions and Macros</a>. </p>
