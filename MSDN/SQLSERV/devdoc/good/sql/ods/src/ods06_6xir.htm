<h1><a name="_configuration_guidelines"></a>Configuration Guidelines</h1>
<p>
Explicit configuration of one or more computers is required in order to enable access to an Open Data Services server application in all of the following cases:
<ul>
<li>
When an Open Data Services server application shares a single computer with SQL Server, you must assign an alternate process identifier to either the Open Data Services server application or to SQL Server. Then appropriately configure any computer that requires direct access to that alternate process identifier.</li>
<li>
For SQL Server to communicate with an Open Data Services server application (sending remote stored procedure calls to an Open Data Services remote server) you must perform SQL Server administrative tasks (such as <b>sp_addserver</b>) to identify the Open Data Services server application as a remote server. You must also add client connection information to the computer on which SQL Server is installed (unless the Open Data Services server application is using a default process identifier).</li>
<li>
For DB-Library clients or SQL Servers to access multiple instances of an Open Data Services server application that is installed on a single computer, each instance must use a different process identifier. The configuration requirements are the same as when SQL Server and Open Data Services share the same computer.</li>
</ul>
