<h1><a name="_client_access_to_an_open_data_services_server.a0.application"></a>Client Access to an Open Data Services Server Application</h1>
<p>
SQL Server database clients can access an Open Data Services server application remotely or directly, as follows:
<ul>
<li>
Clients can access the Open Data Services server application remotely, via the SQL Server remote stored procedure facility.<p>
To enable this type of access, you must configure SQL Server as described in <a href="ods06_0vce.htm">Server Access to an Open Data Services Server Application</a>. You do not need to make any configuration changes to the client computers. 
<p>
Clients can then make remote stored procedure calls to the Open Data Services server application as if it were a remote SQL Server. This can include the use of the Open Data Services <b>sp_sqlexec</b> remote stored procedure, which allows the use of remote stored procedures as a vehicle for sending language queries.
</li>
<li>
Clients can access the Open Data Services server application directly, via a direct connection to the Open Data Services server application.<p>
To enable this type of access, no special configuration is required if the Open Data Services server application is on a network type that supports address resolution at connect time (such as named pipes) and uses the default process identifier. Otherwise, you must use the SQL Client Configuration Utility to configure the client to connect to the node and process identifiers used by the Open Data Services server application.
<p>
The client can connect to the Open Data Services server application and send language queries or stored procedure calls in exactly the same way the client would connect to and communicate with a SQL Server on the network.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
For some custom applications, clients can access SQL Server indirectly via Open Data Services. The Open Data Services server application implements a pass-though server function that directs client requests to SQL Server. For an example of a pass-through server application, see the GATEWAY sample application. </p>
<p>
The network configuration requirements for a pass-through server are somewhat different from the other types of configurations discussed in this chapter. Clients must have a direct connection to the Open Data Services server application and not to SQL Server. The Open Data Services server application must be configured to connect to SQL Server as a client of SQL Server.</p>
<p>
For Open Data Services server application functions that are installed on SQL Server as extended stored procedures, there are no special configuration issues. Clients use these functions by making standard stored procedure calls to SQL Server. For more information, see <a href="ods07_6fcj.htm">Sample Application-Extended Stored Procedures</a>. </p>
