<h2><a name="_connect_events"></a>Connect Events</h2>
<p>
When a client requests a connection, Open Data Services establishes the connection and accepts login information from the client. It then generates a connect event that calls a connect event handler in the Open Data Services server application, if one is available, allowing the Open Data Services server application to perform additional functions as part of the client connection process. Because the client cannot execute any further requests until the connect event is complete, you can use a connect event handler to perform a set of operations before the client has connected (for example, to validate client logins).</p>
