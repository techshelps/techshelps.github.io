<h2><a name="_event_processing_example"></a>Connect Event Example</h2>
<p>
The following steps describe an Open Data Services connect event from its initiation, including the functions performed by the ODS Library and the functions performed by the Open Data Services server application:
<ol>
<li>
The client application calls the DB-Library function <b>dbopen</b>. The <b>dbopen</b> function sends parameters to the client's network layer. The client's network layer sends the connection information to the LAN.</li>
<li>
The Open Data Services network layer receives the client connection information. It creates and allocates an SRV_PROC structure containing the connection information and issues a connect event to the ODS Library.</li>
<li>
The ODS Library calls the connect event handler provided in the Open Data Services server application, as shown in the following illustration:<p>

</li>
<li>
The connect event handler provides whatever additional processing it defines.<p>
For example, if the Open Data Services server application provides a gateway, the connect event handler might respond to this event by establishing a connection to a remote database management system.
</li>
<li>
The connect event handler returns connection information to the client, as shown in the following illustration:<p>
<img src="images/odsug5.gif" border=0>
</li>
</ol>
<p>
This completes the processing for the connect event. At this point, the client is logged in. Open Data Services waits for additional requests from the client, at which point the ODS Library generates another event and calls the appropriate event handler.</p>
