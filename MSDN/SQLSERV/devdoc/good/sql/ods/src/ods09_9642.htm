<p>
The GATEWAY sample application provides an Open Data Services server application that serves as a gateway from the SQL Server environment to an alternate data source. </p>
<p>
For purposes of illustration, the GATEWAY sample application connects to SQL Server as an alternate data source. It accesses the alternate data source by using the standard interface to that data source (in this case, the DB-Library client interface to SQL Server), and returns results to the caller.</p>
<p>
The GATEWAY sample also serves to demonstrate a "pass-through" application. Pass-through applications can be used for auditing or security purposes, since they allow the Open Data Services server application to intercept and examine all requests before the Open Data Services server application sends the request on to SQL Server.</p>
<p>
The programming examples earlier in this book use segments from the GATEWAY sample application code to illustrate how to implement event handlers. For more information about this application, see <a href="ods03_5ip3.htm">Open Data Services Programming</a>. </p>
<p>
For the most current version of the sample code, refer to the version that shipped with your package.</p>
