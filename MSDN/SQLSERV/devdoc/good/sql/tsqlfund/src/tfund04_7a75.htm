<h3><a name="_choosing_all_columns.3a_.select_.2a"></a>Choosing All Columns: SELECT *</h3>
<p>
The asterisk (*) has a special meaning in SELECT statements. It represents all column names in all tables specified in the FROM clause. This is the syntax for selecting all columns in a table:</p>
<p>
SELECT <b>*</b> <br>
FROM <i>table_name</i></p>
<p>
Because SELECT * finds all columns currently in a table, changes in the structure of a table (adding, removing, or renaming columns) automatically modify the results of a SELECT * statement. Listing columns individually allows more precise control over the results. Whenever * is used, the columns in the results are displayed in the order in which they were created by the CREATE TABLE statement. </p>
<p>
It is usually preferable to explicitly name the columns in the select list. Because an application often relies on knowing certain columns will be returned, using SELECT * might "break" an application if a new column is added to the table.</p>
<p>
The following statement retrieves all columns in the <i>publishers</i> table and displays them in the order in which they were defined when the <i>publishers</i> table was created. Because no WHERE clause is included, this statement also retrieves every row.</p>
<pre>SELECT *
FROM publishers
</pre>
<p>
The results look like this:</p>
<pre>pub_id pub_name                  city           state country

You get exactly the same results by listing all the column names in the table in order after the SELECT statement:</p>
<pre>SELECT pub_id, pub_name, city, state
FROM publishers
</pre>
