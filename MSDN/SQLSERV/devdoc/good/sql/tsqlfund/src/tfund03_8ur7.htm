<p>
You can submit SQL statements to SQL Server one at a time, entering statements and receiving results interactively. Or you can submit multiple SQL statements as a batch, interactively or in a file.</p>
<p>
A batch of SQL statements is terminated by an end-of-batch signal that instructs SQL Server to go ahead and execute the statements. The end-of-batch signal used here¾for the stand-alone <b>isql </b>utility¾ is the GO statement on a line by itself.</p>
<p>
Technically speaking, a single SQL statement can constitute a batch, but it is more common to think of a batch as containing multiple SQL statements. Frequently, a batch of statements is written to a file before being submitted to <b>isql</b>. The file can contain multiple batches, each separated by the GO statement.</p>
<p>
For details on batches, see <a href="../../tsqlref/src/tsql01_9i9f.htm">Batches</a> in the <i>Microsoft SQL Server Transact-SQL Reference</i>.</p>
