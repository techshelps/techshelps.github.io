<h3><a name="_datediff"></a>DATEDIFF</h3>
<p>
The DATEDIFF function calculates the amount of time in date parts between the second and first of two dates you specify ¾ in other words, it finds an interval between two dates. The result is a signed integer value equal to <i>date2 - date1</i> in date parts.</p>
<p>
This query uses the date November 30, 1995, and finds the number of days that elapsed between <i>pubdate</i> and that date:</p>
<pre>SELECT DATEDIFF(day, pubdate, 'Nov 30 1995')
FROM titles
</pre>
<p>
For the rows in titles having a <i>pubdate</i> of October 21, 1995, the result produced by the previous query is 40. (There are 40 days between October 21 and November 30.) To calculate an interval in months, type:</p>
<pre>SELECT interval = DATEDIFF(month, pubdate, 'Nov 30 1995')
FROM titles
</pre>
<p>
This query produces a value of 1 for the rows with a <i>pubdate</i> in October and a value of 5 for the rows with a <i>pubdate</i> in June.</p>
<p>
When the first date in the DATEDIFF function is later than the second date specified, the resulting value is negative. Since two of the rows in <i>titles</i> have values for <i>pubdate</i> that are assigned using the GETDATE function as a default, these values are set to the date that your <i>pubs</i> database was created and return negative values in the two preceding queries.</p>
<p>
If one or both of the date arguments is a <i>smalldatetime</i> value, they are converted to <i>datetime</i> values internally for the calculation. Seconds and milliseconds in <i>smalldatetime</i> values are automatically set to 0 for the purpose of calculation.</p>
