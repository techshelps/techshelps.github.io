<h3><a name="_equijoins_and_natural_joins"></a>Equijoins and Natural Joins</h3>
<p>
An <i>equijoin</i> is a join in which the values in the columns being joined are compared for equality, and all columns in the tables being joined are included in the results.</p>
<p>
The following query is an example of an equijoin:</p>
<pre>SELECT *
FROM authors, publishers
WHERE authors.city = publishers.city
</pre>
<p>
In the results of this statement, the <i>city</i> column appears twice. Since there's usually no point in repeating the same information, one of these two identical columns can be eliminated by restating the query. The result is called a <i>natural join</i>. You can restate the preceding query to form a natural join, as follows:</p>
<pre>SELECT publishers.pub_id, publishers.pub_name,
    publishers.state, authors.*
FROM publishers, authors
WHERE publishers.city = authors.city
</pre>
<p>
In this example, <i>publishers.city</i> does not appear in the results.</p>
