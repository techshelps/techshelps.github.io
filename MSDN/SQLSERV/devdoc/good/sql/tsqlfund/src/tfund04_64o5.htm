<h3><a name="_logical_operator_precedence"></a>Logical Operator Precedence</h3>
<p>
When more than one logical operator is used in a statement, NOT is evaluated first, then AND, and finally OR. Arithmetic (and bitwise) operators are handled before logical operators.</p>
<p>
For example, the following query finds all business books in the <i>titles</i> table, no matter what their advances are, as well as all psychology books that have an advance greater than $5500:</p>
<pre>SELECT title_id, type, advance
FROM titles
WHERE type = 'business' OR type = 'psychology'
    AND advance &gt; $5500

title_id type         advance                    
-------- ------------ -------------------------- 
BU1032   business     5,000.00                   
BU1111   business     5,000.00                   
BU2075   business     10,125.00                  
BU7832   business     5,000.00                   
PS1372   psychology   7,000.00                   
PS2106   psychology   6,000.00

</pre>
<p>
In this example, the advance condition pertains to psychology books and not to business books because AND has precedence over OR.</p>
<p>
You can change the meaning of the query by adding parentheses to force evaluation of the OR first. This query finds all business and psychology books that have advances over $5500:</p>
<pre>SELECT title_id, type, advance
FROM titles
WHERE (type = 'business' OR type = 'psychology')
    AND advance &gt; $5500

title_id     type                       advance      
------------ -------------------------- ----------- 
business     6,281.25                   30788       
mod_cook     7,500.00                   24278       
popular_comp 7,500.00                   12875       
psychology   4,255.00                   9939        
trad_cook    6,333.33                   19566       
UNDECIDED    (null)                     (null)

<p>
The use of parentheses, even when not required, can improve readability of queries and reduce the chance of making a subtle mistake because of operator precedence. There is no significant performance penalty in using parentheses. </p>
