<p>
Examples of statements using EXISTS and their equivalent alternatives follow. You've seen some of them before.</p>
<p>
Here are two ways to find authors who live in the same city as a publisher:</p>
<pre><b>A.</b>    SELECT au_lname, au_fname
    FROM authors
    WHERE city =ANY
        (SELECT city
        FROM publishers)

<b>B.</b>    SELECT au_lname, au_fname
    FROM authors
    WHERE exists
        (SELECT *
        FROM publishers
        WHERE authors.city = publishers.city)

    au_lname            au_fname
    --------            --------
    Carson            Cheryl
    Bennet            Abraham

</pre>
<p>
The two queries find titles of books published by any publisher located in a city that begins with the letter B:</p>
<pre><b>C.</b>    SELECT title
    FROM titles
    WHERE pub_id IN
        (SELECT pub_id
        FROM publishers
        WHERE city LIKE 'B%')

<b>D.</b>    SELECT title
    FROM titles
    WHERE EXISTS
        (SELECT *
        FROM publishers
        WHERE pub_id = titles.pub_id
            AND city LIKE 'B%')
