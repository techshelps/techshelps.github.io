<h2><a name="_monitoring_transaction_states"></a>Monitoring Transaction States</h2>
<p>
Transaction states are represented by the following icons in the Large Icon view of the MS DTC Transactions window:</p>
<p>
<img src="images/open.gif" border=0></p>

<h4><a name="_active"></a>Active</h4>
<p>
The transaction has been started.</p>
<p>
<img src="images/aborting.gif" border=0></p>

<h4><a name="_aborting"></a>Aborting</h4>
<p>
The transaction is aborting. The commit coordinator is notifying all participants that the transaction must abort.</p>
<p>
It is not possible to change the transaction outcome at this point.</p>
<p>
<img src="images/aborted.gif" border=0></p>

<h4><a name="_aborted"></a>Aborted</h4>
<p>
The transaction has aborted. All participants have been notified or are currently inaccessible. Once a transaction has aborted, it is immediately removed from the list of transactions in the MS DTC Transactions window.</p>
<p>
It is not possible to change the transaction outcome at this point.</p>
<p>
<img src="images/preprng.gif" border=0></p>

<h4><a name="_preparing"></a>Preparing</h4>
<p>
The client application has issued a commit request. The commit coordinator is collecting prepare responses from all participants.</p>
<p>
<img src="images/prepard.gif" border=0></p>

<h4><a name="_prepared"></a>Prepared</h4>
<p>
All participants have responded yes to prepare.</p>
<p>
<img src="images/indoubt.gif" border=0></p>

<h4><a name="_in.2d.doubt"></a>In Doubt</h4>
<p>
The transaction is prepared, is coordinated by a different MS DTC, and the coordinating MS DTC is inaccessible. The system administrator can force the transaction to commit or abort by right-clicking in the Transactions window and choosing the Resolve/Commit or Resolve/Abort command. Once a forced outcome is executed, the transaction is designated as forced commit or forced abort.</p>
<p>
<b>Caution</b>  Do not manually force an in-doubt transaction until you have read <a href="admin2_9v1v.htm">Manually Resolving Transactions</a>. </p>
<p>

<h4><a name="_forced_commit"></a>Forced Commit</h4>

<p>
<img src="images/forcabor.gif" border=0></p>

<h4><a name="_forced_abort"></a>Forced Abort</h4>

<p>
<img src="images/notifyc.gif" border=0></p>

<h4><a name="_notifying_committed"></a>Notifying Committed</h4>
<p>
The transaction has prepared successfully and the commit coordinator is notifying participants that the transaction has been committed. The commit coordinator does not forget the transaction until all participants have acknowledged receiving (and logging) the commit request.</p>
<p>
It is not possible to change the transaction outcome at this point.</p>
<p>
<img src="images/failnot.gif" border=0></p>

<h4><a name="_only_failed_remain_to_notify"></a>Only Failed Remain to Notify</h4>
<p>
The commit coordinator has notified all connected participants that the transaction has committed. The only participants not notified are those that are currently inaccessible.</p>
<p>
The system administrator can force a subordinate MS DTC to forget the transaction by right-clicking in the Transactions window and choosing the Resolve/Forget command.</p>
<p>
<b>Caution</b>  Do not manually force an in-doubt transaction until you have read <a href="admin2_9v1v.htm">Manually Resolving Transactions</a>. </p>
<p>
<img src="images/comit.gif" border=0></p>

<h4><a name="_committed"></a>Committed</h4>
<p>
The transaction has committed and all participants have been notified. Once a transaction commits, it is immediately removed from the list of transactions in the MS DTC Transactions window. </p>
<p>
