<h1><a name="_the_ms.a0.dtc_transactions_window"></a>The MS DTC Transactions Window</h1>
<p>
Use the MS DTC Transactions window to:
<ul>
<li>
Monitor the status of a transaction</li>
<li>
Manually resolve a transaction </li>
</ul>
<p>
The MS DTC Transactions window lists the current transactions in which a local MS DTC participates. Because the MS DTC can support thousands of concurrent transactions, the MS DTC Transactions window lists only:
<ul>
<li>
Transactions whose status is in doubt.</li>
<li>
Transactions that have remained in the same state for the period of time specified in the MS DTC Configuration dialog box (see <a href="admin2_8a7s.htm">The MS DTC Configuration Dialog Box</a>). </li>
</ul>
<p>
Transactions that may need to be manually resolved fall into two categories:
<ul>
<li>
In-doubt transactions (usually the result of a failed connection between participating servers).</li>
<li>
Transactions that have been committed but not acknowledged by a SQL Server, usually because of a SQL Server failure that prevents the SQL Server from starting or causes a SQL Server to lose its log.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Database locks are maintained on one or more participating servers as long as a transaction remains unresolved (neither committed nor aborted). It is occasionally necessary to manually resolve a transaction to release the locks and make database resources available to other network users.</p>
