<p>
The programming components in Microsoft® SQL Server™ 6.5 enable you to develop sophisticated client/server applications that tap the power of Microsoft SQL Server from workstations running the Microsoft® Windows NT™, Microsoft® Windows® 95, and Microsoft® Windows® operating systems.</p>
<p>
SQL Server 6.5 includes the Microsoft® Distributed Transaction Coordinator (MS DTC), which provides a robust, high-performance, scalable, easy-to-use distributed transaction facility for the Microsoft Windows NT and Microsoft® Windows® 95 operating systems. MS DTC addresses the challenges of processing transactions over a distributed set of software components that exist on a system of networked computers. MS DTC is fully integrated with Microsoft SQL Server and provides a transaction manager in SQL Enterprise Manager at each computer that manages distributed transactions.</p>
<p>
MS DTC provides a management interface that allows you to start and stop MS DTC, view current MS DTC statistics and traces, force the outcomes of in-doubt transactions, and set various global MS DTC options.</p>
