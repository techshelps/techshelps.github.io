<p>
For information about the current MS DTC session, refer to these statistics:
<ul>
<li>
Active¾The current number of transactions that have not yet completed the two-phase commit protocol.</li>
<li>
Max. Active¾The highest number of active transactions at any time during the current MS DTC operating session.</li>
<li>
Indoubt¾The current number of transactions that are unable to commit because of a communication failure between the local SQL Server and the commit coordinator.</li>
</ul>
<p>
The size of the MS DTC log file determines the maximum allowable number of concurrent transactions. Once a transaction has committed or aborted, it is deleted from the log file. However, if the log file becomes full, the MS DTC on the local server cannot accept a new transaction until space to record the new transaction becomes available.</p>
<p>
Together, the Active and Max. Active statistics measure the transaction load on a particular MS DTC. If, for example, the number of current transactions approaches the historical maximum, the system administrator can increase the size of the log file to allow for more transactions. If the number of current transactions is well below the maximum, the system administrator can decrease the size of the log file to conserve disk resources.</p>
<p>
The system administrator can increase or decrease the size of the log file by using the MS DTC Configuration dialog box. For details, see <a href="admin2_8a7s.htm">The MS DTC Configuration Dialog Box</a>.</p>
