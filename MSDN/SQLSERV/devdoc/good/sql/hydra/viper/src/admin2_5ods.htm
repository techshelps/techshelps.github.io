<h2><a name="_the_response_times_group"></a>The Response Times Group</h2>
<p>
Response time is the duration of a transaction from the point that it began to the point that it was committed by the commit coordinator (aborted transactions and transactions whose outcomes were forced are not taken into account). The Response Times group shows the minimum, average, and maximum transaction response times in milliseconds. </p>
