SRV_THREADAFFINITY</dt>
<dd>
Is an <i>option</i> parameter that associates threads with available processors. Using this parameter can result in better processor cache use and performance by reducing context switching and thread migration between processors. The default is 0.
<p>
The SRV_THREADAFFINITY parameter specifies a value in an affinity mask that is a bit vector in which each bit represents processors that a thread can run on. As threads are created, they are associated with one of the processors in the affinity mask. Administrators can control processor usage by masking various processors ON or OFF for use by ODS.

<p>
Initialize SRV_THREADAFFINITY by setting the corresponding bit of the processor(s) to ON. The SRV_THREADAFFINITY processor bit value is a binary value. For example, to use processors 1 through 4, set processor bits 1 through 4 ON by using the following setting:

<p>
SRV_THREADAFFINITY = 15

<p>
To use processors 1 through 6, set processor bits 1 through 6 ON by using the following setting:

<p>
SRV_THREADAFFINITY = 63
