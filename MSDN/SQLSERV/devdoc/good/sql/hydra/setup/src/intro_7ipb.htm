<p>
Microsoft® SQL Server™ 6.5 enhances the performance, reliability, and scalability provided by earlier releases of SQL Server by making the processes of developing applications, managing systems, and replicating data easier than ever. The new and enhanced features in SQL Server 6.5 meet government and industry standards for openness and interoperability. SQL Server 6.5 features comply with American National Standards Institute (ANSI) SQL-92 standards and with the Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS 127-2) as established by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).</p>
<p>
The server includes these new components: MS Query, SQL Trace, Microsoft Distributed Transaction Coordinator (MS DTC), OLE Automation Stored Procedures, SQL Server Web Assistant, and Simple Network Management Protocol Management Information Base (SNMP MIB) and SNMP agent. New client components include MS Query, SQL Trace, MS DTC (client), SQL Server Web Assistant, and other ODBC drivers for heterogeneous replication use. (These components are detailed later in this document.)</p>
