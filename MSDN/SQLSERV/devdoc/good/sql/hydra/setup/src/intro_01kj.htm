<p>
SQL Server 6.5 includes the Microsoft® Distributed Transaction Coordinator (MS DTC), which provides a robust, high-performance, scalable, easy-to-use distributed transaction facility for the Microsoft Windows NT and Microsoft® Windows® 95 operating systems. MS DTC addresses the challenges of processing transactions over a distributed set of software components that exist on a single computer or on a system of networked computers. MS DTC is fully integrated with Microsoft SQL Server. Via MS DTC, remote stored procedure calls can now participate in distributed transactions, so that changes on multiple servers can be committed as a single unit of work.</p>
<p>
SQL Enterprise Manager provides an interface to control and monitor MS DTC. You can view running transactions and their status, manually resolve transactions, and force transaction changes when necessary. For details about MS DTC, see the <i>Guide to Microsoft Distributed Transaction Coordinator</i>.</p>
