<p>
<img src="images/sqlexec.gif" border=0>
<ol>
<li>
From SQL Enterprise Manager, in the Server Manager window select the server to set configuration parameters for. </li>
<li>
Click the right mouse button on the server's SQL Executive icon, and in the shortcut menu, choose Configure.<p>
The Configure SQL Executive dialog box appears.
</li>
<li>
Set the following parameters.</li>
</ol>

<th align=left width=41%>Parameter</th>
<th align=left width=59%>Description</th>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=41%>Auto-Start SQL Mail <br>
When SQL Executive Starts</td>
<td width=59%>Specifies that when SQL Executive is started it will automatically start SQL Mail. SQL Server must be running before SQL Executive is started.</td>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=41%>Auto-Restart Server After <br>
Unexpected Server-Down</td>
<td width=59%>Specifies that if SQL Server stops unexpectedly for reasons other than a shutdown or a <b>net stop mssqlserver</b> command, SQL Executive will automatically restart SQL Server and then write a message to the event log.</td>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=41%>Unexpected Server-Down <br>
Detection Polling Interval <br>
(minutes)</td>
<td width=59%>Specifies the interval in minutes that is used by SQL Executive to check for unexpected SQL Server stoppages. The default value is 5 minutes.</td>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=41%>Local Host Server</td>
<td width=59%>Specifies the name of the local SQL Server. Usually this parameter is set to (default). However, if the server is set to listen on an alternate named pipe, do not use (default). Instead, select the listen-on name from the Local Host Server list. For more information about named pipes, see the <i>Microsoft SQL Server Administrator's Companion</i>. </td>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=41%>Error Log File</td>
<td width=59%>Specifies the path and the name of a file that error information for SQL Executive will be written to. An error log file adds substantial process overhead. Use the error log file only when directed to do so by Microsoft Technical Support or when you are attempting to troubleshoot a specific SQL Executive problem.</td>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=41%>System Account</td>
<td width=59%>Specifies that SQL Executive is assigned to run in the server's LocalSystem account. <p>
<b>Important:</b>  Selecting the System Account option for SQL Executive prevents the use of several features, such as replication and running scheduled tasks that involve other servers. A service running under the LocalSystem account has no user account information associated with it. This prevents certain network server software from allowing the Windows NT service to access resources. </p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=41%>This Account</td>
<td width=59%>Specifies that SQL Executive will run in the security context of the Windows NT user account that is entered here. This Account will usually be a domain user account (although it can be a user account on the local server). This Account should be reserved for use by SQL Executive (users should not use it to log on). This account should be a member of the Administrators local group and have a non-expiring password.<p>
<b>Important:</b>  Generally, the This Account option is assigned through the SQL Server <b>setup </b>program when SQL Server is installed and you do not need to change it. If you must change the user account or update the password, always use the Configure SQL Executive dialog box to do so. Do not use the Services application in Control Panel, because the SQL Executive service account needs additional privileges that are only granted to the account when the Configure SQL Executive dialog box is used.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=41%>Password</td>
<td width=59%>Specifies the password of the Windows NT user account that is assigned to SQL Executive.</td>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=41%>Confirm Password</td>
<td width=59%>Verifies the password of the Windows NT user account that is assigned to SQL Executive.</td>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=41%>Reset CmdExec Account</td>
<td width=59%>Reinstalls the SQLExecutiveCmdExec account, which is a local Windows NT account on the server that is being administered. CmdExec tasks that are owned by users other than system administrators run in the security context of this account.<p>
This option resets the account to its default (minimum) level of access rights. Additional rights that may have been granted to this account are removed.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=41%>Reset CmdExec Password</td>
<td width=59%>Changes the Windows NT password that is used by the SQLExecutiveCmdExec account. The new password is automatically generated by SQL Enterprise Manager.<p>
<b>Important:</b>  Do not use the Windows NT User Manager to change the SQLExecutiveCmdExec password. If you do, then CmdExec tasks that are owned by users other than system administrators cannot run successfully. If this problem occurs, choose the Reset CmdExec Account button.</p>
