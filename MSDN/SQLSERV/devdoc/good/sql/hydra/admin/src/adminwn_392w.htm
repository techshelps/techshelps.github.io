<ul>
<li>
You can perform a backup to a striped set using SQL Enterprise Manager. In the Database Backup/Restore dialog box, in the Backup tab, select multiple backup devices from the Backup Devices list.<p>
Note that striped refers to data that is stored among several devices. Improvements in performance, particularly load balancing, can be achieved by backing up to a striped set.
</li>
<li>
You can select the From Device button on the Restore tab to display the Restore From Device On Server dialog box, from which you can select backup devices to restore from. This is useful when attempting to restore backups that have no histories, such as backups from a previous version of SQL Server, or tape backups made on another machine and moved to the current machine.</li>
</ul>
<p>

You can choose the Database and Transaction Logs button in the Restore tab to populate the Backup History list with database backups and their associated transaction logs grouped together.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Note that the Database Backup and Restore dialog box is available for SQL Server 6.0 and later.</p>
