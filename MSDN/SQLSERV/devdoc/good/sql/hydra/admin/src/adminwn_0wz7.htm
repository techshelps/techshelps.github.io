<h3><a name="_support_for_odbc_subscribers"></a>Support for ODBC Subscribers</h3>
<p>
SQL Enterprise Manager supports replication to ODBC subscribers with the following additions for SQL Server 6.5:
<ul>
<li>
In the Replication - Publishing dialog box, the New Subscriber button opens the New Subscriber dialog box, which contains an ODBC Subscriber button. This button opens the New ODBC Subscriber dialog box, which presents a list of system DSNs that are registered with the publisher. <p>
You can also enter a username and a password if they are required by the ODBC subscriber. The username and the password are used by the distributor to connect to the ODBC subscriber. In many cases, entering the username or password in this dialog box is not necessary, because they are often entered and stored (depending on the ODBC driver) during the process of registering a system DSN with the ODBC administration application in Control Panel.
<p>
<b>Note</b>  A username or password that is entered in the Replication - Publishing dialog box will override any username or password that is entered in the ODBC administration application for a registered DSN.
</li>
<li>
The login name and password for ODBC subscribers can be edited in the Distribution Options dialog box. These options are not available if a SQL Server subscriber is being administered.</li>
<li>
A Subscriptions button has been added to the New Publications and Edit Publications dialog boxes. This button provides the ability to do a push subscription of an entire publication. (In SQL Server 6.0, push subscriptions can be performed only for individual articles.)</li>
</ul>
