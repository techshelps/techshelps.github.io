<p>
Microsoft SQL Server 6.5 includes the SQL Server Web Assistant, a tool that you can use to generate standard Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) files from SQL Server data. The SQL Server Web Assistant generates HTML files by using Transact-SQL queries, stored procedures, and extended stored procedures. HTML files, also known as web pages, can be viewed by using any HTML browser. HTML files are resources for displaying information on the World Wide Web (WWW) and on internal networks.</p>
<p>
The architecture of the SQL Server Web Assistant provides improved performance and scalability for non-interactive queries compared to database access solutions provided by Common Gateway Interface (CGI) applications. </p>

<p>
With the SQL Server Web Assistant, you can generate an HTML file on a one-time basis or as a regularly scheduled SQL Server task. An HTML file can be updated by using a trigger whenever relevant data changes. With this task-scheduling flexibility and the power of Transact-SQL, you can create web pages to serve a variety of purposes. For example, you can use the SQL Server Web Assistant to:
<ul>
<li>
Schedule a task to automatically update a web page price list whenever a new item is added or a price is changed, thus publishing a dynamic inventory and price list for customers and sales staff.</li>
<li>
Publish and distribute management reports including the latest sales statistics, resource allocations, or other SQL Server data.</li>
<li>
Publish server reports with information about who is currently accessing the server, which locks are being held, and by which users.</li>
<li>
Use extended stored procedures to publish information outside of SQL Server.</li>
<li>
Use a table of favorite web sites to publish server jump lists.</li>
</ul>
<p>
You can create a web page with the SQL Server Web Assistant in a few simple steps:
<ul>
<li>
Start the SQL Server Web Assistant.</li>
<li>
Create a query using the Query screen.</li>
<li>
Schedule the query using the Scheduling screen.</li>
<li>
Name and add options to the HTML file using the File Options screen.</li>
<li>
Include some basic formatting for the HTML file using the Formatting screen.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Each of these screens is described in the following sections. Additionally, each screen contains a More Info button that provides detailed Help information.</p>
<p>
<b>Note</b>  The SQL Server Web Assistant provides an interface for the stored procedure <b>sp_makewebtask</b>. The SQL Server Web Assistant interface is available only on Intel-based computers; however, you can run the stored procedure that creates the HTML file from any supported platform.
