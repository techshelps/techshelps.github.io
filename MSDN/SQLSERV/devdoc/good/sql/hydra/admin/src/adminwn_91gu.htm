<h2><a name="_additional_replication_information"></a>Additional Replication Information</h2>
<p>
SQL Server 6.5 provides the following additional changes to replication:
<ul>
<li>
The DBREPL.SQL script has been removed.</li>
<li>
The explicit (NOLOCK) optimizer hint is no longer needed in a replication filter; the lock manager has been updated to ignore table locks on the replicated base table during a replication filter. </li>
<li>
NOT FOR REPLICATION can be added to foreign key constraint declarations. For more information, see <a href="../../tsql/src/addnfeat_60fg.htm">What's New for Transact-SQL</a>. </li>
<li>
The Replication Topology window includes New Subscriber and Remove Subscriber buttons that you can use to add or remove subscribers. The Replication Topology window also includes graphical images that represent the type of subscriber (SQL Server, Microsoft Access ODBC, generic ODBC, and so on).</li>
<li>
Several of the replication dialog boxes in SQL Enterprise Manager have been enhanced. For more information, run SQL Enterprise Manager and review its replication interface or see the SQL Enterprise Manager online Help.</li>
</ul>
