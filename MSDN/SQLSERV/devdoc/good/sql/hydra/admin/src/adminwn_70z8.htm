<h3><a name="_sqlserver_user.2d.defined_counters_object"></a>SQLServer User-Defined Counters Object</h3>
<p>
The SQLServer User-Defined Counters object contains <b>SQL User Counter 1</b> through <b>SQL User Counter 10</b>. Values for these counters can be defined by a user. A counter can monitor any information that is returned by an SQL statement or any operation that is performed from SQL Server, such as executing a stored procedure.</p>
<p>
In SQL Server 6.5, "empty" stored procedures <b>sp_user_counter1</b> through <b>sp_user_counter10</b> correspond to the user-defined counters of the same number in SQL Performance Monitor. To create a user-defined counter, replace one of the empty stored procedures with a new stored procedure. The new stored procedure must return a single integer as its result set. The new stored procedure should have execute permission granted on it for the probe account.</p>
<h5><img src="../../../../../images/wedge.gif" border=0>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To create a counter stored procedure</h5>
<ol>
<li>
Choose one of the stored procedures <b>sp_user_counter1 </b>through <b>sp_user_counter10</b>.</li>
<li>
Drop the selected stored procedure. <p>
For example, to use <b>sp_user_counter1</b>, enter:
<pre>DROP PROC sp_user_counter1
go
<b><i>  </i></b></pre>
</li>
<li>
Create a new stored procedure <b>sp_user_counter1</b>. The results set must return only one integer.</li>
</ol>
<p>
For example, you can create the following stored procedure to count the number of machines that are connected to SQL Server:</p>
<pre>DROP PROC sp_user_counter1
go
CREATE PROC sp_user_counter1
AS SELECT count(distinct net_address) from sysprocesses 
go
<b><i>  </i></b></pre>
<p>
The SELECT statement counts each distinct <i>net_address</i> that is connected to the server. As a result, the user-defined counter <b>SQL User Counter 1</b> in SQL Performance Monitor will display the number of machines that are connected to SQL Server. </p>
<p>
In the following example, user-defined counters are used to track stock prices of four stocks. For this example, assume <i>stock_price</i> has an <i>int</i> dataype and all stock prices are multiplied by 100.</p>
<pre>DROP PROC sp_user_counter1
DROP PROC sp_user_counter2
DROP PROC sp_user_counter3
DROP PROC sp_user_counter4
go
CREATE PROC sp_user_counter1
AS SELECT stock_price from stocks where stock_name = 'A'
go
CREATE PROC sp_user_counter2
AS SELECT stock_price from stocks where stock_name = 'B'
go
CREATE PROC sp_user_counter3
AS SELECT stock_price from stocks where stock_name = 'C'
go
CREATE PROC sp_user_counter4
AS SELECT stock_price from stocks where stock_name = 'D'
go
<b><i>  </i></b></pre>
<p>
As a result, in SQL Performance Monitor <b>SQL User Counter1</b> through <b>SQL User Counter4</b> will display the prices of stocks A, B, C, and D, respectively.</p>
