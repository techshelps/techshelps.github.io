<p>
SQL Server 6.5 provides additional user-assistance and easy-to-use tools. These tools help you complete a task by answering questions, which allows you to progress in an organized manner toward completing a goal. </p>
<p>
The <i>Database Maintenance Plan Wizard</i> assists users in maintaining robust databases and provides a sound recovery strategy in case of system failure. The <i>SQL Server Web Assistant</i> is a flexible publishing tool that you can use to generate a standard Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) page from SQL Server data one time or as a recurring task.</p>
<p>
Here are a few things to remember about wizards and assistants:
<ul>
<li>
You move systematically through the tool by answering questions that appear on the screen. </li>
<li>
You can return to the previous screen at any time by choosing the Previous button. </li>
<li>
You can advance to the next screen at any time by choosing the Next button. </li>
<li>
You can advance to the final screen by choosing the Finish button. By choosing the Finish button, you permit the wizard or assistant to make all remaining decisions for you.</li>
</ul>
