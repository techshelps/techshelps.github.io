<h2><a name="_backup_and_recovery"></a>Backup and Recovery</h2>
<p>
SQL Server 6.5 provides improved backup and recovery capabilities. Specifically, the SQL Enterprise Manager Database Backup/Restore dialog box supports the following improvements:
<ul>
<li>
Histories of database backups are maintained.</li>
<li>
Individual tables can be backed up and restored.</li>
<li>
Transaction logs can be recovered through a specified date and time.</li>
</ul>
<p>
SQL Enterprise Manager maintains a record of database backups, including backups that are made through other applications. You can use SQL Enterprise Manager to restore a database or table without knowing where the backup is stored. This makes it easier to restore a database backup and all of its associated transaction logs in the correct order. For backups from SQL Server 6.5 servers, SQL Enterprise Manager automatically presents a list of database backups, table backups, and transaction log backups for you to choose from.</p>
<p>
Backup history is maintained in tables in the <i>msdb</i> database, even for the backups that were created by custom applications or third-party tools. The following tables hold the backup information: <i>sysbackupdetail</i>, <i>sysbackuphistory</i>, <i>sysrestoredetail</i>, and <i>sysrestorehistory</i>.</p>
