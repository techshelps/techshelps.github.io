<p>
SQL Server 6.5 supports replicating between 6.0 and 6.5 SQL Servers. Before setting up replication between servers of different versions, consider the following constraints: 
<ul>
<li>
The Publisher and Distributor must be the same version. Choose either 6.0 or 6.5 for both Publisher and Distributor.</li>
<li>
Replication administration must be done from SQL Enterprise Manager on a SQL Server 6.5.</li>
<li>
You must install the SQLOLE65.SQL script on the 6.0 server involved in replication. To install SQLOLE65.SQL, run the script for your platform found on the SQL Server CD-ROM. From the SQL Server CD-ROM, choose the subdirectory for your platform, and then choose the subdirectory for ODBC. The correct script resides in the ODBC subdirectory.</li>
<li>
When replicating from a SQL Server 6.0 server to a SQL Server 6.5 server, the replication process works as a SQL Server 6.0 replication process. The enhanced replication features of SQL Server 6.5 will not be available. For more information about SQL Server 6.0 replication, see the <i>Microsoft SQL Server Administrator's Companion</i> for 6.0.</li>
<li>
When replicating from a SQL Server 6.5 server to a SQL Server 6.0 server, the SQL Server 6.0 server is treated as an ODBC server. You must set up a data source name (DSN) for the SQL Server 6.0 server. </li>
</ul>
<h5><img src="../../../../../images/wedge.gif" border=0>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To set up the SQL Server 6.0 server as a DSN:</h5>
<ol>
<li>
On the machine where SQL Server 6.5 resides, from the Main program group, click Control Panel. </li>
<li>
From Control Panel, run the ODBC Administration application, and add the subscriber's DSN as a system DSN.</li>
<li>
Using SQL Enterprise Manager, configure the newly added system DSN as a subscribing server to the publishing server by choosing the New Subscriber button from the Replication - Publishing dialog box.<p>
The New Subscriber dialog box appears.
</li>
<li>
From the New Subscriber dialog box, choose the ODBC Subscriber button.<br>
Complete the New ODBC Subscriber dialog box that appears.<p>
<b>Note</b>  Only system DSNs are listed in the New ODBC Subscriber dialog box.
</li>
<li>
While using SQL Enterprise Manager to create or edit a publication, perform a push subscription to the subscriber by choosing the Subscribers button from the Edit Publications or Edit Article dialog box. <p>
Complete the dialog box that appears.
</li>
</ol>
