<h2><a name="_fallback_considerations"></a>Fallback Considerations</h2>
<p>
Consider the following factors when you are setting up SQL Server fallback support:
<ul>
<li>
The <b>sp_fallback_</b> procedures should not be executed within a user transaction. Avoid initiating CREATE/ALTER DATABASE or DISK INIT statement activity while running <b>sp_fallback_ </b>procedures.</li>
<li>
The <b>sp_fallback_</b> procedures always return the value 0 to indicate success and a value greater than 0 to indicate failure. In almost all cases, a value greater than 0 will have been taken from @@ERROR.</li>
<li>
Only enroll databases that do not share a device file with any other databases.</li>
<li>
Issuing database commands against an enrolled database is not recommended. These commands include dropping, altering, creating, and renaming a database. Before executing a CREATE DATABASE statement in a self-enrolled server, make sure the fallback tables have no entries for the server.</li>
<li>
Execute permission on <b>sp_fallback_help</b> is granted to the public group at installation. All other <b>sp_fallback_ </b>procedures can be executed only by the SA.</li>
<li>
If you want to provide fallback support for replicating servers, the publisher and the distributor should reside on the same server.</li>
<li>
ODBC and DB-Library clients can be set up to automatically switch to the fallback server under certain conditions. This works reliably when the primary server has exactly one fallback server defined. </li>
<li>
A database switched to a fallback server includes the database user information in <i>sysusers</i>. However, the mapping between database users and SQL Server login IDs is not maintained when the database is enrolled and/or activated on the fallback server. This problem can be handled by maintaining identical login IDs (identical <i>name</i> and <i>suid</i> columns in the <i>syslogins</i> table) in both SQL Servers. Add the same login IDs in the same order in both SQL Servers.<p>
Alternately, the system stored procedure <b>sp_change_users_login</b> could be used to fix the mapping between <i>sysusers</i> and <i>syslogins</i>. This, however, requires another fix after the database has been switched back to the primary server.
</li>
</ul>
