<h1><a name="_snmp_support"></a>SNMP Support</h1>
<p>
SQL Server 6.5 provides support for Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) monitoring of Microsoft SQL Server. </p>
<p>
The Microsoft SQL Server Management Information Base (MSSQL-MIB) is based on the proposed Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) SNMP Relational Database MS-MIB (RFC 1697), and it has been enhanced specifically for use with Microsoft SQL Server. IETF is the organization that oversees standards for the internet.</p>
<p>
With SQL Server 6.5 and the MSSQL-MIB, you can use SNMP applications to monitor the status of SQL Server installations, monitor performance information, explore defined databases, and view server and database configuration parameters. </p>
<p>
In addition, SQL Server 6.5 supports the ability to raise SNMP traps. An SNMP trap notifies the SNMP agent that some type of status or condition has occurred on the client or the server. The SNMP agent can then forward that notification to selected workstations that are running an SNMP monitoring application(s). </p>
<p>
A copy of the MSSQL-MIB (MSSQL.MIB) and a copy of the SQL Server SNMP extension agent (SQLSNMP.DLL) are installed by the SQL Server <b>setup</b> program and are enabled if the machine is running SNMP at the time of installation. MSSQL.MIB and SQLSNMP.DLL can later be added or dropped by the <b>setup</b> program's Set Server options and enabled if the machine is running SNMP at setup time.</p>
