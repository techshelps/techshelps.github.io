<p>
Under certain circumstances, the SQLExecutiveCmdExec account can prevent a task from starting. These circumstances include:
<ul>
<li>
An improper installation of the SQLExecutiveCmdExec account.</li>
<li>
The removal of the SQLExecutiveCmdExec account.</li>
<li>
An SQLExecutiveCmdExec account password that was changed outside of the Configure SQL Executive dialog box.</li>
</ul>
<p>
A message for a failed task will appear in the Task History dialog box.</p>
<p>
The following section explains the messages you can receive, the cause, and the solution.
<dl>
<dt>
<b>Message</b></dt>
<dd>
"A required privilege is not held by the client."</dd>
<dt>
<b>Cause</b></dt>
<dd>
The SQL Executive service account does not have the privileges that are required to initiate a logon as the SQLExecutiveCmdExec account.</dd>
<dt>
<b>Solution</b></dt>
<dd>
Open the Configure SQL Executive dialog box and reset the Service Startup Account to a different account, for example, the System Account, and then set it back to the desired user account. 
<p>
You can manually assign the privileges to the startup account by using the Windows NT User Manager application. The privileges are: Act as Part of the Operating System, Replace a System Level Token, and Increase Quotas. If the SQL Executive service startup account is the current session's account, you must log off and then back on after setting these privileges. You also must stop and restart the SQL Executive server.
</dd>
<dt>
<b>Message</b></dt>
<dd>
"A problem occurred while attempting to log on as the Windows NT user 'SQLExecutiveCmdExec': [specific logon problem description]." An example of [specific logon problem description] is "Logon failure: unknown user name or bad password." </dd>
<dt>
<b>Cause</b></dt>
<dd>
The SQLExecutiveCmdExec account does not exist, or it exists but is not defined correctly. For example, the password has been changed or the account has been disabled.</dd>
<dt>
<b>Solution</b></dt>
<dd>
Open the Configure SQL Executive dialog box and choose the Reset CmdExec Account button.
