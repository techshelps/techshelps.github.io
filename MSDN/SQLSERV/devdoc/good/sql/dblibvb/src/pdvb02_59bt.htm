<h2><a name="_initializing_the_visual_basic_for_sql.a0.server_library"></a>Initializing DB-Library for Visual Basic</h2>
<p>
The first task of a DB-Library for Visual Basic application is to call the <b>SqlInit$</b> function to initialize DB-Library for Visual Basic. During initialization, your application becomes "registered" with DB-Library, preventing conflicts with other applications that might call this library at the same time.</p>
<p>
Your application must call <b>SqlInit$</b> before it calls any other DB-Library for Visual Basic function. Because no other DB-Library for Visual Basic actions can take place before the call to <b>SqlInit$</b>, call <b>SqlInit$</b> at the start of your application (usually the <b>Form_Load</b> event procedure of the application's primary, or startup, form).</p>
<p>
<b>SqlInit$</b> takes no parameters and returns the DB-Library version number as a string (where DB-Library is the generic name for the standard SQL Server client interface on which DB-Library for Visual Basic is based). Your error handlers should be available when <b>SqlInit$</b> is called.</p>
<p>
The following program fragment illustrates a valid call to <b>SqlInit$</b>:</p>
<pre>'Initialize DB-Library for Visual Basic Library.
IF SqlInit$() = "" THEN
   PRINT "DB-Library for Visual Basic Library has not been initialized."
   END
END IF
</pre>
<p>
For an example of how <b>SqlInit$</b> is used, refer to the QUERY sample application. This sample application satisfies the initialization requirement by calling the routine <b>InitializeApplication</b>, which in turn calls <b>SqlInit$</b>. <b>InitializeApplication</b> is defined separately in the INIEXITW.BAS common code module.</p>
