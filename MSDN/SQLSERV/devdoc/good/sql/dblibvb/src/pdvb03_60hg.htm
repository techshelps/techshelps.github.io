<p>
The Visual Basic development environment allows you to test your application interactively during the development process.</p>
<p>
Before you start interactive development of SQL Server applications in Windows, verify that your PATH command includes the DB-Library client support file, MSDBLIB3.DLL, and a corresponding Net-Library file, such as DBNMP3.DLL. These files, available with your SQL Server client software for Windows, allow you to test your connection to SQL Server using either custom application functions or a Windows-based tool such as the ISQL/w utility.</p>
<p>
A new Visual Basic Project that uses DB-Library for Visual Basic must include the VBSQL.VBX custom control as a Project file. Adding this file includes the custom error-handling control (stop sign icon) to your Toolbox palette. Be sure to place one instance of this custom control on the startup form of your application.</p>
