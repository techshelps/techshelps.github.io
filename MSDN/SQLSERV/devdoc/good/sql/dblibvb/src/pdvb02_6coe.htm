<h2><a name="_exiting_a_windows_based_application"></a>Exiting a Windows-based Application</h2>
<p>
For Windows, your application must make an additional call to free all memory associated with your application. More than one application can reference DB-Library for Visual Basic at the same time. To avoid conflicts between these applications, DB-Library for Visual Basic allocates memory to store information identifying each application. When you exit a DB-Library for Visual Basic application, you must call <b>SqlWinExit</b> to release this memory and make it available to other applications.</p>
<p>
The following program fragment illustrates the use of <b>SqlWinExit</b>:</p>
<pre>SUB Quit_Click()
   'Close and free all SQL Server connections.
   SqlExit

   'Release memory allocated for VBSQL.
   SqlWinExit

   'End VBSQL application.
   END
END SUB
</pre>
<p>
Typically, Windows-based applications include an Exit or Quit menu option with the File menu. The Visual Basic event procedure associated with the Exit menu option must include calls to both <b>SqlExit</b> and <b>SqlWinExit</b> to close all connections and release memory allocated to the application.</p>
