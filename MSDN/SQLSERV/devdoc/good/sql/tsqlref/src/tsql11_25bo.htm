<h1><a name="_kill_statement"></a>KILL Statement </h1>
<p>
Terminates a user's process based on the system process ID.</p>
<h4>Syntax</h4>
<p>
KILL <i>spid</i></p>
<p>
where
<dl>
<dt>
<i>spid</i></dt>
<dd>
Specifies the system process ID (<i>spid</i>) of the process you want to terminate. The <i>spid </i>is a unique integer (<i>smallint</i>) assigned to processes as they occur; no user is permanently assign a <i>spid</i>. When a process is active, it is stored in the <i>sysprocesses </i>system table. 
<p>
In addition to storing the ID of the process, the <i>sysprocesses</i> table also stores other process information, such as <i>status</i> (runnable, waiting for a lock, sleeping, and so on), the <i>suid </i>(the server login ID of the user who executed the statement), <i>program_name</i> (the "host_name" of the application program ¾ if not explicitly assigned, usually returns the computer name), and so on.

</dd>
</dl>
<h4>Remarks</h4>
<p>
Because an <i>spid</i> is assigned only to active processes, you can get a report on the current processes by executing the <b>sp_who</b> system stored procedure.</p>
<p>
This is a typical example:</p>
<pre>spid   status     loginame hostname  blk   dbname     cmd              
------ ---------- -------- --------- ----- ---------- ---------------- 
1      sleeping   sa                 0     master     MIRROR HANDLER   
2      sleeping   sa                 0     master     LAZY WRITER      
3      sleeping   sa                 0     master     CHECKPOINT SLEEP 
4      sleeping   sa                 0     master     RA MANAGER       
10     sleeping   Mary     WKSTA1    0     pubs       AWAITING COMMAND 
11     runnable   Joe      WKSTA5    10    pubs       SELECT           </pre>
<p>
The <i>blk</i> column contains the system process ID of a blocking process; if there is one, this value will reference the <i>spid</i> column of this table (self-referencing). A blocking process is one that is holding resources that another process needs. In this example, process 11 (a SELECT on a table) is blocked by process 10 (an uncommitted transaction). Although well-designed transactions should complete quickly and rarely block others, a transaction that does block another transaction can be terminated with the KILL statement.</p>
<p>
System processes (MIRROR HANDLER, LAZY WRITER, CHECKPOINT SLEEP, and RA MANAGER) and processes running an extended stored procedure cannot be terminated.</p>
<p>
You can get a report on the current locks and each <i>spid</i> of the process holding them by using the <b>sp_lock</b> system stored procedure. The following information is returned when the SA executes <b>sp_lock</b>:</p>
<pre>spid   locktype             table_id    page        dbname          
------ -------------------- ----------- ----------- --------------- 
15     Sh_intent            313052151   0           master          
10     Ex_table-blk         16003088    0           pubs            </pre>
<p>
In this example, process 10 has a blocking, exclusive table-lock. Process 15 (the process running <b>sp_lock</b> has a shared intent lock on <i>sysprocesses</i> (the table from which this output is retrieved).</p>
<h4>Permission</h4>
<p>
KILL permission defaults to the system administrator and is not transferable.</p>
<h4>Example</h4>
<p>
This example shows how to terminate the system process ID 10.</p>
<pre>KILL 10
</pre>
