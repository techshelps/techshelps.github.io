<p>
The <i>Microsoft SQL Server Transact-SQL Reference</i> is organized for ease of use. In this reference, information about all Transact-SQL statements, server-supplied stored procedures, utilities, and additional informational topics appears in alphabetical order. Transact-SQL users who need an understanding of the SQL syntax and Transact-SQL extensions should refer to this reference when writing SQL scripts, executing ad hoc queries, or modifying the database environment. </p>
<p>
Syntax, limitations and restrictions, examples, and references to topics of similar interest are given.</p>
<p>
Most topic examples refer to the <i>pubs</i> sample database. The <i>pubs </i>sample database is included as a learning tool; it is created when the server is installed. To use the sample database, your system must have access to the <i>pubs</i> database. If you have a localized version of SQL Server and want to try the examples, drop the localized version of <i>pubs </i>and install the U.S. English version of <i>pubs</i>. To install the U.S. English version of <i>pubs</i>, run the INSTPUBS.SQL script with the <b>isql </b>command-line utility. This script can be found in the INSTALL directory of SQL Server. Use this syntax:</p>
<p>
<b>isql /Usa /P</b><i>password</i> <b>/S</b><i>server</i> <b>-i\sql60\install\instpubs.sql</b></p>
<p>
For information about using the <b>isql </b>command-line utility, see the Utilities and Executables topic. For an overview of the <i>pubs </i>database, see Appendix B, "The <i>pubs </i>Sample Database."</p>
<p>
Users who need an understanding of system administration strategies and server configuration should refer to the <i>Microsoft SQL Server Administrator's Companion</i>. Users who need an understanding of database development ¾ designing and optimizing databases, writing queries, and manipulating data ¾ should refer to the <i>Microsoft SQL Server Database Developer's Companion</i>.</p>
