<h2><a name="_console_command.2d.line_utility"></a>console Command-line Utility</h2>
<p>
Displays backup and restore messages when dumping or loading to or from diskette dump devices. The <b>console</b> command-line utility is used by the person responsible for dumping and loading a database.</p>
<h4>Syntax</h4>
<p>
<b>console</b> [<b>/S</b> <i>servername</i>] [<b>/P </b><i>pipename</i>]</p>
<p>
where
<dl>
<dt>
<b>/S </b><i>servername</i></dt>
<dd>
Specifies which SQL Server to connect to. The <i>servername</i> is the name of the server computer on the network. This option is required when you are executing <b>console</b> from a remote computer on the network.</dd>
<dt>
<b>/P</b> <i>pipename</i></dt>
<dd>
Specifies the pipe that the server was started with.
</dd>
</dl>
<h4>Remarks</h4>
<p>
The <b>console</b> program must be running before a DUMP or LOAD statement can proceed for diskette dump devices.</p>
<p>
The <b>console</b> program prompts the operator for information related to mounting and unmounting diskettes. Since the <b>console</b> workstation (which can be any screen group) displays prompts and messages for the operator, run it in a window on the same Windows NT - based workstation that is running SQL Server. Most <b>console</b> messages are self-explanatory. To stop a dump or load to a diskette, press N in response to any prompt to mount a new diskette.</p>
<p>
If two diskettes (that is, two dumps/loads) are being used at once, only one <b>console</b> is needed. The program prints messages one at a time, waiting for a response before displaying the next prompt. For this reason, the messages include the name of the physical drive to which they pertain.</p>
<p>
Make sure that the diskette you are using is formatted and not write-protected.</p>
<p>
The <b>console</b> utility uses named pipes. If you want to use <b>console</b> on an alternate pipe, you must set up the connection using the SQL Client Configuration Utility. </p>
<p>
For details, see the <i>Microsoft SQL Server Administrator's Companion</i>.</p>
<p>
<b>Note</b>  If the <b>console</b> utility has been started and appears to be unusable, wait for 1 minute and try to use it again. (SQL Server may be in the process of fixing a broken console connection). </p>
