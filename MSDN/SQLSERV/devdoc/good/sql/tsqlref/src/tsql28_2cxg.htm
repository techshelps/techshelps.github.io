<h2><a name="_save_transaction_statement"></a>SAVE TRANSACTION Statement </h2>
<p>
Sets a savepoint within a transaction.</p>
<h4>Syntax</h4>
<p>
SAVE TRANsaction <i>savepoint_name</i></p>
<p>
where
<dl>
<dt>
<i>savepoint_name</i></dt>
<dd>
Specifies the name assigned to the savepoint. Savepoint names must conform to the rules for identifiers. 
</dd>
</dl>
<h4>Remarks</h4>
<p>
A user can set a savepoint, or marker, within a transaction. It defines a location to which a transaction can return if part of the transaction might be conditionally canceled. If a transaction is rolled back to a savepoint, it must proceed to completion (with more SQL statements if needed and a <a href="tsql28_1910.htm">COMMIT TRANSACTION statement</a>), or it must be canceled altogether (by rolling it back to its beginning). To cancel an entire transaction, use the form ROLLBACK TRANSACTION <i>transaction_name</i>. All the transaction's statements or procedures are undone.</p>
<p>
<b>Important</b>  When a transaction begins, resources used during the transaction are held until the completion of the transaction (namely locks). When part of a transaction is rolled back to a savepoint, resources continue to be held until the completion of the transaction (or a rollback of the complete transaction).</p>
