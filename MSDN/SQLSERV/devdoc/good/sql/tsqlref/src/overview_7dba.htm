<p>
Microsoft® SQL Server 6.0 provides a variety of graphical and command-line utilities that enable clients to access data in a variety of ways. At the heart of these tools is Transact-SQL® code.</p>
<p>
Transact-SQL is an enhanced version of structured query language (SQL). SQL is a high-level language for relational database systems. Originally developed by IBM®, SQL has been adapted for many relational database management systems (DBMSs) and has been approved as the official relational query language standard by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI). Transact-SQL is compliant with many ANSI SQL standards and also provides important additional capabilities and functions.</p>
<p>
With SQL, you can retrieve data from a database, create databases and database objects, add data, modify existing data, and perform other complex functions. You can also change the server configuration, modify database or session settings, and control data and access statements. Many of these capabilities are implemented by using one of three SQL categories: Data Definition Language (DDL), Data Manipulation Language (DML), and Data Control Language (DCL).</p>
<p>
Microsoft SQL Server continues to adhere to industry standards, and provides improved ANSI SQL support and language enhancements that include declarative referential integrity (DRI) and powerful server-based cursor support, which far exceed the ANSI standard. SQL Server 6.0 enhances several existing Transact-SQL language statements and builds upon its existing tools and system procedures. </p>
