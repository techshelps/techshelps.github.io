<h1><a name="_comments_tsql01"></a>Comments</h1>
<p>
Comments provide user-documented information about SQL statements, statement blocks, and stored procedures.</p>
<h4>Syntax</h4>
<p>
<b>/*</b> <i>text_of_comment</i> <b>*/</b></p>
<p>
Or</p>
<p>
<b>--</b> <i>text_of_comment</i></p>
<p>
where
<dl>
<dt>
<i>text_of_comment</i></dt>
<dd>
Represents a statement or section that should not be evaluated by the server. Comments can be inserted on a separate line, nested (<b>-- </b>only) at the end of a Transact-SQL command line, or within a Transact-SQL statement. 
</dd>
</dl>
<h4>Remarks</h4>
<p>
Multiple-line comments are allowed as long as they are surrounded by <b>/*</b> and <b>*/</b>. A stylistic convention often used for multiple-line comments is to begin the first line with <b>/*</b>, subsequent lines with <b>**</b>, and end with <b>*/</b>. </p>
<p>
Single-line or nested comments are supported with the ANSI-standard comments of the double hyphens (<b>--</b>). Comments inserted with <b>--</b> are delimited by the end-of-line (NEWLINE) character.</p>
<p>
There is no maximum length for comments.</p>
<p>
<b>Note</b>  To avoid generating an error message, do not include a GO command within a comment.</p>
<h4>Example</h4>
<h5>Combining Comments</h5>
<p>
In this example, comments are used to document and test the behavior during different phases of development for a trigger. In this "in progress" example, parts of the trigger are commented out to narrow down problems and test only one of the conditions. Both styles of comments are used; ANSI-style comments are shown both alone and nested. </p>
<pre>CREATE TRIGGER employee_insupd
/*
    Because CHECK constraints can only reference the column(s)
    on which the column- or table-level constraint has 
    been defined, any cross-table constraints (in this case, 
    business rules) need to be defined as triggers.

    Employee job_lvls (on which salaries are based) should be within 
    the range defined for their job. To get the appropriate range, 
    the jobs table needs to be referenced. This trigger will be 
    invoked for INSERT and UPDATES only. For information about 
    triggers, see the Microsoft SQL Server Transact-SQL Reference.
