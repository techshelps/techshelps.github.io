<p>
<b>Note</b>  In the future, support for SQL Server device mirroring may be discontinued. It is recommended that you use either the mirroring functionality of the Microsoft Windows NT operating system, or hardware-based mirroring if your hardware supports it. For more information about Windows NT mirroring, see the Microsoft Windows NT operating system documentation in <i>What's New for SQL Server 6.5</i>.</p>
<p>
Disk mirroring allows a software mirror of a user database device or the MASTER database device to add to the recoverability options available for the database or databases that reside on that device. When a database resides on multiple devices, mirror all the devices to ensure that the whole database is mirrored. If a database device fails, its mirror immediately takes over; database users are unaffected and can continue to access data without interruption.</p>
<p>
You can mirror or unmirror database devices without shutting down SQL Server. Disk mirroring does not interfere with ongoing activities in the database.</p>
<p>
For even greater protection, always put the log portion of the database on a separate device from the data portion (see the LOG ON clause of the CREATE DATABASE statement). Whenever possible, this device should also be on a separate physical device. </p>
<p>
For a report on all the SQL Server devices on your system (user database devices and their mirrors, as well as dump devices), execute the <b>sp_helpdevice</b> system stored procedure.</p>
<p>
SQL Server device mirroring for all user-defined devices consists of three statements (discussed in the following sections).
<ul>
<li>
DISK MIRROR</li>
<li>
DISK UNMIRROR</li>
<li>
DISK REMIRROR</li>
</ul>
<p>
Software device mirroring can be set up by the system administrator. </p>
<p>
<b>Note</b>  To mirror the MASTER device, use the <b>-r</b> option (with the <b>sqlservr </b>command-line executable) and the name of the mirror when you restart SQL Server. To add the <b>-r</b> option as a parameter, choose the Parameters button in the Set Server Options dialog box provided with the SQL Setup Utility. For more information, see <i>Microsoft SQL Server Setup</i>.</p>
<p>
Other SQL Server fault-tolerance options include hardware fault tolerance and operating-system software fault tolerance. For more information, see the <i>Microsoft SQL Server Administrator's Companion</i>.</p>
