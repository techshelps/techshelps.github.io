<h2><a name="_approximate_numeric_data"></a>Approximate Numeric Data</h2>
<p>
Approximate numeric data consists of numeric data preserved as accurately as the binary numbering system allows. Many floating-point values cannot be accurately represented in binary notation. For these numbers, it is necessary to store an approximation of the decimal number. Examples of these numbers are floating-point values ending in .3, .6, and .7. The IEEE 754 specification provides four rounding modes: round to nearest, round up, round down, and round toward zero. SQL Server uses round up. All are accurate to guaranteed precision but can result in slightly different floating-point values. Because the binary representation of a floating-point number may use one of many legal rounding schemes, it is impossible to reliably quantify a floating-point value. It is best to avoid referencing to floating-point columns in WHERE clauses. </p>
<p>
These are the approximate numeric datatypes:
<dl>
<dt>
<i>float</i>[(<i>n</i>)]</dt>
<dd>
Is a datatype that holds positive or negative floating-point numbers. Specify the binary precision with <i>b</i>, which must be from 1 through 15. If the binary precision is from 1 through 7, it is another name for the <i>real</i> datatype. If the binary precision is from 8 through 15, it is considered a synonym for the <i>float</i> datatype. By default, this column has a 15-digit precision. The range of positive values is approximately from 2.23E - 308 through 1.79E  308, zero can be stored, and the range of negative values is approximately from -2.23E - 308 through -1.79E  308. Storage size is 8 bytes. All arithmetic operations except modulo are available with <i>float</i>. 
<p>
Data of type <i>float</i> can include an optional exponent. For <i>float</i> data with an exponential component, enter a number (with or without a decimal point and a positive or negative sign), followed by e or E, followed by an optionally signed integer. The value represented by a <i>float</i> is the product of the first number and 10 to the power of the second number.
</dd>
<dt>
<i>real</i></dt>
<dd>
Is a floating-point column similar to <i>float</i>. This column has 7-digit precision. The range of positive values is approximately from 1.18E - 38 through 3.40E  38, zero can be stored, and the range of negative values is approximately from -1.18E - 38 through -3.40E  38. Storage size is 4 bytes.
