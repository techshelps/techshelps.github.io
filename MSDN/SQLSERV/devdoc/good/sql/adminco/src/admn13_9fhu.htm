<p>
This scenario uses two servers to publish the same data. The publication server sends data to a subscription server, which then republishes the data to any number of subscribers. This is useful when a publication server must send data to subscribers over a slow or expensive communications link. If there are a number of subscribers on the far side of that link, using a publishing subscriber shifts the bulk of the distribution load to that side of the link.</p>
<p>
Note that in this illustration, both the publication server and the publishing subscriber are acting as their own local distribution servers. If each was set up to use a remote distribution server, each distribution server would need to be on the same side of the slow or expensive communications link as its publication server. Publication servers must be connected to remote distribution servers by reliable, high-speed communications links.</p>
<p>
