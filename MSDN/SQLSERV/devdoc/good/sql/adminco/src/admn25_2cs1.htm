<h1><a name="_error_2521"></a>Error 2521</h1>
<h4>Severity Level 16</h4>
<h4>Message Text</h4>
<pre>Table Corrupt: Page is linked but not allocated; check the following pages and table: alloc page#=%ld extent id=%ld logical page#=%ld object id in extent=%ld (object name = %.*s) index id in extent=%d
</pre>
<h4>Explanation</h4>
<p>
This error means that a page is currently in use by a table or index but it has not been marked as allocated. The same page could be allocated again, resulting in a loss of whatever data resides on the page.</p>
<p>
<b>Important</b>  This error is serious, especially if it occurs on a table's data pages.</p>
<p>
Pages encountering error 2521 will not be included in a database dump, because database dumps are performed by reading allocation pages and not by traversing page chains. Correct this error before dumping the database.</p>
<h4>Action</h4>
<p>
If the <i>object id in extent</i> is less than 100, the error is on a system table, which cannot easily be corrected. Restore the database from a known clean backup.</p>
<p>
If the <i>object id in extent</i> is 100 or greater, use the DBCC PAGE statement described in "Associating a Page with an Object" in Chapter 24, "Additional Problem-solving Techniques," to display information about the <i>logical page</i> from the error message. The value that DBCC PAGE displays for <i>indid</i> should match the <i>index id in extent</i> printed at the end of the message.</p>
<p>
If these values do not match, restore the database from a known clean backup. If they do match, check what type of index is involved. For additional information, see the table of index IDs contained in "Associating a Page with an Object" in Chapter 24, "Additional Problem-solving Techniques." </p>
<h5>For tables (<i>index id in extent</i> = 0)</h5>
<p>
Restore the database from a known clean backup.</p>
<h5>For indexes (0 &lt; <i>index id in extent</i> &lt; 255)</h5>
<p>
The problem can be resolved by dropping and re-creating the index in question. After the index is rebuilt, run DBCC CHECKALLOC to verify that the problem no longer exists. If it persists, call your primary support provider.</p>
