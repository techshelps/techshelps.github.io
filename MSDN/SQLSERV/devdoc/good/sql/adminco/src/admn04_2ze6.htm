<h3><a name="_client_configuration"></a>Client Configuration</h3>
<p>
To configure a Windows- or Windows NT-based client to use the Windows Sockets Net-Library, follow the steps under "Setting Up Server Connections," earlier in this chapter. In the DLL Name box, enter the appropriate Windows Socket Net-Library name. For Windows NT-based clients, select TCP/IP Sockets from the list. For Windows-based clients, type <b>dbmssoc3</b> in the box.</p>
<p>
The Connection String uses the format:</p>
<p>
<i>ip_address</i><b>,</b>[<i>socket_number</i>]</p>
<p>
where <i>ip_address</i> is the IP address of the computer running SQL Server and <i>socket_number</i> is the optional socket number that SQL Server is listening on.</p>
<p>
It is also possible to configure a Windows- or Windows NT-based client to use the Windows Sockets Net-Library by default. From the SQL Client Configuration Utility, in the Default Network box select TCP/IP Sockets. Using this method, connections can be established by using the <i>ip_address</i>,[<i>socket_number</i>] directly as the SQL Server name, or by using a server name with the format:</p>
<p>
<i>host_name</i><b>,</b>[<i>socket_number</i>]</p>
<p>
where <i>host_name</i> is a TCP/IP host name that has been defined in the client HOSTS file or on a Domain Name Service (DNS), or is the machine name of a Windows NT Server running SQL Server if WINS is enabled, and <i>socket_number</i> is the optional socket number that SQL Server is listening on. For a client running Windows for Workgroups, the HOSTS file is located in the \WINDOWS directory by default. For a client running Windows NT, the HOSTS file is located in the \WINDOWS\SYSTEM32\DRIVERS\ETC directory by default. For other TCP/IP protocols that support Windows Sockets, see your TCP/IP documentation.</p>
<p>
In all cases, if the <i>socket_number</i> is not specified, the Net-Library uses 1433, the official Internet Assigned Number Authority (IANA) socket number for Microsoft SQL Server.</p>
