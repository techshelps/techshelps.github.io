<h3><a name="_tempdb_database"></a><i>tempdb</i> Database</h3>
<p>
When SQL Server is installed the <b>setup</b> program creates the MASTER database device. One of the databases it creates and places on that device is <i>tempdb</i>. This database provides a storage area for temporary tables and other temporary working storage needs. No special permissions are required to use <i>tempdb </i>(that is, to create temporary tables or to execute commands that might require storage space in the <i>tempdb</i> database).</p>
<p>
All temporary tables are stored in <i>tempdb</i>, no matter which database the user who creates them is using. You can query a temporary table from inside the database in which it was created or from <i>tempdb</i>. If you query <i>tempdb..sysobjects</i>, you will notice that a suffix is attached to the names of temporary tables. System stored procedures (for example, <b>sp_help</b>) work on temporary tables, but only if you use the procedures from <i>tempdb</i>.</p>
<p>
The <i>tempdb</i> database is a shared work space used by the databases on SQL Server. A user's temporary tables are dropped from <i>tempdb</i> when the current user leaves SQL Server or during recovery from a system failure. A stored procedure's temporary tables are dropped when the procedure exits. Temporary tables can also be dropped explicitly before a session ends.</p>
<p>
The default size of <i>tempdb</i> is 2 MB. Certain activities, such as the following, can make it necessary to increase the size of <i>tempdb</i>:
<ul>
<li>
Large temporary tables</li>
<li>
Significant activity on temporary tables (which will fill up the <i>tempdb</i> log)</li>
<li>
Large sorts, or many simultaneous sorts</li>
<li>
Subqueries and aggregates with GROUP BY</li>
<li>
A large number of open cursors</li>
</ul>
<p>
The system administrator can increase the size of <i>tempdb</i>. Note that <i>tempdb</i> is created on the MASTER device by default. Additional space can be added on MASTER or on any other initialized device. The system administrator can also create <i>tempdb</i> in RAM.</p>
