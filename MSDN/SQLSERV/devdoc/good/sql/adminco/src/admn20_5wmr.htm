<h1><a name="_reporting_errors"></a>Reporting Errors</h1>
<p>
If you are unable to resolve a problem using the procedures described in Chapters 21 through 25 and in the <i>Microsoft SQL Server Transact-SQL Reference</i>, call your primary support provider for assistance. When you report an error to your primary support provider, be sure to have the following information:
<ul>
<li>
The environment in which the error occurred, including:<ul>
<li>
SQL Server version (as reported to the error log or returned by <br>
SELECT @@VERSION)</li>
<li>
DB-Library API version (as reported by the Client Configuration Utility) or ODBC driver version (as reported by ODBC Driver Setup)</li>
<li>
Front-end application version (for example, SQL Enterprise Manager or ISQL.EXE) </li>
<li>
Operating-system version</li>
<li>
Hardware platform</li>
<li>
Production or development environment</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
The message number, the message state, and the complete error message text</li>
<li>
Any variables (numbers, database object types, or database object names) included in the error message</li>
<li>
The context in which the message was generated (what statement was running at the time)</li>
<li>
The number of users who were logged in to SQL Server when the error occurred</li>
<li>
The frequency with which the error occurs</li>
</ul>
<p>
It is also helpful to provide a hard copy of the entire error log, including all messages displayed from startup to immediately before or after the error occurred.</p>
