<h1><a name="_error_933"></a>Error 933</h1>
<h4>Severity Level 22</h4>
<h4>Message Text</h4>
<pre>Logical page %1d of the log encountered while retrieving highest timestamp in database '%.*s' is not the last page of the log and we are not currently recovering that database.
</pre>
<h4>Explanation</h4>
<p>
This error occurs when SQL Server retrieved the highest timestamp and found that it was not on the last log page. This indicates that the log was damaged and recovery cannot proceed. During recovery, when SQL Server first opens a database, it must retrieve the highest timestamp value from the last log page. The highest timestamp value should also be on the last page in the log, because log pages are written in succession and each one receives a higher timestamp than the previous one. </p>
<h4>Action</h4>
<p>
This problem can be caused by loading a damaged or truncated dump file. If it happens during a database load, the dump file is probably damaged and you will need to re-dump the original database, and then retry the load. If the file was copied across a network, it may have been damaged during the copy. Always verify the copy (use <b>copy/v </b>or <b>xcopy/v</b>) when you copy database dump files across the network. For maximum reliability, compare the original and copied dump file using <b>FC/B</b>.</p>
