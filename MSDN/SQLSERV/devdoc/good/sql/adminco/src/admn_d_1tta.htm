<p>
Configuration of the drive subsystem is the most critical part of setting up a database server for optimal operation. We have tried to give you the tools to make an intelligent decision regarding the choice of the best configuration for your servers. The key concepts presented in this paper are: distribute I/O requests over an appropriate number of drives, carefully chose a fault-tolerance option, and RAID technology provides the best choice for critical, high-performance database servers. </p>
<p>
Finally, not all systems react the same due to differences among application profiles. The information provided in this paper has been based on five years of experience with array systems, both in Compaq labs and in customer situations. However, your environment requires testing of these concepts before implementing a system in production. Any paper that would claim otherwise should be viewed with a high degree of skepticism. </p>
