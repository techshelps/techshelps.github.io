<h1><a name="_error_1207"></a>Error 1207</h1>
<h4>Severity Level 20</h4>
<h4>Message Text</h4>
<pre>Locksleep called with bad process id %d
</pre>
<h4>Explanation</h4>
<p>
SQL Server sometimes puts a process to sleep while it is waiting for another process to free a lock. It does this by calling an internal "locksleep" routine. If SQL Server calls this routine with a process ID that does not exist or is incorrect, a 1207 error occurs. This usually happens after a process has terminated abnormally and has not freed all of its locks.</p>
<h4>Action</h4>
<p>
Run <b>sp_who</b> to see if the process ID from the error message is a valid server process. Then run <b>sp_lock</b> with the process ID to see if the process holds locks. If <b>sp_lock</b> shows a server process ID (<i>spid</i>) that is not in <i>sysprocesses</i>, use shutdown with the nowait option to shut down SQL Server immediately without doing a checkpoint.</p>
<p>
If restarting does not clear the error condition, or if the problem occurs regularly, contact your primary support provider. When calling your primary support provider, be prepared to provide a copy of the error log. Also have output from <b>sp_who</b> and <b>sp_lock</b> ready.</p>
