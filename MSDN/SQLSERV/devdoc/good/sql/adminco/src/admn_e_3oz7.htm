<h2><a name="_effect_of_.93.select_into.2f.bulkcopy.94_.on_transaction_logs"></a>Effect of "select into/bulkcopy" on Transaction Logs</h2>
<p>
The <b>select into/bulkcopy </b>option must be set in a database when you want to do non-logged operations such as SELECT INTO or fast bulk copy (<b>bcp</b>). </p>
<p>
SQL Server (version 4.2 and later) allow transaction logs to be dumped while this option is turned on, provided that no non-logged activity has taken place since the last database dump. SQL Server detects whether any non-logged operations have been performed in a database. If an attempt is made to dump the transaction log to a physical dump device and it detects that non-logged operations have been done, it raises a version of the 4207 error, stating:</p>
<pre><code>DUMP TRANsaction is not allowed while the select into/bulk copy option is enabled or if a non-logged operation has occurred: use DUMP DATABASE, or disable the option with sp_dboption.</code></pre>
<p>
As the error states, it is necessary to turn off the <b>select into/bulkcopy</b> option and dump the database before transaction log dumps can be issued.</p>
