The Task Scheduling window appears.
</li>
<li>
To view a list of existing tasks (both scheduled and disabled) for this server, select the Task List tab. The following information is displayed:<ul>
<li>
<b>Task</b> is the task name.</li>
<li>
<b>Owner</b> is the task owner (usually the task creator).</li>
<li>
<b>Type</b> is the type of task. CmdExec is an operating system command or executable file. TSQL is a Transact-SQL statement. Distribution, LogReader, and Sync are replication tasks.</li>
<li>
<b>Frequency</b> is the task's schedule type: Recurring, One Time, or On Demand. (An on-demand task is run by an alert when the alert occurs).</li>
<li>
<b>Last Run Date</b> is the day the task last ran.</li>
<li>
<b>Last Run Time</b> is the time of day the task last ran.</li>
<li>
<b>Enabled</b> tells you whether the task is enabled or disabled.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
To view a list of the tasks that are currently running, choose the Running Tasks tab. The following information is displayed:<ul>
<li>
<b>Task</b> is the task name.</li>
<li>
<b>Owner</b> is the task owner (usually the task creator).</li>
<li>
<b>Type</b> is the type of task. CmdExec is an operating system command or executable file. TSQL is a Transact-SQL statement. Distribution, LogReader, and Sync are replication tasks.</li>
<li>
<b>Start Date </b>is the first day on which the recurring task will be executed.</li>
<li>
<b>Status</b> displays status information about the task.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<b>Note</b>  <i>Queued</i> tasks are also shown in the Running Tasks tab. For subsystems (task type) other than TSQL, a task may be queued if it is scheduled to run but there are no free threads available in the subsystem. The maximum number of threads available to a subsystem can be changed using <b>regedt32</b>. The default for all subsystems (except TSQL) is 10.
