<p>
There are many ways you can adjust the appearance and behavior of Microsoft Windows to suit varying eyesight and motor skills without requiring any additional software or hardware. These include ways to adjust the appearance as well as the behavior of the mouse and keyboard. The specific methods available depend on which operating system you are using. Application notes are available describing the specific methods available for each operating system.</p>
