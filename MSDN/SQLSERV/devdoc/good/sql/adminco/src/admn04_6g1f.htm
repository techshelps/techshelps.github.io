<p>
Windows for Workgroups version 3.11 enhances the network integration available with Novell NetWare by offering peer network functionality, as well as connectivity to Windows NT-based computers. SQL Server clients running Windows for Workgroups can be configured in several ways by using the Network Setup application.</p>
<p>
If only Windows support for Novell NetWare is installed (and Microsoft Windows Network is not installed), then you are using the Novell NetWare IPX protocol (IPXODI). This protocol supports SPX as the interprocess communication (IPC) method for connecting to SQL Server. Use the SQL Client Configuration Utility to set the default network to Novell IPX/SPX. This configuration will allow Windows for Workgroups to use the IPX/SPX Net-Library to connect to SQL Server 6.0 running NWLink.</p>
<p>
If only the Microsoft Windows Network is installed (and Windows support for Novell NetWare is not installed), then you can still use IPX to connect to SQL Server 6.0. Use the Drivers button to ensure that the IPX/SPX Compatible Transport With NetBIOS network protocol is installed. This IPX protocol is included with Windows for Workgroups 3.11 and is similar to the NWLink IPX/SPX protocol. This protocol supports named pipes as the interprocess communication (IPC) method for connecting to SQL Server. Use the SQL Client Configuration Utility to set the default network to Named Pipes. This configuration will allow Windows for Workgroups to use the Named Pipes Net-Library to connect to SQL Server running NWLink.</p>
<p>
If both the Microsoft Windows Network and Windows support for Novell NetWare are installed, you can use either the Named Pipes or IPX/SPX Net-Library to connect to SQL Server running NWLink. Using IPX/SPX is only allowed in this configuration if IPX/ODI drivers are loaded and WFW is in dual net mode.</p>
<p>
If integrated security is required, the Named Pipes or Multi-Protocol Net-Libraries are necessary. If data encryption is required, the Multi-Protocol Net-Library is necessary.</p>
