<h3><a name="_database_owner"></a>Database Owner</h3>
<p>
The database owner (DBO) is the creator of a database. The system administrator grants to users the authority to create databases.</p>
<p>
The DBO has full privileges inside the database that he or she owns. The DBO can:
<ul>
<li>
Allow users access to the database.</li>
<li>
Grant users permission to create objects and execute commands within the database.</li>
<li>
Set up groups (which make it easy to grant and revoke permissions). By default, each user is a member of the <i>public</i> group unless explicitly assigned to another group.</li>
<li>
Assign users to groups and add guest accounts, which give users limited access to a database.</li>
</ul>
<p>
A database owner logs in to SQL Server by using an assigned login ID and password. In his or her own database, the user is recognized as DBO; in other databases, the database owner is known by his or her database username.</p>
<p>
When SQL Server is installed, the system administrator is the database owner of the <i>master</i> database. The system administrator is also treated as database owner of any databases he or she uses.</p>
<p>
DBO status can be reassigned to a different user. Only one login ID can be DBO, although other login IDs can be aliased to DBO.</p>
<p>
