<h1><a name="_error_1206"></a>Error 1206</h1>
<h4>Severity Level 20</h4>
<h4>Message Text</h4>
<pre>Locksleep was called with incorrect process id. Process %d is trying to sleep on itself.
</pre>
<h4>Explanation</h4>
<p>
This error occurs when a process asks SQL Server to call this routine and the process ID passed to the routine is the same as that of the calling process. This can happen as a result of the SQL Server running out of locks, or after an abnormally terminated process has not freed all of its locks. SQL Server sometimes puts a process to sleep while it is waiting for another process to free a lock. It does this by calling an internal "locksleep" routine.</p>
<h4>Action</h4>
<p>
You must restart SQL Server to correct this error. Examine the SQL Server error log to see if there are any other error messages. If there are errors indicating that the server is out of locks (error 1204), use the <b>sp_configure</b> system stored procedure to add more locks to your system. For more information, see the explanation for error 1204.</p>
