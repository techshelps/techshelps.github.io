<h2><a name="_stopping_replication_from_a_publisher"></a>Stopping Replication from a Publisher</h2>
<p>
There are a several ways you can stop replication while administering a publication server. While managing a server's publications, you can remove a publication, which cancels replication of that collection of tables, or remove an article from a publication, which cancels replication of that table. Or, while managing publications on the publication server, you can "un-subscribe" one or more subscription servers from a particular article. </p>
<p>
You cannot remove a publication or article that has an existing subscription. Before removing a publication or an article, you must drop all subscriptions.</p>
