<h3><a name="_backing_up_the_msdb_database"></a>Backing Up the <i>msdb</i> Database</h3>
<p>
The <i>msdb</i> database supports SQL Executive and provides a storage area for scheduling information. The <i>msdb</i> database is backed up in the same way as user databases and should be dumped regularly and frequently. </p>
<p>
It is important to make backups of <i>msdb</i> regularly. This database is modified by such things as the tasks that you schedule from the Task Scheduling window, the automatic backups you schedule from the Database Backup/Restore window, and all replication tasks (which are automatically created as necessary, if the server is configured as a replication distributor).</p>
<p>
Because the <b>setup</b> program installs <i>msdb</i> and its transaction log on separate devices, you can perform both database and transaction log dumps for <i>msdb</i>.</p>
