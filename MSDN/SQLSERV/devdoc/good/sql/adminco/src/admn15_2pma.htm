<p>
Subscribers are the least affected of the servers that participate in a data replication system. Replication is essentially transparent to a subscription server. The subscriber receives replicated data as if it were sent by a SQL Server client. </p>
<p>
Replication information concerning the last received transaction is maintained with the <i>job_id</i> column of the <i>MSlast_job_info</i> table, which is resident within each destination database. There is no specific replication information preserved within the transaction log of a subscription server. </p>
<p>
The important issue when considering the backup of a subscription server is that the subscribed database must be able to be recovered to a known point in time. This can be accomplished through the use of:
<ul>
<li>
Scheduled database dumps, combined with scheduled transaction log dumps which reduce the size of the subscription server's transaction log</li>
<li>
Scheduled database dumps that rely on the database option Truncate Log On Checkpoint to reduce the size of the transaction log</li>
</ul>
<p>
In both these cases the backup events occur on a scheduled basis, and the administrator can count on a preserving an image of each subscription server's database within a specific period of time. This is an important issue when determining the replication cleanup schedule of the associated distribution server(s).</p>
