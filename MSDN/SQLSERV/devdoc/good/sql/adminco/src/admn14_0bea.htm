<h2><a name="_using_a_remote_distributor"></a>Using a Remote Distributor</h2>
<p>
Here we will show you how to configure replication so that separate servers perform the publication and distribution roles. This configuration is useful when the publication server¾for example, a heavily used online transaction processing (OLTP) server¾should be freed from the distribution role because of performance and storage space considerations. The publication server must be connected to the distribution server by a reliable, high-speed communications link.</p>
<p>
In this example:
<ul>
<li>
The server AKITA will be configured as a publication server.</li>
<li>
The server MALAMUTE will be configured as a distribution server for AKITA.</li>
<li>
The servers AIREDALE, COLLIE, and MUTT will be configured as subscription servers to AKITA.</li>
</ul>

<h5><img src="../../../../images/wedge.gif" border=0>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To set up the replication topology using a remote distributor</h5>
<ol>
<li>
On MALAMUTE, verify that at least 16 MB of memory is assigned to SQL Server.<p>
From the Server Manager window, select MALAMUTE; from the Server menu, choose Configurations; and from the Server Configuration/Options dialog box that appears, select the Configuration tab. Verify that the <i>memory</i> setting is 8192 or greater. If it is not, change it, and then restart the server.
<p>
The distribution server (MALAMUTE) must have at least 16 MB of memory assigned.
</li>
<li>
Install replication publishing on MALMUTE.<ul>
<li>
From the Server menu, choose Replication Configuration, and from the drop-down menu that appears, choose Install Publishing. The Install Replication Publishing dialog box appears. By default, the Local option is selected, and the Database Name box has an entry of <i>distribution</i>.</li>
<li>
Add a device for the distribution database by choosing <b>&lt;new&gt;</b> from the Data Device box and completing the New Device dialog box that appears. Name the device <i>distdata</i>, and give it a size of 60 MB.</li>
<li>
Add a device for the distribution database transaction log by choosing <b>&lt;new&gt;</b> from the Log Device box and completing the New Device dialog box that appears. Name the device <i>distlog</i>, and give it a size of 30 MB.</li>
<li>
Choose OK. A dialog box asks whether you will configure publication options for this server at this time.</li>
<li>
 Choose Yes. The Replication-Publishing dialog box appears.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
Allow MALAMUTE to distribute for AKITA.<ul>
<li>
Choose the Distribution Publishers button. The Replication-Distribution dialog box appears.</li>
<li>
Select the Enable checkbox for AKITA. This allows MALAMUTE to distribute for AKITA.</li>
<li>
Choose OK. The Replication-Publishing dialog box returns.</li>
<li>
Choose OK.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
Install replication publishing on AKITA.<ul>
<li>
From the Server Manager window, choose AKITA; from the Server menu, choose Replication Configuration; and from the drop-down menu that appears, choose Install Publishing. The Install Replication Publishing dialog box appears.</li>
<li>
Choose the Remote option, and then from the list under Use Existing Remote Distribution Server, choose MALAMUTE.</li>
<li>
Choose OK. A dialog box asks whether you will configure publication options for this server at this time.</li>
<li>
 Choose Yes. The Replication-Publishing dialog box appears.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
Set the publishing options for AKITA.<ul>
<li>
Under Enable Publishing to These Servers, select the Enable check boxes for AIREDALE, COLLIE, and MUTT. </li>
<li>
Under Publishing Databases, select the check box for the databases that will be authorized to publish. <p>
This does not publish the databases, but it does authorize the databases to publish data.
</li>
<li>
Choose the OK button.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
Set the subscription options for each subscriber. For AIREDALE, COLLIE, and MUTT perform these steps:<ul>
<li>
From the Server Manager window, select the subscription server (for example, AIREDALE); from the Server menu, choose Replication Configuration; and from the drop-down menu that appears, choose Subscribing. The Replication-Subscribing dialog box appears.</li>
<li>
Under Enable Subscribing from These Servers, select the Enable check box for AKITA.</li>
<li>
Under Subscribing Databases, select the Enable check box for the databases that will be authorized to be destination databases.<p>
This does not subscribe the databases to any publications, but it does authorize the databases to subscribe.
</li>
<li>
Choose OK.</li>
</ul>
<p>
You have finished setting up your example replication topology using a remote distributor.
</li>
<li>
To view a graphic depiction of the replication topology that you have set up, from the Server Manager window, choose AKITA, and then from the toolbar, choose the Replication Topology button.<p>
The Replication Topology dialog box appears.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
You can now create publications on AKITA and subscribe to those publications and articles from AIREDALE, COLLIE, and MUTT. MALAMUTE will act as the distribution server.</p>
