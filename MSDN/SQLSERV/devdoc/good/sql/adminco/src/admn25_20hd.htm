<h1><a name="_error_511"></a>Error 511</h1>
<h4>Severity Level 16</h4>
<h4>Message Text</h4>
<pre>Updated or inserted row is bigger than maximum size (%d bytes) allowed for this table.
</pre>
<h4>Explanation</h4>
<p>
This error occurs when you attempt to insert a row that is larger than the maximum defined for that table, or when the definition for a temporary table referenced by a stored procedure is not as expected. This error occurs in the following situations:
<ul>
<li>
The row you try to insert into a table is too big to fit into a data page.<p>
In SQL Server, the maximum allowable size of a row in a table is 1962. A row cannot be split across data pages. A data page is 2K in size and consists of the data row and some internal data structures.
</li>
<li>
If changes have been made to the <i>model </i>database.<p>
A stored procedure that uses temporary tables may be invalidated when a new object is added to the <i>model </i>database and SQL Server is shut down and restarted. When the <i>tempdb</i> database is rebuilt, the new object in the <i>model</i> database becomes an object in <i>tempdb</i> as well. This new object takes the object ID used by the stored procedure to reference the temporary table. If one new object in <i>model</i> is added, the stored procedure using temporary table(s) may be invalidated. If two objects are added, two references to temporary tables in stored procedures can be invalidated, and so on.
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Action</h4>
<p>
If the definition for a temporary table referenced by a stored procedure is not as expected, drop and re-create the affected stored procedure. If the stored procedure involved is a system stored procedure, re-execute the installation scripts that will drop and re-create the affected system stored procedure.</p>
