<p>
<b>Note</b>  When a publication server acts as its own distribution server, the following information applies to the distribution database on the publisher. When a publication server uses a remote distribution server, the following information applies to the distribution database on that remote distribution server.</p>
<p>
A distribution server retains individual transactions within the tables of the distribution database until they are applied to all eligible subscribers. The distribution server also preserves a transaction ID within the <i>MSjobs</i> table of its distribution database. This provides a pointer into the publication servers' transaction log, providing access to the last distributed transaction that was successfully transferred from that publication server into the distribution database. </p>
<p>
There is no replication-specific information preserved within the transaction log of a distribution server. </p>
<p>
For a distribution server to be automatically recovered using a previously performed database or transaction log backup, after recovery the <i>MSjobs</i> table must contain a valid pointer to a transaction that still resides within the publication server's transaction log. This pointer defines the relationship between these servers. </p>
<p>
Transaction log dumps of published databases truncate the publishing database's transaction log and may remove the transaction pointed to by the image of the <i>MSjobs</i> table preserved in an earlier backup of the distribution server. </p>
<p>
<b>Important</b>  To automatically recover a distribution server, the database or transaction log dump used must recover the distribution server to a point in time later than the last transaction log dump of all associated publication servers. To ensure that the distribution server can always be automatically recovered from a backup, the administrator needs to establish a coordinated backup of these associated servers to ensure that a backup is performed on the distribution server after every transaction log backup of any associated publication server.</p>
