<h1><a name="_error_913"></a>Error 913</h1>
<h4>Severity Level 22</h4>
<h4>Message Text</h4>
<pre>Could not find row in Sysdatabases with database id %d. Run DBCC CHECKTABLE on Sysdatabases.
</pre>
<h4>Explanation</h4>
<p>
This error can occur if there is a problem with the view resolution process. During execution of various compiled objects in a database that reference the database <i>dbid </i>(such as stored procedures and views), it is a normal process to resolve the <i>dbid </i>with other structures within the database. When a compiled object is first created, the <i>dbid </i>where the object is located is embedded in the compiled code. For example, when a view is accessed or a stored procedure is executed, the rights to access the view or execute the stored procedure are checked. </p>
<h4>Action</h4>
<p>
If the error occurs when a stored procedure or view is accessed, you may be able to correct the problem by simply dropping and re-creating the database object (stored procedure or view).</p>
<p>
If this error continues to occur, contact your primary support provider and have the SQL Server error log and any additional information relevant to the circumstances when the error occurred available for review.</p>
