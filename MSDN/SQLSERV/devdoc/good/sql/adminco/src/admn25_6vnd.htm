<h4>Severity Level</h4>
<h4>Message Text</h4>
<pre>Unable to read login packet(s)
</pre>
<h4>Explanation</h4>
<p>
This error occurs if a client starts to connect but never successfully completes the attempt because of a client operating-system or application failure. It can also be caused when the network fails between the time a connection attempt is initiated and when it is complete.</p>
<p>
Wide area networks are more susceptible than local area networks to this type of problem because such networks often have many routers and media types that can delay the delivery of packets to the server and/or fragment or split them.</p>
<h4>Action</h4>
<p>
Verify that all clients connecting to the affected SQL Server are using the latest version of all the SQL Server client components, including the Net-Libraries, DB-Library, and/or ODBC drivers.</p>
