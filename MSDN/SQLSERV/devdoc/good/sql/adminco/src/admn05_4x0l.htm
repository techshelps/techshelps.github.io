<h2><a name="_dropping_a_dump_device"></a>Dropping a Dump Device</h2>
<p>
There are two ways to drop a dump device using SQL Enterprise Manager: from the Database Backup/Restore dialog box while you manage backup and restoration, or directly from the Server Manager window.</p>
<p>
When you drop a dump device, all data that has been backed up to that device is also dropped.</p>
<h5><img src="../../../../images/wedge.gif" border=0>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To drop a dump device from the Server Manager window</h5>
<ol>
<li>
In the Server Manager window, select a server, and then open its Dump Devices folder.</li>
<li>
Click the right mouse button on a dump device, and then from the drop-down menu that appears, choose Delete.<p>
A confirmation box appears. 
</li>
<li>
To confirm deletion, choose Yes.<p>
The dump device is dropped.
</li>
<li>
Delete the device's operating system file.<p>
You must delete the device's filename from the directory where it is located. Use File Manager or the operating-system <b>del</b> command. It is not necessary to shut down and restart SQL Server.
