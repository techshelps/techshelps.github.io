<h2><a name="_running_out_of_procedure_cache"></a>Running Out of Procedure Cache</h2>
<p>
Because the procedure cache is finite, you can occasionally expect to run out of space. Specific problems that you might encounter include:
<ul>
<li>
Not enough free space in the procedure cache to load another query tree or plan for all users needing them at the same time. Procedure cache space can be freed only if a query tree or plan is not currently in use.<p>
When there is insufficient space to load another query tree or plan, error 701 occurs. For information about correcting this error, see the description of error 701 in Chapter 25, "Handling Common Error Messages."
</li>
<li>
The maximum number of procedures or other compiled objects is already in use. The number of objects allowed in the procedure cache is a function of the procedure cache size (and is recorded in the error log during startup).<p>
If the number of procedures or objects in use exceeds the maximum, error 701 occurs. For additional information about correcting this error, see the description of error 701 in Chapter 25, "Handling Common Error Messages."
