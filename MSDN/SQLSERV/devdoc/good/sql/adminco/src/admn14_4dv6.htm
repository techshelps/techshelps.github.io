<h2><a name="_stopping_replication_from_a_distributor"></a>Stopping Replication from a Distributor</h2>
<p>
From a remote distribution server, you can stop replication by removing the authorization that allows a publication server to use that remote distribution server. </p>
<h5><img src="../../../../images/wedge.gif" border=0>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To remove the authorization that allows a publication server to use a remote distribution server</h5>
<ol>
<li>
From the Server Manager window, select a remote distribution server. </li>
<li>
From the Server menu, choose Replication Configuration, and then from the drop-down menu that appears, choose Publishing. <p>
The Replication-Publishing dialog box appears. 
</li>
<li>
Choose the Distribution Publishing button. <p>
The Replication-Distribution dialog box appears.
<p>

</li>
<li>
To stop a publication server from using this server as its remote distribution server, under Distribution Publishers, clear the option box for that server. <p>
That publication server can no longer use this server as a remote distributor. Published data from that server is no longer replicated but will continue to be preserved in the transaction log.
<p>
If that publisher is later reconfigured to become a combined publisher/distributor or to use this server or another server as its remote distributor, every publication on the publication server must be republished, and all its subscribers must be resubscribed.
</li>
<li>
Choose OK. </li>
</ol>
<p>
From any distribution server (either a remote distribution server or a combined publisher/distributor), you can suspend, edit, or drop scheduled replication tasks that are performed by the log reader process, the synchronization process, or the distribution process. For example, stopping a log reader task is a useful way to stop replication to all subscribers from a selected publication database.</p>
<h5><img src="../../../../images/wedge.gif" border=0>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To stop a log reader task for a publication</h5>
<ol>
<li>
From the Server Manager window, select the distribution server.</li>
<li>
Under the selected server, double-click the Executive icon.<p>
<img src="images/ad14_850.gif" border=0>
<p>
The Task Scheduling window appears, with the Task List tab selected.
</li>
<li>
From the task list, double-click on the task that will be suspended.<p>
For example, if the publication server AIREDALE has published a database named <i>inventory</i>, and if there are one or more publications from that database, then the distribution server task list will display a task named <b>AIREDALE_inventory</b>, with a Type of <b>LogReader</b>.
<p>
The Edit Task dialog box appears.
</li>
<li>
Clear the Enabled option.</li>
<li>
Choose Modify.<p>
The task is suspended. It appears in the task list and retains all its settings but will not be run by SQL Executive.
<p>
To reinstate a suspended task, repeat the preceding procedure, but in step 4 select the Enabled option. For more information about suspending, editing, or dropping tasks, see Chapter 16, <a href="admn16_5oab.htm">Scheduling Tasks</a>.
