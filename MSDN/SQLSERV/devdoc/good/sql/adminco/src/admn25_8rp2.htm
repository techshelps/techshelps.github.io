<h1><a name="_error_5006"></a>Error 5006</h1>
<h4>Severity Level 16</h4>
<h4>Message Text</h4>
<pre>Could not find enough space on disks to extend database %.*s
</pre>
<h4>Explanation</h4>
<p>
This error occurs when an alter database statement references a device that is completely full.</p>
<p>
This error message does not usually appear in the error log. But if the device takes up the space on a physical disk drive as well as the space allocated for SQL Server, messages stating that the file system is full will appear in the error log. If this occurs, you must correct the file-system problem as well as correct the SQL Server space problem.</p>
<p>
<b>Note</b>  If the device is not full but the ALTER DATABASE statement requests more space than is available on that device, the database will be extended and fill up the available space on the device. No error message will be displayed.</p>
<h4>Action</h4>
<p>
These are your options:
<ul>
<li>
In the ALTER DATABASE statement, specify a device that is large enough. Use the <b>sp_helpdevice</b> and <b>sp_helpdb</b> system stored procedures to identify devices that have enough room.</li>
<li>
Add a new device to SQL Server by using the DISK INIT statement. Then reference this device with the alter database statement.</li>
<li>
There is no performance benefit to keeping a database entirely on a single device. However, if this is necessary, follow these steps:<ol>
<li>
Back up all the databases on the device by dumping them to a valid dump device with the dump database statement.</li>
<li>
Drop the device by using the <b>sp_dropdevice</b> system stored procedure.</li>
<li>
Initialize a larger device with the disk init statement.</li>
<li>
Re-create the old databases on the new device. It is important to create the databases exactly like the old ones or errors will occur.</li>
<li>
Reload each database with the load database statement.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
For information about how to safely create, dump, load, and re-create databases, see the <i>Microsoft SQL Server Transact-SQL Reference</i> and Part 5, "Data Management."</p>
