<p>
As discussed previously, queries that include an ORDER BY clause often require the use of a temporary worktable. When the optimizer cannot use an available index for the ordering, it creates a worktable for use in sorting the result rows prior to returning them.</p>
<p>
The following example shows the worktable being created for the ORDER BY clause:</p>
<h4>Query:</h4>
<pre>SELECT *
FROM authors
ORDER BY city
</pre>
<h4>SHOWPLAN:</h4>
<pre>STEP 1
The type of query is INSERT
The update mode is direct
Worktable created for ORDER BY
FROM TABLE
authors
Nested iteration
Table Scan
TO TABLE
Worktable 1

STEP 2
The type of query is SELECT
This step involves sorting
FROM TABLE
Worktable 1
Using GETSORTED Table Scan
