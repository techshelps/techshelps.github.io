<h2><a name="_viewing_replication_tasks_and_the_task_history"></a>Viewing Replication Tasks and the Task History</h2>
<p>
When you use SQL Enterprise Manager to set up replication, it automatically creates the replication tasks that are required. You can view a list of all scheduled tasks, a list of tasks that are currently running, and a history for each replication task.</p>
<h5><img src="../../../../images/wedge.gif" border=0>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To view the task list and the task queue</h5>
<ol>
<li>
From the Server Manager window, select a server.<p>
This is the server for which tasks will be viewed.
</li>
<li>
Under the selected server, double-click the Executive icon.<p>

<p>
Or from the toolbar, choose the Set Schedules button.
<p>

</li>
<li>
To view a list of existing tasks (both scheduled and disabled) for this server, select the Task List tab. The following information is displayed:<ul>
<li>
<b>Task</b> is the task name.</li>
<li>
<b>Owner</b> is the task owner (usually the task creator).</li>
<li>
<b>Type</b> is the type of task. CmdExec is an operating system command or executable file. TSQL is a Transact-SQL statement. Distribution, LogReader, and Sync are replication tasks.</li>
<li>
<b>Frequency</b> is the task's schedule type: Recurring, One Time, or On Demand. (An on-demand task is run by an alert when the alert occurs).</li>
<li>
<b>Last Run Date</b> is the day the task last ran.</li>
<li>
<b>Last Run Time</b> is time of day the task last ran.</li>
<li>
<b>Enabled</b> tells you whether the task is enabled or disabled.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
To view a list of the tasks that are currently running, choose the Running Tasks tab. The following information is displayed:<ul>
<li>
<b>Task</b> is the task name.</li>
<li>
<b>Owner</b> is the task owner (usually the task creator).</li>
<li>
<b>Type</b> is the type of task. CmdExec is an operating system command or executable file. TSQL is a Transact-SQL statement. Distribution, LogReader, and Sync are replication tasks.</li>
<li>
<b>Start Date </b>is the first day on which the recurring task will be executed.</li>
<li>
<b>Status</b> displays status information about the task.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<b>Note</b>  <i>Queued</i> tasks are also shown in the Running Tasks tab. For subsystems (task type) other than TSQL, a task may be queued if it is scheduled to run but there are no free threads available in the subsystem. The maximum number of threads available to a subsystem can be changed using <b>regedt32</b>. The default for all subsystems (except TSQL) is 10. 
</li>
<li>
To update the display with current information, choose the Refresh button.<p>

</li>
</ol>
<p>
You can view a task's history, which provides information about the last run date of a task, the time and duration of the last run, the status of that run, and whether a user was sent e-mail by SQL Executive. You can also view any messages sent by SQL Executive.</p>
<h5><img src="../../../../images/wedge.gif" border=0>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To view the history of a replication task</h5>
<ol>
<li>
From the Server Manager window, select a server.<p>
This is the server for which task history will be viewed.
</li>
<li>
Under the selected server, double-click the Executive icon.<p>

<p>
<img src="images/ad15_852.gif" border=0>
</li>
<li>
From the Task List, select the replication task to view history for.<p>
Replication tasks have an entry in the Type column of Distribution, LogReader, or Sync.
</li>
<li>
Choose the Task History button.<p>
<img src="images/ad12_07.gif" border=0>
<p>
The Task History dialog box appears. 
<p>
<img src="images/ad15_853.gif" border=0>
<p>
The following information is displayed:
<ul>
<li>
<b>Run Date </b>shows the date the information is about.</li>
<li>
<b>Run Time </b>shows when the task ran.</li>
<li>
<b>Status</b> shows whether the task completed successfully.</li>
<li>
<b>E-mailed</b> indicates whether e-mail was sent by SQL Executive after task execution.</li>
<li>
<b>Run Duration </b>shows the amount of time the task took to run. For this release, the value will always be zero.</li>
<li>
<b>Message </b>displays any messages that resulted from the task execution.<p>
If selected for preservation in the Windows NT Event (application) log, success and failure messages can also be viewed using the Windows NT Event Viewer. This avoids the 256-character truncation that will occur when viewing task history.
</li>
<li>
<b>Clear All </b>clears (erases) the history.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
