<h1><a name="_error_1608"></a>Error 1608</h1>
<h4>Severity Level 21</h4>
<h4>Message Text</h4>
<pre>A network error was encountered while sending results to the front end. Check the SQL Server errorlog for more information.
</pre>
<h4>Explanation</h4>
<p>
This error occurs when a front-end process stopped without notifying SQL Server, so a subsequent attempt by SQL Server to send results to the front-end failed. Some of the possible reasons a front-end process can disappear are:
<ul>
<li>
The front-end application either ended abnormally or was terminated.</li>
<li>
The front-end computer was turned off or restarted.</li>
<li>
A network failure occurred.</li>
<li>
The network was shut down.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<b>Note</b>  Using <small>ctrl+c</small> to exit from an application should not result in this error.</p>
<p>
Usually, error 1608 is not serious and can be viewed as notification that a front-end process no longer exists.</p>
<h4>Action</h4>
<p>
Do not be concerned if this error occurs sporadically. If the error occurs frequently and continually, however, or if it occurs frequently for short periods of time, it might be a result of excessive network traffic or network problems. If you suspect network problems, have your network administrator isolate the problem by running diagnostics on the network between the client and SQL Server. </p>
