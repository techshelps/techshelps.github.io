Using the scheduling engine, you can schedule and automate command executions, Transact-SQL statements, and replication tasks. Using the alerts management interface, you can set up SQL Enterprise Manager to automatically respond to SQL Server events by executing a predefined task or sending an alert or a page to selected users. Using SQLMail, you can send messages through the built-in mail application programming interface (MAPI) client interface in Windows NT. These messages can consist of short text strings, the output from a query, or an attached file. Using SQL Performance Monitor, SQL Enterprise Workbench, and the <b>sp_monitor</b> system stored procedure, you can monitor server activity and performance. The chapters in this part explain how.</p>
