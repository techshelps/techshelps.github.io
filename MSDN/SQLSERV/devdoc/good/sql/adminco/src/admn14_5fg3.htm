<h2><a name="_setting_publication_options"></a>Setting Publication Options</h2>
<p>
The server publication options determine the servers that are authorized to subscribe to this server's publications, the schedule by which replication will be performed for each subscription server, which of this server's databases are authorized to publish data, and the directory used as the distribution working directory. For a server that will act as a remote distribution server, the server publication options also determine which publication servers are authorized to use it as a remote distribution server.</p>
<h5><img src="../../../../images/wedge.gif" border=0>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To set a server's publication options</h5>
<ol>
<li>
In the previous topic, Installing or Selecting a Distribution Database, if you chose the Yes button in step 6, then the Replication-Publishing dialog box is already displayed.<p>
If not, then from the Server Manager window, select a server; from the Server menu, choose Replication Configuration; and from the drop-down menu that appears, choose Publishing. 
<p>
The Replication-Publishing dialog box appears.
<p>

</li>
<li>
Define the servers that will be permitted to subscribe to this server's publications by selecting them in the Enable Publishing to These Servers list.<p>
If a server is not registered with SQL Enterprise Manager or is not set as a remote server to this server, it will not be listed. To register a server, choose the New Server button and complete the Register Server dialog box that appears.
</li>
<li>
To set a subscription server's distribution schedule to a setting other than the default (continuous replication), select the Distribution Schedule cell for that server, choose the Distribution Options button, and complete the Distribution Options dialog box that appears. <p>
<img src="images/ad14_901.gif" border=0>
<p>
The Distribution Options dialog box contains these elements:
<ul>
<li>
<i>Commit Every &lt;x&gt; Transactions to Subscriber</i> specifies the maximum number of transactions that will be sent to the subscription server as a single unit. If the number of transactions marked for replication exceeds this number, several units will be sent. (Note that tuning this number can improve your distribution throughput.)</li>
<li>
<i>Distribution Schedule</i> displays the distribution schedule (the interval at which transactions will be replicated to the subscription server).</li>
<li>
<i>Change</i> opens the Task Scheduling dialog box, where you can change the distribution schedule for the subscription server.</li>
<li>
<i>Retention Period After Distribution (hours)</i> determines how long transaction information is retained in the distribution database after it is applied to the subscriber.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
Under Publishing Databases, select the databases that will be allowed to publish data.<p>
If you have not yet created all the databases to be published, go ahead and complete the publication options now. You can later create the necessary databases and then return and edit the publication options to authorize the new databases for publication.
</li>
<li>
To change the distribution working directory, type a new Universal Naming Convention (UNC) path in the Working Directory box.<p>
This directory is used to store the schema scripts and data synchronization files. The default is \\<i>servername</i>\C$\SQL60\REPLDATA, where <i>servername</i> is the name of the distribution server.
<p>
A UNC path takes the form \\<i>servername</i>\<i>sharename</i>\<i>directory.</i>
</li>
<li>
If this server will act as remote distribution server for other publication servers:<ul>
<li>
Choose the Distribution Publishers button. The Replication-Distribution dialog box appears.<p>
<img src="images/ad14_904.gif" border=0>
</li>
<li>
In the Replication - Distribution dialog box, select the servers that will be permitted to use this server as their remote distribution server. <p>
If a server is not registered with SQL Enterprise Manager or is not set as a remote server to this server, it will not be listed. To register a server, choose the New Server button, and complete the Register Server dialog box that appears.
</li>
<li>
Choose OK.</li>
