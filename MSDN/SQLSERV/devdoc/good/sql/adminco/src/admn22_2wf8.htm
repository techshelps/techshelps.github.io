<p>
To ensure that a transaction is recoverable, when a transaction is committed, SQL Server logs all information about the transaction in the transaction log. The amount of data logged for a single transaction depends on the number of indexes affected, the amount of data changed, and the number of pages that must be allocated or deallocated.</p>
<p>
Depending on the transaction, certain other page management information might also be logged. For example, when a single row is updated, the following records might be written in the transaction log:
<ul>
<li>
A data delete record, including all data in the original row</li>
<li>
A data insert record, including all data in the modified row</li>
<li>
One index delete record for each index affected by the change</li>
<li>
One index insert record for each index affected by the change</li>
<li>
One page allocation record for each new data or index page required</li>
<li>
One page deallocation record for each data or index page freed</li>
</ul>
<p>
To ensure the recoverability of all transactions performed on SQL Server, transaction logging cannot be turned off. Any single Transact-SQL statement (or set of Transact-SQL statements within a BEGIN...COMMIT/ROLLBACK TRANSACTION block) that modifies data is considered a transaction and is therefore logged. You can, however, limit the amount of logging performed for specific operations, such as:
<ul>
<li>
Bulk copying data into a database using <b>bcp</b> in fast mode</li>
<li>
Performing a SELECT INTO query</li>
</ul>
<p>
<b>Important</b>  These non-logged operations cause the transaction log to get out of sync with the data in a database, which makes the transaction log useless for database recovery.</p>
<p>
After a non-logged operation has been performed, the transaction log can be truncated, but it cannot be dumped to a device. To allow the log to be dumped to a device, you must execute a DUMP DATABASE statement, which creates a new point of synchronization between the database and the transaction log.</p>
