<h3><a name="_the_repl_publisher_login_id"></a>The repl_publisher Login ID</h3>
<p>
The <b>repl_publisher</b> login ID is created automatically when a server is set as a subscription server. It allows replication processes on the distributor (which may be a separate distribution server or a combined publication/distribution server) to connect to a subscription server and replicate table schema and data to destination databases. This login ID should not be modified, nor should users use it to log in.</p>
<p>
When replication is set up, a subscription server is automatically set up as remote server to its distributor. When replication processes from the distributor connect to the subscription server, they connect using the <b>repl_publisher</b> login ID. </p>
<p>
When a database on the subscription server is marked for subscription, the <b>repl_publisher</b> login ID is aliased to DBO on that destination database. This allows replication processes to create tables and schemas, and to perform inserts, updates, and deletes.</p>
<p>
It is possible to manually alias the <b>repl_publisher</b> login ID to a user with lesser database privileges than DBO, but this should be done with care because all replicated objects within the database will be created and maintained using this login ID.</p>
<p>
