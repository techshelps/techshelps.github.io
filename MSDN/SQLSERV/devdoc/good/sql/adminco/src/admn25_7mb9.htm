<h1><a name="_error_3105"></a>Error 3105</h1>
<h4>Severity Level 16</h4>
<h4>Message Text </h4>
<pre>Data on dump will not fit into current database. Need %ld Mbyte database.
</pre>
<h4>Explanation </h4>
<p>
An attempt was made to load a database dump into a database that is not as large as the dumped database. You cannot use DUMP DATABASE or LOAD DATABASE to shrink a database, regardless of the amount of actual data in the database.</p>
<h4>Action</h4>
<p>
If your goal is to load the database from the dump, you must increase the size of the destination database to at least the configured size of the dumped database. You can do this using either the ALTER DATABASE statement or by dropping the database and then creating a larger one.</p>
<p>
If your goal is to shrink the total size of a database, you cannot use DUMP and LOAD. You must copy all the data out of the database using <b>bcp</b>, drop the database, create a smaller database, create the database structure with scripts, and then reload the data with <b>bcp</b>. </p>
<p>
If the destination database does not have identical data and log mapping, and identical segment mappings, as the dumped database, error 2558 might also occur. For additional information about segment mapping, see the description of error 2558.</p>
