<h1><a name="_error_1521"></a>Error 1521</h1>
<h4>Severity Level 18</h4>
<h4>Message Text</h4>
<pre>Sort failed because a table in tempdb used for the processing of the query had a bad data page count. Tempdb should not have been damaged.
</pre>
<h4>Explanation</h4>
<p>
This error can occur when you are running complex queries that use inefficient query plans.  Effective use of indexes can improve query performance. </p>
<p>
In most cases, you can resolve the error immediately by inspecting and redefining the indexes on the affected tables.</p>
<h4>Action</h4>
<p>
Follow these steps:
<ol>
<li>
Run the UPDATE STATISTICS statement on the table(s) in question. This will update the information about the distribution of key values in the indexes of the specified table(s).</li>
<li>
Modify the query so that the optimizer produces a different query plan. Here are examples of how this can be done:<ul>
<li>
Use SHOWPLAN to make sure your query is using indexes in the query plan.</li>
<li>
Change BETWEEN clauses to the corresponding &lt;= and &gt;= expressions.</li>
<li>
Make sure your indexes have been designed correctly and efficiently.</li>
<li>
Use optimizer hints to manually control the access plan.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
Examine the table structure of the table(s) involved to ensure that normalization is not an issue.</li>
</ol>
<p>
If the problem persists, contact your primary support provider for assistance. Have the table and index structure of the table(s) involved, as well as a copy of the problematic query, available for review.</p>
