<p>
Since disk failure can impair system security, the WAITFOR statement can perform certain tasks when a disk becomes unmirrored. This is syntax for the WAITFOR statement:</p>
<p>
BEGIN<br>
WAITFOR MIRROREXIT<br>
&lt;<i>commands to be executed</i>&gt;<br>
END</p>
<p>
The commands to be executed depend on the application. Some possibilities include adding warning messages in applications that perform updates and using <b>sp_dboption</b> to make certain databases read-only.</p>
<p>
<b>Note</b>  SQL Server can detect that a disk has become unmirrored only when it attempts to write to the mirror device. On mirrored databases, this occurs at a checkpoint or whenever the SQL Server buffer must be written to disk. On mirrored logs, a write occurs whenever a row is changed with UPDATE, INSERT, or DELETE. The WAITFOR MIRROREXIT statement is activated only by these events. </p>
