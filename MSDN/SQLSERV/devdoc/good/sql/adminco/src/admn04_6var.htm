<p>
If you experience difficulties establishing connections from Apple Macintosh clients via AppleTalk, check the Windows NT application log or the SQL Server error log, and verify that the AppleTalk Net-Library is loaded correctly. If it is not, the log will contain an error message.</p>
<p>
If the AppleTalk Net-Library is loaded properly on the server, you should see a message similar to the following in the Windows NT application log or the SQL Server error log:</p>
<pre>Using 'SSMSADSN.DLL' version '6.00.0.0' to listen on 'servicename'
</pre>
<h5><img src="../../../../images/wedge.gif" border=0>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To verify that a Macintosh client can connect to the server</h5>
<ol>
<li>
On the SQL Server computer that is running Windows NT with the Macintosh services installed, establish a Macintosh file share.</li>
<li>
From the Macintosh client, verify that the server's file share can be accessed.</li>
</ol>
<h5><img src="../../../../images/wedge.gif" border=0>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To verify that SQL Server is listening on AppleTalk and can accept a client connection</h5>
<ol>
<li>
Copy the client-side AppleTalk Net-Library (DBMSADSN.DLL) from the \SQL60\DLL directory of the server to the same directory of a remote Windows NT-based computer running the Windows NT Services for Macintosh.</li>
<li>
On the remote workstation, use the SQL Server Client Configuration Utility to change the default Net-Library to DBMSADSN.DLL.</li>
<li>
Attempt an ISQL connection with the AppleTalk service object name. For example:<pre>isql -Usa -P -Sservicename</pre>
<p>
If you can connect with ISQL and execute queries, the server is properly configured to listen on AppleTalk and is accepting connections.
<p>
<b>Note</b>  The Win32 AppleTalk (ADSP) client side Net-Library (DBMSADSN.DLL) is included for testing ADSP connections and troubleshooting AppleTalk connections between Macintosh clients and SQL Server. This Net-Library is only intended to used when testing connections from a remote client to SQL Server. If local connections are attempted via the ADSP Net-Library to a SQL Server listening on AppleTalk, a network error can be generated (Net-Library error 11: getsockopt()).
