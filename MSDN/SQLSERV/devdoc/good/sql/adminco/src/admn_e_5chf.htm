<p>
Microsoft SQL Server is a powerful multiuser relational database management system designed to support high-volume transaction processing, as well as decision-support applications. SQL Server provides data processing capabilities (reliability, data integrity, performance, security) that meet or exceed those found in production-oriented minicomputer- and mainframe-based database management systems. Because of its power and stability, Microsoft SQL Server is widely used in many diverse production environments. </p>
<p>
This appendix provides guidelines for proper backup and recovery of SQL Server databases running in production environments. </p>
