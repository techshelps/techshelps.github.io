<p>
It is important to perform regular backups of your databases and their transaction logs. If you perform regular backups, you will be able to recover from a failure (for example, from a disk failure) by restoring a database from its most recent backup. This chapter shows you how. It is divided into these sections: 
<ul>
<li>
<a href="admn12_82gj.htm">Basic Backup and Restore Operations</a> is a straightforward presentation of the procedures you use to perform backups, to schedule backups, to restore from those backups, and more. </li>
<li>
<a href="admn12_93dz.htm">More About Backing Up and Restoring</a> provides a more in-depth discussion and explanation of strategies and techniques used for backing up, restoring, and recovering databases. </li>
</ul>
<p>
Before implementing your backup and restoration strategies, also review the information about database devices, dump devices, databases, transaction logs, and storage management in Part 3, <a href="adpt_03_60fn.htm">Devices, Databases, and Drives</a>. </p>
<p>
Additional useful information can be found in Appendix E, <a href="admn_e_5chf.htm">Backup and Recovery Guidelines for Production Environments</a>. </p>
