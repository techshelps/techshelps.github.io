<h2><a name="_banyan_vines_clients"></a>Banyan VINES Clients</h2>
<p>
SQL Server supports Banyan VINES Sequenced Packet Protocol (SPP) as the IPC method across Banyan VINES IP network protocol. Banyan VINES support for Windows NT-based clients is available only on the Intel platform; it is not currently available on the MIPS or Alpha AXP platforms.</p>
<p>
MS-DOS- and Windows-based clients require Banyan VINES client software version 4.11(5) or later. Windows NT version 3.5-based clients require Banyan VINES client software version 5.56(2) or later. Contact your Banyan support provider for information about the latest supported client software for each client platform.</p>
<p>
A StreetTalk™ language PC-based service name has the form <i>servicename@group@org</i>, where <i>servicename</i> is the StreetTalk PC-based service name used by the SQL Server, <i>group</i> is the group, and <i>org</i> is the organization. (Note that the service name used by a SQL Server must first be created using the MSERVICE program included with your VINES software.)</p>
<p>
For Windows- or Windows NT-based clients, you can use the SQL Client Configuration Utility, as described earlier in this chapter, to set up Banyan VINES connections.</p>
<p>
If a client application gives a partial StreetTalk name (a name that doesn't include the group and organization) as the server name, the VINES SPP Net-Library will use standard VINES services to complete the rest of the StreetTalk name with your login defaults. If no PC-based service or nickname matching the server name is found within the user's own group and organization, the VINES SPP Net-Library looks for a special group named MSSQL within your organization. This allows network administrators to define a group of SQL Servers that are accessible with one-part names from all groups in the same organization.</p>
<p>
You can override the default name MSSQL by setting a <b>group@org</b> variable on each client to a <b>newgroup@org</b> value. Both the group and organization are required.</p>
<p>
For an MS-DOS-based client, this is an environment variable that must be set before the DBMSVINE.EXE Net-Library TSR is loaded. For example:</p>
<pre>SET group@org=SQLServers@xyzcorp
</pre>
<p>
For a Windows-based client, set <b>group@org</b> by adding a <b>[DBMSVINE]</b> section to your WIN.INI file. For example:</p>
<pre>[DBMSVINE]
group@org=SQLServers@xyzcorp
</pre>
<p>
For a Windows NT-based client, add a DBMSVINE key to the Windows NT Registry. Add the following key</p>
<p>
\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\SOFTWARE<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\Microsoft<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\ MSSQLServer<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\Client<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\DBMSVINE </p>
<p>
with a REG_SZ value <b>group@org</b><i> </i>set to <b>newgroup@org</b>.</p>
<p>
All of these examples change the default collection of SQL Servers to SQLServers@xyzcorp. Then, when any client application attempts to connect to a server named GIZMO, the VINES SPP Net-Library first looks for a PC-based service or nickname in your login group and then looks for one named GIZMO@SQLServers@xyzcorp.</p>
<p>
The VINES SPP Net-Library files do not support the use of StreetTalk names that contain embedded spaces, and they use one VINES IP socket per server and one SPP connection per database connection.</p>
