<h1><a name="_error_823"></a>Error 823 </h1>
<h4>Severity Level 24 </h4>
<h4>Message Text </h4>
<pre>I/O error detected during %S_MSG for %S_BUF 
</pre>
<h4>Explanation</h4>
<p>
SQL Server encountered an I/O error on a read or write request made to a device. This error usually indicates disk problems. The parameters in the error message refer to internal structures and don't often help determine which device is involved. However, additional kernel messages in the error log, recorded before error 823, should indicate which device is involved.</p>
<h4>Action</h4>
<p>
Check the accessibility and condition of the device in question. After you have identified and corrected the problem, run dbcc checkdb and dbcc checkalloc to ensure that no other damage was caused by the bad device. For information about using DBCC, see the <i>Microsoft SQL Server Transact-SQL Reference.</i></p>
<p>
In addition, run hardware diagnostics and correct any problems.</p>
