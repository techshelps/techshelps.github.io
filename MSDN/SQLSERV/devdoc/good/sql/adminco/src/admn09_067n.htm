<h2><a name="_denying_client.2d.requested_trusted_connections"></a>Denying Client-requested Trusted Connections</h2>
<p>
Regardless of the server's login security mode (integrated, mixed, or standard), ODBC and DB-Library client applications can be configured to always request a trusted (integrated security) connection from the server. This feature allows SQL Executive to connect to remote servers as long as SQL Executive is running under a properly configured Windows NT user account, (one that has been granted SA access to the SQL Server). </p>
<p>
This also allows users who have been granted SA privileges to access the SQL Server when they use a client application that is configured to force trusted connections (for example, ISQL/w). Note that the <b>setup</b> program, by default, automatically grants SQL Server system administrator privileges to members of the server's Administrators local group.</p>
<p>
Because the appropriate user privilege levels must exist if the login is to succeed, logging on over client-requested trusted connections can be prevented by performing these steps:
<ol>
<li>
Use the Windows NT User Manager utility to create a local Windows NT user group (for example, <i>SQLAdmins</i>) that contains no users.</li>
<li>
Use SQL Security Manager to grant System Administrator privilege to this empty group.</li>
<li>
Use SQL Security Manager to revoke System Administrator privilege from the local Administrators group.</li>
</ol>
<p>
Note that this will restrict applications and features that use forced trusted connections (such as SQL Enterprise Manager and replication). </p>
