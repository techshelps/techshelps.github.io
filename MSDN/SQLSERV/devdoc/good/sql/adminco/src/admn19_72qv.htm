<h2><a name="_viewing_the_application_log"></a>Viewing the Application Log</h2>
<p>
When SQL Server is configured to use the Windows NT application log, each SQL Server session writes new events to that log. The Windows NT application log is a special file that can be viewed and managed only by using Windows NT Event Viewer. Unlike the SQL Server error log, a new application log is not created each time you start SQL Server.</p>
<h5><img src="../../../../images/wedge.gif" border=0>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To view the Windows NT application log</h5>
<ol>
<li>
From the Administrative Tools program group, start the Event Viewer application.<p>

<p>
The Event Viewer window appears.
<p>

<p>
SQL Server events are identified by the entry <b>MSSQLServer</b> in the Source column. SQL Executive events are identified by the entry <b>SQLEXECUTIVE</b>.
</li>
<li>
To view the log of a remote computer, from the Log menu, choose Select Computer, and then complete the dialog box that appears.<p>
If you will be viewing the log of the local computer, skip this step. 
</li>
<li>
If the Application log is not displayed, from the Log menu, choose Application.<p>
There are three Windows NT logs¾Application, System, and Security¾that can be displayed by Event Viewer. The name of the displayed log is shown on the title bar of the dialog box. SQL Server and SQL Executive events are written to the Application log.
</li>
<li>
Optionally, to display only SQL Server events, choose Filter Events from the View menu, select <b>MSSQLServer</b> from the Source box, and then choose the OK button. <p>
To view only SQL Executive events, select <b>SQLEXECUTIVE</b> instead.
<p>

The Event Detail dialog box appears.
