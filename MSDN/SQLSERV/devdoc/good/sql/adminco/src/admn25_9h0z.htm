<h1><a name="_error_5813"></a>Error 5813</h1>
<h4>Severity Level 16</h4>
<h4>Message Text</h4>
<pre>Unable to run with specified memory size of %ld. Please see the System Administration Guide for more information on how to calculate this number.
</pre>
<h4>Explanation</h4>
<p>
A RECONFIGURE statement failed because SQL Server determined that there is not enough memory available for subsequent starts of SQL Server. </p>
<p>
<b>Note</b>  The calculations performed by RECONFIGURE are internal to SQL Server and do not account for computer resources, which might or might not be adequate to support the SQL Server configuration.</p>
<p>
This error is a result of using <b>sp_configure</b> to make configuration changes that cannot be met using the specified value of the <b>memory</b> option. Because RECONFIGURE must be executed before the changes can take effect, SQL Server has a chance to verify that there will be enough memory to satisfy all requirements.</p>
<p>
Because of the complexity of SQL Server memory allocation, RECONFIGURE cannot always detect potential problems resulting from setting configuration values too high. If such problems go undetected, SQL Server will not start. For information about using RECONFIGURE, see the <i>Microsoft SQL Server Transact-SQL Reference</i>.</p>
<h4>Action</h4>
<p>
Because this error occurs when the value of the <b>memory</b> option is too low to allocate all requested resources, you can correct this problem by using <b>sp_configure</b> to increase the value of the <b>memory </b>option or decrease the value of other parameters.</p>
<p>
After these changes have been made, you can execute RECONFIGURE. If the statement completes without error, the problem is probably resolved. For additional information about memory usage, see Chapter 21, "Configuration Issues."</p>
