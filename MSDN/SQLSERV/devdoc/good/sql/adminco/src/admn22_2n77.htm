<p>
One transaction log management strategy is to have an application that automatically dumps the log. This is especially easy if the transaction log is not being saved for recovery from media failure.</p>
<p>
If the log is being dumped to a device, additional logic is required to prevent the log from filling up or being dumped more often than necessary. One way is to examine the log periodically and dump it, depending on how full it is. </p>
<p>
You can also schedule log dumps using SQL Enterprise Manager and Performance Monitor-triggered dumps. For details, see Part 5, "Data Management," and the SQL Enterprise Manager online Help.</p>
