<h2><a name="_reproducing_problems_admn20"></a>Reproducing Problems</h2>
<p>
In general, the time it takes for your primary support provider to resolve a problem is greatly reduced if you generate a reproducible test case demonstrating the error. These test cases can range from a single query that is not acting as expected to a relatively complex code fragment that encounters a problem. A quick resolution is more likely when the test case is simple. Nothing you can do will support a quick resolution more than providing a simple test case. If a problem cannot be reproduced, it is usually impossible to solve.</p>
<p>
Whenever possible, create the test case using the <i>pubs</i> sample database. In many cases, creating a simple test case can save you from having to send large amounts of data to your primary support provider.</p>
