<h2><a name="_removing_a_user_from_a_database"></a>Removing a User from a Database</h2>
<p>
Dropping a user removes that user from the database. You cannot drop a user who owns objects. Since there is no command to transfer ownership of objects, you must drop the objects before you can drop the username. To deny access to a user who owns objects, you can change his or her SQL Server password.</p>
