<h2><a name="_installing_or_selecting_a_distribution_database"></a>Installing or Selecting a Distribution Database</h2>
<p>
If a server will participate in replication as a publisher, before any other replication options are set, you must define whether that publication server will act as its own distribution server or will use a remote distribution server. If it will act as its own distribution server, a distribution database must be installed.</p>
<p>
If a server will act as a remote distribution server for other publication servers, it must have a distribution database installed. This must be set up before any dependent publication servers are set up.</p>
<p>
<b>Note</b>  If a server will act as either a distribution server or a combined publication/distribution server, it must have at least 32 MB of memory installed, with at least 16 MB assigned to SQL Server. Use SQL Enterprise Manager or <b>sp_configure</b> to assign memory to SQL Server. For more information, see Chapter 3, <a href="admn03_20vn.htm">Configuring Servers</a>. </p>
<h5><img src="../../../../images/wedge.gif" border=0>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To install or select a distribution database</h5>
<ol>
<li>
From the Server Manager window, select a server.</li>
<li>
From the Server menu, choose Replication Configuration, and then from the drop-down menu that appears, choose Install Publishing.<p>
The Install Replication Publishing dialog box appears.

</li>
<li>
To configure this server to act as the distributor of its own publications, or to prepare it to act as a remote distribution server for other publication servers:<ul>
<li>
Choose the Local option.</li>
<li>
In the Database Name box, type a name for the distribution database. The default name is <i>distribution</i>.</li>
<li>
In the Data Device box, select a device for the distribution database, and type a size in the Size (MB) box. If the device does not already exist, add it by choosing <b>&lt;new&gt;</b> from the Data Device box and completing the New Device dialog box that appears.</li>
<li>
In the Log Device box, select a device for the distribution database transaction log, and type a size in the Size (MB) box. If the device does not already exist, add it by choosing <b>&lt;new&gt;</b> from the Log Device box and completing the New Device dialog box that appears.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<b>Note</b>  Replication of published data requires extensive use of the distribution database. A minimum size of 30 MB for the data device and 15 MB for the log device is recommended for initial implementation. These sizes can be expanded as required.
</li>
<li>
To configure this server to use a remote distribution server, select the Remote option, and then select a server from the list. <p>
The selected server will maintain the distribution database and will run the log reader, synchronization, and distribution processes for this publication server.
</li>
<li>
Choose OK.<p>
<b>Important</b>  Before you choose the OK button, make certain the distribution database options are set appropriately. Once a distribution database is selected, a significant reconfiguration is required to change to a different distribution database. For information about changing the distribution database, see Chapter 15, <a href="admn15_738u.htm">Advanced Replication</a>. 
<p>
After you choose OK, a dialog box asks whether you will configure publication options for this server at this time.
<p>
<img src="images/ad14_x02.gif" border=0>
</li>
<li>
Choose Yes.<p>
The Replication-Publishing dialog box appears. For information on completing this dialog box and setting the publication options, see <a href="admn14_5fg3.htm">Setting Publication Options</a>.

</ol>
