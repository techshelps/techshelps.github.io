<h3><a name="_database_object_owner"></a>Database Object Owner</h3>
<p>
Database objects are tables, indexes, views, defaults, triggers, rules, and procedures. The user who creates a database object is the database object owner. The database owner must first grant to the user permission to create the particular type of object. The database object owner can then create an object and grant permission to other users to use that object.</p>
<p>
Database object owners have no special login IDs or passwords. The creator of a database object is automatically granted all permissions on it. A database object owner must explicitly grant permissions to other users before they can access the object. Even the database owner cannot use an object unless the object owner has granted the appropriate permission. However, the database owner and system administrator can impersonate any other user in the database.</p>
<p>
There is no command to transfer ownership of objects. If a database object owner must be dropped from a database, the owned objects must first be dropped.</p>
