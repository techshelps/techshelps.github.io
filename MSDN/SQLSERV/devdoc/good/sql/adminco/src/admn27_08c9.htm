<h1><a name="_error_10018_.28.db.2d.library.29"></a>Error 10018 (DB-Library)</h1>
<h4>DB-Library Severity Level 9</h4>
<h4>Message Text</h4>
<pre>Error in closing the network connection.</pre>
<h4>Explanation</h4>
<p>
This error occurs when the client attempted to close a network connection and the network software returned a failure code. DB-Library may also return a network-specific error code that your network provider may find useful in diagnosing the problem. This error usually indicates a problem with the network, system configuration, or software, rather than a problem with SQL Server.</p>
<h4>Action</h4>
<p>
Inspect the Windows NT Event Viewer system and application logs. These logs may provide information that indicates whether or not the problem is related to the server network protocol, the network card, or the system configuration. Review the SQL Server-specific entries in the application log or in the SQL Server error log for relevant network-related errors that correspond in time with the occurrence of the 10018 error seen on the client. If this review does not provide enough information to resolve the problem, special network monitoring tools and a review of the client's configuration may be needed.</p>
<p>
If the problem persists contact your primary network support provider for assistance.</p>
