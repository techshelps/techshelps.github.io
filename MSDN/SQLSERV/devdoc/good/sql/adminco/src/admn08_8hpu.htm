<h2><a name="_the_guest_user"></a>The guest User</h2>
<p>
Creating a user named <i>guest</i> in a database enables any user with a login ID for SQL Server to access the database as a guest user. If a user attempts to access the database but does not have a username (his or her username is not found in the database's <i>sysusers</i> table), SQL Server looks for a user named <i>guest</i>. If there is one, the user is allowed to use the database, under the permissions assigned to <i>guest</i>.</p>
<p>
When the <i>guest</i> username is first added to a database, the username inherits the privileges of the <i>public</i> group. The database owner and the owners of database objects can change these permissions, to make the privileges of <i>guest</i> either more or less restrictive than those of <i>public</i>.</p>
<p>
If you are using integrated security and have not created individual login IDs for users, you can provide a database username for the default login ID, or you can add the <i>guest</i> user. In both cases, be aware that any user of integrated security can access the database and acquires the permissions you assign to the default login ID or to the <i>guest</i> user. (This is also true for connections from a client configured to force trusted connections. For information, see <a href="admn08_0hdf.htm">Client-Requested Trusted Connections</a>, earlier in this chapter.)</p>
<p>
In databases, the database owner is responsible for setting up a <i>guest</i> user. A <i>guest</i> user in a database allows the database owner to extend database use to all SQL Server users without explicitly naming each one.</p>
<p>
When SQL Server is installed, the <i>master</i>, <i>tempdb</i>, <i>msdb</i>, and <i>pubs</i> databases contain the <i>guest</i> user. The <i>model</i> database, and user databases that are later created, do not. Each database owner can add, if appropriate, a <i>guest</i> user to any user database, thus extending database access to all SQL Server users, without explicitly naming each one.</p>
<p>
The guest user in the <i>master</i> database means that any user with a login ID for SQL Server (or, with integrated security, any user granted user-level privilege to access SQL Server) can successfully connect to SQL Server by logging in with his or her own name. If the username is not found (in <i>master..sysusers</i>), the user is recognized as guest and inherits whatever permissions the <i>public</i> group has been granted.</p>
