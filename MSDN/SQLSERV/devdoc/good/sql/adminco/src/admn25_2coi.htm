<h1><a name="_error_2502"></a>Error 2502</h1>
<h4>Severity Level 16</h4>
<h4>Message Text</h4>
<pre>Table Corrupt: A page is linked in more than one chain; check this page:page number=%ld allocation status=%d
</pre>
<h4>Explanation</h4>
<p>
This error occurs when SQL Server detects an inconsistency in the page linkage of one of the page chains associated with a table. One of the pages has been found to be linked in more than one page chain when it should be linked in only one chain. There is one doubly-linked page chain for the table data, as well as one for each index level.</p>
<p>
<b>Important</b>  This is a serious error and must be corrected immediately.</p>
<p>
If DBCC detects this error during run-time processing, error 605 can also occur.</p>
<h4>Action</h4>
<p>
Follow these steps to resolve the error:
<ol>
<li>
Examine the index ID associated with the page number indicated in the message to determine whether the error occurred on the table data or on an index. For information about how to find the object ID and the index ID of the object that has the error, see Chapter 24, "Additional Problem-solving Techniques."</li>
<li>
Restore the database:<ul>
<li>
If the object ID is less than or equal to 100, the error is on a system table. Restore the database from a clean backup.</li>
<li>
If the object ID is greater than 100, the error is on a user table.</li>
<li>
If this error occurs on table data (the index ID = 0), restore the database from a clean backup.</li>
<li>
If the error occurs on an index, you can usually correct it by dropping and re-creating the index. If dropping and re-creating the index is not feasible, or if you cannot drop the index, contact your primary support provider for assistance.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>
If the problem persists, contact your primary support provider for assistance. Have the output of the appropriate DBCC statements available for review.</p>
