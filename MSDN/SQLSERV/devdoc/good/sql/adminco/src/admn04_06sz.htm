<h2><a name="_tcp.2f.ip_sockets_clients"></a>TCP/IP Sockets Clients</h2>
<p>
For Windows- or Windows NT-based clients, SQL Server supports client communication using standard Windows Sockets as the IPC method across the TCP/IP protocol.</p>
<p>
<b>Important</b>  The Windows Sockets Net-Libraries have been extensively tested on the supported platforms for connecting to Microsoft SQL Server. Using these Net-Libraries with other TCP/IP protocols should work if those protocols properly support Windows Sockets. However, their use on these platforms is not guaranteed. The protocol provider should test and state their support policy.</p>
<p>
Third party 16-bit TCP/IP products (other than those provided with Windows for Workgroups) which properly support the Windows Sockets specifications should work properly with the Win16 TCP/IP Sockets Net-Library (DBMSSOC3.DLL). While not officially tested and supported, products that properly implement the specification should work with the Net-Library.</p>
<p>
<b>Note</b>  MS-DOS-based applications running with the Microsoft Windows TCP/IP protocol stack must use the Named Pipes Net-Library, DBNMPIPE.EXE. There is no TCP/IP sockets support in MS-DOS.</p>
