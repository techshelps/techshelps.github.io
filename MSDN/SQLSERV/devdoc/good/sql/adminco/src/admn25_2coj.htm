<h1><a name="_error_2503"></a>Error 2503</h1>
<h4>Severity Level 16</h4>
<h4>Message Text</h4>
<pre>Table Corrupt: Page linkage is not consistent; check the following pages: (current page#=%ld; page# pointing to this page=%ld; previous page# indicated on this page=%ld)
</pre>
<h4>Explanation</h4>
<p>
This error occurs when SQL Server detects an inconsistency in the page linkage of one of the page chains associated with a table ¾ for example, when a page's <i>next</i> pointer points to a page whose <i>previous</i> pointer points back to a different page. There is one doubly-linked page chain for the table data as well as one for each index level.</p>
<p>
<b>Important</b>  This is a serious error and must be corrected immediately.</p>
<p>
If DBCC statements detect this error during run-time processing, error 605 will also occur.</p>
<h4>Action</h4>
<p>
Determine which table is corrupt by examining the <i>current page</i> in the error message. For additional information about associating a page with an object, see "Associating a Page with an Object" in Chapter 24, "Additional Problem-solving Techniques." If the page is associated with an index, it is sometimes possible to resolve the problem by dropping the index. In most cases, you must recover the database from a known clean backup.</p>
<p>
You should also examine your operating-system error log file, in addition to the SQL Server error log, to determine if hardware errors might have caused the corruption.</p>
<p>
If the problem persists, contact your primary support provider. Have the output from the appropriate DBCC statements available for review.</p>
