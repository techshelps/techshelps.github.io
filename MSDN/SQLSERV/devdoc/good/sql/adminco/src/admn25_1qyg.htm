<h1><a name="_error_208"></a>Error 208</h1>
<h4>Severity Level 16</h4>
<h4>Message Text</h4>
<pre>Invalid object name '%.*s'.
</pre>
<h4>Explanation</h4>
<p>
This error occurs when an object that does not exist is referenced. If the object exists, you might need to include the owner's name in the object name. </p>
<p>
If the object is not owned by the user attempting to access it, and it is not owned by the database owner (DBO), all references to the object must include the owner's name. For example, if <b>user1</b> creates a table called <i>test</i>, other users must use the name <i>user1.test</i> when they refer to the table.</p>
<p>
The SQL Server naming convention for database objects is:</p>
<p>
[[<i>database</i><b>.</b>]<i>owner</i><b>.</b>]<i>object_name</i><b>.</b><i>column_name</i> </p>
<p>
The default value for <i>database</i> is the current database. The default value for <i>owner</i> is the current user. Because <i>owner </i>is part of the object name, it is possible for two different users to have tables with the same name in the same database (for example, <i>user1.test</i> and <i>user2.test</i>). For additional information about naming conventions, see the <i>Microsoft SQL Server Transact-SQL Reference</i>.</p>
<p>
This message can also occur when you reference a temporary table that was created with an EXECUTE statement.</p>
<h4>Action</h4>
<p>
The procedure for handling this error depends on what you know about the object indicated in the error message text.</p>
<p>
The appropriate permissions must also be set to allow access to an object. If these permissions are not set, error 229 or 230 occurs.</p>
<h5>If you do not know who owns the object</h5>
<ul>
<li>
Use the <b>sp_help</b> system procedure (with no parameters) to display the object owner.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Or
<ul>
<li>
Query the <i>sysobjects</i> system table to determine the object owner and type.</li>
</ul>
<p>
For example, to determine the owner and type of the object, <i>table_1</i>, use the following:</p>
<pre>select owner = user_name(uid), name, type
from sysobjects where name = 'table_1'
</pre>
<p>
If no rows are returned from this query, the object either resides in a different database or does not exist.</p>
<h5>If you do not own the object in question</h5>
<ul>
<li>
Include the object owner in the object name. For example:<pre>select * from user1.table_1</pre>
<p>
Although using fully qualified object names eliminates this problem, remember that including the fully qualified object name in an application might complicate the maintenance of the application. For example, if all references to a table include the database name, changing the database name could become difficult.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Or
<ul>
<li>
Have the dbo create the object. If the DBO creates the object, any user can find the object without specifying the owner. Note, however, that temporary tables reside in <i>tempdb</i> and are automatically dropped when the user process or server connection that created them is terminated. Users cannot share temporary tables, even if they are created by the dbo.</li>
</ul>
<h5>If the object does not reside in the database</h5>
<ul>
<li>
Move to the correct database. For example:<pre>use database_1</pre>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Or
<ul>
<li>
Qualify the object name with the database name. For example:<pre>select * from database_1.user1.table_1</pre>
<p>
If you own the object or if the object is owned by the dbo, the owner name is not needed. For example:
<pre>select * from database_1..table_1</pre>
</li>
</ul>
<h5>If a temporary table created with an EXECUTE statement is referenced</h5>
<ul>
<li>
If you must use the EXECUTE statement to create a temporary table, create it as a global temporary table using the syntax ##<i>tablename</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>
