<p>
The first time you start SQL Enterprise Manager, the Register Server dialog box appears. </p>
<p>

<p>
You must provide the name of one or more SQL Servers that you will be managing using SQL Enterprise Manager. Each time you enter a new server name, you must complete the login information.
<ul>
<li>
After you enter a server name, select either Use Standard Security or Use Trusted Connection. This choice determines the type of security that will be used for the connection when SQL Enterprise Manager connects¾as a client¾to that server. The preferred option for security is to use a trusted connection, where Window NT security validates the user and a password does not need to be stored at the client.</li>
<li>
If you selected Use Standard Security, in the Login ID box type the login ID of a valid administrative account (such as SA) for that server; and in the Password box type the password for that login ID. If you selected Use Trusted Connection, the login ID and password are unnecessary. </li>
</ul>
<p>
<b>Note</b>  The Use Trusted Security option is recommended, since it allows SQL Enterprise Manager to connect without storing a password.</p>
<p>
When you register a server, you can also create a group for that server to be a member of, or you can assign that server to a group that already exists. Server groups help you organize the servers of your enterprise. Typical server groups might include development, production, marketing, and so on.</p>
<p>
Once you have registered a server, it appears in the Server Manager window each time you start SQL Enterprise Manager. You can immediately begin to perform tasks for that server using SQL Enterprise Manager. Initial administration tasks that you might want to perform include:
<ul>
<li>
Verifying that all SQL Server configuration options are set appropriately</li>
<li>
Creating devices and databases</li>
<li>
Creating login IDs</li>
<li>
Configuring the SQL Server for replication</li>
</ul>
