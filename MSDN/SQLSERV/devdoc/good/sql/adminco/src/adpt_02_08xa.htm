<h1><a name="_configuration"></a>Configuration</h1>
<p>
SQL Server provides <b>setup</b> programs that largely automate the installation of server software and client software. In most cases, you will be able to use the server or client software immediately after installing it. However, there are a number of configuration tasks that can be performed after installation to optimize a server or client for your particular network, database, and business environments. The following chapters discuss these configuration tasks.</p>
<p>
Chapter 3, <a href="admn03_20vn.htm">Configuring Servers</a>, explains how to fine-tune SQL Server for your particular environment. This chapter shows you how to do such things as set the system administrator's password, set server options and configuration options, configure network support, add a language, set relevant operating system options, assign a user account to SQL Executive, view server attributes, and rebuild the master database. </p>
<p>
Chapter 4, <a href="admn04_904z.htm">Configuring Clients</a>, explains how to configure client software after it has been installed. This chapter shows you how to display the DB-Library version currently installed on the client, set the client's default Net-Library, and set up server connection information on the client. It also provides information about each of the available Net-Libraries. </p>
