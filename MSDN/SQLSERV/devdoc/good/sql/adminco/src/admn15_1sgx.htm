<h2><a name="_replicating_downloaded_data"></a>Replicating Downloaded Data</h2>
<p>
In today's complex computing environment, data often resides on varying storage platforms within an organization. Replication provides an efficient method of distributing data that has been imported into a SQL Server. Once data resides on a SQL Server, it can be replicated outward to other SQL Servers throughout the organization. </p>

<p>
Several conditions must be met to ensure that imported data is properly replicated:
<ul>
<li>
The SQL Server into which the data is imported must be configured as a publisher.</li>
<li>
The database into which the data is imported must be authorized for publication.</li>
<li>
To allow publication of the table, the imported data must be placed into a table with a declared primary key.</li>
<li>
The import of the data must take place as a logged operation. <p>
This implies that either the data will be imported as individual transactions or, if a bulk load operation is performed, a user-defined index must exist on the target table to ensure that the bulk load will default to a logged mode of operation.
</li>
<li>
If a full table publication is required, no <i>text</i> or <i>image</i> datatypes may be imported.</li>
</ul>
