<h2><a name="_worktable_created_for_select_into"></a>Worktable created for SELECT_INTO</h2>
<p>
The SELECT INTO statement performs two functions: it first creates a table with the exact same structure as the table being selected from, and then it inserts all rows that meet the WHERE conditions (if a WHERE clause is used) of the table being selected from. The worktable created for the SELECT_INTO statement is slightly misleading, in that the worktable it refers to is actually the new physical table created. Unlike other worktables, it is not dropped when the query finishes executing. In addition, the worktable is not created in <i>tempdb</i>, unless the user specifies <i>tempdb</i> as the target database for the new table. </p>
