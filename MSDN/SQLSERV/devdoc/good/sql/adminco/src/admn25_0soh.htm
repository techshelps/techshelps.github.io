<h1><a name="_error_7901"></a>Error 7901</h1>
<h4>Severity Level 16</h4>
<h4>Message Text</h4>
<pre>Page %Id was expected to be the first page of a TEXT/IMAGE value.
</pre>
<h4>Explanation</h4>
<p>
This error indicates one of these two conditions:
<ul>
<li>
The page pointer for a text or image column has been corrupted and is referencing a data page instead of a text or image page.</li>
<li>
The first page of the text or image chain for a given column has not been correctly marked as a text or image page.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Action</h4>
<p>
Verify the consistency of the database by running DBCC CHECKDB and DBCC NEWALLOC.</p>
<p>
If there are no other reported problems and you know which rows in the table are the cause of the problem, follow these steps:
<ol>
<li>
Attempt to create a new table that contains the offending rows. This can be done by running a SELECT statement with the INTO clause and restricting the query by using a WHERE clause so that only the offending rows are inserted into the new table.</li>
<li>
Verify that the new table contains the appropriate data.</li>
<li>
Run DBCC checktable against the temporary table.</li>
<li>
If no errors are reported in step 3, delete the offending rows from the original table.</li>
<li>
Insert the rows from the temporary table back into the original table.</li>
<li>
Drop the temporary table.</li>
<li>
Run DBCC checktable against the original table.</li>
<li>
If the problem persists, delete and re-insert the offending rows.</li>
</ol>
<p>
If you cannot determine which rows are causing the error, take the following steps:
<ol>
<li>
Attempt to create a copy of the table by running a SELECT statement with the INTO clause.</li>
<li>
Verify that the new table contains the appropriate data.</li>
<li>
Run DBCC checktable against the new table.</li>
<li>
If the DBCC in step 3 did not report any errors, drop the original table.</li>
<li>
Rename the new table by running:<pre>sp_rename new_table_name name_of_original_table</pre>
</li>
<li>
Run DBCC checktable against the original table.</li>
</ol>
<p>
If the problem persists, contact your primary support provider.</p>
<p>
Because of their potentially large size, text and image data in SQL Server is stored in a page chain independent of the page chain for the actual table. The only information stored in the table regarding a text or image column is the page number of the first page in the text or image chain. For more information, see the Text and Image Manipulation topic in the <i>Microsoft SQL Server Transact-SQL Reference</i>.</p>
