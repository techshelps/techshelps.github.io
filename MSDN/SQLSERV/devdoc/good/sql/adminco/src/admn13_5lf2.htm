SQL Enterprise Manager allows SQL Server administrators and database owners to manage SQL Server via a powerful yet easy-to-use interface. SQL Server replication particularly benefits from SQL Enterprise Manager. From a single server or workstation that has the SQL Server 6.0 utilities installed, you can use SQL Enterprise Manager to reach across your enterprise and set up a complete replication environment spanning as many servers as necessary. Replication can be completely set up and managed by using SQL Enterprise Manager.</p>
<p>
Many of the procedures and examples in Chapter 14, "Setting Up Replication," and Chapter 15, "Advanced Replication," include instructions on how to use SQL Enterprise Manager to easily perform replication tasks. For more information about using SQL Enterprise Manager for tasks other than replication, see Chapter 2, <a href="admn02_2fzf.htm">Introducing the SQL Distributed Framework</a>, or see the online Help for SQL Enterprise Manager. </p>
<p>
As an option, you can also use manual procedures to set up replication. For more information, see Chapter 15, <a href="admn15_738u.htm">Advanced Replication</a>. </p>
