<h3><a name="_sqlserver.2d.users_object"></a>SQLServer-Users Object</h3>
<p>
The following counters are part of the SQLServer-Users object, which includes statistics for SQL Server user connections. Each of these counters displays statistics for a specific server process ID (<i>spid</i>). Note that the <i>spid</i> is prefaced by the username. (It may be logged on the username.)
<dl>
<dt>
<b>CPU Time</b></dt>
<dd>
The cumulative CPU time for a user connection (and checkpoint process). You can use this statistic to determine how much time a user connection has consumed and compare that amount with the CPU consumption for other users.</dd>
<dt>
<b>Locks Held</b></dt>
<dd>
The number of locks held by a user connection. </dd>
<dt>
<b>Memory (2K pages)</b></dt>
<dd>
The amount of memory (in 2K pages) allocated to a user connection. You can use this statistic to determine if queries executed by a particular user are consuming significant memory.</dd>
<dt>
<b>Physical I/O</b></dt>
<dd>
The number of disk reads and writes for the current statement. You can use this statistic to determine how expensive a query or statement is in terms of physical I/O. You can tune this statistic by changing indexes or rewriting the query.
</dd>
