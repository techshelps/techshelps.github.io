<h1><a name="_summary"></a>Summary</h1>
<p>
Microsoft SQL Server offers unparalleled performance and integrity for a PC-based relational database management system, with a robust set of data integrity features, including online database and transaction log backups, and automatic roll forward/rollback recovery. SQL Server is an ideal platform for large production applications, whether they be high-volume transaction-processing systems or decision-support environments. </p>
<p>
As with any software application, it is expected that all proper precautions be taken to avoid loss of data, whether due to hardware, software, or user error. Before using any SQL Server application for production, you should have a solid and well-tested backup strategy in place, so that in the event of any type of failure, production can be restored with minimal downtime and little or no loss of data.</p>
