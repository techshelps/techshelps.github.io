<h2><a name="_aliases"></a>Aliases</h2>
<p>
An <i>alias</i> is a database username that is shared by several login IDs. An alias allows you to treat more than one person as the same user inside a database, giving all of them the same permissions. A common use for aliases is to allow several users to assume the role of database owner (DBO).</p>
<p>
To create an alias, you assign a login ID to an existing database username, instead of creating a unique username specifically for that login ID. Any username in a database can serve as an alias. </p>
<p>
If you assign a login ID to an alias, that login ID cannot be assigned any other username in that database. Nor can that login ID be assigned to a database group, since it automatically belongs to the groups (<i>public</i> and, optionally, one other) that the alias belongs to.</p>
<p>
Aliases can be used to set up a collective user identity, within which the identities of individual users can be traced. For example, suppose several vice presidents want to use a database with identical privileges and ownerships. You could:
<ol>
<li>
Add a separate SQL Server login ID for each vice president.</li>
<li>
Assign a new username in the database, <i>vp</i>, to one of the login IDs.</li>
<li>
Provide appropriate permissions in the database to the user <i>vp</i>.</li>
<li>
Assign the other login IDs to the alias <i>vp</i>.</li>
</ol>
<p>
In the preceding example, all the vice presidents have common capabilities within the database.</p>
<p>
If a user is already authorized to use the database, you must drop the username for that login ID before you can assign an alias to it.</p>
