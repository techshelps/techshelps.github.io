<h1><a name="_using_sql_transfer_manager"></a>Using SQL Transfer Manager</h1>
<p>
SQL Transfer Manager provides an easy, graphical way to transfer objects and data from one SQL Server database to another. It can export from a Microsoft-based or non-Microsoft based SQL Server and can import into a Windows NT-based Microsoft SQL Server. </p>
<p>
SQL Transfer Manager can transfer objects and data from one processor architecture to another¾ for example, from a SQL Server running on an Alpha AXP-based computer to a SQL Server running on an Intel-based computer.</p>
<p>
You can use SQL Transfer Manager to transfer data from SQL Server 4.21 or SQL Server 6.0 to SQL Server version 6.0. However, you cannot include version 6.0-specific datatypes in the source objects. Version 6.0-specific schema additions, such as identity columns and declarative referential integrity will not be included in the transfer. Additionally, if your source server is version 4.21, some stored procedures or views may contain Transact-SQL statements that are no longer accepted in version 6.0 and some version 4.21 object names may now be key words or reserved words in version 6.0. If so, the transfer will fail for these objects and will not complete correctly for objects that depend on them. </p>
<p>
You can also use SQL Transfer Manager to transfer data from a server with one sort order to a server with a different sort order. However, SQL Transfer Manager does not convert extended characters, so you cannot use it for conversion from one code page to another. </p>
<p>
If you are transferring data between servers with different case sensitivity, errors will occur if you were not consistent in case when you created your objects and added your data. For example, on a case-insensitive server, if you create a table called <b>abc</b> and then create a view called <b>xyz</b> as <b>SELECT * FROM ABC</b>, the CREATE VIEW statement will work. However, if you transfer the information to a case-sensitive server, the CREATE VIEW statement will fail.</p>
