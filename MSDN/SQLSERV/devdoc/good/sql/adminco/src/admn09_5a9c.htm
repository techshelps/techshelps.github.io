<h1><a name="_changing_database_ownership"></a>Changing Database Ownership</h1>
<p>
You can change the owner of a database. This drops the aliases of users who could act as the old DBO. You might want to change the database owner, for example, when you create a new database yourself but want to assign ownership of the database to another user.</p>
<p>
The new owner must not already be known in the database as a user or have an alias. It may be necessary to drop a user from a database or from an alias before changing a database's ownership.</p>
<p>
You must be in the database for which the ownership is being changed.</p>
<h5><img src="../../../../images/wedge.gif" border=0>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To change the database owner</h5>
<ul>
<li>
<b>sp_changedbowner</b> <i>login_id</i> [<b>, true</b>]<p>
where
<dl>
<dt>
<i>login_id</i></dt>
<dd>
Is the name of the new owner of the current database. The new owner must not already be known as a user or have an alias in this database.</dd>
<dt>
<b>true</b></dt>
<dd>
Transfers aliases and their permissions to the new database owner.
</dd>
</dl>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
For example, to make <i>maryd</i> the owner of the current database and drop aliases of users who could act as the old DBO, type:</p>
<pre>sp_changedbowner maryd</pre>
<p>
You cannot change the ownership of the <i>master</i> database. </p>
<p>
For more information on using <b>sp_changedbowner</b>, see the <i>Microsoft SQL Server Transact-SQL Reference</i>.</p>
