<h1><a name="_managing_drives"></a>Managing Drives</h1>
<p>
By managing the placement of data on drives, you can improve performance, implement fault tolerance, or do both. In the context of managing drive storage for a SQL Server computer, <i>performance</i> refers in part to the speed of read and write operations, and <i>fault tolerance </i>refers to the ability of the system to continue functioning¾without data loss¾when part of the system fails.</p>
<p>
There are a number of methods you can use to manage the placement of data on drives: 
<ul>
<li>
<i>Hardware-based RAID</i>, which can protect against data loss in the event of media failure and also improve performance.</li>
<li>
<i>Windows NT-based disk striping and striping with parity</i>, both of which improve performance. In addition, disk striping with parity protects against data loss in the event of media failure.</li>
<li>
<i>Windows NT-based disk mirroring and duplexing,</i> both of which are fault-tolerance mechanisms that protect against data loss in the event of media failure. They can also improve read performance.</li>
<li>
<i>SQL Server device mirroring</i>, a fault-tolerance mechanism that protects against data loss in the event of media failure. </li>
<li>
<i>SQL Server segments</i>, which can improve SQL Server performance by giving you more control over where you place data on database devices.</li>
</ul>
<p>
This chapter provides an overview of the drive management methods. It also provides instructions for setting up the SQL Server-based drive management methods (SQL Server mirroring and SQL Server segments).</p>
