<h1><a name="_using_sql_administrator_and_sql_object_manager"></a>Using SQL Administrator and SQL Object Manager</h1>
<p>
SQL Administrator and SQL Object Manager are no longer provided. They have been superseded by SQL Enterprise Manager.</p>
<p>
Servers or clients that still have old copies of SQL Administrator or SQL Object Manager can still use those tools to administer a SQL Server 6.0 server, but only after that server has run two scripts¾ADMIN60.SQL and OBJECT60.SQL¾that upgrade its stored procedures to allow SQL Administrator and SQL Object Manager to administer it. However, you will notice a few differences when using these tools to administer a SQL Server 6.0 server, as compared to administering a SQL Server 4.2 server.</p>
<p>
When an existing SQL Server 4.2 server is upgraded to SQL Server 6.0, the old copies of SQL Administrator or SQL Object Manager are left in place, and the necessary upgrade scripts are automatically run by the <b>setup</b> program. You do not need to take any action to allow an upgraded server to be managed by those tools.</p>
<p>
For new SQL Server 6.0 installations, the two upgrade scripts must be run if other servers or clients that still have SQL Administrator and SQL Object Manager installed will be used to administer the new SQL Server 6.0 server. </p>
<h5><img src="../../../../images/wedge.gif" border=0>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To allow users of SQL Administrator and SQL Object Manager to administer a new SQL Server 6.0 server</h5>
<ol>
<li>
From the Microsoft SQL Server 6.0 program group, start ISQL/w and connect to the new SQL Server 6.0 server. <p>
Or start SQL Enterprise Manager, select the new SQL Server 6.0 server from the Server Manager window, and from the Tools menu, choose Query Analyzer.
</li>
<li>
To allow this server to be administered by the SQL Administrator utility, from the \SQL60\INSTALL directory, open and run the script ADMIN60.SQL.</li>
<li>
To allow this server to be administered by the SQL Object Manager utility, from the \SQL60\INSTALL directory, open and run the script OBJECT60.SQL.</li>
</ol>
