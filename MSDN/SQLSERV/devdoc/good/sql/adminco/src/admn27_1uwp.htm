<h1><a name="_error_10025_.28.db.2d.library.29"></a>Error 10025 (DB-Library)</h1>
<h4>DB-Library Severity Level 9</h4>
<h4>Message Text</h4>
<pre>Write to SQL Server failed.
</pre>
<h4>Explanation</h4>
<p>
This error occurs due to a failure of a client-initiated write operation over a network connection to SQL Server. DB-Library may also return a network-specific error code that your network support provider may find useful in diagnosing the problem. This message occurs when the network connection between the client and the server is broken. It may also be associated with SQL Server error 1608.</p>
<h4>Action</h4>
<p>
Inspect the Windows NT Event Viewer system and application logs. These logs may provide information that indicates whether or not the problem is related to the server network protocol, the network card, or the system configuration. Review the SQL Server-specific entries in the application log or in the SQL Server error log for relevant network-related errors that correspond in time with the occurrence of the 10025 error seen on the client. If this review does not provide enough information to resolve the problem, special network monitoring tools and a review of the client's configuration may be needed.</p>
<p>
If the problem persists contact your primary network support provider for assistance.</p>
