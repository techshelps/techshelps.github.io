<p>
There are numerous products available to help people who are blind or have low vision use Microsoft Windows. For people with low vision, there are screen-enlargement utilities, and for people who cannot use visual information, there are screen readers that provide alternative output by synthesized voice or refreshable Braille displays. In addition, people with low vision can customize the Microsoft Windows display to suit their needs.</p>
<p>
For more information on the various products available, see "Getting More Information" later in this appendix. For more information about customizing Microsoft Windows for people with low vision, see "Customizing Windows," next.</p>
