<h2><a name="_before_backing_up"></a>Before Backing Up</h2>
<p>
The DBCC statement checks the logical and physical consistency of a database. Regardless of database setup, it is highly recommended that you always run the following DBCC statements just prior to backing up a database. 
<ul>
<li>
DBCC CHECKDB</li>
<li>
DBCC CHECKALLOC or NEWALLOC</li>
<li>
DBCC CHECKCATALOG</li>
</ul>
<p>
It is advised that no other activity be taking place while running these checks, as that can lead to incorrect or misleading results.</p>
<p>
Because transactions can occur during or after DBCC is run but before the dump is performed, you may also want to check the database after backup to ensure that the database was consistent at the time it was dumped. If a database or transaction log that contains errors is dumped, those errors will still exist when the data is reloaded. Under some conditions, this can even prevent successful reloading. </p>
<p>
For information about using these DBCC statements, see the description of the <a href="../../tsqlref/src/tsql06_0yus.htm">DBCC statement</a> in the <i>Microsoft SQL Server Transact-SQL Reference</i>.</p>
