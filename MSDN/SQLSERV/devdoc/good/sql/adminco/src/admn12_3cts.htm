<h2><a name="_monitoring_modifying_or_canceling_a_scheduled_backup"></a>Monitoring, Modifying, or Canceling a Scheduled Backup</h2>
<p>
You can schedule a backup for one-time or recurring execution at the time you define it in the Database Backup/Restore window. SQL Enterprise Manager then creates a scheduled backup task. </p>
<p>
However, once you do this, the scheduled backup cannot be monitored, modified, or canceled from the Database Backup/Restore window. You must use the Task Scheduling window. </p>
<p>
When using the Task scheduling window, be aware that all tasks defined on the server ¾ not just backup tasks ¾ are displayed. By default, the name of a backup task is generated by SQL Enterprise Manager using the form <br>
<b>BACKUP</b> - <i>databasename</i>. However, this name could have been changed from the default by the user who scheduled the backup. Also, a backup task has a type of <b>TSQL</b>, which indicates that the task is a scheduled execution of a Transact-SQL statement. </p>

<p>
From the Task Scheduling window you can view a list of all scheduled tasks, plus a list of tasks that are currently running. Note that all scheduled or running tasks defined on that server are displayed (not just the backup tasks).</p>

<ol>
<li>
To view a list of tasks defined for the server, select the Task List tab. <p>

For a selected task, you can view the task history, which provides information about the last run date of a task, the time and duration of the last run, the status of that run, and whether a user was sent e-mail by SQL Executive as a result of the task running. You can also view any messages sent by SQL Executive.</p>
