<h1><a name="_error_7902"></a>Error 7902</h1>
<h4>Severity Level 16</h4>
<h4>Message Text</h4>
<pre>Data size mismatch occurred while checking TEXT/IMAGE values. The first page for this value is: %Id. There were %Id bytes found, which is different from the expected data length of %Id bytes.
</pre>
<h4>Explanation</h4>
<p>
This error occurs when a text<i> </i>or image<i> </i>page does not contain the correct amount of data indicated by the length stored internally in the page. This error is detected when executing DBCC CHECKDB or DBCC CHECKTABLE.</p>
<h4>Action</h4>
<p>
Identify the exact row in the table for the text<i>/</i>image value that is incorrect. Follow these steps:
<ol>
<li>
Run DBCC PAGE for the page listed as the first %Id variable in the error text.</li>
<li>
Find the first text page in the page chain by running DBCC PAGE against each page listed as prevpg<i> </i>in the page header until this value is 0. The page that contains prevpg=0 will be the first text page in the chain.</li>
<li>
The row can now be uniquely identified by the text pointer value. Execute the following query to determine this row:<pre>select * from table
WHERE substring(textptr(text column nam&gt;),1,4) = 0xXXXXXXXX</pre>
<p>
0xXXXXXXXX is the hexadecimal representation of the byte- and word-swapped page number determined in step 2. The 0x prefix indicates a hexadecimal value.
<p>
For example, if the page number determined in step 2 is page 1649, this would be 0x00000671. Swapping the positions of the first and second words and bytes within each word would result in 0x71060000. Provide this byte-swapped value in the WHERE clause to determine the exact row.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
If the query does not display any text data to capture, you may be able to correct the problem by updating the text value to NULL or by deleting the row.</p>
<p>
If this technique does not work, you may have to copy out all non-text columns to another table or restore the database from a known clean backup.</p>
<p>
If the problem persists, contact your primary support provider. Have the full output from DBCC CHECKDB or DBCC CHECKTABLE available for review.</p>
