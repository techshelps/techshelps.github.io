<h2><a name="_files_created_by_sql_transfer_manager"></a>Files Created by SQL Transfer Manager</h2>
<p>
When a transfer is performed, a number of files are created and are saved on the export server in a subdirectory that SQL Transfer Manager creates under \SQL60\BINN. For example, if the server TERRIER exports from the <i>pubs</i> database, a TERRPUBS subdirectory is created (\SQL60\BINN\TERRPUBS), during the export the files are placed there. </p>
