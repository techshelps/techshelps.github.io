<h1><a name="_about_remote_servers_and_users"></a>About Remote Servers and Users</h1>
<p>
A <i>remote server </i>is a SQL Server on the network that users can access by using their local server. When a server is set up as a remote server, users can use the system procedures and the stored procedures on it without explicitly logging in to it. </p>
<p>
A <i>remote user</i> is a user who accesses the remote server. You will add a remote login ID for each remote user.</p>
<p>
For example, suppose all the people in your department use the ACCOUNTS server as their local server, but they sometimes need to use stored procedures on the EXPENSES server. Each time they need information from EXPENSES, they must log in to it. However, if you set up EXPENSES as a remote server for ACCOUNTS and add remote login IDs for the users from your department, then they can access the stored procedures without having to log into EXPENSES.</p>
<p>
The following figure illustrates how users can access a remote server through their local server.</p>

<b>Note</b>  The type of SQL Server security chosen (integrated, mixed, or standard) does not affect the management of remote users. The security described in this chapter is used when executing remote stored procedures are executed across server-to-server connections.</p>
