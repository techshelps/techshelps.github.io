<h2><a name="_novell_ipx.2f.spx_client_connections"></a>Novell IPX/SPX Client Connections</h2>
<p>
The following procedure describes how to test a network connection when using the native Novell Internet Package Exchange/Sequenced Package Exchange (IPX/SPX) protocol.</p>
<h5><img src="../../../../images/wedge.gif" border=0>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To check an IPX/SPX connection</h5>
<ol>
<li>
Check the connection between the client and the network.<p>
The client must be connected to the network. If it is connected, you will get the message "Attached to server <i>servername</i>" after NETX.COM is loaded (for MS-DOS- and Windows-based clients). For Windows NT - based clients, check the Event Viewer to ensure that the NWLink network support software was properly loaded.
</li>
<li>
Check the connection between the server and the network.<p>
The server must be connected to the network. Under Windows NT, check the Event Log for a message containing "ODS: server-side."
</li>
<li>
Check the local connection to SQL Server using the service name.<p>
You should be able to make a local connection to SQL Server with Novell NetWare as the default Net-Library. If you can connect locally using named pipes but cannot connect locally using the Novell NetWare Net-Library, SQL Server is not registered properly on the network.
</li>
<li>
Check the network connection between the client and the server.<p>
If you can connect locally (as described in step 3) but cannot connect from a client across the network, check that:
<ul>
<li>
The server is accessible to the client. You can test this by typing the following from the client:<pre>isql /L
</pre>
<p>
This option makes a call to <b>dbserverenum</b>, which returns the list of available servers from the Bindery. In the list of "Announced network servers," you should see the name of the server you want to connect to. If the server name is not in this list, you will not be able to connect. If the other steps have been done but the server name is not listed, this usually indicates a network problem. Check the SQL Server event log to be sure that the SPX support loaded properly (you will see an error message if it did not). Next, try to eliminate any possible bridge or router problems by attempting to connect from clients on the same LAN segment as the server.
</li>
<li>
The client can connect to a file server on the local area network where the SQL Server is located.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Failing either of these tests indicates a network routing or configuration problem.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
If you are having trouble with connections being dropped or client applications "hanging," this usually indicates a network error. Problems can occur when there are no free network buffers to service requests or when there are conflicts over shared network or memory resources. </p>
<p>
If you are running into stability problems running Windows-based client applications over Novell IPX/SPX, the first step is to verify that you have the latest NetWare drivers available for your hardware configuration. SQL Server client applications will run on most systems using "monolithic" NetWare drivers, as long as they meet the minimum version levels specified in Chapter 4, "Configuring Clients." On some hardware, however, the newer "ODI" NetWare drivers are required for reliable operations.</p>
<p>
If problems persist with the latest NetWare drivers, you may need to change the setting for the <b>NWShareHandles</b> and/or the <b>RestoreDrives</b> parameters. The effects of these parameters depend on the interrupt load on your system, so your hardware configuration may require a setting different from the default. In Windows for Workgroups version 3.1, these settings can be made through the Network application in the Control Panel. Select the Networks button and then select Novell NetWare in the Other Networks in Use box. Choose the Settings button and try different combinations of the NWShare Handles and Restore Drives check boxes. Try changing just the NWShare Handles setting first. If you are running Windows 3.1, you will need to add or change the [<b>NetWare</b>] section in the SYSTEM.INI file with a text editor. The section should look like this:</p>
<p>
<b>[NetWare]<br>
</b>NWShareHandles=TRUE<br>
RestoreDrives=FALSE</p>
<p>
The default for both of these settings is FALSE.</p>
