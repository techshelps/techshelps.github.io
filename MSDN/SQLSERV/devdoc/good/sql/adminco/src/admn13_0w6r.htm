<h2><a name="_push_subscriptions"></a>Push Subscriptions</h2>
<p>
A <i>push</i> subscription is carried out when administrative focus is set on the publication server. As part of the process of creating or managing a publication, subscriptions are created by "pushing" out a publication or an article to one or more subscription servers.</p>
<p>
One advantage of using push subscriptions is that they simplify and centralize subscription administration. The act of publishing is combined with the act of subscribing, and one person can perform both in the same administrative session. The need to separately administer each subscriber is eliminated. Another advantage is that for each publication, many subscribers can be set up at once. </p>
