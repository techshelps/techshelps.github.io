<h3><a name="_severity_levels_19_through_24"></a>Severity Levels 19 through 25</h3>
<p>
Problems that generate error messages with severity levels 19 and higher are considered <i>fatal</i> errors. The program code that was running to accomplish the current task is no longer running. Fatal errors of severity level 20 terminate the client connection to SQL Server. To continue working, you must reconnect to SQL Server. </p>
<p>
The SA should be informed every time an error with severity level 19 or higher occurs.
<dl>
<dt>
<b>Severity Level 19: SQL Server Error in Resource</b></dt>
<dd>
These messages indicate that some nonconfigurable internal limit has been exceeded. Level 19 errors rarely occur and they must be corrected by the SA or by your primary support provider.
<p>
The SA should be informed every time a level 19 message occurs.
</dd>
<dt>
<b>Severity Level 20: SQL Server Fatal Error in Current Process</b></dt>
<dd>
These messages indicate that a statement has encountered a problem. Because the problem has affected only the current process, it is unlikely that the database itself has been damaged.</dd>
<dt>
<b>Severity Level 21: SQL Server Fatal Error in Database (dbid) Processes</b></dt>
<dd>
These messages indicate that you have encountered a problem that affects all processes in the current database. It is unlikely, however, that the database itself has been damaged.</dd>
<dt>
<b>Severity Level 22: SQL Server Fatal Error Table Integrity Suspect</b></dt>
<dd>
These messages indicate that the table or index specified in the message has been damaged by a software or hardware problem.
<p>
Level 22 errors are rare. If you should encounter one, run the DBCC diagnostics as described in the <i>Microsoft SQL Server Transact-SQL Reference</i> to determine if other objects in the database are also damaged. It is possible that the problem is in the cache only and not on the disk itself. If so, restarting SQL Server will fix the problem. To continue working, you must reconnect to SQL Server. 

<p>
If restarting does not help, the problem is on the disk. Sometimes it can be solved by destroying the object specified in the error message. For example, if the message tells you that SQL Server has found a row with a length of 0 in a nonclustered index, delete the index and rebuild it. 
</dd>
<dt>
<b>Severity Level 23: SQL Server Fatal Error: Database Integrity Suspect</b></dt>
<dd>
These messages indicate that the integrity of the entire database is suspect due to damage caused by a hardware or software problem.
<p>
Level 23 errors are rare. If you should encounter one, run the DBCC diagnostics as described in the <i>Microsoft SQL Server Transact-SQL Reference</i> to determine the extent of the damage. Even when the whole database is suspect, it is possible that the damage is confined to the cache and that the disk itself is fine. If so, restarting SQL Server will fix the problem.
</dd>
<dt>
<b>Severity Level 24: Hardware Error</b></dt>
<dd>
These messages indicate some type of media failure. The SA might have to reload the database. It might also be necessary to call your hardware vendor.</dd>
<dt>
<b>Severity Level 25: Internal System Error</b></dt>
<dd>
These messages indicate some type of system error, such as a page chain corruption.
</dd>
