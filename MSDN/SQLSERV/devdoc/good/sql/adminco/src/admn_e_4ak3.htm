<p>
Microsoft distributes Dvorak keyboard layouts that make the most frequently typed characters on a keyboard more accessible to people who have difficulty using the standard "QWERTY" layout. There are three Dvorak layouts: one for two-handed users, one for people who type with their left hand only, and one for people who type with their right hand only. The left-handed or right-handed keyboard layouts can also be used by people who type with a single finger or a wand. You do not need to purchase any special equipment in order to use these features.</p>
<p>
Microsoft Windows already supports the two-handed Dvorak layout, which can be useful for coping with or avoiding types of repetitive-motion injuries associated with typing. To get this layout, choose International from the Windows Control Panel. The two layouts for people who type with one hand are distributed as Microsoft Application Note GA0650. This note is also contained in file GA0650.ZIP on most network services or GA0650.EXE on the Microsoft Download Service. For instructions on obtaining this application note, see the preceding section, "Access Pack for Microsoft Windows."</p>
