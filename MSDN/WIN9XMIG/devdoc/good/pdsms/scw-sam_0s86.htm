<p>
<span style=color:#FF0000>[This is preliminary documentation and subject to change.]</span> </p>
<p>
Your application requires a standard Setup .inf file. This section details only those modifications required to integrate with the Setup Computer Wizard (SCW). For more information on the .inf file required for setting up your application, see the documentation that accompanied your Setup management software.</p>
<p>
Along with the other information you must place in your application .inf file, you must provide the following information to SCW:
<ul>
<li>
The name of the .inf section that contains information about your setup application.</li>
<li>
The symbol number of the icon to associate with your application. </li>
<li>
The command line text to install your application on the client workstation.</li>
<li>
The command line text to remove (uninstall) your application from the client workstation.</li>
<li>
The amount of disk space in megabytes that your application needs during installation. This includes temporary files and directories.</li>
<li>
Message strings your application may need to display during installation.</li>
</ul>
<h5>To create the .inf file for your setup application</h5>
<ol>
<li>
Include the required [Version] section.</li>
<li>
Under the [Version] section, include the <i>Signature</i> parameter with the value <b>$WINDOWS NT$</b>.</li>
<li>
Include the [Optional Components] section.</li>
<li>
Under the [Optional Components] section, include the name of the section that contains the information about your Setup application. Only one application per .inf file is allowed.</li>
<li>
Under your [<i>application</i>] section, you can use the optional <i>OptionDesc</i> and <i>Tip</i> parameters to provide explanatory text about your application to SCW. The values for these optional parameters must be string parameters defined in the [Strings] section.</li>
<li>
Under your [<i>application</i>] section, add the <i>IconIndex</i> parameter with the index number of the icon you plan to use for your application Setup program. Legal values for <i>IconIndex</i> are defined in <a href="scw-sam_0hbn.htm">Icon Indices</a>.</li>
<li>
Under your [<i>application</i>] section, add the <i>InstallCmd</i> parameter with the actual quoted text required to run your Setup program in unattended mode. Do not use a value from the [String] section. <p>
Use the %SBSServer% environment variable for the path to the server, and construct the install command from that location. Small Business Server shares the %SBSServer%\CLIENTS directory that you can use for this purpose. If you don't use the %SBSServer%\CLIENTS directory, then you will have to make sure that users who install your application has permission to run programs in the directory.
</li>
<li>
Under your [<i>application</i>] section, add the <i>UninstallCmd</i> parameter with the actual quoted text required to remove your application from the client computer in unattended mode. Do not use a value from the [String] section.</li>
<li>
Under your [<i>application</i>] section, add the <i>DiskSpaceEstimate</i> parameter with the number of megabytes your setup application needs on the client computer during installation. This includes temporary directories. </li>
<li>
Under the [Strings] section, add the string parameters for optional messages you need.</li>
</ol>
