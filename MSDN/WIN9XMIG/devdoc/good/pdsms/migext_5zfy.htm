<h1><a name="_zaw__incompatible_messages_section"></a>[Incompatible Messages] Section</h1>
<p>
<span style=color:#FF0000>[This is preliminary documentation and subject to change.]</span> </p>
<p>
You use this section to present messages to a user through the Setup incompatibility report (displayed during the Windows 95 or Windows 98 phase of the upgrade process). The report is presented to the user before any changes are made to the computer and is useful when you intend to change the behavior of an application or when you plan to remove application components.</p>
<p>
The syntax for this section is:</p>
<p>
<i>&lt;Message Object Section&gt; = &lt;Message&gt;</i>
<dl>
<dt>
<i>Message Object Section </i></dt>
<dd>
Specifies the name of a custom section (defined by your migration DLL) that contains a list of message objects such as files, directories, and registry entries. The name may be any combination of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and spaces. It may not start or end with a space. By listing one or more message objects in a separate section, your DLL can associate several message objects with a single message. The value for <i>Message Object Section</i> is used as the component string in the compatibility report presented to the end user.</dd>
<dt>
<i>Message</i></dt>
<dd>
Is a string describing the details of the incompatibility or message to be displayed to the user. The user will see the text in a multiline, scrollable, read-only edit control.
</dd>
</dl>
<p>
For example, this incompatibility section may contain the following line:</p>
<pre><code>MyAppMsg = "The DOS and Real-mode portions of Myapp.exe are not supported on Windows NT"
</code></pre>
<p>
Where <i>MyAppMsg</i> refers to another section containing the list of files, directories, and registry entries associated with the message string.</p>
<p class=indent1>
<b>Notes</b>  When you write an entry to the [Incompatible Messages] section, a <i>Message Object Section</i> must provide one or more objects associated with the message.</p>
<p>
Your migration DLL is responsible for managing the code page and language dependencies of the messages listed in this section. In particular, the text in the [Incompatible Messages] section must be in the same language as the active Windows 95 or Windows 98 system. Your DLL must not write messages to this section if it does not support the active operating system language.</p>
<p>
The user has an option to view, print, or save the incompatibility report generated. This report will associate the <i>ProductID</i> with each <i>Message</i>.</p>
