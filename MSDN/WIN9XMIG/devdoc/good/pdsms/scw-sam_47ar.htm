<p>
Detect if a user has run your Setup program from a client computer connected to a Microsoft® Small Business Server and give the user the option to integrate with client setup.</p>
<p>
Provide tools that integrate with the client setup process automatically to automate this process. This could include copying files and making the modifications to the Scw.ini file.</p>
<p>
Test your applications to verify they install and work successfully. Some applications may not integrate well with the SCW installation model.</p>
<p>
Work with your customers to ensure they have the required software licenses. SCW provides a deployment mechanism for installing applications. It doesn't implement licensing. If your application requires licenses for each computer, you must configure. </p>
