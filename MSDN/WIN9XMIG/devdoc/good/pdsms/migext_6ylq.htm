<p>
This section contains a list of paths that are not part of the active Windows 95 or Windows 98 system configuration. Setup does not search through any of these paths or their subdirectories. Excluded paths include directories on the system drive used by other operating systems, network drives, and substituted or compressed drives. Setup writes to this section. </p>
<p>
If your application is installed in any one of the paths listed in this section, your DLL must consider the application as not installed and must return ERROR_NOT_INSTALLED when initializing. </p>
<p>
Your migration DLL can read the paths listed in this section using the Setup API <b>SetupGetLineCount</b> and <b>SetupGetLineText</b> functions. You can then use string matching to determine if a path you need is excluded. Your DLL must never make changes to the directories listed in this section.</p>
