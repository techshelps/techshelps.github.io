<p>
To support the Migration Extension Interface, the Win9x Upgrade section has been added to the UNATTEND.TXT answer file. (Note that this is subject to change before Beta 2.)</p>
<p>
[Win9x Upgrade]
<dl>
<dt>
Attended = [Yes|No]</dt>
<dd>
Default value is Yes. Attended specifies if the upgrade is running in attended mode or not. When set to No, Setup assumes default values for the rest of the Win9x Upgrade section parameters:</dd>
<dt>
MigrationDllPath = &lt;path&gt;</dt>
<dd>
Specifies a local or UNC path to migration DLLs. Setup will search this directory and its subdirectories for migration DLLs.</dd>
<dt>
ReportOnly = [No|Yes]</dt>
<dd>
Default value is No. This parameter forces Setup to generate a compatibility report and then terminate without upgrading the computer.</dd>
<dt>
SaveReportTo = &lt;path&gt;</dt>
<dd>
Default is the local computer system drive (generally C:\). Specifies a local or UNC path (not a file name) to the desired location of Setup compatibility report files (HARDWARE.TXT and SOFTWARE.TXT). HARDWARE.TXT contains the hardware compatibility report. SOFTWARE.TXT contains the software compatibility report.</dd>
<dt>
AppendComputerNameToPaths = [No|Yes]</dt>
<dd>
Default value is No. This key is used to specify whether the computer name should be appended to the path to which the compatibility reports are to be saved. The directory is created if it does not already exist. For example, if SaveReportTo = C:\reports and the computer name is Testcomp, the reports would be saved to C:\reports\Testcomp.
