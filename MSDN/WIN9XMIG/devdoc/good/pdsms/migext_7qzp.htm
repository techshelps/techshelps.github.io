<p>
<span style=color:#FF0000>[This is preliminary documentation and subject to change.]</span> </p>
<p>
During the Windows 95 or Windows 98 phase of the upgrade, Windows NT Setup creates and uses MIGRATE.INF files to collect file information from all migration DLLs. During the Windows NT portion of the upgrade, Setup uses this same file to provide that information back to the submitting migration DLL. </p>
<p>
Each working directory passed to a migration DLL has a MIGRATE.INF file in it. The sections are:</p>
<table cellspacing=4 cols=2>
<tr valign=top>
<th align=left width=31%>Section</th>
<th align=left width=69%>Description</th>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=31%><a href="migext_065q.htm">[Version]</a></td>
<td width=69%>This is a generic section required for every Windows 95- and Windows 98-style INF. It contains information about the version of Windows NT being used for the upgrade. Setup writes to this section. </td>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=31%><a href="migext_3q26.htm">[Migration Paths]</a></td>
<td width=69%>This section contains a list of Win32 paths to files requested by your migration DLL through the <b>QueryVersion</b> function <i>ExeNamesBuf</i> parameter. Each line represents the full path to a file. Setup writes to this section. </td>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=31%><a href="migext_6ylq.htm">[Excluded Paths]</a></td>
<td width=69%>This section contains a list of paths not part of the active Windows 95 or Windows 98 system configuration. Setup does not search through any of these paths or their subdirectories. Excluded paths include directories on the system drive used by other operating systems, network drives, and substituted or compressed drives. Setup writes to this section. </td>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=31%><a href="migext_9lpq.htm">[Handled]</a></td>
<td width=69%>You use this section to inform Windows NT Setup about files, directories, and registry entries in the active Windows 95 or Windows 98 installation you intend to migrate using your migration DLL. <p>
Setup assumes that files, directories, and registry entries listed here are compatible with Windows NT 5.0. Therefore, users will not be warned about incompatibilities associated with these components. All file names, directories, and registry entries listed in this section must be valid on the active Windows 95 or Windows 98 system.</p>
<p>
You can use the <b>WritePrivateProfileString</b> function for adding lines to this section.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=31%><a href="migext_6kry.htm">[Moved]</a></td>
<td width=69%>You use this section to inform Windows NT Setup about files and directories you plan to move, rename, or delete during the migration. This enables Setup to adjust the relevant Windows NT Explorer shell links. <p>
You can use the <b>WritePrivateProfileString</b> function for adding lines to this section.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=31%><a href="migext_5zfy.htm">[Incompatible Messages]</a></td>
<td width=69%>You use this section to present messages to a user through the Setup incompatibility report (displayed during the Windows 95 or Windows 98 phase of the upgrade process). The report is presented to the user before any changes are made to the computer and is useful when you intend to change the behavior of an application or when you plan to remove application components.</td>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=31%><a href="migext_2ywe.htm">[&lt;Message Object Section&gt;]</a></td>
<td width=69%>A message object section provides a mechanism for you to associate one or more message objects (file, directory, and registry location) with a message specified in the <b>[Incompatible Messages]</b> section.</td>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=31%><a href="migext_0z6n.htm">[Windows NT Disk Space Requirements]</a></td>
<td width=69%>You use this section to specify the amount of disk space (on a per drive basis) your migration DLL requires during the Windows NT phase of the upgrade. Setup uses this information to calculate the total amount of space required for the upgrade. If sufficient space is unavailable, Setup informs the user accordingly during the Windows 95 or Windows 98 phase of the upgrade.</td>
