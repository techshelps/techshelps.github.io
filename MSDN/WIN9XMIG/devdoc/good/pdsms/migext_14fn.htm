<p>
The Migration Extension Interface is designed to fit into the upgrade process as follows:
<ol>
<li>
A user installs your application on a Windows® 95- or Windows 98-based system. You place your MIGRATE.DLL file (and other associated files) on your distribution media or on the World Wide Web site where the user installed the application.</li>
<li>
Sometime later, the user runs the Windows NT® 5.0 Setup program, which prompts the user for the location of the migration DLLs.</li>
<li>
Setup locates (via user input) and activates your MIGRATE.DLL, passing it its MIGRATE.INF file.</li>
<li>
Your MIGRATE.DLL modifies the MIGRATE.INF file with the relevant information and passes it back to Windows NT Setup.</li>
<li>
Windows NT Setup continues its installation process. When it begins the Windows NT portion of the installation, it again contacts your MIGRATE.DLL and passes it the MIGRATE.INF file.</li>
<li>
Your MIGRATE.DLL uses the information it wrote into the  MIGRATE.INF file and takes the appropriate actions to enable your application to run under Windows NT.</li>
</ol>
