<h1><a name="_zaw__windows_nt_disk_space_requirements_"></a>[Windows NT Disk Space Requirements] Section</h1>
<p>
<span style=color:#FF0000>[This is preliminary documentation and subject to change.]</span> </p>
<p>
You use this section to specify the amount of disk space (on a per-drive basis) your migration DLL requires during the Windows NT phase of the upgrade. Setup uses this information to calculate the total amount of space required for the upgrade. If sufficient space is unavailable, Setup informs the user accordingly during the Windows 95 or Windows 98 phase of the upgrade.</p>
<p>
The syntax for this section is:</p>
<p>
<i>&lt;DriveLetter&gt; = &lt;Space Required&gt;</i>
<dl>
<dt>
<i>DriveLetter </i></dt>
<dd>
Specifies the drive/partition (single letter without a colon or backslash) in which a migration DLL requires space for its private data. Setup will ignore drives/partitions that are also listed in the <b>[Excluded Paths]</b> section.</dd>
<dt>
<i>Space Required </i></dt>
<dd>
Is an integer that indicates the amount of disk space in (bytes) required by a migration DLL during the Windows NT phase of Setup. When calculating space requirements, the amount of space lost from directory and cluster use must be taken into account. The number does not include the files copied into the working directory during the Windows 95 or Windows 98 phase. 
</dd>
</dl>
<p>
If this section is not present, or if no drives or partitions are specified, Setup assumes that the migration DLL requires no additional hard disk space to migrate the target application. </p>
<p>
<b>Important</b>  Be sure to specify the correct disk space requirement data. If you cannot calculate disk space requirements accurately, you should provide a liberal estimate of the space required.</p>
