<p>
The client optional component file (Clioc.inf) is used exclusively by applications using the integration features of the Setup Computer Wizard (SCW). </p>
<p>
Your preinstallation program will find the Clioc.inf file in the %sbs%\SmallBusiness\Template directory. The name and identifier of your application setup .inf file must be added to this file.</p>
<p>
Your preinstallation program must add your application setup .inf information to the [Components] section of Clioc.inf. </p>
<p>
Entries in the [Components] section have the following format:</p>
<pre><code>"","",&lt;inf-file-name&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>
where
<dl>
<dt>
inf-file-name</dt>
<dd>
The name of the information file that you supply with your Setup program.

<p>
<b>Note</b>  The first two quote-enclosed null fields in the line are required.

</dd>
</dl>
<p>
Do not place your application entry after the client entry. In addition, do not change the order of any of the applications already listed. </p>
<p>
If your preinstallation program places the entry for your application setup INF file in another location within Clioc.inf, SCW will ignore that entry. Users will not be able to install your application.</p>
<p>
The following shows the content of the default Clioc.inf file.</p>
<pre><code>[Components.w95]
proxy = "","",cliproxy.inf
outlook = "","",clioutl.inf
clifax = "","",clifax.inf
mshare = "","",climshr.inf
ie3 = "","",cliie3.inf
client = ..\..\setup\win95\ocsam.dll,OcEntry,client.inf

[Components.x86]
proxy = "","",cliproxy.inf
outlook = "","",clioutl.inf
clifax = "","",ntfax.inf
mshare = "","",ntmshr.inf
ie3 = "","",cliie3.inf
client = ..\..\setup\i386\ocsam.dll,OcEntry,client.inf
</code></pre>
<p>
You must add the line describing your application to both the Components.w95 and Components.x86 blocks if it runs on both the Microsoft® Windows NT® and Microsoft® Windows® 95 platforms. If it runs only on Windows 95, then add your application to the components.w95 section only.</p>
<p>
In addition, you must also add a register key and value so SCW can detect whether your application is already installed. You do this by adding a section to the end of the CLIOC.INF file in the format:</p>
<pre><code>HKLM="&lt;register key&gt;","&lt;value&gt;"
</code></pre>
<p>
For example:</p>
<pre><code>[client]
HKLM="SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Uninstall\Client","DisplayName"</code></pre>
<p>&nbsp;</p></body>
