<h3><a name="_win32_window_procedure"></a>Window Procedure</h3>
<p>
A window procedure is a function that receives and processes all messages sent to the window. Every window class has a window procedure, and every window created with that class uses that same window procedure to respond to messages. </p>
<p>
The system sends a message to a window procedure by passing the message data as arguments to the procedure. The window procedure then performs an appropriate action for the message; it checks the message identifier and, while processing the message, uses the information specified by the message parameters. </p>
<p>
A window procedure does not usually ignore a message. If it does not process a message, it must send the message back to the system for default processing. The window procedure does this by calling the <a href="winprocs_10o3.htm"><b>DefWindowProc</b></a> function, which performs a default action and returns a message result. The window procedure must then return this value as its own message result. Most window procedures process just a few messages and pass the others on to the system by calling <b>DefWindowProc</b>. </p>
<p>
Because a window procedure is shared by all windows belonging to the same class, it can process messages for several different windows. To identify the specific window affected by the message, a window procedure can examine the window handle passed with a message. For more information about window procedures, see <a href="winprocs_1iyb.htm">Window Procedures</a>. </p>
