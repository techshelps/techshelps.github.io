<h2><a name="_win32_removing_a_caret"></a>Removing a Caret</h2>
<p>
You can temporarily remove a caret by hiding it, or you can permanently remove the caret by destroying it. To hide the caret, use the <a href="caret_1p9w.htm"><b>HideCaret</b></a> function. This is useful when your application must redraw the screen while processing a message, but must keep the caret out of the way. When the application finishes drawing, it can display the caret again by using the <a href="caret_0r78.htm"><b>ShowCaret</b></a> function. Hiding the caret does not destroy its shape or invalidate the insertion point. Hiding the caret is cumulative; that is, if the application calls <b>HideCaret</b> five times, it must also call <b>ShowCaret</b> five times before the caret will reappear. </p>
<p>
To remove the caret from the screen and destroy its shape, use using the <a href="caret_8ng4.htm"><b>DestroyCaret</b></a> function. <b>DestroyCaret</b> destroys the caret only if the window involved in the current task owns the caret. </p>
