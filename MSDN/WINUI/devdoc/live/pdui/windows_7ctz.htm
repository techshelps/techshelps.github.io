<h3><a name="_win32_components_of_an_application_window"></a>Components of an Application Window</h3>
<p>
An application window includes elements such as a title bar, a menu bar, the window menu (formerly known as the system menu), the minimize button, the maximize button, the restore button, the close button, a sizing border, a client area, a horizontal scroll bar, and a vertical scroll bar. An application's main window typically includes all of these components. The following illustration shows these components in a typical main window. </p>

<p>
The <i>title bar</i> displays an application-defined icon and line of text; typically, the text specifies the name of the application or indicates the purpose of the window. An application specifies the icon and text when creating the window. The title bar also makes it possible for the user to move the window by using a mouse or other pointing device. </p>
<p>
Most applications include a <i>menu bar</i> that lists the commands supported by the application. Items in the menu bar represent the main categories of commands. Clicking an item on the menu bar typically opens a pop-up menu whose items correspond to the tasks within a given category. By clicking a command, the user directs the application to carry out a task. </p>
<p>
The <i>window menu</i> is created and managed by the system. It contains a standard set of menu items that, when chosen by the user, set a window's size or position, close the application, or perform tasks. For more information, see <a href="newmenus_1gz7.htm">Menus</a>. </p>
<p>
When you click the maximize or minimize button, this affects the size and position of the window. When you click the <i>maximize button</i>, the system enlarges the window to the size of the screen and positions the window, so it covers the entire desktop, minus the taskbar. At the same time, the system replaces the maximize button with the restore button. The <i>restore button</i> is a bitmap that, when clicked, restores the window to its previous size and position. </p>
<p>
When the user clicks the <i>minimize button</i>, the system reduces the window to the size of its taskbar button, positions the window over the taskbar button, and displays the taskbar button in its normal state. To restore the application to its previous size and position, click its taskbar button.</p>
<p>
The <i>sizing border</i> is an area around the perimeter of the window that enables the user to size the window by using a mouse or other pointing device. </p>
<p>
The <i>client area</i> is the part of a window where the application displays output, such as text or graphics. For example, a desktop publishing application displays the current page of a document in the client area. The application must provide a function, called a window procedure, to process input to the window and display output in the client area. For more information, see <a href="winprocs_1iyb.htm">Window Procedures</a>. </p>
<p>
The <i>horizontal scroll bar</i> and <i>vertical scroll bar</i> convert mouse or keyboard input into values that an application uses to shift the contents of the client area either horizontally or vertically. For example, a word-processing application that displays a lengthy document typically provides a vertical scroll bar to enable the user to page up and down through the document. </p>
<p>
The title bar, menu bar, window menu, minimize and maximize buttons, sizing border, and scroll bars are referred to collectively as the window's <i>nonclient area</i>. The system manages most aspects of the nonclient area; the application manages everything else about the window. In particular, eac application manages the appearance and behavior of its client area. </p>
