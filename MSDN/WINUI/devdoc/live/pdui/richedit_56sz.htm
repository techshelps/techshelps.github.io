<h2><a name="_win32_word_and_line_breaks"></a>Word and Line Breaks</h2>
<p>
A rich edit control calls a function called a <i>word break procedure</i> to find breaks between words and to determine where it can break lines. The control uses this information when performing word wrap operations and when processing the ctrl+left and ctrl+right key combinations. An application can send messages to a rich edit control to replace the default word break procedure, to retrieve word break information, and to determine what line a given character falls on.</p>
<p>
Word break procedures for rich edit controls are similar to those for edit controls, but they have additional capabilities. Word break procedures for both kinds of controls can determine whether a character is a delimiter and can find the nearest word break before or after the specified position. A <i>delimiter</i> is a character that marks the end of a word, such as a space. In an edit control, word breaks occur only after delimiters.</p>
<p>
Word break procedures for rich edit controls also group characters into <i>character classes,</i> each identified by a value in the range 0x00 through 0x0F. Word breaks occur either after delimiters or between characters of different classes. Thus, a word break procedure with different classes for alphanumeric and punctuation characters would find two word breaks in the string "WIN.COM".</p>
<p>
A character's class can be combined with zero or more <i>word break flags</i> to form an eight-bit value. When performing word wrap operations, a rich edit control uses word break flags to determine where it can break lines. There are the following word break flags.</p>
<table cellspacing=4 cols=2>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=31%>WBF_BREAKAFTER</td>
<td width=69%>Lines may be broken after the character.</td>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=31%>WBF_BREAKLINE</td>
<td width=69%>The character is a delimiter. Delimiters mark the ends of words. Lines may be broken after delimiters.</td>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=31%>WBF_ISWHITE</td>
<td width=69%>The character is a white space character. Trailing white space characters are not included in the length of a line when wrapping.</td>
</tr>
</table><br>
<p>
The WBF_BREAKAFTER value is used to allow wrapping after a character that does not mark the end of a word, such as a hyphen.</p>
<p>
You can replace a rich edit control's default word break procedure with your own by using the <a href="editcon_93tv.htm">EM_SETWORDBREAKPROC</a> message. For more information about word break procedures, see the description of the <a href="editcon_9l7n.htm"><b>EditWordBreakProc</b></a> function.</p>
<p>
Alternately, you can use the <a href="richedit_9um0.htm">EM_SETWORDBREAKPROCEX</a> message to replace the default extended word break procedure with an <a href="richedit_7m7s.htm"><b>EditWordBreakProcEx</b></a> function. This function provides additional information about the text, such as the character set. You can use the <a href="richedit_78oo.htm">EM_GETWORDBREAKPROCEX</a> message to retrieve the address of the current extended word break procedure.</p>
<p>
You can use the <a href="richedit_963v.htm">EM_FINDWORDBREAK</a> message to find word breaks or to determine a character's class and word break flags. In turn, the control calls its word break procedure to get the requested information.</p>
<p>
To determine which line a given character falls on, you can use the <a href="richedit_5lbm.htm">EM_EXLINEFROMCHAR</a> message.</p>
