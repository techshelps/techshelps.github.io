<h3><a name="_win32_size_and_position_messages"></a>Size and Position Messages</h3>
<p>
The system sends the <a href="windows_2c8f.htm">WM_GETMINMAXINFO</a> message to a window whose size or position is about to change. For example, the message is sent when the user clicks <b>Move</b> or <b>Size</b> from the window menu or clicks the sizing border or title bar; the message is also sent when an application calls <a href="windows_2blf.htm"><b>SetWindowPos</b></a> to move or size the window. WM_GETMINMAXINFO includes a pointer to a <a href="windows_0eia.htm"><b>MINMAXINFO</b></a> structure containing the default maximized size and position for the window, as well as the default minimum and maximum tracking sizes. An application can override the defaults by processing WM_GETMINMAXINFO and setting the appropriate members of <b>MINMAXINFO</b>. A window must have the WS_THICKFRAME or WS_CAPTION style to receive WM_GETMINMAXINFO. A window with the WS_THICKFRAME style receives this message during the window-creation process, as well as when it is being moved or sized. </p>
<p>
The system sends the <a href="windows_717r.htm">WM_WINDOWPOSCHANGING</a> message to a window whose size, position, position in the Z order, or show state is about to change. This message includes a pointer to a <a href="windows_8oz6.htm"><b>WINDOWPOS</b></a> structure that specifies the window's new size, position, position in the Z order, and show state. By setting the members of <b>WINDOWPOS</b>, an application can affect the window's new size, position, and appearance. </p>
<p>
After changing a window's size, position, position in the Z order, or show state, the system sends the <a href="windows_5q90.htm">WM_WINDOWPOSCHANGED</a> message to the window. This message includes a pointer to <b>WINDOWPOS</b> that informs the window of its new size, position, position in the Z order, and show state. Setting the members of the <b>WINDOWPOS</b> structure that is passed with WM_WINDOWPOSCHANGED has no effect on the window. A window that must process <a href="windows_2pk5.htm">WM_SIZE</a> and <a href="windows_9ip1.htm">WM_MOVE</a> messages must pass WM_WINDOWPOSCHANGED to the <a href="winprocs_10o3.htm"><b>DefWindowProc</b></a> function; otherwise, the system does not send WM_SIZE and WM_MOVE messages to the window. </p>
<p>
The system sends the <a href="windows_7mg5.htm">WM_NCCALCSIZE</a> message to a window when the window is created or sized. The system uses the message to calculate the size of a window's client area and the position of the client area relative to the upper left corner of the window. A window typically passes this message to the default window procedure; however, this message can be useful in applications that customize a window's nonclient area or preserve portions of the client area when the window is sized.
