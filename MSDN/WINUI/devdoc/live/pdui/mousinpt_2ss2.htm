<h2><a name="_win32_tracking_the_mouse_cursor"></a>Tracking the Mouse Cursor</h2>
<p>
Win32-based applications often perform tasks that involve tracking the position of the mouse cursor. Most drawing applications, for example, track it during drawing operations, allowing the user to draw in a window's client area by dragging the mouse. Word-processing applications also track the cursor, enabling the user to select a word or block of text by clicking and dragging the mouse. </p>
<p>
Tracking the cursor typically involves processing the <a href="mousinpt_8uum.htm">WM_LBUTTONDOWN</a>, <a href="mousinpt_5085.htm">WM_MOUSEMOVE</a>, and <a href="mousinpt_9po0.htm">WM_LBUTTONUP</a> messages. A window determines when to begin tracking the cursor by checking the cursor position provided in the <i>lParam</i> parameter of the WM_LBUTTONDOWN message. For example, a word-processing application would begin tracking the cursor only if the WM_LBUTTONDOWN message occurred while the cursor was on a line of text, but not if it was past the end of the document. </p>
<p>
A window tracks the position of the cursor by processing the stream of WM_MOUSEMOVE messages posted to the window as the mouse moves. Processing the WM_MOUSEMOVE message typically involves a repetitive painting or drawing operation in the client area. For example, a drawing application might redraw a line repeatedly as the mouse moves. A window uses the WM_LBUTTONUP message as a signal to stop tracking the cursor. </p>
