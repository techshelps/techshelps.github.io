<h1><a name="_win32_windows"></a>Windows</h1>
<p>
In a graphical Win32-based application, a window is a rectangular area of the screen where the application displays output and receives input from the user. Therefore, one of the first tasks of a graphical Win32-based application is to create a window. </p>
<p>
A window shares the screen with other windows, including those from other applications. Only one window at a time can receive input from the user. The user can use the mouse, keyboard, or other input device to interact with this window and the application that owns it. </p>
