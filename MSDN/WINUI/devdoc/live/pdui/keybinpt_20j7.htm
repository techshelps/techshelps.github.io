<p>
Some non-English keyboards contain character keys that are not expected to produce characters by themselves. Instead, they are used to add a diacritic to the character produced by the subsequent keystroke. These keys are called <i>dead keys</i>. The circumflex key on a German keyboard is an example of a dead key. To enter the character consisting of an "o" with a circumflex, a German user would type the circumflex key followed by the "o" key. The window with the keyboard focus would receive the following sequence of messages: </p>
<p>
WM_KEYDOWN<br>
WM_DEADCHAR<br>
WM_KEYUP<br>
WM_KEYDOWN<br>
WM_CHAR<br>
WM_KEYUP</p>
<p>
<a href="messques_8vj9.htm"><b>TranslateMessage</b></a> generates the <a href="keybinpt_7c1e.htm">WM_DEADCHAR</a> message when it processes the <a href="keybinpt_9l7y.htm">WM_KEYDOWN</a> message from a dead key. Although the <i>wParam</i> parameter of the WM_DEADCHAR message contains the character code of the diacritic for the dead key, an application typically ignores the message. Instead, it processes the <a href="keybinpt_2otu.htm">WM_CHAR</a> message generated by the subsequent keystroke. The <i>wParam</i> parameter of the WM_CHAR message contains the character code of the letter with the diacritic. If the subsequent keystroke generates a character that cannot be combined with a diacritic, the system generates two WM_CHAR messages. The <i>wParam</i> parameter of the first contains the character code of the diacritic; the <i>wParam</i> parameter of the second contains the character code of the subsequent character key. </p>
<p>
The <b>TranslateMessage</b> function generates the <a href="keybinpt_91de.htm">WM_SYSDEADCHAR</a> message when it processes the <a href="keybinpt_1yjy.htm">WM_SYSKEYDOWN</a> message from a system dead key (a dead key that is pressed in combination with the alt key). An application typically ignores the WM_SYSDEADCHAR message. </p>
