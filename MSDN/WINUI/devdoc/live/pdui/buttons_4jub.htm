<h3><a name="_win32_owner_drawn_buttons"></a>Owner-Drawn Buttons</h3>
<p>
Unlike radio buttons, an <i>owner-drawn button</i> is painted by the application, not by the system, and has no predefined appearance or usage. Its purpose is to provide a button whose appearance and behavior are defined by the application alone. There is only one owner-drawn button style: BS_OWNERDRAW. </p>
<p>
When the user selects an owner-drawn button, the system sends the button's parent window a <a href="editcon_8wh0.htm">WM_COMMAND</a> message containing the <a href="buttons_8810.htm">BN_CLICKED</a> notification code, just as it does for a button that is not owner-drawn. The application must respond appropriately. </p>
<p>
For an example of an owner-drawn button, see <a href="buttons_4icz.htm">Using Owner-Drawn Buttons</a>.</p>
