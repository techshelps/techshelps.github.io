<p>
A <i>maximized window</i> is a window that has the WS_MAXIMIZE style. By default, the system enlarges a maximized window so that it fills the screen or, in the case of a child window, the parent window's client area. Although a window's size can be set to the same size of a maximized window, a maximized window is slightly different. The system automatically moves the window's title bar to the top of the screen or to the top of the parent window's client area. Also, the system disables the window's sizing border and the window-positioning capability of the title bar (so that the user cannot move the window by dragging the title bar). </p>
<p>
A <i>minimized window</i> is a window that has the WS_MINIMIZE style. By default, the system reduces a minimized window to the size of its taskbar button and moves the minimized window to the taskbar. A <i>restored window</i> is a window that has been returned to its previous size and position, that is, the size it was before it was minimized or maximized. </p>
<p>
If an application specifies the WS_MAXIMIZE or WS_MINIMIZE style in the <a href="windows_1w6w.htm"><b>CreateWindowEx</b></a> function, the window is initially maximized or minimized. After creating a window, an application can use the <a href="windows_96wn.htm"><b>CloseWindow</b></a> function to minimize the window. The <a href="windows_4u9f.htm"><b>ArrangeIconicWindows</b></a> function arranges the icons on the desktop, or it arranges a parent window's minimized child windows in the parent window. The <a href="windows_6otq.htm"><b>OpenIcon</b></a> function restores a minimized window to its previous size and position.</p>
<p>
The <a href="windows_2tdj.htm"><b>ShowWindow</b></a> function can minimize, maximize, or restore a window. It can also set the window's visibility and activation states. The <a href="windows_9v90.htm"><b>SetWindowPlacement</b></a> function includes the same functionality as <b>ShowWindow</b>, but it can override the window's default minimized, maximized, and restored positions. </p>
<p>
The <a href="windows_4ntw.htm"><b>IsZoomed</b></a> and <a href="windows_1e77.htm"><b>IsIconic</b></a> functions determine whether a given window is maximized or minimized, respectively. The <a href="windows_79bo.htm"><b>GetWindowPlacement</b></a> function retrieves the minimized, maximized, and restored positions for the window, and also determines the window's show state. </p>
<p>
When the system receives a command to maximize or restore a minimized window, it sends the window a <a href="windows_306m.htm">WM_QUERYOPEN</a> message. If the window procedure returns FALSE, the system ignores the maximize or restore command. </p>
<p>
The system automatically sets the size and position of a maximized window to the system-defined defaults for a maximized window. To override these defaults, an application can either call the <a href="windows_9v90.htm"><b>SetWindowPlacement</b></a> function or process the <a href="windows_2c8f.htm">WM_GETMINMAXINFO</a> message that is received by a window when the system is about to maximize the window. WM_GETMINMAXINFO includes a pointer to a <a href="windows_0eia.htm"><b>MINMAXINFO</b></a> structure containing values the system uses to set the maximized size and position. Replacing these values overrides the defaults. </p>
