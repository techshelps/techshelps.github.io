<h2><a name="_win32_adjusting_the_blink_time"></a>Adjusting the Blink Time</h2>
<p>
In 16-bit Windows, a Windows-based application could call the <a href="caret_5r51.htm"><b>GetCaretBlinkTime</b></a> function to save the current blink time, then call the <a href="caret_5bqd.htm"><b>SetCaretBlinkTime</b></a> function to adjust the blink time during its processing of the <a href="keybinpt_2ldf.htm">WM_SETFOCUS</a> message. The application would restore the saved blink time for the use of other applications by calling <b>SetCaretBlinkTime</b> during its processing of the <a href="keybinpt_9sc3.htm">WM_KILLFOCUS</a> message. However, this technique does not work on 32-bit Windows and Windows NT, because they are robust, multithreaded environments. Specifically, the deactivation of one application is not synchronized with the activation of another application, so that if one application hangs, another application can still be activated. </p>
<p>
Win32-based applications should respect the blink time chosen by the user. The <b>SetCaretBlinkTime</b> function should only be called by an application that allows the user to set the blink time. </p>
