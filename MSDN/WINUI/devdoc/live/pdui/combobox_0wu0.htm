<h3><a name="_win32_processing_the_wm_command_message_in_an_owner_drawn_dialog_box"></a>Processing the WM_COMMAND Message in an Owner-Drawn Dialog Box</h3>
<p>
When an event occurs in a dialog box control, the control notifies the dialog box procedure by means of a <a href="editcon_8wh0.htm">WM_COMMAND</a> message. The example in <a href="combobox_23w8.htm">Creating a Square Meal Dialog Box</a> processes notification messages from the combo box, the list box, and the <b>OK</b> button. The control identifier is in the low-order word of <i>wParam</i>, and the notification message is in the high-order word of <i>wParam</i>. </p>
<p>
If the control identifier is IDCOMBO, an event has occurred in the combo box. In response, the dialog box procedure ignores all other combo box events except <a href="combobox_79uz.htm">CBN_SELENDOK</a>, which indicates that a selection was made, the drop down was closed up, and the changes made should be accepted. The dialog box procedure calls <code>InitFoodList</code> to reset the contents of the list box and to add the names of the current selection in the drop-down list box. </p>
<p>
If the control identifier is IDLIST, an event has occurred in the list box. This causes the dialog box procedure to ignore all list box events except <a href="listbox_27or.htm">LBN_DBLCLK</a>, which indicates that the user has double-clicked a list item. This event is processed in the same way as if an <b>OK</b> button has been chosen. </p>
<p>
If the control identifier is IDOK, the user has chosen the <b>OK</b> button. In response, the dialog box procedure inserts the name of the selected food into the application's multi-line edit control, then calls the <a href="dlgboxes_9up3.htm"><b>EndDialog</b></a> function to close the dialog box. </p>
<p>
If the control identifier is IDCANCEL, the user has clicked the <b>Cancel</b> button. In response, the dialog box procedure calls <b>EndDialog</b> to close the dialog box. </p>
