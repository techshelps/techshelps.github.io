<h2><a name="_win32_menu_bars_and_menus"></a>Menu Bars and Menus</h2>
<p>
A menu is arranged in a hierarchy. At the top level of the hierarchy is the <i>menu bar</i>; <i>menus</i> drop down from the menu bar, and at the lower levels are <i>submenus</i>. A menu bar is sometimes called a <i>top-level menu</i>, and the menus and submenus are also known as <i>pop-up menus</i>.</p>
<p>
A menu item can either carry out a command or open a submenu. An item that carries out a command is called a <i>command item</i> or a <i>command</i>. </p>
<p>
An item on the menu bar almost always opens a menu. Menu bars rarely contain command items. A menu opened from the menu bar drops down from the menu bar and is sometimes called a <i>drop-down menu</i>. When a drop-down menu is displayed, it is attached to the menu bar. A menu item on the menu bar that opens a drop-down menu is also called a <i>menu name</i>.</p>
<p>
The menu names on a menu bar represent the main categories of commands that an application provides. Selecting a menu name from the menu bar typically opens a menu whose menu items correspond to the commands in a given category. For example, a menu bar might contain a <b>File</b> menu name that, when clicked by the user, activates a menu with menu items such as <b>New</b>, <b>Open</b>, and <b>Save</b>.</p>
<p>
Only an overlapped or pop-up window can contain a menu bar; a child window cannot contain one. If the window has a title bar, the system positions the menu bar just below it. A menu bar is always visible. A submenu is not visible, however, until the user selects a menu item that activates it. For more information about overlapped and pop-up windows, see <a href="windows_3p2r.htm">General Window Styles</a>.</p>
<p>
Each menu must have an owner window. The system sends messages to a menu's owner window when the user selects the menu or chooses an item from the menu. These messages are described in <a href="newmenus_7rqr.htm">Messages Used with Menus</a>. </p>
