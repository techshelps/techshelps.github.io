<h1><a name="_win32_about_static_controls"></a>About Static Controls</h1>
<p>
Applications often use static controls to label other controls or to separate a group of controls. Although static controls are child windows, they cannot be selected. Therefore, they cannot receive the keyboard focus and cannot have a keyboard interface. A static control that has the SS_NOTIFY style receives mouse input, notifying the parent window when the user clicks or double clicks the control. Static controls belong to the STATIC window class. </p>
<p>
Although static controls can be used in overlapped, pop-up, and child windows, they are designed for use in dialog boxes, where the system standardizes their behavior. By using static controls outside dialog boxes, a developer increases the risk that the application might behave in a nonstandard fashion. Typically, a developer either uses static controls in dialog boxes or uses the SS_OWNERDRAW style to create customized static controls. </p>
