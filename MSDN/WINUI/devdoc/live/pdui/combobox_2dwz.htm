<h2><a name="_win32_edit_control_selection_fields"></a>Edit Control Selection Fields</h2>
<p>
The <i>selection field</i> is the portion of a combo box that displays the currently selected list item. In simple and drop-down combo boxes, the selection field is an edit control and can be used to enter text that is not in the list. </p>
<p>
An application can retrieve or set the contents of the selection field and can determine or set the edit selection. The application can also limit the amount of text a user can type in the selection field. When the contents of the selection field change, the system sends notification messages to the parent window or dialog box procedure. </p>
<p>
To retrieve the content of the selection field, an application can send the <a href="windows_34ok.htm">WM_GETTEXT</a> message to the combo box. To set the contents of the selection field of a simple or drop-down combo box, an application can send the <a href="windows_5nxw.htm">WM_SETTEXT</a> message to the combo box. </p>
<p>
The <i>edit selection</i> is the range of selected text, if any, in the selection field of a simple or drop-down combo box. An application can determine the starting and ending character positions of the current selection by using the <a href="combobox_2p4c.htm">CB_GETEDITSEL</a> message. It can also select characters in the edit selection by using the <a href="combobox_2cdo.htm">CB_SETEDITSEL</a> message. </p>
<p>
Initially, the amount of text that the user can type into the selection field is limited by the size of the selection field. However, if the combobox has the CBS_AUTOHSCROLL style, the text can continue beyond the size of the selection field. An application can use the <a href="combobox_99pw.htm">CB_LIMITTEXT</a> message to limit the amount of text a user can type into the selection field, regardless of whether the control has the CBS_AUTOHSCROLL style.</p>
<p>
When the user edits the content of the selection field, the parent window or dialog box procedure receives notification messages. <a href="combobox_7c6d.htm">CBN_EDITUPDATE</a> is sent first, indicating that the text in the selection field has been edited. After the altered text is displayed, the system sends <a href="combobox_2lut.htm">CBN_EDITCHANGE</a>. When the selection field content changes as the result of a list item being selected, these messages are not sent. </p>
