<h3><a name="_win32_owned_windows"></a>Owned Windows</h3>
<p>
An overlapped or pop-up window can be owned by another overlapped or pop-up window. Being owned places several constraints on a window. 
<ul>
<li>
An owned window is always above its owner in the Z order. </li>
<li>
The system automatically destroys an owned window when its owner is destroyed. </li>
<li>
An owned window is hidden when its owner is minimized. </li>
</ul>
<p>
Only an overlapped or pop-up window can be an owner window; a child window cannot be an owner window. An application creates an owned window by specifying the owner's window handle as the <i>hwndParent</i> parameter of <a href="windows_1w6w.htm"><b>CreateWindowEx</b></a> when it creates a window with the WS_OVERLAPPED or WS_POPUP style. The <i>hwndParent</i> parameter must identify an overlapped or pop-up window. If <i>hwndParent</i> identifies a child window, the system assigns ownership to the top-level parent window of the child window. After creating an owned window, an application cannot transfer ownership of the window to another window. </p>
<p>
Dialog boxes and message boxes are owned windows by default. An application specifies the owner window when calling a function that creates a dialog box or message box. </p>
<p>
An application can use the <a href="windows_0p87.htm"><b>GetWindow</b></a> function with the GW_OWNER flag to retrieve a handle to a window's owner. </p>
