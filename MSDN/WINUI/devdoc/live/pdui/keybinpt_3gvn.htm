<h3><a name="_win32_system_and_nonsystem_keystrokes"></a>System and Nonsystem Keystrokes</h3>
<p>
The system makes a distinction between system keystrokes and nonsystem keystrokes. System keystrokes produce system keystroke messages, <a href="keybinpt_1yjy.htm">WM_SYSKEYDOWN</a> and <a href="keybinpt_9upc.htm">WM_SYSKEYUP</a>. Nonsystem keystrokes produce nonsystem keystroke messages, <a href="keybinpt_9l7y.htm">WM_KEYDOWN</a> and <a href="keybinpt_45dc.htm">WM_KEYUP</a>. </p>
<p>
If your window procedure must process a system keystroke message, make sure that after processing the message the procedure passes it to the <a href="winprocs_10o3.htm"><b>DefWindowProc</b></a> function. Otherwise, all system operations involving the alt key will be disabled whenever the window has the keyboard focus. That is, the user won't be able to access the window's menus or System menu, or use the alt+esc or alt+tab key combination to activate a different window. </p>
<p>
System keystroke messages are primarily for use by the system rather than by an application. The system uses them to provide its built-in keyboard interface to menus and to allow the user to control which window is active. System keystroke messages are generated when the user types a key in combination with the alt key, or when the user types and no window has the keyboard focus (for example, when the active application is minimized). In this case, the messages are posted to the message queue associated with the active window. </p>
<p>
Nonsystem keystroke messages are for use by application windows; the <b>DefWindowProc</b> function does nothing with them. A window procedure can discard any nonsystem keystroke messages that it does not need. </p>
