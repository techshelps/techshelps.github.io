<h1><a name="_win32_about_mouse_input"></a>About Mouse Input</h1>
<p>
The mouse is an important, but optional, user-input device for Win32-based applications. A well-written Win32-based application should include a mouse interface, but it should not depend on the mouse as the sole means of acquiring user input. The application should provide full keyboard support as well. </p>
<p>
A Win32-based application receives mouse input in the form of messages that are sent or posted to its windows. </p>
