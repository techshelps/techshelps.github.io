<p>
Accelerators are closely related to menus — both provide the user with access to an application's command set. Typically, users rely on an application's menus to learn the command set and then switch over to using accelerators as they become more proficient with the application. Accelerators provide faster, more direct access to commands than menus do. At a minimum, an application should provide accelerators for the more commonly used commands. Although accelerators typically generate commands that exist as menu items, they can also generate commands that have no equivalent menu items. </p>
