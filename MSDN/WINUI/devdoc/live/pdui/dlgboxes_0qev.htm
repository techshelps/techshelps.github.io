<h2><a name="_win32_owner_window"></a>Owner Window</h2>
<p>
Most dialog boxes have an owner window (or more simply, an owner). When creating the dialog box, the application sets the owner by specifying the owner's window handle. The system uses the owner to determine the position of the dialog box in the Z order so that the dialog box is always positioned above its owner. Also, the system can send messages to the window procedure of the owner, notifying it of events in the dialog box. </p>
<p>
The system automatically hides or destroys the dialog box whenever its owner is hidden or destroyed. This means the dialog box procedure requires no special processing to detect changes to the state of the owner window. </p>
<p>
Because the typical dialog box is used in conjunction with a command in a menu, the owner window is usually the window containing the menu. Although it is possible to create a dialog box that has no owner, it is not recommended. For example, when a modal dialog box has no owner, the system does not disable any of the application's other windows and allows the user to continue to carry out work in the other windows, defeating the purpose of the modal dialog box. </p>
<p>
When a modeless dialog box has no owner, the system neither hides nor destroys the dialog box when other windows in the application are hidden or destroyed. Although this does not defeat the purpose of the modeless dialog box, it requires that the application carry out special processing to ensure the dialog box is hidden and destroyed at appropriate times. </p>
