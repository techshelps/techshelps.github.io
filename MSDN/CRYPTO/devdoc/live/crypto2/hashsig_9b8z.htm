<h1><a name="_crypto2_hashes_and_digital_signatures"></a>Hashes and Digital Signatures</h1>
<p>
Using the functions described in this chapter, a user can <i>digitally sign</i> data so that any other user can easily verify that the data has not been changed since it was signed. The identity of the user who signed the data can also be easily verified.</p>
<p>
A digital signature consists of a small amount of binary data, typically less than 256 bytes. This signature can be bundled with the signed message or stored separately; depending on how a particular application has been implemented. </p>
<p>
The Microsoft® Base Cryptographic Provider creates digital signatures that conform to the RSA Public-Key Cryptography Standard (PKCS) #6.</p>
