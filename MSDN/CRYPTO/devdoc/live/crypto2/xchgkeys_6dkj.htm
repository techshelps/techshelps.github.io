<h2><a name="_crypto2_certificates_and_certification_authorities"></a>Certificates and Certification Authorities</h2>
<p>
A certificate is a packet of data that contains a user's public key, in addition to the data that serves to identify the user in the real world (for example, the user's name). Every certificate is created and signed by a trusted entity known as a certification authority.</p>
<p>
Because certificates are signed, they can be transmitted over a nonsecure network or stored on nonsecure media. Each time you receive a certificate, you should verify the signature by using the certification authority's public key.</p>
<p>
For more information on certificates see <a href="certs_50kz.htm">Authentication Using Certificates</a>, and <a href="mancerts_0yb7.htm">Managing Certificates</a>. </p>
<p>
<b>Warning</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;If you use the Microsoft Base Cryptographic Provider to create a certification authority, your license to issue certificates is limited to certificates intended for use in the context of your particular application or service.</p>
