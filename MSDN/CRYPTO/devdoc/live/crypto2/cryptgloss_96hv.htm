<a name="_crypto2_certificate_gly"></a><b>certificate</b></dt>
<dd>
A digitally signed statement that contains information about an entity and the entity's public key, thus binding these two pieces of information together. A certificate is issued by a trusted organization (or entity) called a <i>Certification Authority</i> (CA) after the CA has verified that the entity is who it says it is. 
<p>
Certificates can contain different types of data. For example, an X.509 certificate includes the format of the certificate, the serial number of the certificate, the algorithm used to sign the certificate, the name of the CA that issued the certificate, the name and public key of the entity requesting the certificate, and the CA's signature.
</dd>
<dt>
<a name="_crypto2_certification_authority_gly"></a><b>Certification Authority</b></dt>
<dd>
(CA) A trusted organization or entity that issues certificates for authentication purposes. Before issuing the certificate the CA first authenticates the entity requesting the certificate, then issues a certificate that includes information about the requester, including the requester's public key.</dd>
<dt>
<a name="_crypto2_certificate_blob_gly"></a><b>certificate blob</b></dt>
<dd>

<dt>
<a name="_crypto2_certificate_name_blob_gly"></a><b>certificate name blob</b></dt>
<dd>
An encoded representation of the name information that is included in certificates. Each name blob is mapped to a CERT_NAME_BOLB structure.

</dd>
<dt>
<a name="_crypto2_certificate_request_gly"></a><b>certificate request</b></dt>
<dd>
A specially formatted electronic message (sent to a CA) used to request a certificate. The request must contain the information required by the CA to authenticate the request, plus the public key of the entity requesting the certificate.
<p>

<p>
Microsoft Certificate Server performs a central role in the management of software security systems to enable secure communications across the Internet, corporate intranets, and other networks that are not secure. 
</dd>
<dt>
<a name="_crypto2_certificate_store_gly"></a><b>certificate store</b></dt>
<dd>
Typically, a permanent storage where certificates, certificate request lists (CRLs), and certificate trust lists (CTLs) are stored. It is possible, however, to create and open a certificate store solely in memory when working with certificates that do not need to be put in permanent storage.

<a name="_crypto2_cipher_block_chaining_gly"></a><b>Cipher Block Chaining</b></dt>
<dd>
(CBC) A method of operating a symmetric block cipher that uses feedback to combine previously generated ciphertext with new plaintext.
<p>
Each plaintext block is combined with the ciphertext of the previous block by a bitwise XOR before it is encrypted. Combining ciphertext and plaintext ensures that even if the plaintext contains many identical blocks, they will each encrypt to a different ciphertext block.

<p>
When the Microsoft Base Cryptographic Provider is used, CBC is the default cipher mode.
</dd>
<dt>
<a name="_crypto2_cipher_block_chaining_cbc_mac_gly"></a><b>Cipher Block Chaining (CBC) MAC</b></dt>

A block cipher method that encrypts the base data with a block cipher and then uses the last encrypted block as the hash value. The encryption algorithm used to build the MAC is the one that was specified when the session key was created.</dd>
<dt>
<a name="_crypto2_cipher_feedback_gly"></a><b>Cipher Feedback</b></dt>
<dd>
(CFB) A block cipher mode that processes small increments of plaintext into ciphertext, instead of processing an entire block at a time.
<p>
This mode uses a shift register that is one block size in length and divided into sections. For example, if the block size is 64 bits with eight bits processed at a time, then the shift register would be divided into eight sections.
</dd>
<dt>
<a name="_crypto2_cipher_mode_gly"></a><b>cipher mode</b></dt>
<dd>
A block cipher mode (each block is encrypted individually) that can be specified via the <b>CryptSetKeyParam</b> function. If the application does not explicitly specify one of these modes, then the cipher block chaining (CBC) cipher mode is used.

<i>ECB:</i> A block cipher mode that uses no feedback. 

<p>
<i>CBC:</i> A block cipher mode that introduces feedback by combining ciphertext and plaintext.

<p>
CFB: A block cipher mode that processes small increments of plaintext into ciphertext, instead of processing an entire block at a time.
