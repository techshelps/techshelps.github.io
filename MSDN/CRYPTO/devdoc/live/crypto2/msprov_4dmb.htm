<h1><a name="_crypto2_microsoft_cryptographic_service_providers"></a>Microsoft Cryptographic Service Providers</h1>
<p>
The following cryptographic service providers (CSP) are currently available from Microsoft®:</p>
<p>
<a href="msprov_554g.htm"><b>The Microsoft Base Cryptographic Provider, version 2.0</b></a>. The Microsoft Base Cryptographic Provider, version 2.0 provides a broad set of basic cryptographic functionalities that can be exported to other countries. It was initially distributed with the Microsoft CryptoAPI version 1.0, and is now distributed with version 2.0 for use with the Microsoft Windows NT® and Microsoft Windows® 95 operating environment.</p>
<p>
<a href="msprov_4434.htm"><b>The Microsoft Enhanced Cryptographic Provider, version 2.0</b></a>. The Microsoft Enhanced Cryptographic Provider, version 2.0 provides the same capabilities as the Microsoft Base Cryptographic Provider, but provides for stronger security through longer keys and additional algorithms. It can be used with both CryptoAPI versions, but is currently available only within North America.</p>
<p>
<a href="msprov_0omo.htm"><b>The Microsoft DSS Cryptographic Provider, version 1.0</b></a>. The Microsoft DSS Cryptographic Provider, version 1.0 provides hashing, data signing, and signature verification capability using the <a href="hashsig_67q7.htm">Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA)</a> and Digital Signature Standard (DSS) algorithms. It can be exported to other countries, and can be used with the Windows NT and Windows 95 operating environments.</p>
<p>
<a href="msprov_9x68.htm"><b>The Microsoft Base DSS and Diffie-Hellman Cryptographic Provider, version 1.0</b></a>. The Microsoft Base DSS and Diffie-Hellman Cryptographic Provider, version 1.0 is a superset of the DSS Cryptographic Provider, and supports Diffie-Hellman key exchange, hashing, data signing, and signature verification using the Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA) and Digital Signature Standard (DSS) algorithms. It can be exported to other countries, and is provided with the Windows NT and Windows 95 operating environments.</p>
<p>
<a href="msdhprov_9d80.htm"><b>The Microsoft DSS and Diffie-Hellman/Schannel Cryptographic Provider, Version 1.0</b></a>. The Microsoft DSS and Diffie-Hellman/Schannel Cryptographic Provider, version 1.0 supports hashing, data signing with DSS, generating Diffie-Hellman (D-H) keys, exchanging D-H keys, and exporting a D-H key. This CSP supports key derivation for the SSL3 and TLS1 protocols. It can be exported to other countries, and is provided with Windows NT 5.0 (or later).</p>
<p>
<a href="msrsprov_1z8w.htm"><b>The Microsoft RSA/Schannel Cryptographic Provider, Version 1.0</b></a>. The Microsoft RSA/Schannel Cryptographic Provider, version 1.0 supports hashing, data signing, and signature verification. The algorithm identifier CALG_SSL3_SHAMD5 is used for SSL 3.0 and TLS 1.0 client authentication. This CSP supports key derivation for the SSL2, PCT1, SSL3 and TLS1 protocols. The hash consists of a concatenation of a MD5 hash a SHA hash and signed with a RSA private key. It can be exported to other countries, and is provided with Windows NT 5.0 (or later).</p>
