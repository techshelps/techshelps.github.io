<h3><a name="_crypto2_symmetric_versus_public_key_encryption"></a>Symmetric Versus Public-Key Encryption</h3>
<p>
There are two main classes of encryption algorithms: <i>symmetric algorithms</i> and <i>public-key algorithms </i>(also known as <i>asymmetric</i> algorithms). Systems that use symmetric algorithms are sometimes referred to as <i>conventional</i>.</p>

<h4><a name="_crypto2_symmetric_algorithms"></a>Symmetric Algorithms</h4>
<p>
Symmetric algorithms are the most common type of encryption algorithm. They are known as symmetric because the same key is used for both encryption and decryption. Unlike the keys used with public-key algorithms, symmetric keys are frequently changed. For this reason, they are referred to here as <i>session keys</i>.</p>
<p>
Compared to public-key algorithms, symmetric algorithms are very fast and, thus, are preferred when encrypting large amounts of data. Some of the more common symmetric algorithms are RC2, RC4, and the Data Encryption Standard (DES).</p>

<h4><a name="_crypto2_public_key_algorithms"></a>Public-Key Algorithms</h4>
<p>
Public-key (asymmetric) algorithms use two different keys: the <i>public key</i> and the <i>private key</i>. The private key is kept private to the owner of the key pair, and the public key can be distributed to anyone who requests it (often by means of a certificate). If one key is used to encrypt a message, then the other key is required to decrypt the message.</p>
<p>
Public-key algorithms are very slow — on the order of 1,000 times slower than symmetric algorithms. Consequently, they are typically used only to encrypt session keys. They are also used to digitally sign messages, as discussed in the next section.</p>
<p>
One of the most common public-key algorithms is the <a href="enc_dec_4jzm.htm">RSA Public-Key Cipher</a>.</p>
