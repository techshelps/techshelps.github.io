<p>
In this section, the generic steps to signing data are reviewed. The following illustration depicts the individual tasks that must be accomplished, as shown in the list that follows it.</p>
<p>

<h5><img src="../../images/wedge.gif" border=0>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To create a signed message</h5>
<ol>
<li>
Create the data (if necessary) and get a pointer to it.</li>
<li>
Open a certificate store that contains the signer's certificate.</li>
<li>
Get the private key from the certificate. There are two properties that must be set on the certificate before using it—one is used to tie a certificate to a particular CSP, and within that CSP, to a particular private key, and the other is used to indicate which hashing algorithm is to be used when a digest operation is called for. These need only be set once.</li>
<li>
From the certificate property, determine the hash algorithm.</li>
<li>
Send the data through the hashing function by using the hashing algorithm, thus creating a hash (digest) of the data.</li>
<li>
Using the private key obtained through the property on the certificate, encrypt the digest, creating the signature.</li>
<li>
Include the following in the signed message:<ul>
<li>
The signed data</li>
<li>
The hash algorithm</li>
<li>
The signature</li>
<li>
The signer ID (certificate issuer and serial number)</li>
<li>
The signer's certificate (optional)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
