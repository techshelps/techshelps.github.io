<a name="_crypto2_electronic_codebook_gly"></a><b>Electronic Codebook</b></dt>
<dd>
(ECB) A block cipher mode (each block is encrypted individually) that uses no feedback. This means any blocks of plaintext that are identical (either in the same message or in a different message that is encrypted with the same key) is transformed into identical ciphertext blocks. 
<p>
Initialization vectors cannot be used with this cipher mode.

<p>
If a single bit of the ciphertext block is garbled, then the entire corresponding plaintext block is also garbled.
</dd>
<dt>
<a name="_crypto2_encoding_gly"></a><b>encoding</b></dt>
<dd>
The process of turning data into a stream of bits. Encoding is part of the serialization process that converts data into a stream of ones and zeros so that it can be transmitted over a serial line.</dd>
<dt>
<a name="_crypto2_encoding_type_gly"></a><b>encoding type</b></dt>
<dd>
Refers to which type of encoding is used for certificate and message encoding. The encoding types are specified as a DWORD, with the type of certificate encoding stored in the low-order word and the type of message encoding stored in the high-order word.
<p>
Although some functions or structure fields require only one of the encoding types, it is always acceptable to specify both. 
</dd>
<dt>
<a name="_crypto2_encryption_gly"></a><b>encryption</b></dt>
<dd>
The process in which data (plaintext) is translated into something that appears to be random and meaningless (ciphertext).</dd>
<dt>
<a name="_crypto2_encrypted_data_gly"></a><b>encrypted data</b></dt>
<dd>
Data that has been converted from plaintext into ciphertext. Encrypted messages are used to disguise the content of a message when it is sent or stored.</dd>
<dt>
<a name="_crypto2_encryption_and_decryption_functions_gly"></a><b>encryption and decryption functions</b></dt>
<dd>
A simplified message function used to encode and encrypt (or decode and decrypt) messages and data.
<p>

</dd>
<dt>
<a name="_crypto2_enhanced_content_type_gly"></a><b>enhanced content type</b></dt>
<dd>
A class of data contained in a PKCS #7 message that contains data (possibly encrypted), plus cryptographic enhancements such as hashes or signatures.
<p>
Types of enhanced data defined by PKCS #7 include signed data, enveloped data, signed-and-enveloped data, and digested (hashed) data.
</dd>
<dt>
<a name="_crypto2_enveloped_data_content_type_gly"></a><b>enveloped data content type</b></dt>
<dd>
A PKCS #7 enhanced content that consists of encrypted content (of any type) and content-encryption keys (for one or more recipients). The combination of encrypted content and encryption key for a recipient is called a <i>digital envelope</i> for that recipient.
<p>
This type of message should be used when you want to keep the contents of the message secret and allow only specified persons or entities to retrieve the contents.
</dd>
<dt>
<a name="_crypto2_exchange_key_gly"></a><b>exchange key</b></dt>
<dd>
See <i>exchange key pair.</i></dd>
<dt>
<a name="_crypto2_exchange_key_pair_gly"></a><b>exchange key pair</b></dt>
<dd>
A public/private key pair used to encrypt session keys so that they can be safely stored and exchanged with other users. Exchange key pairs are created by calling <b>CryptGenKey</b>.
<p>
Compare <i>signature key pair</i>.
</dd>
<dt>
<a name="_crypto2_external_store_gly"></a><b>external store</b></dt>
<dd>
A certificate store that maintains its certificates, CRLs, and CTLs in a location external to cached memory, such as in a database on a network server.
<p>
An external store does not read and decode its certificates, CRLs, and CTL when CertOpenStore is called. Reading and decoding is deferred until an enumeration or find.
