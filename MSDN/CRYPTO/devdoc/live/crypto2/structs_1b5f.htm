<h1><a name="_crypto2_cert_revocation_status"></a>CERT_REVOCATION_STATUS</h1>
<p>
The <b>CERT_REVOCATION_STATUS</b> structure is returned by <a href="certhelp_9tpq.htm"><b>CertVerifyRevocation</b></a> to specify the status of the revoked or unchecked context. See <a href="certhelp_9tpq.htm"><b>CertVerifyRevocation</b></a> for details.</p>
<pre><code>typedef struct _CERT_REVOCATION_STATUS {
    DWORD                   cbSize;
    DWORD                   dwIndex;
    DWORD                   dwError;
    DWORD                   dwReason;
} CERT_REVOCATION_STATUS, *PCERT_REVOCATION_STATUS;
 </code></pre>
<h4>Members</h4>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>cbSize</b></dt>
<dd>
The count of bytes in this data structure. 
<p>
Upon input to <a href="certhelp_9tpq.htm"><b>CertVerifyRevocation</b></a>, <b>cbSize</b> must be set to a size &gt;= <b>sizeof</b>(<b>CERT_REVOCATION_STATUS</b>). Otherwise, <b>CertVerifyRevocation</b> returns FALSE and sets <b>LastError</b> to E_INVALIDARG.
</dd>
<dt>
<b>dwIndex</b></dt>
<dd>
Upon return from <b>CertVerifyRevocation</b>, <b>dwIndex </b>specifies the index of the first context that was revoked or unable to be checked for revocation. If the caller wants more information about the remaining contexts that have not been checked, <b>CertVerifyRevocation</b> will need to be called again, specifying a list in <i>rgpvContext[] </i>that contains the unchecked contexts from the original list.</dd>
<dt>
<b>dwError</b></dt>
<dd>
Upon return from <a href="certhelp_9tpq.htm"><b>CertVerifyRevocation</b></a>, <b>dwError</b> specifies the error status. <b>LastError</b> as reported from <b>CertVerifyRevocation </b>is also set to this error status. See the table in the "Return Values" section in <a href="certhelp_9tpq.htm"><b>CertVerifyRevocation</b></a> for the list of error values.</dd>
<dt>
<b>dwReason</b></dt>
<dd>
Upon return from <b>CertVerifyRevocation</b>, <b>dwReason</b> specifies the reason for the error. <b>dwReason</b> is currently only set when <b>dwError</b> equals<b> </b>CRYPT_E_REVOKED and contains the reason why the context was revoked. It may be one of the following:
<dl>
<dt>
CRL_REASON_UNSPECIFIED    0</dt>
<dd>
No reason was specified for why the certificate was revoked.</dd>
<dt>
CRL_REASON_KEY_COMPROMISE    1</dt>
<dd>
Used in revocation of an end entity certificate. It indicates that it is known or suspected that the subject's private key, or other aspects of the subject validated in the certificate, have been compromised.</dd>
<dt>
CRL_REASON_CA_COMPROMISE    2</dt>
<dd>
Used in revocation of a CA-certificate. It indicates that it is known or suspected that the subject's private key, or other aspects of the subject validated in the certificate, have been compromised.</dd>
<dt>
CRL_REASON_AFFILIATION_CHANGED    3</dt>
<dd>
Indicates that the subject's name or other information in the certificate has been modified but there is no cause to suspect that the private key has been compromised.</dd>
<dt>
CRL_REASON_SUPERSEDED    4</dt>
<dd>
Indicates that the certificate has been superseded, but there is no cause to suspect that the private key has been compromised.</dd>
<dt>
CRL_REASON_CESSATION_OF_OPERATION    5</dt>
<dd>
Indicates that the certificate is no longer needed for the purpose of which it was issued, but there is no cause to suspect that the private key has been compromised.</dd>
<dt>
CRL_REASON_CERTIFICATE_HOLD    6</dt>
<dd>
Indicates that the certificate has been placed on hold.
