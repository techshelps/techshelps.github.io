<p>
When a function has been found that can perform the revocation verification check, it is called and passed the same parameters originally passed to <a href="certhelp_9tpq.htm"><b>CertVerifyRevocation</b></a>, with the exception of <i>rgpvContext</i>[] and <i>cContext. </i>Because a called function has the option to process one or more of the contexts<i>, rgpvContext</i>[] and <i>cContext</i> are updated to specify the remaining count of contexts and the next context to be checked. Also, the <b>cbSize</b> member of <i>pRevStatus</i> has been checked to be equal to or greater than the size of <a href="structs_1b5f.htm">CERT_REVOCATION_STATUS</a>, and the remaining members have been zeroed. </p>
<p>
A called revocation verification function reports back it's progress in the same manner that the <b>CertVerifyRevocation</b> return value is specified, with errors handled as follows: </p>
<p>
If all the contexts were successfully checked and none were revoked, then TRUE should be returned, otherwise FALSE should be returned. </p>
<p>
If FALSE is returned, the following actions should be taken:
<ul>
<li>
If one of the contexts is found to be revoked, the index of the revoked certificate context should be returned in the <b>dwIndex</b> member of <i>pRevStatus</i>. Additionally, the <b>dwError</b> member of <i>pRevStatus</i> should be set to CRYPT_E_REVOKED. If the reason for revocation is known, the <b>dwReason</b> member of <i>pRevStatus</i> should be set to one of the predefined reasons. See <a href="structs_1b5f.htm">CERT_REVOCATION_STATUS</a> for a list of reasons.</li>
<li>
If a context can't be checked for revocation, then the index of the unverified certificate context should be returned to the <b>dwIndex</b> member of <i>pRevStatus</i>. Additionally:<ul>
<li>
If the called function was capable of processing the context, but was unable to complete the revocation check, the <b>dwError</b> member of <i>pRevStatus</i> should be set to CRYPT_E_REVOCATION_OFFLINE.</li>
<li>
If the called function was not capable of processing the context, the <b>dwError</b> member of <i>pRevStatus</i> should be set to CRYPT_E_NO_REVOCATION_CHECK.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<b>Note</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="certhelp_9tpq.htm"><b>CertVerifyRevocation</b></a> sets <b>LastError</b> to the value returned in the <b>dwError</b> member of <i>pRevStatus</i>. </p>
