<h1><a name="_cryptcsp_introduction_to_csps"></a>Introduction to CSPs</h1>
<p>
This document defines the cryptographic service provider interface and describes the procedure by which custom cryptographic service providers (<a href="signcsp_6rn7.htm">CSPs</a>) are created.</p>
<p>
A tight focus on CSPs is maintained throughout this document. The following subjects are not covered:
<ul>
<li>
Cryptography</li>
<li>
Cryptographic protocols and standards</li>
<li>
Cryptographic application programming</li>
<li>
Windows programming</li>
</ul>
<p>
Even though these subjects are not discussed here, you will need to be familiar with most of them in order to implement a good CSP. Please refer to <a href="intro_3yni.htm">Related Documentation</a> for a list of additional reading. This document assumes that you have already read <i>CryptoAPI 2.0</i> in the <i>Microsoft</i>®<i> Platform SDK.</i></p>
<p>
As mentioned in the CryptoAPI 2.0 section of the Microsoft Platform SDK, cryptographic service providers (<a href="signcsp_6rn7.htm">CSPs</a>) contain implementations of cryptographic algorithms and standards.</p>
<p>
Every CSP consists of, at a minimum, a dynamic-link library (DLL) that exposes each of the functions in CryptoSPI. Many CSPs will be implemented (at least in part) in a Win32 service program, managed by the Win32 service control manager; or in hardware, such as a smart card or secure coprocessor. In either case, the DLL may merely act as a pass-through layer, facilitating the communication between the operating system and the actual CSP implementation.</p>
