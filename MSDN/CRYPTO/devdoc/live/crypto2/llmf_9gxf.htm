<p>
For the purpose of this discussion, a message is any data that has been encoded (and usually signed or encrypted) for transmission to another person or entity, or such data that has been received from another person or entity. This data may sometimes be signed data, and often includes certificates.</p>
<p>
The low-level message functions provide the necessary functionality to encode data for transmission, and decode data that has been received. Functionality is also provided to decrypt and verify the signatures of received messages.</p>
