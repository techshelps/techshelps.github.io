<H2>1.3  Windows Software Support</H2><P>Microsoft Windows provides VoiceView extensions to the Windows Sockets API for the application developer to use when transferring data between VoiceView-enabled devices. Microsoft Windows also provides the File Transfer API to easily accomplish a few well-defined file-transfer tasks using the Windows Sockets API (as well as APIs for other transport mechanisms.)</P>
<P>Microsoft Windows interacts with a VoiceView-enabled device by sending and receiving messages through the serial communications interface. The messages use an extension to the AT-type commands of the TIA/EIA – 602 and TIA/EIA – 615 standards.</P>
<P>In the future, Microsoft will add support for further voice and data integration technologies.  Simultaneous Voice-Data (SVD) lets users talk and transmit data at the same time on an analog phone line (as opposed to VoiceView, which flips between voice and data).  Ultimately, this architecture will scale to ISDN.</P>
<P>The following figure shows the structure of a typical that uses a VoiceView-enabled modem with a serial connection to the computer running the application and connections to the telephone network and a local telephone.</P>
