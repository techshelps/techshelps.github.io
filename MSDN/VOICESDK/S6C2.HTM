<H1>Integrating Voice and Data: Overview</h1>

<P>There are a number of technologies that allow both
voice and data to be exchanged on a single phone call without
having to hang up. By exploiting this capability, a variety of
new applications can be constructed that make the everyday
telephone call a richer experience.</p>

<P>The first of these technologies to be broadly
available is VoiceView, which is an alternating voice and data
protocol for hardware devices and software applications that
optimizes the integration of voice and data communications.
VoiceView allows a software application to very quickly switch
back and forth between sending voice and sending data on a call.</p>

<P>Voice-aware applications benefit the user by using a
computer to enhance communications during normal telephone calls.
The power of the computer increases the amount and accuracy of
exchanged information and decreases the time for a call. New
types of interaction, which are not possible in either a standard
data call or a standard voice call, also become available.
Applications for Microsoft Windows incorporate these benefits of
VoiceView and other voice-data technologies (such as simultaneous
voice-data or ultimately ISDN) by using the File Transfer API and
the Windows Sockets API.</p>
