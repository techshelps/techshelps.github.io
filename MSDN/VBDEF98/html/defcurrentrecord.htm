<h1><a name="defcurrentrecord"></a>current record</h1>
<p>
The record in a <b>Recordset</b> object that you can use to modify or examine data. Use the Move methods to reposition the current record in a recordset. Use the Find methods&nbsp; or the <b>Seek</b> method to change the current record position according to specific criteria.</p>
<p>
Only one record in a <b>Recordset</b> can be the current record; however, a <b>Recordset</b> may have no current record. For example, after a dynaset-type <b>Recordset</b> record has been deleted, or when a <b>Recordset</b> has no records, the current record is undefined. In this case, operations that refer to the current record result in a trappable error.</p>
