<h2><a name="_wolf_getclusternodestate"></a>GetClusterNodeState</h2>
<p>
The <b>GetClusterNodeState</b> function returns the current state of a node.</p>
<pre><code><b>CLUSTER_NODE_STATE WINAPI GetClusterNodeState(
  HNODE</b><i> hNode  </i>
<b>);</b>
 </code></pre>
<h4>Parameters</h4>
<dl>
<dt>
<i>hNode</i></dt>
<dd>
[in] Handle to the node for which state information should be returned.
</dd>
</dl>
<h4>Return Values</h4>
<p>
If the operation was successful, <b>GetClusterNodeState</b> returns the current state of the node, which is represented by one of the following values:</p>
<table cellspacing=4 cols=2>
<tr valign=top>
<th align=left width=48%>State</th>
<th align=left width=52%>Description</th>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=48%>ClusterNodeUp</td>
<td width=52%>The node is operational.</td>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=48%>ClusterNodeDown</td>
<td width=52%>The node is not operational. </td>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=48%>ClusterNodeJoining</td>
<td width=52%>The node is in the process of joining a cluster.</td>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=48%>ClusterNodePaused</td>
<td width=52%>The node has temporarily suspended activity.</td>
</tr>
</table><br>
<p>
If the operation was unsuccessful, <b>GetClusterNodeState</b> returns ClusterNodeStateUnknown. For more detailed information about the error, call the Win32 function <b>GetLastError</b>.</p>
<h4>Remarks</h4>
<p>
When a node is trying to form or rejoin a cluster or is down, it is in the ClusterNodeDown state. A node that is down is not an active cluster member and it may or may not be running. The <a href="wfintro_40bp.htm">Cluster Service</a> may have started and then failed, or may have failed to start completely.  </p>
<p>
When a node is operating as an active member of a cluster, it is in the ClusterNodeUp state. An node that is up responds to updates to the cluster database, can host and manage groups, and can maintain communication with other nodes in the cluster.</p>
<p>
When a node is operating as an active member of a cluster but cannot host any resources or resource groups, it is in the ClusterNodePaused state. Nodes that are undergoing maintenance are typically placed in this state.</p>
