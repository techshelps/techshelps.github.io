<p>
The Microsoft® Cluster Automation Server allows you to create instances of programmable objects that you can access with an application or tool that supports Automation, such as Microsoft Visual Basic®. Programmable objects expose properties that can be retrieved and updated and methods that can be invoked.through Visual Basic. The programmable objects provided by Cluster Server expose properties and methods that are specific to cluster management. </p>
<h5><img src="../../images/wedge.gif" border=0>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To prepare your environment for using the Cluster Automation Server with Visual Basic</h5>
<ol>
<li>
Install Microsoft Visual Basic version 4.0 or 5.0.</li>
<li>
Install the Microsoft Cluster Server SDK.</li>
<li>
Register MSCLUS.DLL, the dynamic link library that contains the Cluster Automation Server. Typically this registration is taken care of when you install the SDK. However, if you need to manually register MSCLUS.DLL, use the system registry program REGSVR32. </li>
</ol>
<p>
To test your environment, launch Visual Basic and choose <b>References</b> from the <b>Projects</b> menu. If MSCLUS.DLL has been registered properly, it will appear in the list of components as "MS Cluster 1.0 Type Library." Click the check box next to this item in the list to enable the Visual Basic Object Browser to include the programmable cluster objects. You will now be able to allocate instances of these objects, call their methods, and retrieve as well as set their properties.</p>
