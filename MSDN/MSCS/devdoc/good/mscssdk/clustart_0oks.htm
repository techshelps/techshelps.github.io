<p>
Creating a Cluster Administrator extension DLL involves implementing some of the methods from the Cluster Administrator Extension API and make calls to others. Whereas the Resource API is made up of standard functions, the Cluster Administrator Extension API is a COM-based API consisting of interfaces. Therefore, before concentrating on tasks specific to Cluster Administrator extensions, it is wise to become familiar with the COM programming model. For information on COM, see the "COM and ActiveX Object Services" section in the Microsoft Platform SDK.</p>
<p>
Also, if you use the Resource Type AppWizard to begin development, you will notice that the code it produces uses the Microsoft Foundation Classes (MFC) and C++ language. If you are not an experienced MFC user, it is recommended that you take some time to read the documentation included with Microsoft Visual C++® development system. </p>

<ol>
<li>
See <a href="clustart_8tlw.htm">Using the Resource Type AppWizard</a> to learn how to create a skeletal version of a Cluster Administrator extension DLL.</li>
<li>
See <a href="cluprops_1rxv.htm">Common Resource Properties</a> to determine how to use the information that is relevant to all cluster resources.</li>
<li>
If the resource type to be administered by your extension is based on an existing resource type, the discussion of the private properties for the Cluster Server resource types in <a href="cluprops_8mgj.htm">Private Resource Properties</a> should prove helpful. </li>
<li>
Use the <a href="cluadmex_8k15.htm">Cluster Administrator Extension API</a> to learn how to further supplement your Cluster Administrator extension DLL. The descriptions in the API reference will help you determine which of the interfaces you will need to implement and why and how you should implement them. It also describes when and how to make calls to Cluster Administrator. </li>
<li>
Use the <a href="clustruct_2qer.htm">Cluster Structures</a> reference to learn how to store various properties and other information that you might want to expose in your Cluster Administrator extension property sheet. </li>
<li>
Refer to the relevant portions of the Cluster API for making calls to the Cluster Service:<p class=indent1>
<a href="clusapi_7ncj.htm">Cluster Management Functions</a> discusses functions for accessing the cluster as a whole.</p>
<p class=indent1>
<a href="clusapi_4zxv.htm">Node Management Functions</a> discusses functions for accessing cluster nodes.</p>
<p class=indent1>
<a href="clusapi_92lv.htm">Group Management Functions</a> discusses functions for accessing cluster groups.</p>

<a href="clusapi_9t9v.htm">Resource Management Functions</a> discusses functions for accessing resources.</p>
<p class=indent1>
<a href="clusapi_54kz.htm">Cluster Database Management Functions</a> discusses functions for accessing the cluster database.</p>
</li>

When you are ready to test, refer to <a href="clustart_5ujw.htm">Registering a Cluster Administrator Extension DLL</a> to help with registration and <a href="clustart_0tws.htm">Debugging a Cluster Administrator Extension DLL</a> to help with debugging.</li>
