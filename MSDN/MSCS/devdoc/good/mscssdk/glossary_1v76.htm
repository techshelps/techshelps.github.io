<a name="_wolf_recovery_log"></a><b>Recovery Log</b></dt>
<dd>
A file that maintains a history of all of the transactions affecting the cluster database on any of the cluster nodes. The recovery log is stored on the cluster's quorum resource and is also referred to as the quorum log.</dd>

<a name="_wolf_redundant_array_of_inexpensive_disks_raid_"></a><b>Redundant Array of Inexpensive Disks (RAID)</b></dt>
<dd>
A storage device that uses two or more magnetic or optical disks working in tandem to increase performance and provide various levels of error recovery and fault tolerance. RAID can be implemented in software using standard disk controllers, or it can be designed into the disk controller itself. </dd>
<dt>
<a name="_wolf_reliability"></a><b>Reliability</b></dt>
<dd>
Degree to which data in a transfer is guaranteed to arrive at its destination in its intended form. Reliability refers to three distinct attributes: (a) the degree to which a system or component achieves a transfer, (b) the degree to which a system or component can fail and the transfer still occur, and (c) the degree to which the integrity of the data is preserved. </dd>

<dt>
<a name="_wolf_resource_class"></a><b>Resource class</b></dt>
<dd>
Numeric value that is used to identify resources of similar capability, such as resources that can act as storage devices. </dd>
<dt>
<a name="_wolf_resource_dll"></a><b>Resource DLL</b></dt>
<dd>
