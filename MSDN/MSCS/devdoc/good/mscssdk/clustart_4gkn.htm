<h1><a name="_wolf_introduction_to_cluster_server_programming"></a>Introduction to Cluster Server Programming</h1>
<p>
As a programmer using the Cluster Server SDK, you may perform one or more of the following tasks:
<ul>
<li>
Create a new cluster-aware application.</li>
<li>
Add cluster-awareness to an existing application.</li>
<li>
Create a custom resource type by building a resource DLL to allow Cluster Server to manage your application or service as a cluster resource.</li>
<li>
Create a cluster management application.</li>
<li>
Create a Cluster Administrator extension DLL to allow Cluster Administrator to handle your custom resource type.</li>
<li>
Create a setup program to install, configure, and register a resource DLL and/or a Cluster Administrator extension DLL.</li>
</ul>
<p>
A cluster-aware application is any application that runs on a cluster node and is managed and administered as a cluster resource. A cluster-aware application is aware of its environment and is designed to take advantage of the features that clustering offers. When a cluster-aware application detects that it is running on a cluster node, it provides special functionality or performs additional tasks made available through the <a href="clusapi_9149.htm">Cluster API</a>.</p>
<p>
Most applications can be made cluster-aware. Only applications that do not use TCP/IP as a network protocol, maintain data in a configurable location, or support transaction processing cannot be made cluster-aware. Typical cluster-aware applications include database applications, transaction processing applications, file and print server applications, and other groupware applications.</p>
<p>
Although it is possible to use the resource DLLs provided by Cluster Server to manage your cluster-aware application, it is recommended that you create your own. By creating a resource type that fits your specific needs, you can have more control and flexibility in how Cluster Server handles your application. Creating a custom resource type enables the Resource Monitor to manage your application in ways that are specific to the application. </p>
<p>
To create a custom resource type, you build a resource DLL using the <a href="resapi_0wdl.htm">Resource API</a> and, as an option, a DLL to allow Cluster Administrator to include property sheets for your application. The resource DLL contains implementations of entry point functions defined in the <a href="resapi_0wdl.htm">Resource API</a> for handling the communication between the application and the Resource Monitor. The Cluster Administrator extension DLL uses the interface methods of the <a href="cluadmex_8k15.htm">Cluster Administrator Extension API</a> to allow the application to be administered with Cluster Administrator. Providing a Cluster Administrator extension DLL simplifies the job of the network administrator; it enables him or her to work with your application, its dependent resources, and any other standard resources using an integrated, consistent user interface.</p>
<p>
You can also create a cluster management application with the Cluster Server SDK. A cluster management application is an application written specifically to manage one or more clusters. Cluster management applications can typically run locally on one of the cluster nodes or remotely on a non-clustered system. Cluster Administrator is an example of a cluster management application as is the command-line tool, CLUSTER.EXE. If you need to create your own cluster management application that runs as a stand-alone application or in conjunction with Cluster Administrator, you can do so using the <a href="clusapi_9149.htm">Cluster API</a>. </p>
<p>
Although Cluster Server programming applies primarily to cluster-aware and cluster management applications, Cluster Server supports a third type of application, the cluster-unaware application. A cluster-unaware application resembles a cluster-aware application in that both run on a cluster node and are managed and administered as cluster resources. The difference between applications that are cluster-aware and those that are not is in their knowledge of their environment. A cluster-unaware application has no inherent knowledge of its existence in a cluster; its functionality is the same regardless of whether or not it is running in a cluster. Cluster-unaware applications are typically managed as Generic Application or Generic Service resources, but it is possible to also manage them as custom resource types. </p>
