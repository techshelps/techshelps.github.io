<dl>
<dt>
<a name="_wolf_checkpoint_manager"></a><b>Checkpoint Manager</b></dt>
<dd>
Software component in the Cluster Service that is responsible for saving data in the log file maintained by the quorum resource.</dd>
<dt>
<a name="_wolf_client_application"></a><b>Client application</b></dt>
<dd>
Application software that is running on a network client system and does not necessarily perform name translation or establish connections. </dd>
<dt>
<a name="_wolf_client_server_model"></a><b>Client/server model</b></dt>
<dd>
Architecture that splits an application into a front-end client component and a back-end server component. The client component running on a workstation gathers data from the user, prepares it for the server, and issues a request to the server. On the back end, the server waits for requests from its clients. When it receives a request, the server processes it and returns the requested information to the client. The client then presents the data to the user through its own user interface.</dd>
<dt>
<a name="_wolf_cluster"></a><b>Cluster</b></dt>
<dd>
Two computer systems running Microsoft® Windows NT® Server that are accessed and managed as a single system.</dd>
<dt>
<a name="_wolf_cluster_administrator"></a><b>Cluster Administrator</b></dt>
<dd>
Cluster Server application that is used to manage and administer a cluster. Cluster Administrator can run on a client or server machine regardless of whether the machine is an active member of a cluster.</dd>
<dt>
<a name="_wolf_cluster_administrator_extension"></a><b>Cluster Administrator extension</b></dt>
<dd>
Software component that implements the Cluster Administrator extension API for allowing Cluster Administrator to administer a new resource type.</dd>
<dt>
<a name="_wolf_cluster_api_gly"></a><b>Cluster API</b></dt>
<dd>
Collection of functions that are implemented by the Cluster Service and used by a cluster-aware client or server application, a cluster management application, or a resource DLL. The Cluster API includes functions for managing the cluster as a whole, nodes, groups, resources, and the cluster database.</dd>
<dt>
<b>Cluster Automation Server</b></dt>
<dd>
The library of COM-based interfaces that developers writing in Visual Basic and various scripting languages use to create cluster management applications.</dd>
<dt>
<a name="_wolf_cluster_aware_application"></a><b>Cluster-aware application</b></dt>
<dd>
Server application that can run on a cluster node and be managed as a cluster resource.</dd>
<dt>
<a name="_wolf_cluster_member"></a><b>Cluster member</b></dt>
<dd>
A node that is an active participant of a cluster. A cluster member is in constant communication with the other members of the cluster and maintains a current version of the cluster database. </dd>
<dt>
<a name="_wolf_cluster_service_gly"></a><b>Cluster Service</b></dt>
<dd>
Cluster Server software component implemented as a Microsoft® Windows NT® service that controls all aspects of cluster operation and manages the configuration database. Every node in a cluster runs one instance of the Cluster Service.</dd>
<dt>
<a name="_wolf_cluster_unaware_application"></a><b>Cluster-unaware application</b></dt>
<dd>
Client application that can run on a cluster node and be managed as a cluster resource, but has no inherent knowledge of its cluster environment. Client applications function the same regardless of whether they are running on a node in a cluster or on a non-clustered system.</dd>
<dt>
<a name="_wolf_communications_line"></a><b>Communications line</b></dt>
<dd>
Physical connection by which information flows from the network into the computer. Examples are twisted-pair, coaxial, and fiber-optic cable.</dd>
<dt>
<a name="_wolf_communications_manager"></a><b>Communications Manager</b></dt>
<dd>
Software component in the Cluster Service that maintains communication between cluster members and blocks communication when a node fails.</dd>
<dt>
<a name="_wolf_core_network_name_resource"></a><b>Core Network Name Resource</b></dt>
<dd>
The Network Name resource for the cluster.</dd>
