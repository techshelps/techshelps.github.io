<h2>Summary</h2>

<ul>
    <li>Globalized programs need to support a variety of cultural
        and linguistic conventions. The Win32 NLSAPI provides
        generic support for date, time, calendar, number, and
        currency formats, as well as for sorting, character
        typing, and character mapping.</li>
    <li>The NLSAPI exists in two forms: &#150;&#150;A and
        &#150;&#150;W. Windows NT supports both sets of API entry
        points. Win32s and Windows 95 support the &#150;&#150;A
        versions.</li>
    <li>The NLSAPI allows you to write generic code that will
        correctly display international data carried by the
        system, even if that information is added to the system
        after your application is complete.</li>
    <li>The system carries default formatting information for
        date, time, currency, and numbers. The user can change
        some of the default settings using Control Panel.</li>
    <li>Applications can customize date and time formats with
        picture strings. They can create custom number and
        currency formats using the system-defined NUMBERFMT and
        CURRENCYFMT structures.</li>
    <li>You can tag document text streams with locale IDs, just
        as you would store font information. Your application can
        use these locale IDs when calling NLSAPI functions and
        when determining which algorithms to use for spelling and
        other text analysis.</li>
    <li>Creating sort keys with <i>LCMapString</i> is a fast way
        to sort large sets of strings. Sort keys automatically
        handle locale-related idiosyncrasies.</li>
    <li>When developing a single binary to run on Win32s, Windows
        95, and Windows NT, be aware that there are slight
        variations in the national language support available on
        each platform.</li>
    <li>The NLSAPI calls will help you write global code, but
        your application will probably require language-related
        adjustments that the NLSAPI does not address.</li>
