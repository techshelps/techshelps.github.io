<h1 class="cht">Preface</h1>

<p>In the late 1980s, Microsoft's International Product Group
(IPG), the team responsible for creating most of the localized
versions of Microsoft products, distributed a booklet internally
that contained guidelines for writing code that accommodated the
needs of international developers and users. <i>The International
Handbook for Software Design,</i> as it was called, was revised
over the years, expanding in scope to cover several operating
systems and most of the Microsoft localization
process&#151;including development, design, testing, translation,
documentation, packaging, computer-based tutorials, and help
files.</p>

<p>Although Microsoft creates multiple-language versions of
dozens of software products each year, its methods for doing so
haven't always been enlightened. For IPG engineers, the first
internationalization efforts involved inheriting finished product
sources, fixing &quot;internationally broken&quot; designs,
attempting to alter old code that no one remembered, enlarging
buffers, removing hard-coded strings, and generally campaigning
(begging, threatening) for more international-aware development
practices. The <i>International Handbook </i>was distributed
throughout the company as part of this awareness campaign.</p>

<p>IPG worked for a number of years to improve the efficiency and
lower the cost of creating international versions of Microsoft
products. As a result of steady evolution, Microsoft gradually
disbanded IPG starting in late 1991, and its employees joined the
teams responsible for producing the English-language products.
The company felt that it made better sense to have a single team
committed to creating all language versions of a product rather
than one domestic team and one international team, each reporting
to different chains of command. Following this approach, the
teams creating Microsoft Windows NT 3.<i>x</i> and Microsoft
Windows 95 worked to release high-quality localized versions of
the operating system as quickly and efficiently as possible
without compromising the United States product.</p>

<p>As Microsoft was solidifying its internationalization methods,
Windows was becoming an international phenomenon. Companies that
sought information on creating localized applications for Windows
began to ask for copies of Microsoft's internal handbook, which
documented several years of Microsoft's collective
internationalization experience. In response, Microsoft revised
the handbook and made it widely available via the Microsoft
Developer Network CD-ROM. By 1994, with two new Windows operating
systems on the horizon, it was clear the book needed updating.
The book you are holding is a complete revision of the internal
handbook and is designed to help developers create 32-bit
applications for Windows.</p>

<p>There are many steps to creating an international product, and
many pieces to the finished job. This book focuses on development
strategies. It doesn't cover documentation, translation, help
files, legalities, management, marketing, or distribution, except
as they affect software development. The book is intended
primarily for programmers who already have some knowledge of
Windows-based coding techniques and the Microsoft Visual C/C++
programming language, and for managers who want an overview of
internationalization.</p>

<p>Operating system technology constantly evolves. National
standards also change. The best use of this handbook is as a
companion volume to the <i>Win32 Programmer's Reference,</i> not
as the last word. Some information in the appendixes, such as
address formats and paper sizes, is provided to show you the
kinds of defaults that change from country to country. Always
double-check this information when applying it to your product.
The code in this book was compiled and tested in Visual C++ on
Microsoft Windows NTAS, but the principles behind the code apply
to any development environment. If you have any input for future
editions of this book, please send it to the Internet address <i>ibook@microsoft.com.</i></p>
