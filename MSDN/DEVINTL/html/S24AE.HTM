<h1 class="cht">Foreword</h1>

<p>Since its inception, Microsoft has realized the importance of
the international market in software development projects. We
entered the Japanese market in 1978 and established our first
European office in 1982. In May 1983, we completed and licensed
our first double-byte character set (DBCS) operating system with
the kanji releases of MS-DOS 2.1 for the IBM 5550 and the NEC
PC-9801. Five months later, Microsoft shipped a European edition
of MS-DOS. The following year we were already expanding further
into Asia with a hangul (Korean) release of MS-DOS.</p>

<p>Our research into these new markets revealed that many
international-language issues could be handled as algorithms and
APIs that any good developer could understand and use&#151;key
parts of the international engineering process, then, could be
considered core code. This awareness greatly changed the way that
Microsoft approached the internationalization process, as many
coding issues could be resolved in the initial planning stages of
a product. Internationalization now extended well beyond
localization.</p>

<p>During this time, we internally circulated a confidential
document that described international design concepts we wanted
our software development staff to know. As technology became more
sophisticated and the demand for information about globalization
strategies escalated, the document grew in popularity and was
revised and expanded&#151;evidence of the momentum building in
the software industry. Clearly, communicating our knowledge
beyond Microsoft's development staff would be of great value. So
that all developers could have access to this information, we
wrote this book based on the concept and intent of the original
document.</p>

<p>Microsoft Windows brought device independence to the PC and
offered application developers a way to address a wide variety of
hardware peripherals through a common programming interface.
International developers benefited because they could unify
different international hardware platform standards, and users
benefited because they could more efficiently and conveniently
handle international-language requirements through a graphical
user interface. With each new release of Windows, Microsoft has
brought the software developer closer to the goal of creating
products that can be used in any number of countries, regardless
of the developer's physical location. Windows 3.1 was the first
operating system we simultaneously shipped in several Western
European languages, and that product was also extended for
language requirements in Asia, Central and Eastern Europe, and
the Middle East.</p>

<p>When we created our first 32-bit operating system, we
integrated international support in the initial design. The first
release of Windows NT, in 1993, included an unprecedented range
of APIs for international locale settings, offered developers a
choice between a local code page and Unicode, and was
simultaneously available in several localized editions. We have
also been busy rewriting Windows itself. Windows 95 was designed
for an aggressive international ship schedule involving 30
language releases&#151;ranging from 0 to 6 months&#151;all
connected to one very large project with many new international
features. The work continues as we expand our list of localized
operating systems and add additional international capabilities
to our future operating systems.</p>

<p>Independent software vendors (ISVs) who target Microsoft
Windows will benefit from Windows' rapid expansion into
international markets. We have seen rewarding examples of growth
in which ISVs have adopted software design practices that
anticipate and accommodate international language requirements.
We have also seen cases in which customers have switched from one
company's product to another company's product based on how that
company handled international engineering issues.</p>

<p>We welcome you to explore and implement international software
design strategies in the planning of code using the comprehensive
information contained in this book, and we urge you to discover
new opportunities around the world.</p>
