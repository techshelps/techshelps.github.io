<h1 class="h1">Appendix R Dead-Key Combinations on International
Keyboard Layouts</h1>

<p>This appendix consists of three tables: Common Dead-Key
Combinations, Dead-Key Combinations on the Greek Keyboard, and
Dead-Key Combinations on the Polish Programmer's Keyboard.</p>

<p>On many international keyboards, it is possible to produce
accented characters by pressing two keys&#151;one that produces a
plain character followed by one that produces a combining accent.
The following tables summarize these combinations, called
&quot;dead-key combinations,&quot; as they are produced by the
keyboard layouts defined by Microsoft Windows. The first table,
which should be read as a two-screen spread, i.e. first half on
top and second half below, lists dead-key combinations that are
common on many international keyboards. Not all combinations are
valid on all keyboard drivers, however. The third and fourth
tables, which identify dead-key combinations on the Greek
keyboard and the Polish Programmer's keyboard, include
combinations not found on other keyboards. They are formatted as
one-screen tables.</p>
