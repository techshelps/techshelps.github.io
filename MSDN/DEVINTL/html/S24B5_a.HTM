<h2>Multilingual Input</h2>

<p>Most language editions of Windows NT 3.<i>x,</i> like most
language editions of Windows 3.<i>x,</i> support only one
systemwide keyboard layout per user at a time. To change keyboard
layouts, the user has to use the International icon in Control
Panel (see Chapter 5, Figure 5-6 in the topic <font class="MissingLink" meta="dev5h">&quot;Default User
and System Locals&quot;</font>), select a keyboard layout from a long
list of choices, and restart the system. This is a limited and
inconvenient process for users who wish to enter multiple
languages in a single document because users prefer to
use&#151;and sometimes must use&#151;the native keyboard layout
associated with the language they want to enter. For example, you
need to install the Russian keyboard layout in order to type
Russian text because the English keyboard layout doesn't contain
any Cyrillic characters. Users need the ability, then, to switch
between different keyboard layouts when typing in different
languages.</p>

<p>Many computer users in Central and Eastern Europe and the
Middle East create documents in at least two languages that use
completely different character sets, and this has affected the
design of Central and Eastern European and Middle Eastern
editions of Windows 3.1 and the international English edition of
Windows NT 3.<i>x.</i> For example, users in North Africa often
create documents in Arabic and French, and users in Hungary often
create documents in Hungarian and Russian. For these editions of
Windows, the development teams added the ability to install two
default keyboard layouts as well as two code pages and two sets
of fonts, and the ability to switch between these layouts at any
time using a hot-key combination. The developers have modified
and greatly expanded this design for Windows 95.</p>
