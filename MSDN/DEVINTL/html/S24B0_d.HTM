<h2>Summary</h2>

<ul>
    <li>Defaults that change from locale to locale include spoken
        languages; written scripts; sorting orders; keyboard
        layouts; input methods; common paper sizes; and date,
        time, number, and currency formats.</li>
    <li>Internationalization involves creating a functional core
        code base and a generic feature design that can serve as
        the basis for all language editions of a product.</li>
    <li>Different language editions of Windows can be grouped in
        categories with similar development issues. Once you have
        created a program for one language in a category, the
        development effort involved in creating editions of your
        program for other languages in the same category is
        minimal.</li>
    <li>The level of localization required for a program to be
        successful depends on the target market. The more effort
        you spend, the higher the risk and cost, but the greater
        the potential return.</li>
    <li>The most effective process for creating localized
        products takes international considerations into account
        at the beginning of the product cycle and throughout
        development, and expedites the shipping of multiple
        language editions.</li>
