<P><b>Glossary</b></p>

<ul>
    <li><b>Windows Intelligent Font Environment (WIFE): </b>An
        operating system layer, introduced with the Far East
        editions of Windows 3, that manages multiple font
        technologies and font drivers that can be installed.</li>
    <li><b>End-User Defined Character (EUDC): </b>A special
        character, such as a rare ideograph, that the user
        creates with an editor and assigns to a code point within
        a reserved range.</li>
    <li><b>Font association: </b>The automatic pairing of a font
        that contains ideographs with a font that does not
        contain ideographs. This allows the user to enter
        ideographic characters regardless of which font is
        selected.</li>
</ul>

<p>So that the user can take full advantage of the font
capabilities he is accustomed to on Windows 3, Windows 95
supports font technologies governed by the Windows Intelligent
Font Environment (WIFE), which was introduced with Windows 3. All
existing font packages that use WIFE will work on Windows 95.
Because TrueType fonts have been used as system defaults for Far
East editions of Windows since Windows 3.1, however, Windows 95
will not install the WIFE module itself. New software, then,
should use TrueType and should not assume that WIFE support will
continue in the future. If you are a font vendor and require
information on creating Far East TrueType fonts, please consult
Microsoft's TrueType Open Specification, available through the
Microsoft Developer Network (in the section titled &quot;TrueType
1.0 Font Files&quot;).</p>

<p>Although the Japanese and Chinese code pages used by Windows
each define thousands of characters, they exclude some rarely
used ideographs. If a user or an application requires special
ideographs&#151;to spell the names of people or places, for
example&#151;they can be added to the system by creating End-User
Defined Characters (EUDCs). Far East editions of Windows ship
with an EUDC editor, which is similar to a paint program. (See
Figure 7-25 below.) With this editor, the user can draw
characters, assign them code-point values, and save them in
TrueType font files. The user can also opt to buy third-party
font packages that include EUDC characters.</p>

Windows 95.</i></p>

<p>On Windows 3.1, EUDC characters were supported through WIFE,
because TrueType did not support bitmapped fonts. On Windows 95,
however, TrueType can support embedded bitmaps directly, and
Windows 95's EUDC editor can create TrueType outline fonts. As
described in <font class="MissingLink" meta="dev0f">Chapter 3</font>, Windows NT maps the range of EUDC
characters through Unicode's private-use zone. It does not store
any character property information for EUDC characters. For more
information on support for EUDC fonts in Windows 95, consult the
SDK documentation.</p>

<p>When the user selects a font that covers only Latin
characters, Windows 95 automatically selects a DBCS font for
displaying any ideographs the user might type. For example,
Chinese Windows 95 associates the MingLight font with fonts
containing Latin 1 ANSI characters. This process, called font
association, allows the user to enter ideographic characters
regardless of which font is selected. Each Far East edition of
Windows associates fonts differently, because each edition ships
with different ideographic fonts. The user can override the
system's default font associations by changing the appropriate
values in the registry.</p>
