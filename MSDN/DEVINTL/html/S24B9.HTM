<H1>Appendix B Common Latin Diacritics and Ligatures</h1>

<p>This appendix consists of two tables. The first table shows
bitmaps for common Latin diacritics. The second table illustrates
diacritics and ligatures used in various languages.</p>

<p>Diacritics are marks that are placed over, under, near, or
through letters to indicate that the pronunciation differs from
the unmarked form. (In many of the languages listed in the second
table, diacritics appear with both lowercase and uppercase
letters.) The diaeresis (two dots above a vowel) is a special
case; it can be used to indicate a syllabic break (for example, <i>coöp</i>),
but it can also be used as an umlaut, to indicate a vowel-sound
change.</p>

<p>Ligatures were widely used in Medieval Latin script, but today
only the ampersand (&amp;), which means <i>and,</i> remains.
Other ligatures have become common letters or punctuation
characters in various languages. For example, in German, <i>ß </i>is
the ligature for <i>ss </i>or <i>sz</i>; in several languages, <i>æ
</i>is the ligature for <i>ae</i>; and in German, Russian, and
Scandinavian languages, <i>§ </i>is used to represent a
paragraph.</p>
