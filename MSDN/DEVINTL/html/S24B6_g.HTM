<h2>Customized IME Support on Windows 95</h2>

<p>Fully IME-aware applications create and maintain their own
input contexts and draw the IME's status, composition, and
candidate windows themselves. Whereas applications with partial
support might reposition the IME's user interface windows or
change the fonts used to display characters, fully IME-aware
applications can customize the IME user interface more
extensively. Windows 95 provides a number of API calls, listed in
<font class="MissingLink" meta="dev0z">Appendix N</font>, for communicating closely with IMEs. Because IME DLLs
still contain the code that converts keyboard strokes into
characters and determines candidate lists, applications need to
query IMEs for information on composition strings and candidate
lists before they can draw any windows. Applications also need to
ask IMEs for status information, such as whether the IME is open
or closed, and what the current input mode and sentence mode are.</p>
