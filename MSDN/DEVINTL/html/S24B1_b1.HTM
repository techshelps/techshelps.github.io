<h3>Designing an International User Interface</h3>

<P><b>Glossary</b></p>

<ul>
    <li><b>Accelerator:</b> An Alt+<i>character </i>key
        combination used to activate menus, menu items, and
        dialog items in Windows. The character that activates the
        menu or dialog item is underlined. It is also called a
        &quot;hot key.&quot;</li>
    <li><b>Shortcut key:</b> A keyboard combination that
        activates a program command directly, as an alternative
        to activating the command through the program menus.</li>
    <li><b>AltGr:</b> The Alt key on the right on some
        non&#150;US Windows keyboard layouts. The AltGr key is
        equivalent to the Ctrl+Alt key combination and is used to
        create an alternative shift state for accessing a third
        character on some keys.</li>
    <li><b>Dead key: </b>A key that produces a WM_CHAR value of
        VK_DeadKey when pressed. By itself, the dead key does not
        generate a character. Pressing a dead key followed by
        another key is one way to generate accented characters. (<font class="MissingLink" meta="dev0ao">See
        Appendix R</font>.)</li>
</ul>

<p>There are two basic rules for designing a user interface that
is internationally acceptable and easy to localize. First, use
simple, generic graphics, and second, avoid crowding those
graphics. The forthcoming book <i>The Windows Interface: An
Application Design Guide, </i>from Microsoft Press, will provide
clear recommendations for esigning a consistent, easy-to-follow
user interface that should result in a core program suitable for
international markets. The advice in this section will give you
some extra incentive to follow those guidelines closely.</p>

<p><b>Bitmaps, Icons, and Sounds</b></p>

<p>Icons and bitmaps are standard features of Windows-based
applications, especially on toolbars. It takes creativity to come
up with bitmaps that are specific enough to identify a setting or
an operation but that avoid cultural references and stereotypes
that don't translate well. Recreating bitmaps for different
language editions of a product, however, is a waste of time. Take
advantage of the common toolbar button illustrations defined for
Windows 95 or of existing international symbols, such as those
used on road signs or in airports. In general, keep bitmaps free
of letters that represent the first letters of commands, such as <i>O</i>
for <i>Open</i>, and avoid punctuation marks that might change
from locale to locale, such as quotation marks. Don't include
text in bitmaps or icons unless the text will not be translated
(for example, your company name). Instead, draw text on buttons
using the Win32 call <i>TextOut,</i> or take advantage of the
Tooltips feature provided by the Microsoft Foundation Classes
(MFC).</p>

<p>Keep bitmaps simple. The more complex they are, the more
difficult they are to decipher. Figure 2-2 below shows several
bitmaps that would be confusing to international users and
explains why. In general, be cautious with representations of
animals, religious and mythological symbols, national emblems,
colors, people (especially racial, cultural, or gender
stereotypes), hand gestures, and body language, which might be
misinterpreted or might offend users in another country. Avoid
images of sports equipment, utensils, national monuments, or any
symbol that might be familiar in some cultures but unfamiliar in
others. Pictures that represent a play on words in one language
might be completely meaningless in others. Also keep in mind that
not all cultures read text from left to right. A picture of an
arrow pointing to the left, indicating &quot;undo,&quot; might be
confusing to an Arabic or a Hebrew speaker.</p>

<p>Be culturally sensitive when choosing sounds for your program
as well. Telephones and sirens have different sounds in different
countries. In some countries, you should be particularly careful
about how you use sounds. Users in the United States might find
it helpful to hear a beep when they make a mistake, but users in
Japan might be embarrassed by a beep because it calls attention
to their blunders. For nonmultimedia applications, sound should
be a secondary method for sending messages to the user anyway;
some software users are deaf or have hearing impairments; others
don't have sound-generating equipment, work in a noisy
environment, or prefer to have sounds turned off.</p>

<p><b>Menus and Dialogs</b></p>

<p>The length of English text often grows when it's translated.
For example, the English word <i>Edit </i>becomes <i>Bearbeiten </i>in
German, and <i>Sort Ascending </i>becomes <i>Lajittele nousevassa
järjestyksessä </i>in Finnish. So design menu bars, status
bars, toolbars, title bars, and dialog boxes to allow text size
to increase. Limit the number of menus on your menu bar so that
the menu bar does not wrap to a second line when translated. Find
out whether symbols are acceptable replacements for lengthy text.
For example, in Europe it is acceptable to translate the English
word <i>Help </i>as a question mark (<i>?</i>) to save space.
Abbreviating main menu names on the menu bar is rarely
acceptable, though abbreviating words on status bars is common.
Keep in mind that abbreviations might also require more space in
some languages and that in some ideographic languages, such as
Japanese and Chinese, abbreviations don't exist.</p>

<p>Dialog boxes crammed full of information will not fit on the
screen when translated into some languages. Use the dialog tab
controls available in Windows 95 to minimize this problem. (See
Figure 2-3.) You should also use multiline text boxes to display
either messages or multiple-word descriptions that might require
additional space when translated. If you're not sure whether a
menu or dialog-box design will be sufficient to accommodate
several languages, double-check by asking someone to translate a
few examples.</p>

<P><b>Figure 2-3</b> <i>Use Windows 95 dialog tab
controls to keep dialog boxes from becoming too large.</i></p>

<p><b>Keyboards</b></p>

<p>Keyboard layouts change according to locale. Not all
characters exist in all keyboard layouts, as you will see if you
examine the layout pictures in <font class="MissingLink" meta="dev0ac">Appendix Q</font>. When assigning
shortcut-key combinations, make sure that you can reproduce them
using international keyboards, especially if you will be shipping
an unlocalized product to countries with widely differing
keyboard layouts. You can choose from a number of different
keyboard layouts via the Windows Control Panel.</p>

<p>Most European keyboards contain an AltGr key. Don't assign
characters that are produced using either AltGr or Shift+AltGr on
some keyboards to Ctrl+Alt or Shift+Ctrl+Alt shortcut-key
combinations. The shortcut-key combination Ctrl+Alt+[, for
example, cannot be reproduced on Canadian, Portuguese, Spanish,
or Swedish keyboards, among others. Other keyboard combinations
are reserved for system use by some editions of Windows; Alt+~
invokes Input Method Editors (IMEs) on Far Eastern systems. Steer
clear of the following characters when assigning shortcut keys:</p>

<p>@ £ $ { } [ ] \ ~ | ^ ' &lt; &gt;</p>

<p>On some keyboard layouts, AltGr is used to produce basic Latin
letters. On the Polish keyboard, for instance, you have to press
AltGr to generate accented forms of the letters A, C, E, L, N, O,
S, and Z. Accented characters don't exist on the US keyboard
layout. To type accented characters in Windows using the US
keyboard layout, you have to hold down the Alt key and, using the
numeric keypad keys, type zero (0) plus the Windows code-page
index of the desired accented character. You can use the
US-International keyboard layout to type accented characters
using dead-key combinations. (<font class="MissingLink" meta="dev0ao">See Appendix R</font>)</p>

<p>For reasons such as these, consider using numbers and function
keys (F4, F5, and so on) instead of letters in shortcut-key
combinations. Number and function-key combinations are not as
intuitive for the user as letter combinations, but they don't
have to be localized, and whereas creating combinations that can
be produced with the keyboard of the target locale will
accommodate most users, it will not guarantee accommodation of
all. In some locales, such as Central and Eastern Europe,
Netherlands, Arabic-speaking countries, and Hebrew-speaking
countries, more than one standard keyboard is used. Assigning
numbers and function keys to shortcut-key combinations is even
more advantageous when you consider that it enables users to use
the multiple-keyboard functionality introduced with Windows 95
(see <font class="MissingLink" meta="dev0i">Chapter 6</font>)&#151;since virtually all keyboard layouts include
numbers and function keys.</p>
