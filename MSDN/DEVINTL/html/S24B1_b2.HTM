<h3><strong>Researching Legal Issues</strong></h3>

<p>As you get feedback on your product specification, solicit
advice from people familiar with the law in local markets.
Certain kinds of features might affect the international
distribution of your product. For example, United States export
laws govern the sale of products that contain encryption
algorithms, such as those used for file compression or copy
protection, to certain countries. Software that connects with
telephones can be more difficult to sell in Europe, where some
governments closely regulate the use of phone lines. Software and
documentation that is marketed in France must be in French, and
software marketed in Brazil must support hardware that is
developed locally.</p>

<p>In Germany, competition law severely restricts a company's
ability to claim that its product is better than another
company's product. This directly affects advertising and
packaging, but it can also affect sample files, documentation,
help files, or features that assist users in making the
transition from a competitor's product to your product.
Productivity features, such as those that keep track of how long
a user has been editing a document, might conflict with labor
laws.</p>

<p>Another important legal consideration is, of course, software
piracy. Microsoft works with the Business Software Alliance
(BSA), located in Washington, DC, to protect its products
overseas. (Figure 2-4 shows one of Microsoft's logos used in
anti-piracy literature.) The BSA conducts educational campaigns
and lobbies governments for tougher piracy laws. The efforts of
the BSA have proved more effective in preventing piracy than
adding copy-protection code or hardware devices to products.
Although counterfeiting is illegal in many countries, some
countries still allow local companies to market clones of
software products. Before you enter a new software market,
research these issues. Keep in mind that entering new markets
requires diplomacy. Microsoft's well-publicized efforts to
establish Windows in mainland China is a good case study for any
company seeking to expand its operations. Microsoft was not aware
of the politically sensitive issues of developing products
offshore for import into the People's Republic of China when it
began developing and marketing the Simplified Chinese edition of
Windows. As a result, the company unwittingly angered the Chinese
government. Now Microsoft is working very closely with the
Chinese government and local developers to ensure the full
success of Windows 95.</p>
