<h2>Planning a Global Program</h2>

<H3><b>Glossary</b></h3>

<ul>
    <li><b>Specification, </b><b><i>or</i></b><b>
        &quot;spec&quot;:</b> A detailed plan of a program's user
        interface design and the expected functionality of
        program features.</li>
</ul>

<p>For a program to meet the needs of an international audience,
it must have features that an international audience can use. In
addition to support for international character sets and national
conventions, this usually requires that the user interface be
translated into several languages. The goal for a product team
trying to fulfill these requirements is to maximize the quality
of all language editions of its product while minimizing the
amount of time and money invested. The only way to achieve this
is to have a written specification&#151;before any coding work
begins&#151;that takes internationalization issues into
consideration. If you treat international concerns as just an
afterthought, your final product will reflect that, and your
target markets will definitely notice.</p>
