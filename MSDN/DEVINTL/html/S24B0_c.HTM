<h2>Localization</h2>

<p class="t"><b>Glossary</b></p>

<ul>
    <li><b>Localization: </b>The process of adapting a program
        for a specific international market, which includes
        translating the user interface, resizing dialog boxes,
        customizing features (if necessary), and testing results
        to ensure that the program still works.</li>
    <li><b>Levels of localization: </b>The amount of translation
        and customization necessary to create different language
        editions. The levels, which are determined by balancing
        risk and return, range from translating nothing to
        shipping a completely translated product with customized
        features.</li>
    <li><b>Enabling: </b>Altering program code to handle input,
        display, and editing of bidirectional or double byte
        languages, such as Arabic and Japanese.</li>
    <li><b>Layout: </b>The order and spacing of displayed text.</li>
</ul>

<p>Internationalizing core code is a basic requirement for
software that will ship outside of your native country. You can
vary the level of effort and expense devoted to localization,
however, depending on the target market and the application type.
(See Figure 1-4 below.) Some markets, such as Eastern European
countries and the People's Republic of China, are currently
comparatively small, so shipping a product there is considered an
investment for the future. Other markets, such as France and
Germany, are well established, and breaking into them requires a
large investment and a commitment to high standards. Still other
markets, such as Korea and the Arabic-speaking countries, are
small but growing rapidly. It is possible to establish a presence
in small markets by shipping a partially localized application
quickly and following it up later with a more fully localized
edition of the same application or its next revision. For
example, Microsoft traditionally ships an English edition of a
new Windows operating system enabled for Central and Eastern
European character sets within days of shipping the US product.
Localized editions generally follow within six months.</p>

<p>At Microsoft, subsidiary marketing managers decide the level
of localization for each language edition of Windows. Developers
and translators provide the marketing managers with an estimate
of how much time and money each level will require. Then the
subsidiaries and product teams decide whether the potential
return is worth the cost. Take a look at Appendix P, which lists
localized editions of Windows and their ship dates, to see the
decisions Microsoft has made so far.</p>

<p class="t"><b>Figure 1-4</b><b><i> </i></b><i>Levels of
localization.</i></p>

<p>The first two levels of localization listed in Figure 1-4,
translating nothing and translating documentation and packaging
only, involve little development cost&#151;at most, developers
will be called upon to explain technical issues to translators.
The next level, enabling the code, involves no translation cost.
The term &quot;enabling&quot; applies most often to software that
was originally designed for Western European languages. Enabled
software allows users to create documents in their own languages,
even if the user interface isn't localized. Code for Middle
Eastern or Far Eastern language editions of such programs must be
altered to handle input, layout, display, editing, and printing
of Middle Eastern or Far Eastern language text. (See Chapters 3,
6 and 7 for a more detailed description of what is involved.)
Screen savers, multimedia titles, and other programs that do not
allow the user to enter or edit text do not require enabling.</p>

<p>If an English-language edition of your product exists,
consider using it to test the waters in markets where users will
buy a product with an English-language user interface until a
fully localized edition is available. The following list gives
some guidelines for determining the markets in which an
English-language user interface is acceptable:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Small markets (for example, Central and Eastern Europe
        and Indonesia)</li>
    <li>Markets where your product has no competitors</li>
    <li>Markets where many people speak English (for example,
        India, Israel, Korea, and the Netherlands)</li>
    <li>Markets where the target audience speaks English
        (scientific, medical, and technology communities)</li>
</ul>

<p>In markets where only translated products are successful, do a
partial translation if you want to ship quickly or don't want to
pay the cost of a full translation. As a general rule, the more
involved the translation, the more questions developers must
answer and the more bugs developers must fix.</p>

<p>In more competitive markets, you will need to customize
features and, in some cases, add support for hardware that is
sold locally.</p>
