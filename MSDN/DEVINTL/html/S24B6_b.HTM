<h2>Far Eastern Writing Systems</h2>

<P><b>Glossary</b></p>

<ul>
    <li><b>Phoneme: </b>A unique individual sound used in a
        language.</li>
    <li><b>Morpheme:</b> The smallest meaningful element of a
        word. The word <i>dog</i> is one morpheme. The word <i>dogs</i>
        is two morphemes: <i>dog</i> plus the plural marker <i>s</i>.
        Many ideographs are based on morphemes.</li>
    <li><b>Syllabary: </b>A set of written characters in which
        each character represents a syllable&#151;for example, a
        consonant sound followed by a vowel sound.</li>
    <li><b>Radical:</b> A group of strokes in a Chinese character
        that are treated as a unit for the purposes of sorting,
        indexing, and classification. A character can contain
        more than one element that is recognized as a radical,
        but each character contains only one element, called the
        main radical, that is used as the indexing radical. The
        main radical often gives a hint as to the general meaning
        of the character, and other radicals in the character
        might indicate how the character is pronounced.</li>
    <li><b>Jamos: </b>The 24 basic elements of the Korean script.</li>
    <li><b>Wansung: </b>The Korean standard character set (KS
        C-5601-1987), which corresponds to Windows code page 949.
        It covers the most common hangul character combinations. <i>Extended
        Wansung</i> covers all possible hangul combinations.</li>
    <li><b>Johab: </b>The Korean standard character set (KS
        C-5601-1992), which corresponds to Windows code page
        1361. It includes all possible hangul character
        combinations. </li>
</ul>

<P>When you are developing software for Far Eastern
languages, you'll benefit from a basic understanding of Chinese,
Japanese, and Korean writing systems, as well as from an
understanding of how an Input Method Editor works. If you need
more detail than this chapter provides, consider purchasing a
language textbook.</p>

<p>Both the Japanese and the Korean languages consist of
ideographic characters that were originally borrowed from
Chinese. These characters are represented using two bytes in DBCS
code pages and have no case distinction. In Chinese and Japanese,
ideographic characters are traditionally read from top to bottom
in columns that run from right to left. In Korean, ideographic
characters are traditionally read from top to bottom in columns
that run from left to right. These days, however, many documents
are read horizontally from left to right.</p>

<p>Ideographic characters consist of up to 36 strokes that are
grouped into one or more elements. Characters with only one
element are generally called radicals<i> </i>or root radicals.
Radicals represent common morphemes that in themselves give a
character meaning. Examples of radicals include <i>fire, water,
sun, vision,</i> and <i>hearing</i>. In most characters that
consist of two or more elements, one element is a radical and the
other elements determine the character's phonetic value. Figure
7-2 provides examples of some simple ideographic characters.</p>
