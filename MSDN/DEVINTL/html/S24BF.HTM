<H1>Appendix D Sort Order for Selected Languages</h1>

<P>This appendix consists of eight tables, which
illustrate the alphabetic sort order for the following languages:
Czech, Danish and Norwegian, Finnish and Swedish, French,
Lithuanian, Polish, and Spanish (Traditional Sort). The Default
Sort order, which is supported by Microsoft Windows 95, applies
to the following languages: Dutch, English, German, Indonesian,
Italian, and Portuguese. </p>

<P>Each table includes an identical list of words
compiled from various languages; this list is sorted according to
the individual language's rules for diacritics, ligatures, and
letter combinations. Some diacritics and ligatures do not exist
in certain languages; in these cases, the words are sorted
according to the rules for the base characters. Details about the
sort order of diacritics, ligatures, and letter combinations are
provided in the &quot;Description&quot; column.</p>
