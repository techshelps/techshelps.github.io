<h2>Summary</h2>

<ul>
    <li>To create Chinese-language, Japanese-language, or
        Korean-language applications for Windows NT or Windows
        95, you need the appropriate Far East Win32 Software
        Development Kit (SDK) and a compiler that understands
        Unicode or double-byte character sets.</li>
    <li>As a first step toward creating a Far East&#150;edition
        code base, enable your code to handle double-byte
        character sets or Unicode, following the guide-lines
        presented in <font class="MissingLink" meta="dev0f">Chapter 3</font>.</li>
    <li>The Chinese, Japanese, and Korean writing systems contain
        thousands of ideographic characters. Therefore, entering
        characters efficiently on computers requires Input Method
        Editors (IMEs), which are software modules that map
        multiple keystrokes into single ideographs. Different
        text input methods are popular for each language.</li>
    <li>To support IMEs on Windows NT 3.5, your application needs
        to parse the WM_IME_REPORT message and its various <i>wParam</i>
        values. IME support on Windows NT 3.5 differs slightly
        from one language to another.</li>
    <li>The IME model for Windows has been revised for Windows 95
        and Windows NT 3.51. It includes a single IME API for all
        Far East editions of the operating systems. Applications
        following this model can be IME-unaware, partially
        IME-aware, or fully IME-aware.</li>
    <li>Applications can customize IME support on Windows 95 by
        controlling the appearance of the IME windows.</li>
    <li>Win32-based applications can display text vertically
        using fonts whose typeface names begin with the <i>at</i>
        (@) character.</li>
    <li>As long as your application relies on the Win32 API, you
        do not have to write special code to handle hardware
        differences found in the Japanese PC market.</li>
    <li>Windows 95 supports Windows Intelligent Font Emulator
        (WIFE) fonts for compatibility reasons, but new
        applications should use TrueType fonts instead. With
        TrueType fonts, the user can define characters not
        supported by the system's character encoding or standard
        fonts.</li>
    <li>Far East editions of Windows support additional functions
        that are related to IMEs which other editions of Windows
        do not. It is possible, however, to display Far Eastern
        characters on any edition of Windows NT and to create a
        single binary that will run on Far East editions and
        other editions of Windows.</li>
    <li>Far East editions of Windows support different methods
        for sorting ideographic characters. Characters can be
        sorted in stroke order, phonetically, or by code-point
        value, depending on the locale.</li>
    <li>Chinese, Japanese, Korean, and Thai written text follow
        special rules for breaking lines.</li>
