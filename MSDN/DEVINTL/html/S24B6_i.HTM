<h2>Japanese Hardware</h2>

<p>When PCs first appeared on the Japanese market, they
represented several different architectural standards, as the
following table illustrates. Creating applications for five or
six distinct hardware platforms was a headache that software
companies had to endure in order to sell a large volume of
products. The first major step toward correcting this problem was
the introduction of DOS/V (<i>V</i> stands for &quot;VGA&quot;)
in 1992. Developers could now write applications to a single
interface&#151;customized versions of the operating system took
care of hardware differences.</p>

<p>These days, unless you are writing low-level device drivers or
accessing hardware directly, you don't need to be concerned with
hardware differences on machines sold in Japan. As long as your
application takes advantage of the Win32 API, it should run
smoothly on different machines. You might have to recompile your
application&#151;for example, Windows NT&#150;based applications
need to be compiled separately for Intel-based machines and RISC
machines&#151;but you will not need to rewrite your code, as
developers did before the advent of DOS/V. If you <i>are </i>writing
device drivers, you'll need a copy of the Far East Win32 DDK.</p>

<p>It is always a good idea to test your application on local
hardware. Since half of the PCs in Japan are made by NEC,
definitely test your product on NEC machines. Windows 95 supports
both AT-compatible and NEC machines, but it does not support the
FM Towns, FMR, or Epson proprietary architectures. Neither does
it support 640 x 480 video. Be sure to test your application with
other local video resolutions, local keyboards, and local
printers.</p>
