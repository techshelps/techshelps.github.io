<h3>Paying Attention to Small Details with a Big Impact</h3>

<p><b>Glossary</b></p>

<ul>
    <li><b>Case:</b> The capitalized (uppercase) or uncapitalized
        (lowercase) form of alphabetic characters, usually in
        Latin script.</li>
</ul>

<p>Languages and cultures are unique in more ways than are
revealed by their rules for formatting numbers and dates, sorting
words, and mapping letters from uppercase to lowercase. They also
handle spelling, grammar, and formatting standards for business
letters or other documents differently. You'll need to do your
own homework to determine the correct behavior for
locale-sensitive features that Windows doesn't handle
automatically. The appendixes in this book lend some guidance,
but you'll need to consult other sources for more detailed
information, such as government standards manuals, books on
languages or linguistics, and data from research organizations.</p>

<p>In particular, pay attention to linguistic nuances that might
seem trivial but could have a large impact on application design
and functionality. For example, Windows allows you to convert
characters into uppercase or lowercase equivalents using <i>LCMapString</i>
or the function calls <i>CharLower, CharLowerBuff,</i> <i>CharUpper,</i>
and <i>CharUpperBuff, </i>and some applications use this feature
to automatically convert the first letter of every sentence into
uppercase or assume that certain types of words should always be
capitalized. In Russian, however, names of the days of the week
are never capitalized&#151;capitalizing the word for <i>Wednesday</i>
changes the meaning to <i>environment,</i> and capitalizing the
word for <i>Sunday</i> changes the meaning to <i>resurrection</i>.</p>

<p>Remember that some linguistic conventions are universal and
some are not. Many languages use the character <i>4</i> to
represent the numeric concept, but they use various words to
represent it: <i>cuatro, fier, four, quatre,</i> and so on. In
creating sort keys for a French phone book, for example, it would
make sense to substitute all instances of the character <i>4</i>
with <i>quatre</i>. Then all business names that begin with the
number 4 would appear in the <i>Q</i> section of the phone book,
where a reader would expect to find them. As you develop
localized products, you will come across language sensitive
issues that Windows does not address. It's up to you to design
intelligent algorithms to handle them.</p>
