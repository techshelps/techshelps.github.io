<h2>Three Levels of IME Support for Applications Running on
Windows 95</h2>

<P><b>Glossary</b></p>

<ul>
    <li><b>Input context:</b> An internal structure that stores
        IME-related status information. Windows 95 supports
        multiple IME contexts, automatically creating an input
        context for each active thread.</li>
</ul>

<p>Input Method Editor support on Far East editions of Windows
3.1 and Windows NT 3.5 differs slightly depending on the target
language. The differences are inconvenient for
developers&#151;sharing a common code base among Far East
editions of an application requires additional work because
IME-related code has to be customized depending on the target
language. The designers of Windows 95 therefore decided to create
a common IME system for Far East editions of Windows 95.</p>

<p>The Windows 95 team's goal in redesigning the IME system was
to give applications more control over mechanisms handled
exclusively by the IME module on Windows 3.1. For example, on
Windows 3.1, applications had no control over characters that the
user entered until the IME posted a WM_CHAR or WM_IME_REPORT
message. On Windows 95, however, applications have the option of
trapping and responding to messages before the messages are
processed by the IME. Applications that contain code to support
Windows 3.1&#150;based or Windows NT 3.5&#150;based IMEs still
run correctly on Windows 95 as long as the application executable
is identified as Windows NT 3.5 or as an earlier version, but
once you become familiar with the Windows 95&#150;based model,
you will probably want to rework your code to take advantage of
the additional features offered, particularly because Windows NT
3.51 supports the same model.</p>

<p>There are three discrete levels of IME support for
applications running on Windows 95: no support, partial support,
and fully customized support. Applications can customize IME
support in small ways&#151;by repositioning windows, for
example&#151;or they can completely change the look of the IME
user interface. (See the section titled <font class="MissingLink" meta="dev25j">&quot;Customized IME
Support on Windows 95&quot;</font>.)</p>
