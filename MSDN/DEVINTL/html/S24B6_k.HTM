<h2>Rules for Sorting Ideographic Characters</h2>

<p>There are several traditional methods for sorting ideographic
characters:</p>

<p>By radical, and then by the number of strokes required to draw
the radical, in increasing order</p>

<p>By the number of strokes required to draw the character, and
then by the order of the radicals</p>

<p>By pronunciation (note that many ideographs have more than one
pronunciation)</p>

<p>By code-point value</p>

<p>Far East editions of Windows support the sort methods listed
in the following table. The sort method used depends on the
locale specified in the sort call. By default, each Far East
edition supports only the Unicode sort order and the sort order
or orders for the default system locale. The user can, however,
install sort tables for additional languages via Control Panel.</p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="7" cols="2">
    <tr>
        <td valign="top"><b><i>Locale</i></b></td>
        <td valign="top"><em><strong>Sort Order</strong></em></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td valign="top">Any locale that is not Chinese,
        Japanese, or Korean</td>
        <td valign="top">By Unicode code-point value. Ideographic
        characters in Unicode are grouped according to the number
        of strokes required to draw the radical and then by the
        number of strokesrequired to draw the rest of the
        character</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td valign="top">Japanese</td>
        <td valign="top">In Shift-JIS order. Roman and kana
        characters in Shift-JIS are sorted phonetically, and
        kanji characters are sorted by radical.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td valign="top">Traditional Chinese</td>
        <td valign="top">By the number of strokes required to
        draw the character.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td valign="top">Simplified Chinese</td>
        <td valign="top">In phonetic order. This is the default
        for the Simplified Chinese locale.</td>

    <tr>
        <td valign="top">&nbsp;</td>
        <td valign="top">By the number of strokes required to
        draw the character. This is provided as an alternative
        sort method.</td>
