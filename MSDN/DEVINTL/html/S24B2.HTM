<H1>Chapter 3 Encoding Character Sets</h1>

<p>Most developers of international Microsoft Windows&#150;based
programs have at some point banged their heads against the wall
trying to come to grips with character encodings. The mishmash of
standards makes it hard for users to share data and for
programmers to create worldwide software. Some standards are
7-bit; others are 8-bit. Single-byte character sets come in
several flavors, as do the double-byte standards, which are also
called multibyte because they are really a mix of single-byte and
double-byte character codes. Trying to pass data from different
character encodings across networks or between operating systems
involves a gauntlet of mappings, conversions, fonts, and
headaches.</p>

<p>The reasons for this complexity are historical, and as
technology evolves, working with character encodings will get
easier. A band of international thinkers has created a standard
for the future called Unicode, which newer operating systems such
as Microsoft Windows NT have adopted. But until Unicode is more
widely used, programmers will still have to navigate through a
rough sea of character-encoding standards. Because understanding
character sets is basic to any internationalization effort, this
chapter provides a map for understanding them in Windows NT,
which is based on Unicode, and in Microsoft Windows 95, which is
not based on Unicode but is based on the same family of code
pages introduced by Microsoft Windows 3.1.</p>
