<h2>Summary</h2>

<ul>
    <li>The ease with which you can localize a program's user
        interface is a good indication of whether the underlying
        code is properly internationalized.</li>
    <li>Win32 resource files are a convenient mechanism for
        isolating, editing, and compiling the localizable
        elements of a program's user interface. To create a
        different language edition of a program, you need only
        change the resources.</li>
    <li>The Win32 SDK contains tools for creating, editing, and
        compiling resources. Microsoft Visual C++ 2 integrates
        these tools into a single editing environment.</li>
    <li>Win32 resource strings are compiled into Unicode format,
        but the .RC file format is still commonly expressed in
        Windows character sets. You can compile multilingual
        resources encompassing different character sets using the
        RC compiler that comes with the Win32 SDK.</li>
    <li>A good localization tool for an ongoing project tracks
        when developers add, change, or delete user interface
        elements in the application. It also minimizes common
        mistakes made by translators and provides context
        information and database suggestions to increase
        translation accuracy and speed.</li>
    <li>Designing your native-language dialog boxes with room to
        spare minimizes time spent resizing them.</li>
    <li>Message tables conveniently store alert and error
        messages that contain more than one replacement
        parameter. Message tables can contain text in multiple
        languages and character sets.</li>
    <li>You should store localizable constants, but not strings,
        in RCDATA resources.</li>
    <li>Because resources in Win32 are indexed by language as
        well as by type and name, you can compile
        multiple-language resources in a single executable or
        into separate DLLs and switch the language of your
        program's user interface at run time.</li>
    <li>A version stamp can be used to declare which languages a
        given executable or DLL supports.</li>
