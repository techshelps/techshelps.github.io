<h3>Korean</h3>

<p>The Korean written language uses two types of characters:
hangul and hanja. A hangul character is a single syllabic
character created by combining one or more consonant signs and a
vowel sign. There are 24 basic elements (14 consonants and 10
vowels), or phonemes, used to denote these signs; these elements
are called jamos. You can create up to 51 jamos by combining two
or more basic elements to form additional vowels or consonants,
called compounds. Compounds and basic elements together comprise
21 vowels (10 basic vowels and 11 compound vowels) and 30
consonants (14 basic consonants and 16 compound consonants).
Jamos are shown in Figure 7-4 below.</p>

hangul writing system.</i></p>

<p>A hangul character (syllabic) consists of an initial
consonant, a medial vowel, and sometimes a final consonant.
Nineteen of the 30 consonants can be initial consonants. All 21
vowels can be medial vowels, and 27 of the 30 consonants can be
final consonants. This means that 11,172 hangul character
combinations are possible, though far fewer are actually used.
The Wansung code page encodes the most common hangul character
combinations, and the Johab code page covers all possible
combinations. The Korean language also adopted hanja characters
from Chinese and uses them for more formal written communication
and to represent personal names. Most daily communications are
written in hangul.</p>
