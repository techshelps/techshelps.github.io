<h2><font face="Helvetica-Black">Identifying Localization
Requirements in Specs</font></h2>

<p align="left">The user interface design and the feature set for
each language edition of a product might not be exactly the same.
Plan for this in advance by identifying required differences in
your spec. For example, European editions of Windows 95 do not
upport some API calls that Far East editions use to handle the
input of ideographic characters. European editions of Windows 95
don&#146;t simply omit these API functions; the spec calls for
their entry points to be stubbed so that programs that call them
will still run on all language editions of Windows 95.</p>

<p align="left">In addition to describing product features in
detail, your spec might also address other factors that will
affect your ship dates, such as staffing requirements and the
scheduling of milestones for coding, translation, and testing.
The members of your team who are writing the program
specification, for example, need to know in advance which
languages and locales the final product is targeting and to what
extent each language edition will actually be translated. When
describing what new features will look like and how they will
behave, the team should address internationalization issues, such
as whether certain features will be removed or customized for
different editions and whether a feature&#146;s behavior must be
locale-sensitive. What happens if a user enters Cyrillic
(Russian) characters? Is it necessary to adjust certain dialog
boxes for the Japanese edition? Program designers need to
consider such details. If they are not familiar with foreign
languages or with the needs of international users, they need to
talk to people who are.</p>

<p align="left">If you work for a large company, send copies of
your draft specification to marketing representatives and
language specialists at international subsidiaries. If you work
for a small company, share the spec with overseas partners or
consultants. Your partners should be able to point out any
glaring errors or oversights and give you feedback on the
relevance of proposed new features and designs to their markets.
They might forward customer reports, market-research results, and
reviews of competitive products from the local press. They should
also provide you with locale-specific information your product
might need, such as typical postal codes, business letter
formats, punctuation rules, and so on. Familiarity with the
specification will in turn help your international partners make
plans for marketing the product once it is released.</p>

<p align="left">Good planning will help you ship your product
quickly. Early feedback on the specification from your team, key
customers, usability tests, and market experts will help you
determine the best way to implement your features at a much lower
cost than the cost of making changes at the last minute.
Large-scale last-minute changes in your product design will cause
a chain-reaction delay in the ship date of your executable, help
files, tutorials, documentation, and marketing
collateral&#151;all of which might then need to be retranslated
and retested. You never want to ship an inadequate product, but
major last-minute changes are expensive, and you can avoid them
by working from a solid, globalized spec.</p>
