<h3>Chinese</h3>

<p>Three forms of ideographic characters are commonly used today:
Traditional Chinese, Simplified Chinese, and kanji. Traditional
Chinese characters, which are thousands of years old, generally
contain more strokes than other ideographic forms and are more
pictorial. These characters are still used in Taiwan. Simplified
Chinese characters, which are based on Traditional Chinese
characters, were developed in mainland China to make reading and
writing easier to learn. Although Traditional Chinese and
Simplified Chinese share some characters, the simplified
characters, of which there are less than 7000, are composed of
fewer strokes and in most cases are distinct from their original
counterparts. This is why software products developed for the
Chinese-speaking market are usually released in two
editions&#151;one for the Traditional Chinese script and one for
the Simplified Chinese script.</p>
