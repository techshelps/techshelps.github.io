<h2>Far Eastern Input Method Editors</h2>

<H3><b>Glossary</b></h3>

<ul>
    <li><b>Input method:</b> Any method used to enter text that
        doesn't involve typing each character directly. Input
        methods are widely used for entering ideographs and other
        characters phonetically or component by component.</li>
    <li><b>Romaji:</b> A writing system based on the Latin
        alphabet that is used to represent Japanese text.</li>
    <li><b>Bopomofo:</b> A Chinese standard phonetic script
        developed in 1913.</li>
    <li><b>Determined string:</b> A string that has been
        converted from a phonetic representation into ideographs.</li>
    <li><b>Conversion </b><b><i>or</i></b><b> composition window:
        </b>The window of an Input Method Editor that displays
        text typed by the user, either as entered or as converted
        to ideographic form.</li>
    <li><b>Status window: </b>The window of an Input Method
        Editor in which the user can change the IME's conversion
        mode or input mode.</li>
    <li><b>Candidate window: </b>The window of an Input Method
        Editor that lists characters that the user can choose to
        replace the text highlighted in the composition window.</li>
</ul>

<p>Input Method Editors, also called front-end processors, are
applets that allow the user to enter the thousands of different
characters used in Far Eastern written languages using a standard
101-key keyboard. The user composes each character in one of
several ways: by radical, by phonetic representation, or by
typing in the character's numeric code page index. IMEs are
widely available; Windows ships with standard IMEs that are based
on the most popular input methods used in each target country,
and a number of third-party vendors sell IME packages.</p>

<p>An IME consists of an engine that converts keystrokes into
phonetic and ideographic characters, plus a dictionary of
commonly used ideographic words. As the user enters keystrokes,
the IME engine attempts to guess which ideographic character or
characters the keystrokes should be converted into. Because many
ideographs have identical pronunciation, the IME engine's first
guess isn't always correct. When the suggestion is incorrect, the
user can choose from a list of homophones; the homophone that the
user selects then becomes the IME engine's first guess the next
time around. This process is summarized in Figure 7-5.</p>

IME engine converts keystrokes into ideographic characters.</i></p>

<p>You don't have to use a localized keyboard to enter
ideographic characters. While localized keyboards can generate
phonetic syllables (such as kana or hangul) directly, the user
can represent phonetic syllables using Latin characters. In
Japanese, Latin characters that represent kana are called romaji.
Japanese keyboards contain extra keys that allow the user to
toggle between entering romaji and entering kana. If you are
using a non-Japanese keyboard, you need to type in romaji in
order to generate kana.</p>

<p>The best way to learn how an IME works from the user's
perspective is to try using it. The next sections take a look at
the Chinese, Japanese, and Korean IMEs that ship with Windows NT
3.5 and Windows 95.</p>
