<h2>Testing Considerations</h2>

<p>Just as localization should begin early in the product cycle,
so should testing of localized programs. It's very tempting to
concentrate all testing efforts on the domestic product in order
to get it shipped quickly. Early testing of all editions,
however, ensures that development is paying attention to
international issues because it often uncovers serious bugs in
the core code.</p>

<p>When deciding whether or not to fix a bug at all, determine
how much time fixing the bug will require and how crucial the fix
is to the finished product. Does the bug make the program
unusable? If not, will it seriously affect sales in any important
target markets? Maintain common standards for all language
editions of your product. Never postpone fixing bugs found in
your domestic software product that will affect international
users. Make sure your domestic product passes the international
functionality checklist in Figure 2-8.</p>

<p>At the end of the product cycle, when the domestic product is
close to shipping, it is tempting to postpone bugs that arise
only in localized software until after the domestic product
ships, out of fear of &quot;destabilizing&quot; the domestic
edition. But every time you postpone fixing an
international-related bug, you are postponing all of your
international releases. If your domestic product will ship in a
few days, postponing a few bugs exclusive to localized editions
is not a big deal. However, many experienced developers have
worked on projects that were in ship mode for weeks, months, or
even years. Under these circumstances, allowing international
bugs to pile up is dangerous and leaves unresolved a significant
number of changes that you will have to merge with the sources
for the next product release.</p>

<p>Keep in mind that if you plan to ship a single international
executable, you really cannot postpone fixing bugs related to
internationalization. Developers of localized editions might need
a few extra weeks after the domestic edition ships to make
changes to resource files, help files, or sample documents, but
once your single executable is done, it should be done for all
languages. Of course, this won't always happen, but striving for
this ideal will definitely benefit the ship dates of your
localized editions.</p>
