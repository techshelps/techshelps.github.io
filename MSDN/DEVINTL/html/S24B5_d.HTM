<h2>Rich Text and Porting Multilingual Text</h2>

<p>Windows 95&#150;based applications can inherit some
multilingual functionality simply by using RichEdit common
controls, which support formatted text. These controls handle
charsets just as they do any other character fomatting property,
so the system preserves charset information whenever text is
imported or exported from the control. RichEdit controls, along
with the clipboard formats and the Font common dialog box, are
the only &quot;free&quot; pieces of multilingual support that
come with the system. (See <font class="MissingLink" meta="dev0f">Chapter 3</font> for information about the
clipboard.) You'll need to add code to your application to take
full advantage of Windows 95's multilingual features.</p>

<p>Formatted text is also a convenient mechanism for porting text
to other platforms, such as Windows NT, that do not yet support
multilingual text. Unicode is, of course, an alternative
plaintext standard, but as described in <font class="MissingLink" meta="dev0f">Chapter 3</font>, it can be
difficult to accurately convert text expressed in Unicode to text
expressed in Windows code pages. Unless your Windows
95&#150;based application saves text in a Unicode-based file
format, you might want to port documents using a formatted text
standard such as Rich Text Format (RTF). RTF defines several
keywords that are related to charsets and language. The charset
and code page values for the RTF keywords \fcharset<i>N</i> and
\cpg<i>N </i>are the same as those listed in the Charset Name and
Code- Page ID columns in <font class="MissingLink" meta="dev5i">Figure 6-5</font>.. The RTF keywords \deflang<i>N
</i>and \lang<i>N </i>take Windows language IDs, expressed in
decimal form, as arguments.</p>

<p>Saving files in formatted text is not the only requirement for
sharing multilingual documents. Both sender and recipient need
applications that can understand multilingual documents, and
their systems need enough font and locale support to create and
display multilingual data. If the text recipient needs only to
read the document&#151;for example, when downloading messages
from an electronic bulletin board&#151;the sender could embed the
necessary fonts at the end of the text stream. Obviously,
embedding fonts involves some overhead costs at run time.</p>
