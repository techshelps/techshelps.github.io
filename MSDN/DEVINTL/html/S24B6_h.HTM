<h2>Vertical Writing and Printing</h2>

<p>Depending on the purpose of your application, you might find
it necessary to support vertical text. Although text that is read
horizontally from left to right is becoming more common in Far
Eastern countries (text in Japanese technical and business
journals, for example, is often printed horizontally), many
books, magazines, and newspapers still print text vertically.</p>

<p>As the following illustration shows, displaying text
vertically doesn't mean that you simply rotate an entire line of
text by 90 degrees. Most characters remain upright, but others,
such as those identified by arrows, change orientation.</p>

<p>Fortunately, with Win32 you don't need to write code to rotate
characters. To display text vertically on Windows, enumerate the
available fonts as usual and select a font whose typeface name
begins with the <i>at</i> (@) character. Then create a LOGFONT
structure, setting both the escapement and the orientation to 270
degrees. Calls to <i>TextOut</i> are the same as for horizontal
text.</p>

<p>The Far East Win32 SDK contains a sample application called
TATE (short for <i>tategaki,</i> meaning &quot;vertical
writing&quot;) which demonstrates how to create fonts and display
vertical text. Figure 7-22 shows a sample file displayed in TATE
using a horizontal font. Selecting a vertical font from the Font
dialog box (see Figure 7-23 below) causes the text to be
displayed vertically. (See Figure 7-24 below.)</p>

<p>The Far East Win32 SDK includes the code for TATE, which is
minimal; TATE doesn't allow you to enter or edit text. In your
own application, you will need to add editing code to handle, for
example, the progression of Japanese vertical text from right to
left.</p>
