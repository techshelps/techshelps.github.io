<h1 class="cht">Chapter 1 Understanding Internationalization</h1>

<p>Developing globalized software is a continuous balancing act.
Developers and their managers often grossly underestimate the
level of effort and attention to detail required to create
high-quality foreign-language editions of a product. If you are a
developer, make sure your management understands what is
involved. Familiarity with the kinds of problems that arise will
help you make decisions at the beginning of your product cycle,
saving you time and money&#151;not to mention grief.</p>

<p>The process of creating globalized software has two
facets&#151;&quot;internationalization,&quot; which covers
generic coding and design issues, and &quot;localization,&quot;
which involves translating and customizing a product for a
specific market. Using the national language support supplied by
the Microsoft Win32 API is an internationalization step, whereas
resizing dialog boxes and standardizing terminology are
localization steps. Developers write code, so they tend to focus
primarily on internationalization issues. But because code and
feature design affect how a product is translated and customized,
developers must also understand basic localization concepts.</p>

<p>The first two chapters of this book provide a helpful
introduction to software internationalization on Microsoft
Windows. They discuss general concepts and techniques for
creating globalized applications, define terms used throughout
the rest of the book, and provide a framework for later chapters,
which cover specific technical details about using Windows-based
tools and Win32 API functions.</p>
