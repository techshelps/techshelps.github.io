<h2>Han Unification in the Unicode Standard</h2>

<H3><b>Glossary</b></h3>

<ul>
    <li><b>Han unification: </b>The process of assigning the same
        code point to characters historically perceived as being
        the same character but represented as unique in more than
        one East Asian ideographic character standard. This
        results in a group of ideographs shared by several
        cultures and significantly reduces the number of code
        points needed to encode them.</li>
    <li><b>Round-trip conversion:</b> Mapping a character from
        one character encoding to another and back. Of particular
        interest is how well information is preserved during
        round-trip conversion.</li>
</ul>

<p>The &quot;Han&quot; of &quot;Han unification&quot; refers to
the Han Dynasty, when Chinese characters were first systemized.
It's also the first character in the name for ideographs, , which
is pronounced <i>hanzi</i>, <i>hantsu, </i>or<i> kangxi </i>in
Chinese, <i>kanji</i> in Japanese, and <i>hanja </i>in Korean.
Because Chinese characters were borrowed by the Japanese and
Korean written languages a long time ago, the three languages
share many ideographs, though in each language the same character
can have different meanings and several different pronunciations.
(See Figure 3-11.)</p>

<P><b>Figure 3-11</b> <i>An ideographic character used
in both Chinese and Japanese.</i></p>

<p>The Unicode Consortium chose to represent shared ideographs
only once because the goal of the Unicode standard was to encode
characters independent of the languages that use them. Unicode
makes no distinctions based on pronunciation or meaning;
higher-level operating systems and applications must take that
responsibility. Through Han unification, Unicode assigned about
21,000 code points to ideographic characters instead of the
120,000 that would be required if the Asian languages were
treated separately. (See Figure 3-12.) Even though the character
in the above Figure 3-11 has a number of pronunciations and
meanings, only one character is encoded in Asian national
standards. It's true that the same character might look slightly
different in Chinese than in Japanese, but that difference in
appearance is a font issue, not a &quot;uniqueness&quot; issue.</p>

<P><b>Figure 3-12</b> <i>National standards for these
languages encode the han character with a distinct code point.
Unicode considers this to be one and only one character.
Therefore, in the process of Han unification, only one code point
was allocated. In undertaking Han unification, the Unicode
Consortium worked closely with experts from various countries,
including China, whose GB 13000 standard encompasses all the
characters of several Asian standards, according to The Unicode
Standard, Volume 2.</i></p>

<p>Some ideographs look very similar but actually have unique
meanings and might be drawn with a different stroke order. Such
characters generally have separate codes in the Asian national
standards. Other characters can be variants of one another,
having a slightly different appearance but the same meaning. If
characters are assigned separate codes in the Asian national
standards, Unicode assigns them separate codes. Preserving these
distinctions provides a framework for simple round-trip mappings
between Unicode and various national standards. Unicode also
separately encodes about 2000 Simplified Chinese characters used
in the People's Republic of China.</p>
