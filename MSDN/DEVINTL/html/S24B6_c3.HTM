<h3>Chinese Input Methods</h3>

<p>The Traditional Chinese editions of Windows NT 3.5 and Windows
95 ship with several different input methods.</p>

<p><b>Phonetic Symbol</b></p>

<p>The phonetic-symbol input method is based on the Chinese
standard phonetic script called bopomofo. Bopomofo consists of 37
symbols and 5 audible tones, which are assigned to the letters <i>A</i>
through <i>Z,</i> the numbers <i>0</i> through <i>9, </i>and some
special keys. The user generates Chinese characters by combining
consonants, semi-vowels, and tones. The user can choose from
among four different keyboard layouts, including layouts defined
by IBM and E-Ten Information Systems.</p>

<p><b>Chang Jei</b></p>

<p>The Chang Jei input method builds Chinese characters based on
radicals. Twentyfive radicals are assigned to the letters <i>A</i>
through <i>Y</i>. The letter <i>X</i> is used to generate more
complex radicals. Up to five keystrokes are required to generate
a single Chinese character using the following sequence of
patterns: top-down, left-right, and outside-inside. Each pattern
style consists of a character heading and a character body.
Building a character heading requires a maximum of two keystrokes
(the first and last radicals). Building a character body requires
a maximum of three keystrokes (the first, second, and last
radicals). This input method adheres to the Chang Jei tables
published by E-Ten Information Systems. A &quot;quick,&quot; or
&quot;simplified,&quot; variation of the Chang Jei input method
also ships with Chinese Windows.</p>

<p><b>Da Yi, Array, and Internal Code</b></p>

<p>Two other input methods that build characters using radicals
are the Da Yi input method and the Array input method. The Da Yi
method defines 40 basic radicals, arranged on a standard 101-key
keyboard and corresponding to the stroke order in which
characters are handwritten. A maximum of four basic radicals make
up a Chinese character. The Array input method defines 10 basic
keystrokes, numbered 0 through 9, that represent basic radicals.
The columns of keys beneath each number&#151;for example, on a US
keyboard the letters <i>QAZ</i> beneath 1 and the letters <i>WSX</i>
beneath 2&#151;are used to select specific characters.</p>

<p>Another method is the Internal Code input method, which allows
the user to select a character by typing in its Big-5 code-point
index.</p>

<p><b>Activating the IME</b></p>

<p>You can activate the IME on the Traditional Chinese edition of
Windows NT 3.5 by pressing either the Ctrl+Spacebar key
combination on the right or the Ctrl+Spacebar key combination on
the left, depending on the option you have selected for the IME
in Control Panel. To deactivate the IME, you must switch it to
half-width mode by clicking the toolbar and then press the same
key combination you used to activate the IME.</p>

<p>The IME toolbar remains at the bottom of the screen as you
type. (See Figure 7-13.) The first toolbar section (on the far
left) displays the name of the active input method. You can
switch among input methods currently installed in the system by
clicking the mouse in this section. The second toolbar section
tells you whether the IME is in full-width mode or half-width
mode. The third section, which is considerably wider than the
others, contains the candidate list.</p>

Traditional Chinese edition of Windows NT 3.5.</i></p>

<p>The user can select characters from the candidate list by
clicking them. Each input method, except for the Array method,
also has its own on-screen keyboard layout. To enter characters,
click the rightmost section of the toolbar. To enter punctuation,
click the toolbar section labeled with a comma (<i>,</i>), just
left of the right most section.</p>

<p>The IME toolbar for Traditional Chinese Windows 95, called the
status window, is similar to the toolbar on Chinese Windows NT
3.5. (See Figure 7-14.) The two leftmost sections of the Windows
95 status window correspond exactly to the Windows NT toolbar.
The third and fourth sections on the Windows 95 status window
display the name of an alternative input method and the current
character's representation in that input method. Click the comma
bitmap to enter punctuation (as you would on Windows NT), and
click the keyboard icon to activate the on-screen keyboard.</p>

<p><b>Entering Chinese Characters</b></p>

<p>If you are running Traditional Chinese Windows NT 3.5, try the
following: start Microsoft Write or another application that
accepts text input. Activate the Chinese IME by pressing
Ctrl+Spacebar. The IME will be in half-width mode. Change the
mode to full-width by clicking the full-width/half-width section
of the toolbar. Type the Chinese name for the USA, which
literally means <i>The Beautiful Country, </i>using the Phonetic
Symbol input method, which is a popular Chinese input method.</p>

<p>Press the following keys: A, O, 3. Or, if you are using the
on-screen keyboard, click the following keys instead:</p>

<p><img src="G07FD09.gif" width="71" height="21"></p>

<p>Choose the first character in the candidate list.</p>

<p>Press the following keys: E, J, I, 6. If you are using the
on-screen keyboard, click the following keys instead:</p>

<p><img src="G07FD10.gif" width="96" height="21"></p>

<p>Choose the first character in the candidate list. The Chinese
word for the USA appears.</p>

<p>To type <i>Taiwan </i>using the Phonetic Symbol input method,<i>
</i>perform these steps:</p>

<p>Press the following keys: W, 9, 6. If you are using the
on-screen keyboard, click the following keys instead:</p>

<p><img src="G07FD11.gif" width="71" height="21"></p>

<p>Choose the second character from the candidate list.</p>

<p>Press the following keys: J, 0 (zero). If you are using the
on-screen keyboard, click the following keys instead:</p>

<p><img src="G07FD12.gif" width="46" height="21"></p>

<p>Press the Spacebar to indicate that the character you want is
in first tone.</p>

<p>Choose the first character from the candidate list. The
Chinese word for <i>Taiwan</i> appears.</p>

<p>If you are running Traditional Chinese Windows 95, try
entering <i>Taipei City</i>. Start Notepad and perform the
following steps:</p>

<p>Click the following using the on-screen keyboard:</p>

<p><img src="G07FD13.gif" width="71" height="21"></p>

<p>Choose the numeral <i>2</i> from the list of characters shown
in Figure 7-15.</p>
