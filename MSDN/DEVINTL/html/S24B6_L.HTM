<h2>Rules for Breaking Lines in Asian Languages</h2>

<p>Line-breaking and word-wrapping algorithms are important to
text parsing as well as to text display. The rules for Asian
languages, however, are quite different from the rules for
Western languages. For example, unlike most Western written
languages, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, and Thai do not necessarily
indicate the distinction between words by using spaces. The Thai
language doesn't even use punctuation. For these languages,
software applications cannot conveniently base line breaks and
word-wrapping algorithms on a space character or on standard
hyphenation rules. They must follow different guidelines.</p>

<p>Because the Win32 full-text search engine for Microsoft
WinHelp recognizes that word wrapping is more complex for some
languages than for others, it supports the <i>IWordBreak</i> OLE
interface. That way, if a third-party developer creates a
superior word-wrapping algorithm for any language, the WinHelp
engine can take advantage of it through OLE.</p>
