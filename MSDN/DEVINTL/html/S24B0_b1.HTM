<h3>Categories of Internationalization for Windows</h3>

<p class="t"><b>Glossary</b></p>

<ul>
    <li><b>Single-byte character set (SBCS):</b> A character
        encoding in which each character is represented by 1
        byte. Single byte character sets are mathematically
        limited to 256 characters.</li>
    <li><b>Multibyte character set (MBCS):</b> A mixed-width
        character set, in which some characters consist of more
        than 1 byte. A double byte character set (DBCS), which is
        a specific type of multibyte character set, includes some
        characters that consist of 1 byte and some characters
        that consist of 2 bytes.</li>
    <li><b>Bidirectional (BiDi) text: </b>A mixture of characters
        that are read from left to right and characters that are
        read from right to left. Most Arabic and Hebrew
        characters, for example, are read from right to left, but
        numbers and quoted Western terms within Arabic or Hebrew
        text are read from left to right.</li>
    <li><b>Latin script: </b>The set of 26 characters (A&#150;Z)
        inherited from the Roman Empire that, together with later
        character additions, is used to write languages
        throughout Africa, the Americas, parts of Asia, Europe,
        and Oceania. The Windows 3.1 Latin 1 character set covers
        Western European languages and languages that use the
        same alphabet. The Latin 2 character set covers Central
        and Eastern European languages.</li>
    <li><b>Traditional Chinese:</b> The set of Chinese
        characters, used in such countries/regions as Hong Kong SAR, China
        Singapore, and Taiwan, that is consistent with the
        original form of Chinese ideographs that are several
        thousand years old.</li>
    <li><b>Simplified Chinese: </b>The Chinese alphabet used in
        the People's Republic of China. It consists of several
        thousand ideographic characters that are simplified
        versions of traditional Chinese characters. </li>
    <li><b>Software Development Kit (SDK):</b> A set of tools and
        libraries for creating software applications for Windows
        operating systems.</li>
    <li><b>Device Driver Kit (DDK): </b>A set of tools and
        libraries for creating Windows based software that runs
        hardware devices.</li>
</ul>

<p>Software engineering requirements for neighboring countries/regions
are often quite similar. In fact, three broad geographical groups
cover almost all markets for Windows-based applications: the
Middle East; the Far East; and Europe, Russia, and the Americas.
Before you begin planning a new Windows-based product or decide
which international markets to target for an existing product,
examine the development issues for each of the categories listed
in Figure 1-3.</p>

<p class="t"><b>Figure 1-3</b><b><i> </i></b><i>Categories of
internationalization for Windows, based on development issues.</i></p>

<p>If you plan intelligently, once you have a solid core feature
and a code base for one or two languages in a particular
category, you might determine that the cost of developing another
language edition in that category is small compared with the
potential return. A good example is the Far East* category
(double-byte languages). </p>

<p>Applications written for the Chinese, Japanese, and Korean
editions of Windows share common development issues. Once you
have a Japanese language application, the development steps
necessary to create an application for the booming Korean market
are minimal.</p>

<p>The Windows 95 development team built localized editions of
the operating system from separate code bases that correspond to
the categories listed in Figure 1-3. There were no code
differences between language editions of Windows 95 in each of
these categories&#151;only the language of the user interface
changed. The Middle Eastern, Far Eastern, and Thai code bases are
all supersets of the European code base. (Applications written
for single-byte editions of Windows will run on bidirectional or
double-byte editions of Windows, but the reverse is not
necessarily true.) In fact, to add Middle Eastern functionality
to a European edition of Windows, you need only install several
additional libraries. Windows 3.<i>x</i> had different code bases
for Western European languages, Central and Eastern European
languages, Greek, Turkish, Middle Eastern languages, Far Eastern
languages, and Thai. The goal for future versions of Windows is
to have a single code base for all languages.</p>

<p>Some language editions of your product may require changes
only in packaging and small software components, such as
spell-checkers or sample documents, to be marketable in more than
one region. English products are a prime example. As long as a
program's design is not culturally biased and its features have
been properly internationalized, it can be sold in Australia,
Britain, Canada, Hong Kong SAR, China, India, Ireland, New Zealand, South
Africa, the United States, and many other countries/regions. Keeping this
in mind during the planning stages will help you produce a single
program executable that can be shipped worldwide.</p>

<p>Spanish is another language that is spoken widely. With few
changes, a Spanish-language program can be shipped throughout
Latin America, Spain, and the United States. Though local
dialects exist in many Spanish-speaking countries/regions, computer users
generally accept software that has been translated using a core
vocabulary. Windows supports a number of languages that are used
in multiple locales, including the following:</p>

<hr>

<p>* Although the term &quot;Far East&quot; is no longer as
commonly acceptable as it once was, Microsoft still uses it when
referring to language versions of Windows that require
double-byte character sets.</p>
