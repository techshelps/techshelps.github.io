<p>
In this chapter, we've introduced the concepts that will be covered through the remainder of the book. At this point, you should have a good understanding of what business objects are - and why they're so important to the future of software development. You should also have a general understanding of component technology and how business objects can be managed and distributed through components.</p>
<p>
From here, we'll explore these concepts in more practical detail. We'll look at:</p>
