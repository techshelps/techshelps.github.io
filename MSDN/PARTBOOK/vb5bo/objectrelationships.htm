<h1><a name="objectrelationships"></a>Object Relationships</h1>
<p>
At this point, we've gone through our use case scenarios, and we've defined all the objects that we need to model our business process. We've even gone so far as to determine how all the objects are related to each other at a high level.</p>
<p>
Thus far, however, our objects don't have any properties or methods that actually let them interact with each other. Essentially, we've identified relationships between objects; but we haven't added any way to implement those relationships.</p>
<p>
Earlier in the chapter, we discussed the common types of object relationships:</p>
<table border=1 cellpadding=5 cols=2 frame=below rules=rows width=644>
<tr valign=top>
<td class=blue width=35%><b>Relationship</b></td>
<td class=blue width=65%><b>Description/Example</b></td>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=35%>Ownership (owns, has)</td>
<td width=65%>Parent-child relationships</td>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=35%>User (uses)</td>
<td width=65%>One object uses or employs the services of another object</td>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=35%>Aggregate (contains, made of)</td>
<td width=65%>One object is made up of other (subordinate) objects</td>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=35%>Generalization (is a)</td>
<td width=65%>One object is a specific type of another object</td>
</tr>
</table><br>
<p>
Let's go through each relationship and discuss how to implement that relationship with Visual Basic.</p>
