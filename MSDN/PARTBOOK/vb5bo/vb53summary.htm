<p>
In this chapter, we've discussed the analysis and design process for developing a logical business object model. Our discussion included:</p>
<ul type=disc>
<li>
Requirements use cases (or scenarios)<br><br></li>
<li>
Functional use cases<br><br></li>
<li>
How to identify objects from our use cases<br><br></li>
<li>
How to determine the properties, methods and events for our objects<br><br></li>
<li>
Object relationships and how to implement them using Visual Basic</li>
</ul>
<p>
Object-oriented analysis and design techniques provide us with very powerful and useful tools. These techniques can be useful whether we're going to implement our application using object technology or not, since they offer a general way to model our business entities and processes.</p>
<p>
From here, we'll move on to look at implementing robust, real-world business objects and components using Visual Basic. Then, in Chapter 5, we'll start to tie everything together as we implement a full-blown example application based on the video rental store example that we studied in this chapter.</p>
