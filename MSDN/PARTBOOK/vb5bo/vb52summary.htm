<h1><a name="vb52summary"></a>Summary</h1>
<p>
In this chapter, we've looked at event-driven programming, code behind forms, and other traditional design concepts. We saw how Visual Basic 5.0's object- and component-oriented features build upon older concepts to provide us with new and more powerful capabilities for software design.</p>
<p>
We also walked through the concept of a logical three-tier application model, separating presentation, business logic and data processing. We developed a specific application model including a presentation tier, UI-centric business objects, data-centric business objects and a data services tier. We discussed how this CSL architecture can be implemented in environments ranging from a single workstation to a network where the processing is spread across multiple machines. </p>
<p>
At this point, you should have a good understanding of how this architecture works and how business objects and binary components are used to implement it. As we progress through the remainder of the book, we'll build on these concepts and implement an application by making use of them.</p>
<p>
From here, we'll explore these concepts in more practical detail. We'll look at:</p>
<ul type=disc>
<li>
The design and creation of business objects<br><br></li>
<li>
How business objects are implemented in Visual Basic<br><br></li>
<li>
How business objects are used to create components<br><br></li>
<li>
The different types of components we can create using Visual Basic</li>
</ul>
<p>
Specifically, in the next chapter, we'll cover:</p>
<ul type=disc>
<li>
Analysis of our business domain<br><br></li>
<li>
Identification of business objects<br><br></li>
<li>
Design of individual business objects<br><br></li>
<li>
How business objects interact<br><br></li>
<li>
Using business objects to model our business<br><br></li>
</ul>
