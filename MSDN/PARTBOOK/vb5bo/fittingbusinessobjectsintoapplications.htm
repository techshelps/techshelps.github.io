<p>
Now that we've established what business objects are, and we've explored the different types of components that can contain them, we need to look at just where the objects fit into our typical application. We'll discuss this in much more detail in Chapter 2, but it will be useful to take a quick, high-level look at some different application models, and where business objects fit into them.</p>
<p class=indent>
For the client/server experts reading this, I should point out that we're really blurring the lines between the physical and logical models in this overview. In each case, I'm really proposing a 3-tier logical model; but it is useful to see where everything falls physically regardless. In Chapter 2, we'll be more precise, as we get into more detail on the architecture we'll use throughout the book.</p>
