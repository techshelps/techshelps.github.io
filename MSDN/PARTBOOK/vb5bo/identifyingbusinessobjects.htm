<p>
Now let's find the business objects that are required to support this functionality. As before, a good technique for this process is to pick out the nouns from the use case. Of course, this could get carried to an extreme, so your judgement is required. What we need to do is to pick out possible real-world objects that might need to be modeled in the software:</p>
<p>
CustomerID number</p>
<p>
VideoBarcode reader</p>
<p>
ID cardDatabase</p>
<p>
AttendantSubtotal price</p>
<p>
ScreenTax</p>
<p>
ID numberTotal Price</p>
<p>
Clearly, some of the possible objects we've listed won't end up being created as objects in the software; nevertheless, this is a good starting point. The next step is to determine how these objects relate to each other. During this process, we'll find out which of the objects are important to the software and which are not.</p>
