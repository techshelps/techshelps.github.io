<p>
Finally, here are some requirements for a system that reports an analysis of video rentals. </p>
<p class=indent>
Reporting requirements are often quite different from the rest of an application. Actual reporting is typically done through a reporting package that works directly against the data source. Data analysis is often best done by within business objects, since we can take full advantage of the logic we've coded into our objects.</p>

Requirements Use Case for Rental Analysis</p>
<p class=indent>
</p>
<p class=indent>
In order to decide what kinds of videos to provide for renting in the future, the 
store owner wants to analyze the inventory to identify which types of video make 
the most profit.</p>
<p class=indent>
To do this, the computer needs to look at the number of times each video was rented and what the rental price was for each rental – essentially looking at the revenue generated by the video. This needs to be compared to the purchase cost of each video to determine whether the video recouped its cost effectively. </p>
<p class=indent>
All this data needs to be consolidated to show the profitability of the videos - both by producing studio and by video category.</p>
