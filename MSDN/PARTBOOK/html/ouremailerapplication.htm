<p>
Our first example will be called eMailer:</p>
<p>
<img src="img04_01.gif" border=0></p>
<p>
With this program, we can check email and download it as well as compose and send email. We can even perform another function with eMailer: many programs allow the user to &#34;register&#34; with the click of the mouse, and we&#39;ll do that, too. We will set up eMailer to send a prewritten registration message to our email address; to register, all the user must do is to click a <b>Register Now</b> item in the Help menu. This action will send the message to us automatically, including the user&#39;s name and email address so that we can register him or her.</p>
<p>
Using the Visual Basic Application Wizard, create a new SDI application named eMailer. This is the example program that we will add email capabilities to, so add the two MAPI controls that we&#39;ll need&mdash;MAPISession and MAPIMessages&mdash;by selecting the <b>Components</b> item of the Visual Basic Project menu. Select the entry marked <b>Microsoft MAPI Control 5.0</b> and click <b>OK</b>. Next, double-click each icon of these new controls in the toolbox, adding two new controls to our application: MAPISession1 and MAPIMessages1. Now we&#39;re ready to go; we will start by checking the user&#39;s email from eMailer.</p>
