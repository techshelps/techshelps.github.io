<p>
Now, back to discussions on a higher level. We, as technical professionals, are often asked to justify or support strategic decisions through analysis and/or case studies. If such a decision involves the question 'Why DCOM?', we have a dilemma. DCOM, being an extremely young technology, will not have too many substantial or particularly compelling case studies that one can draw from. Instead, the decision may have to be made based on initial testing and more casual 'feature-set' analysis.</p>
<p>
Here we'll provide a list of salient 'selling points' for DCOM that can be used when building a case for DCOM. Beware, portions of what follows may read more like sales pitches than sound technical punches.</p>
