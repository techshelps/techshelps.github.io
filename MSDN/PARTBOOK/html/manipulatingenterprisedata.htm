<p>
So far we have assumed that the data source used to supply data to our Web page was an Access database. However, Access is not designed to handle really large volumes of data, or high transaction rates from multiple users. As we begin to look at developing an Internet or Intranet site, we need to consider the potential number of simultaneous visitors we might have to cater for. Hundreds of users might visit a typical Internet site in any given day, potentially dozens at the same time. In this environment, Microsoft Access would quickly overheat. So let's take a step beyond Access, and look at how the ADO can be used with other sources of data, including enterprise database systems such as Microsoft SQL Server.</p>
