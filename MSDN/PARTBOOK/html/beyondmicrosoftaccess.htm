<p>
In the previous sections, we've looked at the workings of OLE DB and the ADO in detail. It's time to put some of it into practice. We'll take an example database, and move it from Access to the SQL Server platform. This is a surprisingly straightforward process. With some thought as to the differences between the two platforms, and some good up-front design work, we can create and develop an ASP application using Access, then <b>upsize</b> it to SQL Server for use in an enterprise-oriented, high volume environment. </p>
