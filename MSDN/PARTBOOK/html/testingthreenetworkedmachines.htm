<p>
Just to make sure that everything is still in order:</p>
<ul type=disc>
<li>
Run <b><code>Pview95.exe</code></b> on machine B to ensure that the <b><code>Atlfinder.exe</code></b> server is still running. If it isn't, restart with <b><code>ATLFinder /Server</code></b>.<br><br></li>
<li>
Run <b><code>Pview95.exe</code></b> on machine C to ensure that the <b><code>Dllhost.exe</code></b> surrogate is still running. If it isn't, restart with <b><code>DLLHOST {D2A1CBC6-4C5E-11D0-8564-004005263AF7}</code></b>.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Finally, start Internet Explorer 3.01 on machine A, and enter in the following URL:</p>
<p>
<b><code>http://&lt;Machine B’s name or IP&gt;/TestPage.htm</code></b></p>
<p>
This, of course, assumes that you've placed the <b><code>TestPage.htm</code></b> file at the root of the web supported by machine B's Personal Web Server.</p>
<p>
As the web page loads, you'll see the Calendar control activate (albeit quite slowly). Try clicking on a cell to select the event list and get the event details. Remember that the control coding has to initialize the ATLDept objects on machine C from machine A with dummy data across the network.</p>
<p>
Notice how the entire application still functions as it did when it was standalone. The only difference is the slower network based operation.</p>
