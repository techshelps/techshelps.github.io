<p>
The last part of the object model that we still need to discuss is the remainder of <b><code>Window</code></b>’s properties: the ones that are actually objects in themselves. These objects are much simpler than <b><code>Window</code></b> and <b><code>Document</code></b>, and they aren’t used as commonly as these objects either. However, they can be very useful in certain situations, and warrant a few pages of explanation. Here's the object model again, so you can see how they're related to the rest of the hierarchy.</p>
<p>
*** Insert diagram from 0448 VBScript Page 148 - the object model. Repeated from earlier in chapter.</p>
<p>
The <b><code>History</code></b> object, <b><code>Navigator</code></b> object, and <b><code>Frames</code></b> collection all lie immediately off of the <b><code>Window</code></b> object in the browser hierarchy. These objects, in the order listed, provide information about the browser’s history list, the browser version, and the frames in the current document (if any).</p>
