<p>
In this chapter, you&#39;ll learn how to create OLE custom controls, also known as OCX controls or ActiveX controls. We&#39;ll use Microsoft Visual C++ 4.0, the most popular tool for creating ActiveX controls. I&#39;ll assume that you&#39;ve used this package and have a fair understanding of how it works (if not, you can still follow along, but it will be harder). With Visual C++, you can design and implement your own customized controls using Visual C++&#39;s ControlWizard. For example, you can create a control that displays the date and then install this control in VBScript Web pages as easily as other controls such as buttons or listboxes.</p>
<p>
As you can imagine, this is a powerful technique. The potential (and after-market) for new controls is endless, and the power of VBScript is extended to amazing proportions with the ability to embed and access OLE controls.</p>
