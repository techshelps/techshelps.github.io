<h1><a name="therecordsetobject"></a>The Recordset Object</h1>
<p>
The <b><code>Recordset</code></b> object is the real heart of the ADO. It's the primary mechanism we use to interact with a database. In previous chapters we've introduced the <b><code>Recordset</code></b>, and seen what it has to offer. In this section, we'll consider some of the things we must take into account when creating <b><code>Recordsets</code></b>. Then we'll look at how we go about retrieving <b>Binary</b> <b>Large</b> <b>Object</b> (BLOB) data using a <b><code>Recordset</code></b>. </p>
<p>
A <b><code>Recordset</code></b> is in essence a <b>cursor</b>. A cursor is a subset of a database, organized and sorted in accordance with an SQL query. Cursors are powerful tools within a relational database engine. They allows developers to retrieve a subset of data, position that data in tables and columns, and then navigate the result set—both forward and backward—updating and changing the data as required. The following are some things to consider when creating and working with <b><code>Recordsets</code></b>.</p>
