<p>
Despite all the flexibility that distributed component computing will bring us, there are vital missing pieces in the COM/DCOM puzzle that will prevent the immediate widespread deployment of the technology. This has little impact on self-contained project development environments, such as our Aberdeen &amp; Wilshire intranet.
