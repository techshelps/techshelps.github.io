<p>
In our previous example, and in examples you saw in the last chapter, we've come up against the need to display data from a table in our Web pages. This is a regular requirement and is, of course, the main reason that HTML sports the <b><code>&lt;TABLE&gt;</code></b> tag and the wide range of formatting options it offers.</p>
<p>
However, we still have to manually create the <b><code>&lt;TR&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;</code></b> and <b><code>&lt;TD&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;</code></b> tags to get the layout right. There are tools that help to do this, but a sample component that is now available from Microsoft can do it all automatically. You can get the component from: <b><code>http://www.microsoft.com/iis/usingiis/developing/samples</code></b></p>
<p>
It's written in Java, so you'll also need to install the latest Java Virtual Machine (VM) from Microsoft, as well as the component. Because it's a sample, rather than part of ASP, you need to install it separately, but full instructions are included in the distribution file.</p>
<p>
So what can it do? Well, it has four properties, and one method. The best way to learn about it is to see how we use it:</p>
<pre><code>' <b>Create a connection, and open it using the System DSN 'MyDatabase'</b>
Set oConn = Server.CreateObject("ADODB.Connection")
oConn.Open "MyDatabase"

' Create a recordset containing the records from the table 'MyTable'
Set oRs = oConn.Execute("MyTable")

' Create an instance of the HTML Table Formatter Component
Set oTblfmt = Server.CreateObject("IISSample.HTMLTable")

' Now set its properties for the borders, caption, style and headings
oTblFmt.Borders = False
oTblFmt.Caption = "Displaying my data"
oTblFmt.CaptionStyle = "ALIGN=CENTER VALIGN=BOTTON"
oTblFmt.HeadingRow = True

' And insert the formatted table into the page
oTblFmt.AutoFormat(oRs)</code></pre>
<p>
If you are into creating components, you'll find the download worth it just to see how it's done—all the source code is included. And it certainly saves a lot of coding, and keeps the actual size of the page down as well!</p>
