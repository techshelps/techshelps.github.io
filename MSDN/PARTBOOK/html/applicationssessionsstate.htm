<p>
Traditional network based applications have always had one major advantage—the automatic maintenance of <b>state</b> by the network itself. The previous lack of this feature within HTTP has tended to limit the development of true Web-based applications. What do we mean by state? In a traditional local or wide area network, the software (such as Novell, Banyan, or Microsoft's own protocols) combined with features of the operating system in such a way that once a user logged into the network, they could be automatically recognized by all the applications on it.</p>
