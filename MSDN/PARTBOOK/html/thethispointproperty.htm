<p>
To work with an individual data point, we use the ThisPoint property. This property selects the current point in the graph control; to select the first data point, we set Graph1.ThisPoint to 1:</p>
<pre><code>Sub Page_Initialize
                Graph1.GraphTitle = "Fish Consumption"
                Graph1.BottomTitle = "Measured in Tons"
                Graph1.GraphData = 50
                Graph1.GraphData = 60
                Graph1.GraphData = 30
                Graph1.GraphData = 40
                Graph1.GraphData = 60
                Graph1.GraphData = 70
                Graph1.GraphType = 2    'Change for diff graphs
    --&gt;         Graph1.ThisPoint = 1
                        .
                        .
                        .
        End Sub</code></pre>
<p>
Now that we&#39;ve selected the data point to explode, we set its ExtraData property to 1:</p>
<pre><code>Sub Page_Initialize
                Graph1.GraphTitle = "Fish Consumption"
                Graph1.BottomTitle = "Measured in Tons"
                Graph1.GraphData = 50
                Graph1.GraphData = 60
                Graph1.GraphData = 30
                Graph1.GraphData = 40
                Graph1.GraphData = 60
                Graph1.GraphData = 70
                Graph1.GraphType = 2    'Change for diff graphs
                Graph1.ThisPoint = 1
    --&gt;         Graph1.ExtraData = 1
        End Sub</code></pre>
<p>
The new graph appears in Figure 6.7.</p>

<p>
<b>Figure 6.7 &nbsp;Our graph control displays our data as a 3-D pie chart with one exploded slice.</b></p>
<p>
Of course, not all data will appear neatly at x positions 1, 2, 3, 4, and so on. Usually, we must set the x data just as we&#39;ve set the y data. To set the x position of a point, we first select that point with the ThisPoint property and then set its XPosData property to the correct x value. Using this property (which cycles just as the GraphData property cycles), we can specify the x locations of our data points as well as the y values.</p>
<p>
That&#39;s it for the graph control. As you can see, using it makes graphing numerical data very easy. The file graph.htm appears in Listing 6.3.</p>

The graph control is useful and easy to use. The same is true for the next custom control we turn to: the multimedia control.</p>
