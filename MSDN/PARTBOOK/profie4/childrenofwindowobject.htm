<p>
Despite the fact that we've spent some time on the intrinsic <b><code>window</code></b> elements, we still have a lot of browser functionality that we haven't covered yet. Instead of adding numerous new methods, properties, and events to the <b><code>window</code></b> object, the designers of the object model decided to group pieces of related functionality together into new objects and to make these objects children of the <b><code>window</code></b> object. As we'll see in a moment, these objects represent things like history list of the browser, the location currently shown, and information specific to the browser like its version and display properties. We'll cover each of these subsidiary, but still important, objects over the next few pages.</p>
