Of course, a large part of IE4's strength is derived from the way it harnesses existing web integration technologies. One of the primary strengths of the web is its ability to be viewed from many different platforms, the same code being executed successfully on rival platforms. Two differing, but not necessarily mutually exclusive, visions of how this can be achieved are ActiveX and Java. IE4 is designed to be able to execute both Microsoft's own ActiveX technology and Sun's Java. We'll take a little time to examine both of these technologies now as they form a vital part of the future of the web and their support was central to IE4's design.</p>
