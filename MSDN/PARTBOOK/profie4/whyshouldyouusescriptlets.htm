<p>
Scriptlets are simple and powerful, provided that you really need them. If you are a C/C++ developer writing image-processing or data-warehousing applications, it's unlikely that you'll need to learn about Scriptlets. But if the Web and HTML are part of your everyday work, Scriptlets can be incredibly useful. Here's a brief top-ten list of reasons why you – as a Web developer –should consider using Scriptlets:</p>
<ul type=disc>
<li>
You can write them in any (repeat, <i>any</i>) scripting language. You don't need to know C/C++ or any other programming language.<br><br></li>
<li>
You can prototype them in a matter of minutes, and things will certainly be even easier once updated development tools become available.<br><br></li>
<li>
You can create your own HTML objects, and describe them in terms of properties, methods and events.<br><br></li>
<li>
Your entire edit-compile-debug cycle is reduced to hitting Save and <i>F5</i> in the IE4 main window.<br><br></li>
<li>
For the very first time you have the opportunity of writing reusable HTML code, which is a primary requirement in any large-scale Web-oriented project.<br><br></li>
<li>
You can exploit all the power of the Dynamic HTML object model and implement cool effects such as text or image drag-and-drop, mouse over and out object manipulation, and style changes.<br><br></li>
<li>
You can also use your Scriptlets in desktop applications, through a dedicated ActiveX control.<br><br></li>
<li>
You can use them to customize and enhance your Windows Active Desktop and your disk folders. <br><br></li>
<li>
You can always convert your samples to ordinary ActiveX controls once you've fully tested their public interface.</li>
</ul>
