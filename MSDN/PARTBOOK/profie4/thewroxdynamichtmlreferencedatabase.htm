<p>
As you can start to appreciate when you begin to digest the diagram on the previous page, the Dynamic HTML object model encompasses nearly every part of the browser and displayed HTML document. This makes logical sense: we know that we can use Dynamic HTML to modify almost every part of the browser and the page and that the object model is the sole conduit between our code and the browser. From this follows the reasonable conclusion that the object model must expose all of this extensive functionality through its objects and collections.</p>
<p>
The pages that follow explain what each object can accomplish and how the objects relate to each other. We talk about the most important properties, methods, and events. However, to save you from paging through endless amounts of material while you're trying to read and understand, we've placed the extensive reference section with descriptions of every interface element at the end of this book in Appendix D.</p>
<p>
The same information, including any updates are available in a snazzy and easy to use Access 97 format database on the Wrox web site at <b><code>http://rapid.wrox.co.uk</code></b>. </p>
