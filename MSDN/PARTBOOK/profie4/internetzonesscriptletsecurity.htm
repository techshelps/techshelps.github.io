<p>
IE4 introduces <b>security zones</b>, and allows users to associate them with any files that can open or download. They choose the level of security depending on where the page comes from, and how much they trust its source. Many Web sites adopt secure protocols to prevent unauthorized people from spying on the data sent and received. IE 4 recognizes these sites, and displays a lock icon on the status bar while viewing documents from them. IE4 lets users divide the Internet into four different zones, so that they can assign each Web site to a zone with a suitable security level. The zones are: Local Intranet, Trusted Sites, Restricted Sites, Internet. Local Intranet and Internet have a default security level of Medium. The default safety level is high in Trusted Sites and low in Restricted Sites, so consequently the security settings are Low and High, respectively. </p>
<p>
All the files that IE 4 finds locally on your computer are assumed to be completely safe, and no security settings are applied to them. This allows you to open and run documents and programs on your computer without prompting or interruption. The security levels for each of the various zones is completely up to you.</p>
<p>
Web sites in the Restricted Sites zone may be those from which you want to avoid running or opening any scripts or active content. Scriptlets are portions of Web information subject to security restrictions. IE 4 will only download a remote Scriptlet to your machine if you include the source Web site in a zone with a security level of Medium or Low. The Internet Options dialog box (available from the View menu) allows you to change the security settings, choosing from the general values (Low, Medium, High) or by defining your own settings. In this case, to avoid problems when loading remote Scriptlets, make sure that your have enabled the Script ActiveX controls marked safe for scripting option in your Security Settings, as illustrated here:</p>
