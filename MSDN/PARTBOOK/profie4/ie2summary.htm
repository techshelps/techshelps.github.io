<p>
In this chapter we talked about one of the most important additions to Internet Explorer which is utilized by Dynamic HTML. While style sheets were present in Internet Explorer 3.0, it's only in IE4 that virtually of the CSS1 standard has been implemented. Style sheets give us the ability to precisely display and position elements on our pages, and are a key to creating dynamic pages with scripting.  </p>
<p>
Specifically we learned in this chapter that:</p>
<ul type=disc>
<li>
Style sheets have tremendous importance for Dynamic HTML: they're the mechanism we use to change the appearance of HTML elements dynamically.<br><br></li>
<li>
Several kinds of style information- such as positioning or fonts- can be added to HTML pages in several different ways.<br><br></li>
<li>
The <b><code>style</code></b> object makes the different style properties of elements available to script code.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Over the rest of the book you'll be seeing the objects and concepts we talked about in this chapter again and again. As we cover the rest of the fundamentals of dynamic HTML, we'll see how style sheets can be used to connect script to the elements in this page. When tied together with script code and the browser object model, the full functionality of style sheets are revealed. We'll cover this over the next few chapters, but first we need to look at the browser object model.</p>
