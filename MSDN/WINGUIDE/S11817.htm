<H3>A Balanced Design Team</H3><P>  </P>
<P>An important consideration in the design of a product is the composition of the team that designs and builds it. Always try to balance disciplines and skills, including development, visual design, writing, human factors, and usability assessment. Rarely are these characteristics found in a single individual, so create a team of individuals who specialize in these areas and who can contribute uniquely to the final design.</P>
<P>Ensure that the design team can effectively work and communicate together. Locating them in close proximity or providing them with a common area to work out design details often fosters better communication and interaction.</P>
