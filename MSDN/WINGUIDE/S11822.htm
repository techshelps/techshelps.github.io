<H1>The Desktop</H1><P>  </P>
<P>The <I>desktop</I> represents a user's primary work area; it fills the screen and forms the visual background for all operations (as shown in Figure 3.1). However, the desktop is more than just a background. It can also be used as a convenient location to place objects that are stored in the file system. In addition, for a computer connected to a network, the desktop also serves as a private work area through which a user can still browse and access objects remotely located on the network.</P>
