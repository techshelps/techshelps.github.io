<H1>Data-Centered Design</H1><P>  </P>
<P><I>Data-centered design </I>means that the design of the interface supports a model where a user can browse for data and edit it directly instead of having to first locate an appropriate editor or application. As a user interacts with data, the corresponding commands and tools to manipulate the data or the view of the data become available to the user automatically. This frees a user to focus on the information and tasks rather than on applications and how applications interact.</P>
<P>In this data-centered context, a <I>document</I> is a common unit of data used in tasks and exchanged between users. The use of the term is not limited to the output of a word-processing or spreadsheet application, but it emphasizes that the focus of design is on data, rather than the underlying application.</P>
