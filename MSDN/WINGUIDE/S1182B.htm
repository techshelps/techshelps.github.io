<H3>Access Keys</H3><P>  </P>
<P>An access key is an alphanumeric key — sometimes referred to as a <I>mnemonic </I>— that when used in combination with the ALT key navigates to and activates a control. The access key matches one of the characters in the text label of the control. For example, pressing ALT+O activates a control whose label is "Open" and whose assigned access key is "O". Typically, access keys are not case sensitive. The effect of activating a control depends on the type of control.</P>
<P>Assign access key characters to controls using the following guidelines (in order of choice):</P>
<OL><LI>The first letter of the label for the control, unless another letter provides a better mnemonic association.</LI><LI>A distinctive consonant in the label.</LI><LI>A vowel in the label.</LI></OL><P>Avoid assigning a character where the visual indication of the access key cannot be distinguished from the character. Also, avoid using a character normally assigned to a common function. For example, when you include an Apply button, reserve the "A" — or its localized equivalent — as the access key for that button. In addition, do not assign access keys to the OK and Cancel commands when they map to the ENTER and ESC keys, respectively.</P>
<P>Nonunique access key assignments within the same scope access the first control. Depending on the control, if the user presses the access key a second time, it may or may not access another control with the same assignment. Therefore, define an access key to be unique within the scope of its interaction — that is, the area in which the control exists and to which keyboard input is currently being directed.</P>
<P>Controls without explicit labels can use static text controls to create labels with assigned access keys. Software that supports a nonroman writing system (such as Kanji), but that runs on a standard keyboard, can prefix each control label with an alphabetic (roman) character as its access key.</P>
