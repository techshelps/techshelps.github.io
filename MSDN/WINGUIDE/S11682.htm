<H1>Selecting Objects</H1><P>  </P>
<P>An OLE embedded or linked object follows the selection behavior and appearance techniques supported by its container; the container application supplies the specific appearance of the object. For example, Figure 11.11 shows how the linked drawing of a horn is handled as part of a contiguous selection in the document.</P>

<P>When the user individually selects the object, display the object with an appropriate selection appearance. For example, for the content view of an object, display it with handles, as shown in Figure 11.12. For OLE linked objects, overlay the content view's lower left corner with the shortcut graphic. In addition, if your application's window includes a status bar that displays messages, display an appropriate description of how to activate the object (see Table 11.3 later in this chapter).</P>

<P>When the object is displayed as an icon, use the same selection appearance as for selected icons in folders and on the desktop, as shown in Figure 11.13.</P>
