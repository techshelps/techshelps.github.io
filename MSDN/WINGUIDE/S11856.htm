<H3>Opening and Closing Windows</H3><P>  </P>
<P>When the user opens a primary window, include an entry for it on the taskbar. If the window has been opened previously, restore the window to its size and position when it was last closed. If possible and appropriate, reinstate the other related view information, such as selection state, scroll position, and type of view. When opening a primary window for the first time, open it to a reasonable default size and position as best defined by the object or application. For details about storing state information in the system registry, see Chapter 10, "Integrating with the System."</P>
<P>  </P>
<P><B>Note</B>   <img src="NOTE.gif"><BR>Only primary windows, not secondary windows, should include an entry on the taskbar.</P>
<P>  </P>
<P>Because display resolution and orientation varies, your software should not assume a fixed display size, but rather adapt to the shape and size defined by the system. If you use standard system interfaces the system automatically places your windows relative to the current display configuration.</P>
<P>  </P>
<P><B>Note</B>   <img src="XREF.gif"><BR>The <B>SetWindow-Placement</B> function is an example of a system interface that will automatically place windows correctly relative to the current display. For more information about this function, see the documentation included in the Win32 SDK.</P>
<P>  </P>
<P>Opening the primary window activates that window and places it at the top of the window order. If the use attempts to open a primary window that is already open within the same desktop, activate the existing window using the following recommendations. If the existing window is minimized, restore it when you activate it.</P>

<P>The user closes a primary window by clicking (for a pen, tapping the screen) the Close button in the title bar or choosing the Close command from the window's pop-up menu. Although the system supports double-clicking (with a pen, double-tapping the screen) on the title bar icon as a shortcut for closing the window for compatibility with previous versions of Windows, avoid documenting this as the primary way to close a primary window. Instead, document the Close button.</P>
<P>When the user chooses the Close command, if your application does not automatically save these changes and pending transactions or edits that have not yet been saved to file remain, display a message asking the user whether to save any changes, discard any changes, or cancel the Close operation before closing the window. If there are no pending transactions, just close the window. Follow this same convention for any other command that results in closing the primary window (for example, Exit or Shut Down).</P>
<P>  </P>
<P><B>Note</B>   <img src="XREF.gif"><BR>For more information about supporting the Close command, see Chapter 5, "General Interaction Techniques." </P>
<P>  </P>
<P>When closing the primary window, close any of its dependent secondary windows as well. The design of your application determines whether closing the primary window also ends the application processes. For example, closing the window of a text document typically halts any application code or processes remaining for inputting or formatting text. However, closing the window of a printer has no effect on the jobs in the printer's queue. In both cases, closing the window removes its entry from the taskbar. </P>
