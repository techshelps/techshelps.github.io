<H3>Mouse and Pen Navigation</H3><P>  </P>
<P>Navigation with the mouse is simple; when a user moves the mouse left or right, the pointer moves in the corresponding direction on the screen. As the mouse moves away from or toward the user, the pointer moves up or down. By moving the mouse, the user can move the pointer to any location on the screen. Pen navigation is similar to mouse navigation, except that the user navigates by moving the pen without touching the input surface.</P>
