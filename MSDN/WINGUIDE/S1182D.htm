<H3>Shortcut Keys</H3><P>  </P>
<P>Shortcut keys (also referred to as accelerator keys) are keys or key combinations that, when pressed, provide quick access to frequently performed operations. CTRL+<I>letter</I> combinations and function keys (F1 through F12) are usually the best choices for shortcut keys. By definition, a shortcut key is a keyboard equivalent of functionality that is supported adequately elsewhere in the interface. Therefore, avoid using a shortcut key as the only way to access a particular operation.</P>

<P><B>Note</B>   <img src="NOTE.gif"><BR>Function key and modified function key combinations may be easier for international users because they have no mnemonic relationship. However, there is a tradeoff because function keys are often more difficult to remember and to reach. For a list of the most common shortcut key assignments, see Appendix B, "Keyboard Interface Summary."</P>
<P>  </P>
<P>When defining shortcut keys, observe the following guidelines:</P>
<UL><LI>Assign single keys where possible because these keys are the easiest for the user to perform.</LI><LI>Make modified-letter key combinations case insensitive.</LI><LI>Use SHIFT+<I>key</I> combinations for actions that extend or complement the actions of the key or key combination used without the SHIFT key. For example, ALT+TAB switches windows in a top-to-bottom order. SHIFT+ALT+TAB switches windows in reverse order. However, avoid SHIFT+<I>text</I> keys, because the effect of the SHIFT key may differ for some international keyboards.</LI><LI>Use CTRL+<I>key</I> combinations for actions that represent a larger scale effect. For example, in text editing contexts, HOME moves to the beginning of a line, and CTRL+HOME moves to the beginning of the text. Use CTRL+<I>key</I> combinations for access to commands where a letter key is used — for example, CTRL+B for bold. Remember that such assignments may be meaningful only for English-speaking users.</LI><LI>Avoid ALT+<I>key</I> combinations because they may conflict with the standard keyboard access for menus and controls. The ALT+<I>key</I> combinations — ALT+TAB, ALT+ESC, and ALT+SPACEBAR — are reserved for system use. ALT+<I>number</I> combinations enter special characters.</LI><LI>Avoid assigning shortcut keys defined in this guide to other operations in your software. That is, if CTRL+C is the shortcut for the Copy command and your application supports the standard copy operation, don't assign CTRL+C to another operation.</LI><LI>Provide support for allowing the user to change the shortcut key assignments in your software, when possible.</LI><LI>Use the ESC key to stop a function in process or to cancel a direct manipulation operation. It is also usually interpreted as the shortcut key for a Cancel button.</LI></UL><P>Some keyboards also support three new keys, the Application key and the two Windows keys. The primary use for the Application key is to display the pop-up menu for current selection (same as SHIFT+ F10). You may also use it with modifier keys for application-specific functions. Pressing either of the Windows keys — left or right —displays the Start menu. These keys are also used by the system as modifiers for system-specific functions. Do not use these keys as modifiers for nonsystem-level functions.</P>
