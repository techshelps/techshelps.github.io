<H3>Pen Recognition</H3><P>  </P>
<P><I>Recognition</I> is the interpretation of pen strokes into some standardized meaning. Consider recognition as a means to an end, not an end in itself. Do not use recognition if it is unnecessary or if it is not the best interface. For example, it may be more effective to provide a control that allows a user to select a date, rather than requiring the user to write it in just so your software can recognize it.</P>
<P>Accurate recognition is difficult to achieve, but you can greatly improve your recognition interface by providing a fast, easy means to correct errors. For example, if you allow users to overwrite characters or choose alternatives, they will be less frustrated and find recognition more useful. You can also improve recognition by using context and constraints. For example, a checkbook application can constrain certain fields to contain only numbers.</P>
