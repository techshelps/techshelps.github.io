<H2>The Menu Bar and Drop-down Menus</H2><P>  </P>
<P>A <I>menu bar</I>, one of the most common forms of a menu interface, is a special area displayed across the top of a window directly below the title bar (as shown in Figure 7.1). A menu bar includes a set of entries called <I>menu titles</I>. Each menu title provides access to a <I>drop-down menu </I>composed of a collection of <I>menu items</I> or choices.</P>

<P>The content of the menu bar and its drop-down menus are determined by the functionality of your application and the context of a user's interaction. You can also optionally provide user configuration of the menu structure, including hiding the menu bar. If you provide this kind of option, supplement the interface with other components such as pop-up menus, handles, and toolbars, so that a user can access the functionality typically provided by the menu bar.</P>
<P>When displayed, a drop-down menu appears as a panel with its menu items arranged in a column. While the system supports multiple columns for a drop-down menu, avoid this form of presentation because it adds complexity to browsing and interaction of the menu.</P>
<H4><A NAME="PT2"></A>Drop-down Menu Interaction</H4>
<P>When the user chooses a menu title, it displays its associated drop-down menu. To display a drop-down menu with the mouse, the user points to the menu title and presses or clicks mouse button 1. This action highlights the menu title and opens the menu. Tapping the menu title with a pen has the same effect as clicking the mouse.</P>
<P>If the user opens a menu by pressing the mouse button while the pointer is over the menu title, the user can drag the pointer over menu items in the drop-down menu. As the user drags, each menu item is highlighted, tracking the pointer as it moves through the menu. Releasing the mouse button with the pointer over a menu item chooses the command associated with that menu item and the system removes the drop-down menu. If the user moves the pointer off the menu and then releases the mouse button, the menu is "canceled" and the drop-down menu is removed. However, if the user moves the pointer back onto the menu before releasing the mouse button, the tracking resumes and the user can still select a menu item.</P>
<P>If the user opens a menu by clicking on the menu title, the menu title is highlighted and the drop-down menu remains displayed until the user clicks the mouse again. Clicking a menu item in the drop-down menu or dragging over and releasing the mouse button on a menu item chooses the command associated with the menu item and removes the drop-down menu. When the system displays a drop-down menu, clicking its associated menu title again cancels the menu and removes the drop-down. Clicking another menu title also results in canceling any displayed drop-down menu, and displays the menu associated with that menu title.</P>
<P>The keyboard interface for drop-down menus uses the ALT key to activate the menu bar. When the user presses an alphanumeric key while holding the ALT key, or after the ALT key is released, the system displays the drop-down menu whose access key for the menu title matches the alphanumeric key (matching is not case sensitive). Pressing a subsequent alphanumeric key chooses the menu item in the drop-down menu with the matching access character.</P>
<P>The user can also use arrow keys to access drop-down menus from the keyboard. When the user presses the ALT key, but has not yet selected a drop-down menu, LEFT ARROW and RIGHT ARROW keys highlight the previous or next menu title, respectively. At the end of the menu bar, pressing another arrow key in the corresponding direction wraps the highlight around to the other end of the menu bar. Pressing the ENTER key displays the drop-down menu associated with the selected menu title. If a drop-down menu is already displayed on that menu bar, then pressing LEFT ARROW or RIGHT ARROW navigates the highlight to the next drop-down menu in that direction, unless the drop-down menu displays its content in multiple columns, in which case the arrow keys move the highlight to the next column in that direction, and then to the next drop-down menu.</P>
<P>Pressing UP ARROW or DOWN ARROW in the menu bar also displays a drop-down menu if none is currently open. In an open drop-down menu, pressing these keys moves to the next menu item in that direction, wrapping the highlight around at the top or bottom. If the drop-down menu has multiple columns, then pressing the arrow keys first wraps the highlight around to the next column.</P>
<P>The user can cancel a drop-down menu by pressing the ALT key whenever the menu bar is active. This not only closes the drop-down menu, it also deactivates the menu bar. Pressing the ESC key also cancels a drop-down menu. However, the ESC key cancels only the current menu level. For example, if a drop-down menu is open, pressing ESC closes the drop-down menu, but leaves its menu title highlighted. Pressing ESC a second time unhighlights the menu title and deactivates the menu bar, returning input focus to the content information in the window.</P>
<P>You can assign shortcut keys to commands in drop-down menus. When the user presses a shortcut key associated with a command in the menu, the command is carried out immediately. Optionally, you can also highlight its menu title, but do not display the drop-down.</P>
