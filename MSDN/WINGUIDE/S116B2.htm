<H1>Visual Communication</H1><P>  </P>
<P>Effective visual design serves a greater purpose than decoration; it is an important tool for communication. How you organize information on the screen can make the difference between a design that communicates a message and one that leaves a user feeling puzzled or overwhelmed.</P>
<P>Even the best product functionality can suffer if its visual presentation does not communicate effectively. If you are not trained in visual or information design, it is a good idea to work with a designer who has education and experience in this field and include that person as a member of the design team early in the development process. Good graphic designers provide a perspective on how to take the best advantage of the screen and how to use effectively the concepts of shape, color, contrast, focus, and composition. Moreover, graphic designers understand how to design and organize information, and the effects of fonts and color on perception.</P>
