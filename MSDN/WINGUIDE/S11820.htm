<P>In the natural world, objects persist in their existing state unless changed or destroyed. When you use a pen to write a note, you need not invoke a command to ensure that the ink is preserved on the paper. The act of writing implicitly preserves the information. This is the long term direction for objects in the interface as well. Although it is still appropriate to design software that requires explicit user actions to preserve data, consider whether data can be preserved automatically. In addition, view state information, such as cursor position, scroll position, and window size and location, should be preserved so it can be restored when an object's view is reopened.</P>
