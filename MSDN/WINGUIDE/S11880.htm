<H2>Message Box Text</H2><P>  </P>
<P>The message text you include in a message box should be clear, concise, and in terms that the user understands. This usually means using no technical jargon or system-oriented information.</P>
<P>In addition, observe the following guidelines for your message text:</P>
<UL><LI>State the problem, its probable cause (if possible), and what the user can do about it — no matter how obvious the solution may seem to be. For example, instead of "Insufficient disk space," use "'Sample Document' could not be saved, because the disk is full. Try saving to another disk or freeing up space on this disk."</LI><LI>Consider making the solution an option offered in the message. For example, instead of "One or more of your lines are too long. The text can only be a maximum of 60 characters wide," you might say, "One or more of your lines are too long. Text can be a maximum of 60 characters in Portrait mode or 90 characters wide in Landscape. Do you want to switch to Landscape mode now?" Offer Yes and No as the choices.</LI><LI>Avoid using unnecessary technical terminology and overly complex sentences. For example, "picture" can be understood in context, whereas "picture metafile" is a rather technical concept.</LI><LI>Avoid phrasing that blames the user or implies user error. For example, use "Cannot find filename" instead of "Filename error." Avoid the word "error" altogether.</LI><LI>Make messages as specific as possible. Avoid mapping more than two or three conditions to a single message. For example, there may be several reasons why a file cannot be opened; provide a specific message for each condition.</LI><LI>Avoid relying on default system-supplied messages, such as MS-DOS&reg; extended error messages and Kernel INT 24 messages; instead, supply your own specific messages wherever possible.</LI><LI>Be brief, but complete. Provide only as much background information as necessary. A good rule of thumb is to limit the message to two or three lines. If further explanation is necessary, provide this through a command button that opens a Help window.</LI></UL><P>You may also include a message identification number as part of the message text for each message for support purposes. However, to avoid interrupting the user's ability to quickly read a message, place such a designation at the end of the message text and not in the title bar text.</P>
