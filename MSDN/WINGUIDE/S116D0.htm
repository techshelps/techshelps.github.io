<H1>Accessibility</H1><P>  </P>
<P><I>Accessibility</I> means making your software usable and accessible to a wide range of users, including those with disabilities. Many users may require special accommodation because of temporary or permanent disabilities.</P>
<P>The issue of software accessibility in the home and workplace is becoming increasingly important. Nearly one in five Americans have some form of disability — and it is estimated that 30 million people in the U.S. alone have disabilities that may be affected by the design of your software. In addition, between seven and nine out of every ten major corporations employ people with disabilities who may need to use computer software as part of their jobs. As the population ages and more people become functionally limited, accessibility for users with disabilities will become increasingly important to the population as a whole. Legislation, such as the Americans with Disabilities Act, requires that most employers provide reasonable accommodation for workers with disabilities. Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act is also bringing accessibility issues to the forefront in government businesses and organizations receiving government funding.</P>
<P>Designing software that is usable for people with disabilities does not have to be time consuming or expensive. However, it is much easier if you include this in the planning and design process rather than attempting to add it after the completion of the software. Following the principles and guidelines in this guide will help you design software for most users. Often recommendations, such as the conservative use of color or sound, often benefit all users, not just those with disabilities. In addition, keep the following basic objectives in mind:</P>
<UL><LI>Provide a customizable interface to accommodate a wide variety of user needs and preferences.</LI><LI>Provide compatibility with accessibility utilities that users install.</LI><LI>Avoid creating unnecessary barriers that make your software difficult or inaccessible to certain types of users.</LI></UL><P>The following sections provide information on types of disabilities and additional recommendations about how to address the needs of customers with those disabilities.</P>
