<H2>Client-Server Applications</H2><P>  </P>
<P>Users operating on a network may wish to run your application from a network server. For applications that store no state information, no special support is required. However, if your application stores state information, design your application with a server set of components and a client set of components. The server components include the main executable files, dynamic link libraries, and any other files that need to be shared across the network. The client components consist of the components of the application that are specific to the user, including local registry information and local files that provide the user with access to the server components.</P>
