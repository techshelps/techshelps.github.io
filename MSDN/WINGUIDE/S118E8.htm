<H1>Animation</H1><P>  </P>
<P>Animation can be an effective way to communicate information. For example, it can illustrate the operation of a particular tool or reflect a particular state. It can also be used to include an element of fun in your interface. You can use animation effects for objects within a window and interface elements, such as icons, buttons, and pointers.</P>
<P>Effective animation involves many of the same design considerations as other graphics elements, particularly with respect to color and sound. Fluid animation requires presenting images at 16 (or more) frames per second.</P>
<P>When you add animation to your software, ensure that it does not affect the interactivity of the interface. Do not force the user to remain in a modal state to allow the completion of the animation. Unless animation is part of a process, make it interruptible by the user or independent of the user's primary interaction.</P>
<P>Avoid gratuitous use of animation. When animation is used for decorative effect it can distract or annoy the user. You may want to provide the user with the option of turning off the animation or otherwise customizing the animation effects.</P>
