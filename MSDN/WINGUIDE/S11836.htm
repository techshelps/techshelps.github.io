<H3>Scope of Selection</H3><P>  </P>
<P>The <I>scope</I> of a selection is the area, extent, or region in which, if other selections are made, they will be considered part of the same selection set. For example, you can select two document icons in the same folder window. However, the selection of these icons is independent of the selection of the window's scroll bar, a menu, the window itself, or selections made in other windows. So, the selection scope of the icons is the area viewed through that window. Selections in different scopes are independent of each other. For example, selections in one window are typically independent of selections in other windows. Their windows define the scope of each selection independently. The scope of a selection is important because you use it to define the available operations for the selected items and how the operations are applied.</P>
