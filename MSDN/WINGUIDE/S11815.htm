<P>The visual design is an important part of a software's interface. Visual attributes provide valuable impressions and communicate important cues to the interaction behavior of particular objects. At the same time, it is important to remember that every visual element that appears on the screen potentially competes for the user's attention. Provide a pleasant environment that clearly contributes to the user's understanding of the information presented. A graphics or visual designer may be invaluable with this aspect of the design.</P>
<P>For information and guidelines related to the aesthetics of your interface, see Chapter 13, "Visual Design." This chapter covers everything from individual element design to font use and window layout.</P>
