<H1>Chapter 10  Integrating with the System</H1><P>  </P>
<P>Users appreciate seamless integration between the system and their applications. This chapter covers information about integrating your software with the system and how to extend its features, including using the registry to store information about your application, installing your application, using appropriate naming conventions, and supporting shell features, such as the taskbar, Control Panel, and Recycle Bin.</P>
<P>This chapter is only intended to provide an overview. Details required for some conventions go beyond the scope of this guide. For information about these conventions, see the documentation included in the Microsoft Win32 Software Development Kit (SDK). In addition, some of these conventions and features may not be supported in all releases. For more information about specific releases, see Appendix D, "Supporting Specific Versions of Windows."</P>
