<H1>Open Appearance</H1><P>  </P>
<P>Open appearance is most commonly used for an OLE embedded object, but it can also apply in other situations where the user opens an object into its own window. To indicate that an object is "open," display the object in its container's window overlaid with a set of hatched (45 degree) lines drawn every four pixels, as shown in Figure 13.34.</P>
<P>  </P>

<P>If the opened object is selected, display the hatched lines using the system highlight color. When the opened object is not selected, display the lines using the system's setting for window text color.</P>
