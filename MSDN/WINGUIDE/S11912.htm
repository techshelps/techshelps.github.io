<H1>Microsoft Windows NT 3.51</H1><P>  </P>
<P>Windows NT 3.51 (and Windows NT Server 3.51) includes a special dynamic-link library (COMCTL32.DLL) that supports the new controls in Windows 95. As a result, you can develop applications for Windows 95 and Windows NT that have general functional and operational compatibility. However, when applying the conventions in this guide to applications designed for Windows NT, be aware of the following differences in <BR>release 3.51:</P>
<UL><LI>Window visuals and shell components follow the Windows 3.1 appearance and operation.</LI><LI>Close buttons and title bar icons are not supported.</LI><LI>Open and Save As common dialog boxes follow Windows 3.1 appearance and conventions. </LI><LI>Message box symbols follow Windows 3.1 conventions.</LI><LI>Pen API interfaces are not supported.</LI><LI>Registry formats and entries — support for application state and path information, shell creation, the Quick View command, adding commands for files, shell extensions, and sound event registration.</LI><LI>Program Manager is still the primary interface for providing user access to applications. File Manager, rather than Windows Explorer, supports file browsing and file management.</LI><LI>There is no support for the Add/Remove Programs installation object (included in Control Panel). Instead, provide an object in your application's Program Manager group.</LI><LI>AutoPlay is not supported.</LI><LI>Taskbar and desktop toolbars are not supported.</LI><LI>The Recycle Bin is not supported.</LI><LI>The Passwords object (in Control Panel) is not supported. Use the Windows NT User Manager instead.</LI><LI>Microsoft MAPI 1.0, TAPI, and Plug and Play are not supported. (Simple MAPI support is included.)</LI><LI>Some system shortcut key assignments, such as CTRL+ESC and CTRL+ALT+DEL, operate differently.</LI></UL><P>For more information about these interfaces, see the documentation included in the Microsoft Win32 Software Development Kit (SDK).</P>
