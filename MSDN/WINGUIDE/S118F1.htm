<H2>Documentation, Packaging, and Support</H2><P>  </P>
<P>Although this guide focuses primarily on the design of the user interface, a design that provides for accessibility needs to take into consideration other aspects of a product. For example, consider the documentation needs of your users. For users who have difficulty reading or handling printed material, provide online documentation for your product. If the documentation or installation instructions are not available online, you can provide documentation separately in alternative formats, such as ASCII text, large print, Braille, or audio tape format. Organizations that can help you produce and distribute such documentation are listed in the accessibility section of the Bibliography of this guide.</P>
<P>When possible, choose a format and binding for your documentation that makes it accessible for users with disabilities. As in the interface, information in color should be a redundant form of communication. Bindings that allow a book to lie flat are usually better for users with limited dexterity.</P>
<P>Packaging is also important because many users with limited dexterity can have difficulty opening packages. Consider including an easy-opening overlap or tab that helps users remove shrink-wrapping.</P>
<P>Finally, although support is important for all users, it is difficult for users with hearing impairments to use standard support lines. Consider making these services available to customers using text telephones (also referred to as "TT" or "TDD"). You can also provide support through public bulletin boards or other networking services.</P>
