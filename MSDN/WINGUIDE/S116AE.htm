<H1>Wizards</H1><P>  </P>
<P>A <I>wizard</I> is a special form of user assistance that automates a task through a dialog with the user. Wizards help the user accomplish tasks that can be complex and require experience. Wizards can automate almost any task, including creating new objects and formatting the presentation of a set of objects, such as a table or paragraph. They are especially useful for complex or infrequent tasks that the user may have difficulty learning or doing.</P>

<P><B>Note</B>   <img src="XREF.gif"><BR>The system provides support for creating a wizard using the standard property sheet control. For more information about this control, see Chapter 7, "Menus, Controls, and Toolbars."</P>
<P>  </P>
<P>However, wizards are not well-suited to teach a user how to do something. Although wizards assist the user in accomplishing a task, they should be designed to hide many of the steps and much of the complexity of a given task. Similarly, wizards are not intended to be used for tutorials; wizards should operate on real data. For instructional user assistance, consider task Help or tutorial-style interfaces. </P>
<P>Do not rely on wizards as a solution for ineffective designs; if the user relies on a wizard too much it may be an indication of an overly complicated interface, not good wizard design. In addition, consider using a wizard to supplement, rather than replace, the user's direct ability to perform a specific task. Unless the task is fairly simple or done infrequently, experienced users may find a wizard to be inefficient or not provide them with sufficient access to all functionality.</P>
<P>Wizards may not always appear as an explicit part of the Help interface. You can provide access to them in a variety of ways, including toolbar buttons or even specific icons, such as templates.</P>
