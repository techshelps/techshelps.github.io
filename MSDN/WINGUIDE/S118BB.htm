<H2>Link Management</H2><P>  </P>
<P>An OLE linked object includes properties such as: the name of its source, its source's type, and the link's updating basis, which is either automatic or manual. An OLE linked object also has a set of commands related to these properties. It is the responsibility of the container of the linked object to provide the user access to these commands and properties. To support this, an OLE container provides a property sheet for all of its OLE objects. You can optionally also include a Links dialog box for viewing and altering the properties of several links simultaneously.</P>
