<H2>Usability Testing</H2><P>  </P>
<P>Just as it is important to test the general usability of your software, it is a good idea to test how well it provides for accessibility. There are a variety of ways of doing this. One way is to include users with disabilities in your prerelease or usability test activities. In addition, you can establish a working relationship with companies that provide accessibility aids. Information about accessibility vendors or potential test sites is included in the Bibliography.</P>
<P>You can also try running your software in a fashion similar to that used by a person with disabilities. Try some of the following ideas for testing:</P>
<UL><LI>Use the Windows Accessibility Options and set your display to a high contrast scheme, such as white text on a black background. Are there any portions of your software that become invisible or hard to use or recognize?</LI><LI>Try using your software for a week without using a mouse. Are there operations that you cannot perform? Was anything especially awkward?</LI><LI>Increase the size of the default system fonts. Does your software still look good? Does your software fonts appropriately adjust to match the new system font?</LI></UL><P> </P></FONT>
