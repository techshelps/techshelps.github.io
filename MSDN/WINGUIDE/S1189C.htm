<H2>Installing Your Application on a Network</H2><P>  </P>
<P>If you create a client-server application so that multiple users access it from a network server, create separate installation programs: an installation program that allows the network administrator to prepare the server component of the application, and a client installation program that installs the client component files and sets up the settings to connect to the server. Design your client software so that an administrator can deploy it over the network and have it automatically configure itself when the user starts it.</P>
<P>  </P>
<P><B>Note</B>   <img src="XREF.gif"><BR>For more information about designing client-server applications, see Chapter 14, "Special Design Considerations." Additional information can also be found in the documentation included in Win32 SDK.</P>
<P>  </P>
<P>Because Windows may itself be configured to be shared on a server, do not assume that your installation program can store information in the main Windows directory on the server. In addition, shared application files should not be stored in the "home" directory provided for the user.</P>
<P>Design your installation program to support UNC paths. Also, use UNC paths for any shortcut icons you install in the Start Menu folder.</P>
