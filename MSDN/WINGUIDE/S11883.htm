<H2>Opening and Closing MDI Windows</H2><P>  </P>
<P>The user starts an MDI application either by directly opening the application or by opening a document (or data file) of the type supported by the MDI application. If directly opening an MDI document, the MDI parent window opens first and then the child window for the file opens within it. To support the user opening other documents associated with the application, include an interface, such as an Open dialog box.</P>
<P>When the user directly opens an MDI document outside the interface of its MDI parent window — for example, by double-clicking the file — if the parent window for the application is already open, open another instance of the MDI parent window rather than the document's window in the existing MDI parent window. Although the opening of the child window within the existing parent window can be more efficient, the opening of the new window can disrupt the task environment already set up in that parent window. For example, if the newly opened file is a macro, opening it in the opened parent window could inadvertently affect other documents open in that window. If the user wishes to open a file as part of the set in a particular parent MDI window, the commands within that window provide that support.</P>
<P>Because MDI child windows are primary windows, support closing them following the same conventions for primary windows by including a Close button in their title bars and a Close command in their pop-up menu for the windows. When the user closes a child window, any unsaved changes are processed following these common conventions for primary windows. Do not close its parent window, unless the parent window does not provide context or operations without an open child window.</P>
<P>When the user closes the parent window, close all of its child windows. Where possible, preserve the state of a child window, such as its size and position within the parent window; restore the state when the user reopens the file.</P>
