<P>Microsoft Exchange includes a special wizard for installation of information services. You can support this wizard to allow the user to easily install your service.</P>
<P>The system also provides profiles and files that define which services are available to users when they log on. When the user installs your service, ask the user which profile they would like to include with your service, such as their default profile.</P>
