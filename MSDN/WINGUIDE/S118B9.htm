<H2>Operations and Links</H2><P>  </P>
<P>The operations available for an OLE linked object are supplied by its container and its source. When the user chooses a command supplied by its container, the container application handles the operation. For example, the container processes commands such as Cut, Copy, or Properties. When the user chooses a command supplied (registered) by its source, the operation is conceptually passed back to the linked source object for processing. In this sense, activating an OLE linked object activates its source object.</P>
<P>In certain cases, the linked object exhibits the result of an operation; in other cases, the linked source object can be brought to the top of the Z order to handle the operation. For example, carrying out commands, such as Play or Rewind, on a link to a sound recording appear to operate on the linked object in place. However, if the user chooses a command to alter the link's representation of its source's content (such as Edit or Open), the link source is exposed and responds to the operation instead of the linked object itself.</P>
<P>A link can play a sound in place, but cannot support editing in place. For a link source to properly respond to editing operations, fully activate the source object (with all of its containing objects and its container). For example, when the user double-clicks a linked object whose default operation is Edit, the source (or its container) opens, displaying the linked source object ready for editing. If the source is already open, the window displaying the source becomes active. This follows the standard convention for activating a window already open; that is, the window comes to the top of the Z order. You can adjust the view in the window, scrolling or changing focus within the window, as necessary, to present the source object for easy user interaction. The linked source window and linked object window operate and close independently of each other.</P>
