<H2>Toolbar and Status Bar Controls</H2><P>  </P>
<P>The system includes toolbar and status bar controls that you can use to implement these interfaces in your applications. The toolbar control supports docking and windowing functionality. It also supports a dialog box for allowing the user to customize the toolbar. You define whether the customization features are available to the user and what features the user can customize. The system also supports creation of desktop toolbars. For more information about desktop toolbars, see Chapter 10, "Integrating with the System."</P>
<P>The standard status bar control also includes the option of including a size grip control for sizing the window, described in Chapter 6, "Windows." When the status bar size grip is displayed, if the window displays a size grip at the junction of the horizontal and vertical scroll bars of a window, that grip should be hidden so that it does not appear in both locations at the same time. Similarly, if the user hides the status bar, restore the size grip at the corner of the scroll bars.</P>
