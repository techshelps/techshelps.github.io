<H2>Support for User Options</H2><P>  </P>
<P>To provide maximum flexibility for users and their tasks, design your toolbars and status bars to be user configurable. Providing the user with the option to display or hide toolbars and status bars is one way to do this. You can also include options that allow the user to change or rearrange the elements included in toolbars and status bars.</P>
<P>Provide toolbar buttons in at least two sizes: 24 by 22 and 32 by 30 pixels. To fit a graphic label in these button sizes, design the images no larger than 16 by 16 and 24 by 24 pixels, respectively. In addition, support the user's the option to change between sizes by providing a property sheet for the toolbar (or status bar).</P>
<P>  </P>
<P><B>Note</B>   <img src="XREF.gif"><BR>For more information about designing toolbar buttons, see Chapter 13, "Visual Design."</P>
<P>  </P>
<P>Consider also making the location of toolbars user adjustable. While toolbars are typically <I>docked</I> by default — aligned to the edge of a window or pane to which they apply — design your toolbars to be moveable so that the user can dock them along another edge or display them as a palette window.</P>
<P>  </P>
<P><B>Note</B>   <img src="XREF.gif"><BR>For more information about palette windows, see Chapter 8, "Secondary Windows."</P>
<P>  </P>
<P>To undock a toolbar from its present location, the user must be able to click anywhere in the "blank" area of the toolbar and drag it to its new location. If the new location is within the hot zone of an edge, your application should dock the toolbar at the new edge when the user releases the mouse button. If the new location is not within the hot zone of an edge, redisplay the toolbar in a palette window. To redock the window with an edge, the user drags the window by its title bar until the pointer enters the hot zone of an edge. Return the toolbar to a docked state when the user releases the mouse button.</P>
<P>As the user drags the toolbar, provide visual feedback, such as a dotted outline of the toolbar. When the user moves the pointer into a hot zone of a dockable location, display the outline in its docked configuration to provide a cue to the user about what will happen when the drag operation is complete. You can also support user options such as resizing the toolbar by dragging its border or docking multiple toolbars side by side, reconfiguring their arrangement and size as necessary.</P>
<P>When supporting toolbar and status bar configuration options, avoid including controls whose functionality is not available elsewhere in the interface. In addition, always preserve the current position and size, and other state information, of toolbar and status bar configuration so that they can be restored to their state when the user reopens the window.</P>
