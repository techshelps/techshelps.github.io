<H2>Guidelines for Writing Text for Wizard Pages</H2><P>  </P>
<P>se a conversational, rather than instructional, writing style for the text you provide on the screens. The following guidelines can be used to assist you in writing the textual information:</P>
<UL><LI>Use words like "you" and "your."</LI><LI>Start most questions with phrases like "Which option do you want..." or "Would you like...." Users respond better to questions that enable them to do a task than being told what to do. For example, "Which layout do you want?" works better in wizards than "Choose a layout."</LI><LI>Use contractions and short, common words. In some cases, it may be acceptable to use slang, but you must consider localization when doing so.</LI></UL><P>  </P>
<P><B>Note</B>   <img src="XREF.gif"><BR>For more information about localization design, see Chapter 14, <BR>"Special Design Considerations."</P>
<P>  </P>
<UL><LI>Avoid using technical terminology that may be confusing to a novice user.</LI><LI>Try to use as few words as possible. For example, the question "Which style do you want for this newsletter?" could be written simply as "Which style do you want?"</LI><LI>Keep the writing clear, concise, and simple, but remember not to be condescending.</LI></UL><P></P>
