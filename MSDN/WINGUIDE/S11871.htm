<H2>Validation of Input</H2><P>  </P>
<P>Validate the user's input for a field or control in a secondary window as closely to the point of input as possible. Ideally, input is validated when it is entered for a particular field. You can either disallow the input, or use audio and visual feedback to alert the user that the data is not appropriate. You can also display a message box, particularly if the user repeatedly tries to enter invalid input. You can also reduce invalid feedback by using controls that limit selection to a specific set of choices — for example, check boxes, option buttons, drop-down lists — or preset the field with a reasonable default value.</P>
<P>If it is not possible to validate input at the point of entry, consider validating the input when the user navigates away from the control. If this is not feasible, then validate it when the transaction is committed, or whenever the user attempts to close the window. At that time, leave the window open and display a message; after the user dismisses the message, set the input focus to the control with the inappropriate data.</P>
