<H2>Properties of a Multiple Selection</H2><P>  </P>
<P>When a user selects multiple objects and requests the properties for the selection, reflect the properties of all the objects in a single property sheet or property inspector rather than opening multiple windows. Where the property values differ, display the controls associated with those values using the mixed value appearance — sometimes referred to as the indeterminate state. However, also support the display of multiple property sheets when the user displays the property sheet of the objects individually. This convention provides the user with sufficient flexibility. If your design still requires access to individual properties when the user displays the property sheet of a multiple selection, include a control such as a list box or drop-down list in the property window for switching between the properties of the objects in the set.</P>
