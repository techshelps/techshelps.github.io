<H1>Internationalization</H1><P>  </P>
<P>To successfully compete in international markets, your software must easily accommodate differences in language, culture, and hardware. This section does not cover every aspect of preparing software for the international market, but it does summarize some of the key design issues.</P>
<P>  </P>
<P><B>Note</B>   <img src="XREF.gif"><BR>For more information about the technical details for localizing your application, see the documentation included in the Win32 SDK.</P>
<P>  </P>
<P>The process of translating and adapting a software product for use in a different country is called <I>localization</I>. Like any part of the interface, include international considerations early in the design and development process. In addition to adapting screen information and documentation for international use, Help files, scenarios, templates, models, and sample files should all be a part of your localization planning.</P>
<P>Language is not the only relevant factor when localizing an interface. Several countries can share a common language but have different conventions for expressing information. In addition, some countries can share a language but use a different keyboard convention.</P>
<P>A more subtle factor to consider when preparing software for international markets is cultural differences. For example, users in the U.S. may recognize a rounded mail box with a flag on the side as an icon for a mail program, but this image may not be recognized by users in other countries. Sounds and their associated meanings may also vary from country to country.</P>
<P>It is helpful to create a supplemental document for your localization team that covers the terms and other translatable elements your software uses, and describes where they occur. Documenting changes between versions saves time in preparing new releases. Appendix E of this guide provides recommended translations of many words used in the Windows interface.</P>
