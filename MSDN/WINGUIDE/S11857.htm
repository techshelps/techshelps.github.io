<H3>Moving Windows</H3><P>  </P>
<P>The user can move a window either by dragging its title bar using the mouse or pen or by using the Move command on the window's pop-up menu. On most configurations, an outline representation moves with the pointer during the operation, and the window is redisplayed in the new location after the completion of the move. (The system also provides a display property setting that redraws the window dynamically as it is moved.) After choosing the Move command, the user can move the window with the keyboard interface by using arrow keys and pressing the ENTER key to end the operation and establish the window's new location. Never allow the user to reposition a window so that it cannot be accessed.</P>
<P>A window need not be active before the user can move it. The action of moving the window implicitly activates it. </P>
<P>Moving a window may clip or reveal information shown in the window. In addition, activation can affect the view state of the window — for example, the current selection can be displayed. However, when the user moves a window, avoid making any changes to the content being viewed in that window. </P>
