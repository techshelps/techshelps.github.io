<h2><a name="_wceddk_the_.5b.drivers.5c.pcmcia.5c.detect.5d_.key"></a>The [Drivers\PCMCIA\Detect] Key</h2>
<p>
The<b> </b>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Drivers\PCMCIA\Detect key contains numbered subkeys that the Device Manager uses when trying to auto-detect PC Cards. Each subkey specifies a device driver DLL and a corresponding detection function that the Device Driver uses to determine if the driver can recognize the inserted PC Card. These detection functions are only invoked when a PC Card has no Plug-and-Play ID, or when there is no subkey under the Drivers\PCMCIA\ key corresponding to the card's Plug-and-Play ID.</p>
<p>
The subkeys under <b>Detect</b> are two digit integers that determine the order the Device Manager uses to try detection functions. The Device Manager stops trying detection functions when one of them returns a value indicating a successful detection.  For example, the DLL listed in the subkey "20" would be tried after the one listed in the subkey "19", provided that no suitable driver had yet been found. This subkey integer is arbitrary and is typically assigned by an installable device driver's installation routine. The two values within these subkeys are described in this table.</p>
