<p>
This illustration shows the relationship between an installable device driver and other system components:</p>
<p>
<img src="sysarch.gif" border=0></p>
<p>
Here are brief descriptions of those components and their interactions.</p>
<h2>User Application</h2>
<p>
Any application that uses a peripheral device. Access to a peripheral is through the filesystem and the special files which expose the services of a peripheral.</p>
<h2>Kernel</h2>
<p>
The core of the Windows CE operating system. The kernel provides basic services to the application. To support installable device drivers, the kernel handles redirecting the application's Win32 file I/O function calls to the appropriate entry points in the Installable Device Driver.</p>
<h2>Device Manager</h2>
<p>
Device manager is a special program which is involved in the loading and unloading of installable device drivers. For more information, see the <a href="devmgr.htm">Device Manager</a> chapter.</p>
<h2>Installable Device Driver</h2>
<p>
This is the DLL that you will create to manage a peripheral device. It exposes Win32 file I/O functions to applications, and implements those functions by using hardware that is built into the Windows CE platform to communicate with its peripheral device.</p>
<h2>Built-In Device Driver</h2>
<p>
A device driver supplied by the Windows CE platform's manufacturer. The built-in device drivers used by installable device drivers are generally drivers for various sorts of I/O ports, such as serial ports or PC Card slots.</p>
<h2>Windows CE Platform's Hardware</h2>
<p>
The hardware which makes up the Windows CE platform. Installable device drivers generally use the I/O ports on the Windows CE platform, while the kernel can use all of the platform's hardware.</p>
<h2>Peripheral Device</h2>
<p>
The device being managed by the installable device driver.</p>
