<h2><a name="_wceddk_printer_drivers"></a>Printer Drivers</h2>
<p>
Windows CE versions 2.0 and later include support for printing. The printing model used by Windows CE is a subset of the printing model defined by Win32. Only a small number of the graphics driver functions defined by Win32 for printer drivers are required in printer drivers for Windows CE. Because Windows CE printer drivers are structurally similar to Win32 printer drivers, a detailed discussion of the architecture and implementation details of printer drivers is not included in this document. See the Windows NT Device Driver Kit for more information about Win32 printer drivers.</p>
<p>
The Windows CE display system (GDI) does most of the work involved in printing. When a document is printed, GDI gets a device context from the printer driver, and calls the display driver to render the document in that context—the printer driver does not have to render the document itself. GDI then calls the printer driver again to send the resulting bitmap to the printer. For performance reasons, GDI renders the document in bands-horizontal sections of the document-and makes several calls to the printer driver to send the rendered bands to the printer.</p>
<p>
Windows CE printer drivers are only required to implement those Win32 graphics driver functions necessary for setting up the printer, starting and ending print jobs, and copying rendered strips to the printer. Internally, the printer driver is also responsible for converting the bitmap data from GDI's bitmap format into whatever format is required by the printer.</p>
<p>
Windows CE printer drivers are compiled as DLLs. They must export the <a href="ddkref_238.htm"><b>DrvEnableDriver</b></a> function.</p>
