<h2><a name="_wceddk_accelerated_line_segment_function"></a>Accelerated line segment function</h2>
<p>
Note that if an accelerated line draw function is implemented, it is obliged to draw lines with sub-pixel precision (the emulated function provided also does this).</p>
<p>
The function whose address was placed in pLineParms-&gt;pLine is called once for each line segment with the start pixel on the destination surface defined by pLineParms-&gt;xStart and pLineParms-&gt;yStart.</p>
<p>
The bresenham parameters for the line are passed in pLineParms-&gt;dM and pLineParms-&gt;dN, and the actual number of pixels to draw is indicated in pLineParms-&gt;cPels.</p>
<p>
The octant which the line should be drawn in is defined by pLineParms-&gt;iDir which contains values as follows:</p>
<p>
<i>[ Insert graphic showing octant numbers, which are from 0-7, in clockwise order, with 0 being immediately under the positive x-axis. Remember to show that the positive y-axis points downward. ]</i></p>
