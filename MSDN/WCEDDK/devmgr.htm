<h2><a name="_wceddk_device_manager"></a>Device Manager</h2>
<p>
This section discusses the Device Manager, its role within the Windows CE operating system, and its responsibilities for managing installable device drivers.</p>
<p>
As mentioned in the topic <a href="overview_2.htm">System Architecture for Installable Device Drivers</a>, the Device Manager is involved in the loading and unloading of installable device drivers. The Device Manager is a user-level process that is normally always running on a Windows CE platform. The Device Manager interacts with the Windows CE kernel, the registry, and with installable device driver DLLs.</p>
