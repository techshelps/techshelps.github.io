<h2><a name="_wceddk_gpesurf_class"></a>GPESurf Class</h2>
<p>
The GPESurf class represents a surface which may have been allocated by GDI or by the driver. It may also retain its pixels in system or video memory (if there is such a distinction on your device). Generally GPESurfs are created for all surfaces either when the driver allocates the memory (for example in response to <b>DrvCreateDeviceBitmap</b>) or when the driver encounters them (for example the source bitmap in a Blt operation where GDI allocated the surface).</p>
<p>
If GDI allocated the surface, the Drv function will create a temporary surface (TmpGPESurf class) which is a derivative of the GPESurf class. This is just a wrapper around the SURFOBJ which GPE created. The TmpGPESurf object only persists for the duration of the Drv call.</p>
<p>
The GPESurf class provides a number of methods for the driver to retrieve a pointer to the pixel data, the pixel format, stride, height, and width. GPESurf also retains a flag to indicate whether the data is stored in video memory (verified by a call to GPESurf::InVideoMemory() ), and a local flag which determines whether the memory should be de-allocated when the GPESurf is deleted.</p>
<p>
The driver writer will typically want to create a new surface class based on the GPESurf class for video memory allocations. Refer to <i>Surface Allocation</i> for details of the GPE::AllocateSurface method.</p>
