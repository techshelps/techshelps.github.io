<p>
The Windows CE Device Driver Kit contains several sample device drivers, which illustrate how to write installable device drivers for several types of devices. If you are implementing an installable device driver for a device that is similar to one of those, you can base your driver on the appropriate sample driver's source code. The sample device drivers are:</p>

<u>Sample driver</u><u>Description</u> </p>
<p>
<i>PCMCIA</i></p>
<p>
16550mod An example client driver for an I/O type PC Card. A sample application included with this driver opens, writes, reads, and closes the device by making calls to the 16550MOD driver. </p>
<p>
Pager An example pager PC Card driver supporting the Motorola NewsCard pager. A sample application is also included. </p>
<p>
Ramcard An example driver for memory type PC Card. Two sample applications for writing to and reading from the card are also included. </p>
<p>
Cardtest An example driver and test to test a block of memory on a PC Card memory card, or to dump attribute memory or tuple information from a PC Card.</p>
<p>
SERIAL</p>
<p>
GPS An example serial-based client PC Card driver based on a GPS PC Card. </p>
<p>
TTY An example serial-based client PC Card driver based on an example TTY terminal.</p>
<p>
NDIS:source code compatable with win95/nt.  recompile as a DLL and it should just work.</p>
