<h2><a name="_wceddk_ndis_network_drivers"></a>NDIS Network Drivers</h2>
<p>
Windows CE 2.0 and later support network drivers based on a subset of the Network Driver Interface Specification (NDIS) model used by Windows NT. The full specification allows several types of network drivers; Windows CE only supports Miniport drivers. There is no support for legacy or monolithic network drivers.</p>
<p>
For Miniport drivers, Windows CE is source code compatable with Windows NT. With a few exceptions, the NDIS APIs supported by Windows CE are exactly like those supported by Windows NT. The <a href="ddkref.htm">Windows CE Device Driver Reference</a> contains a complete list of NDIS APIs supported by Windows CE, and documentation for the APIs which differ from their Windows NT counterparts.</p>
<p>
Because Windows CE Miniport drivers are source code compatable with Miniport drivers for Windows NT, this guide does not discuss the details of how to write a Miniport driver. For information on how to write a Miniport driver, see the Windows NT Device Driver Kit.</p>
