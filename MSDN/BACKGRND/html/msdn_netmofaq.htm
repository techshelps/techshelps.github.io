<h2><a name="netmofaq_general"></a>General Overview</h2>
<p>
<b>What is Microsoft NetMeeting 2.0?</b></p>
<p>
Microsoft NetMeeting 2.0 delivers a complete Internet-conferencing solution for real-time communication and collaboration over the Internet or corporate intranets. NetMeeting 2.0 is the successor to NetMeeting 1.0, the leading real-time, multimedia communications client for the Internet, which first shipped with Microsoft Internet Explorer 3.0. The new version of NetMeeting offers new features and capabilities to make the product easier to use, more powerful, faster, and more manageable. Support for the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) H.323 and T.120 standards for audio and video conferencing, and multipoint data conferencing, respectively, enables cross-vendor, cross-product, and cross-platform interoperability. NetMeeting 2.0 includes the following key components:
<ul type=disc>
<li>
<b>Standards-based multipoint data conferencing.</b> Users of NetMeeting can collaborate and share information with two or more conference participants in real time. During a conference, users can share applications on their computer and work together by allowing other conference participants to see the same information on their screens, thereby facilitating the review, editing, and presentation of information. In addition, users can exchange and mark up graphics and draw diagrams with the electronic whiteboard, communicate using written text with the NetMeeting chat program, and send files to other conference participants. The NetMeeting multipoint data conferencing capability is based on the ITU T.120 standard.<br><br></li>
<li>
<b>Standards-based video conferencing.</b> With a video-capture card and camera, users of NetMeeting can send and receive video images for face-to-face communication during a conference. The switchable audio and video feature of NetMeeting allows users to switch among participants they communicate with during a meeting. In addition, NetMeeting also offers support for Intel MMX technology, improving video and audio performance during a call. The video-conferencing capability of NetMeeting is based on the ITU H.323 standard.<br><br></li>
<li>
<b>Standards-based multipoint data conferencing.</b> Using a sound card, microphone and speakers, participants using NetMeeting can talk to friends, family, and business associates over the Internet and corporate intranets. Internet phone discussions can be enhanced using data- and video-conferencing capabilities. The Internet telephony capability of NetMeeting is based on the ITU H.323 standard.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<b>What's new in Microsoft NetMeeting 2.0?</b></p>
<p>
There are four key areas of enhancements that are new in NetMeeting 2.0. These include support for Internet telephony and video-conferencing capabilities based on the ITU H.323 standard, support for the Microsoft Windows® NT® 4.0 operating system, significant user interface enhancements to make the product even easier to use, and platform improvements available through an updated software development kit (SDK). The most visible change in NetMeeting 2.0 is, in fact, visual: Using a digital video camera, you can now see the people you're talking with over the Internet or corporate intranets, communicating face-to-face with family, friends, and business acquaintances.</p>
<p>
<b>What are some of the scenarios in which NetMeeting can be used?</b></p>
<p>
NetMeeting will change the way people communicate and collaborate on the Internet and corporate intranets by expanding the situations in which the PC can be used. Possible scenarios include these:
<ul type=disc>
<li>
<b>Virtual meetings.</b> NetMeeting allows users to be in different locations and conduct meetings as if everyone were in the same room.<br><br></li>
<li>
<b>Document collaboration.</b> NetMeeting allows users to collaborate on documents or information in real time.<br><br></li>
<li>
<b>Customer service.</b> NetMeeting allows users to communicate directly with customer service from a Web site or to be able to see graphic information as part of a telephone call.<br><br></li>
<li>
<b>Telecommuting.</b> NetMeeting allows users to extend their reach while on the road or in remote locations beyond file sharing or e-mail by taking advantage of data-conferencing capabilities.<br><br></li>
<li>
<b>Distance learning.</b> NetMeeting allows presentations or information to be disseminated to numerous people at the same time over the Internet or intranets.<br><br></li>
<li>
<b>Technical support.</b> NetMeeting allows support organizations not only to see the scenario or situation on a remote user’s computer, but also to correct a problem during a support call without physically going to the remote PC.</li>
</ul>
<p>
How is Microsoft NetMeeting 2.0 different from other Internet phone and conferencing products?</p>
<p>
NetMeeting 2.0 is the first real-time communications solution for the Internet that provides standards-based audio, video, and multipoint data-conferencing capabilities. It offers both a complete, easy-to-use client, and an open, extensible platform for third parties to build or integrate real-time communications with their products and services.</p>
<p>
There are four key areas that set NetMeeting apart:
<ul type=disc>
<li>
<b>Standards based.</b> NetMeeting supports international communication, conferencing, and directory standards including the ITU H.323, ITU T.120, and the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP). This enables interoperability for Internet telephony, video conferencing and data conferencing, and compatibility with standards-based products and services.<br><br></li>
<li>
<b>Multipoint data conferencing.</b> NetMeeting offers multipoint data conferencing, enabling you to work jointly by connecting with multiple people during a conference to share information. Most other conferencing products only support point-to-point conferencing, allowing just two people to communicate together. With NetMeeting, you can share applications, use the whiteboard and chat, and send files during a conference with multiple people.<br><br></li>
<li>
<b>True application sharing.</b> NetMeeting lets you share application windows running on your computer during a virtual meeting. This enables you to work together in real time with others, allowing all participants in a meeting to see the same information, enhancing the way that people communicate. In addition, NetMeeting supports real-time collaboration, allowing others in the meeting to take control of the shared application, and letting them manipulate the contents of the shared application. Because no changes are required to the shared applications to support real-time collaboration, you can share virtually any Windows-based application.<br><br></li>
<li>
<b>Broad industry support.</b> NetMeeting features the broadest industry support of any conferencing product or platform. More than 60 leading industry vendors participated in the announcement of NetMeeting 2.0 and are building products and offering services that enhance the use of NetMeeting for customers.</li>
</ul>
<p>
If you want to read more about how NetMeeting compares, see the <i>NetMeeting Reviewer's Guide</i> (<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/netmeeting/press/revguide.htm">http://www.microsoft.com/netmeeting/press/revguide.htm</a>).</p>
<p>
What are the different communication and conferencing standards that NetMeeting 2.0 supports?</p>
<p>
There are a number of industry standards that have been ratified or proposed through the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) or the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF). In brief, these standards include the following:
<ul type=disc>
<li>
<b>T.120 (ITU):</b> Set of protocols for transport-independent, multipoint data conferencing. Includes application-layer protocols for common application purposes.<br><br></li>
<li>
<b>H.323 (ITU):</b> Set of protocols for audio, video and data conferencing over Transport Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) networks. Includes real-time protocol/real-time control protocol (RTP/RTCP). The H.323 standard integrates with T.120, to address audio, video, and data conferencing on the network.<br><br></li>
<li>
<b>RTP/RTCP (IETF):</b> Real-time protocol (RTP) and real-time control protocol (RTCP). Packet format for sending real-time information across the Internet.<br><br></li>
<li>
<b>LDAP (IETF):</b> Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP). Protocol for accessing directory information.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<b>Why is support of standards important?</b></p>
<p>
Broad support of standards ensures interoperability among solutions from different vendors. For example, the telephone industry uses a set of international standards to ensure that a person making a telephone call can connect to another person regardless of the manufacturer of either phone handset. Support for standards for audio, data, and video conferencing will provide the same transparent interoperability that customers expect. In addition, support of H.323 and T.120 enables interoperability with other standards-based products including servers and gateways, enhancing the capabilities available to users of NetMeeting.</p>
<p>
<b>What tools or information are available to help organizations deploy NetMeeting?</b></p>
<p>
To help organizations deploy NetMeeting, Microsoft has prepared the NetMeeting 2.0 Resource Kit, a companion technical information resource for system administrators. The kit provides detailed information, based on customer feedback, to help administrators deploy NetMeeting in their organizations. This includes how to configure the firewall, optimize bandwidth, and take advantage of the Windows 95 and Windows NT 4.0 operating-system policy mechanisms to remotely administer and control the features and functionality of NetMeeting. The NetMeeting Resource Kit can be downloaded from the NetMeeting Web site (<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/netmeeting/">http://www.microsoft.com/netmeeting/</a>). In addition, organizations can deploy the Microsoft Internet Locator Server to provide directory services for NetMeeting on the corporate intranet, making it easy for users within the company to find and connect to each other.</p>
<p>
<b>What is the Internet Locator Server (formerly known as the User Location Server)?</b></p>
<p>
The Internet Locator Server (ILS) makes it easy for NetMeeting users to find other users of NetMeeting to connect to and communicate with on the Internet or corporate intranet. It provides a way to connect a user’s name with a unique network address (IP address in the case of TCP/IP on the Internet) just as a phone number connects to a person at a specific telephone. The ILS directory addresses the problem in which IP addresses are normally dynamic and assigned to a computer each time it connects to the Internet, providing up-to-date information that ensures an accurate way to contact other users. Internet service providers can set up their own ILS and provide a way for their customers and visitors to their site to find each other easily, and organizations can deploy an ILS on their intranet to support NetMeeting users on their network. Microsoft has submitted a specification on the ILS to the IETF as a proposed enhancement to the LDAP directory protocol standard; it is expected the specification will be integrated into the upcoming LDAP version 3.0 standard. To learn more about ILS, see the NetMeeting Web site (<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/netmeeting/">http://www.microsoft.com/netmeeting/</a>).</p>
<p>
<b>What is the NetMeeting Software Development Kit?</b></p>
<p>
The NetMeeting SDK provides application programming interfaces (APIs) that allow conferencing capabilities to be integrated with other applications using C, C++, or Microsoft Visual Basic® . In addition, the NetMeeting SDK will include an ActiveX™ control for conferencing, allowing Web site creators to integrate conferencing functionality directly on a Web page. For example, developers can extend the functionality of NetMeeting to add a business-card exchange capability or an answering machine feature, or to add conferencing capabilities to applications using macro-based scripting languages. Web site creators can integrate the ActiveX control with ActiveX scripting solutions such as JavaScript and Visual Basic, Scripting Edition to add conferencing capabilities to their Web site. For more information about the NetMeeting SDK, see the NetMeeting Web site (<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/netmeeting/">http://www.microsoft.com/netmeeting/</a>).</p>
<p>
<b>What are some examples of how the NetMeeting SDK can be used?</b></p>
<p>
There are a number of ways that the NetMeeting SDK can be used to open new market opportunities for third-party software developers, solution providers, and Web-site professionals. These include integrating real-time, multipoint data-conferencing capabilities into existing conferencing solutions such as video conferencing, developing custom-conferencing solutions to enhance service offerings, integrating conferencing functionality into Web pages, and extending the features of NetMeeting.</p>
<p>

<h2><a name="netmofaq_product"></a>Product Features</h2>
<p>
<b>What are the main features of NetMeeting 2.0?</b></p>
<p>
The main features include point-to-point Internet telephony (audio conferencing), point-to-point video conferencing, multipoint application sharing, whiteboard, file transfer, chat, and shared clipboard. Support for multipoint data conferencing allows people to communicate and collaborate as a group in real time, even though they may be located at different sites.</p>
<p>
<b>What can users do with the Internet telephony capability?</b></p>
<p>
The real-time voice capability lets users talk to another person in a conference. This feature provides Internet phone services, allowing users to call and communicate with family and friends over the Internet.</p>
<p>
<b>What can users do with the video conferencing capability?</b></p>
<p>
With a Video for Windows–compatible video capture card and camera, you can send and receive video images during a conference allowing you to hold face-to-face meetings over the Internet. Even if you don't have a video camera connected to your PC, you can still receive video images during a conference.</p>
<p>
<b>What can users do with application sharing?</b></p>
<p>
Application sharing enables users to share a program running on one computer with other people in a conference. NetMeeting works with existing Windows operating system–based programs, allowing applications to be shared transparently without requiring any special knowledge of conferencing capabilities. When an application has been shared, the other people in the conference see the actions that are performed as the person sharing the application works on the program (that is, editing content, scrolling through information, and so on.). In addition, the person sharing the application can choose to collaborate, allowing other people in the conference to take turns editing or controlling the application. Each member of the conference does not need to have the given application on his or her system—only the person sharing the application. Examples of how the application-sharing capability in NetMeeting can be used to improve the way people communicate over the Internet in real time would include sharing a word-processing program to collaborate on a document; sharing a programming-language application to work with others on creating a program; sharing a spreadsheet program to work together on verifying and updating information; or sharing a web browser to enable collaborative browsing.</p>
<p>
The application sharing protocol in NetMeeting was submitted by Microsoft and PictureTel to the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) as an enhancement to the ITU T.120 standard and has successfully cleared the fully "determined" stage by the ITU Study Group 16. The technology was previously known as T.SHARE while in draft form, and now is titled T.128. In addition, by inclusion as part of the T.120 standard, support for T.128 by conferencing vendors enables cross-vendor and cross-platform interoperability for application sharing available in compliant conferencing products. T.128 is expected to pass the ITU Study Group 16’s "decision" stage in January 1998 when it will become a fully approved part of the T.120 specification.</p>
<p>
<b>What can users do with the shared clipboard feature?</b></p>
<p>
The shared clipboard allows a user to exchange the contents of the clipboard with other participants in a conference. This allows, for example, a user to copy information from a local application into the contents of a shared program as part of a group collaboration. This capability provides seamless exchange of information between applications that have been shared and local applications, providing the familiar cut, copy, and paste operations for use in a data conference.</p>
<p>
<b>What can users do with file-transfer capability?</b></p>
<p>
The file-transfer capability in NetMeeting enables users to send a file to a specific participant or all the participants in a conference. You can use the right mouse button to select a person’s name in the conference and choose to send him or her a file, or you can drag a file into the Microsoft NetMeeting window and have a file automatically sent to each participant in a conference. The file transfer occurs in the background as everyone continues sharing a program, using the whiteboard, and chatting. Users have the option of accepting or declining the receipt of a file being sent to them. The file-transfer capability in NetMeeting is fully compliant with the T.127 standard.</p>
<p>
<b>What can users do with the whiteboard?</b></p>
<p>
The whiteboard program is a multipage, multiuser drawing application that enables users to sketch an organization chart or a flowchart, draw a diagram, or display other graphic contents. The whiteboard is object-oriented (vs. pixel-oriented), allowing users to move and manipulate the contents by clicking and dragging with the mouse. With a remote pointer or highlighting tool, users can point out specific contents or sections of shared pages. This capability extends the application-sharing feature of NetMeeting by supporting ad hoc collaboration on a common drawing surface.</p>
<p>
<b>What can users do with the chat feature?</b></p>
<p>
Chat provides a text-based mechanism to communicate with participants in a conference. Chat can be used to communicate about common ideas or topics with fellow conference participants or to record meeting notes and action items as part of a collaborative process. You can even use the "whisper" mode to send a private message to another person in the conference.</p>

<h2><a name="netmofaq_video"></a>Video Conferencing</h2>
<p>
What are some of the ways that I can use the videophone capability of NetMeeting 2.0?</p>
<p>
Now you can see and hear family and friends around the world through a local Internet connection. For example, grandparents a continent away can use NetMeeting 2.0 to see their grandchildren's first steps the moment they happen, and all family members can keep in more intimate touch with face-to-face conversations.</p>
<p>
With NetMeeting installed on local desktops, people in organizations can use video conferencing to communicate more effectively with each other or with business associates in remote offices or other locations. This is a major benefit, especially for organizations with personnel located in different buildings.</p>
<p>
<b>Which video-capture cards or cameras are compatible with NetMeeting 2.0?</b></p>
<p>
NetMeeting 2.0 supports most video capture cards and cameras that are compatible with Microsoft Video for Windows capture drivers. This includes commonly available video hardware for Windows 95 and Windows NT 4.0. See the netmeet.txt readme file for issues with specific cameras.</p>
<p>
<b>What types of cameras work best with NetMeeting 2.0?</b></p>
<p>
The following types of cameras tend to give better performance with NetMeeting 2.0:
<ul type=disc>
<li>
<b>Cameras that operate with video capture cards generally perform better than parallel port cameras.</b> Cameras that connect to a video capture card use less of your computer's processor than cameras that connect through your computer's parallel port. However, parallel port cameras generally cost less than video-capture cards, although most video capture cards allow you to plug in a regular camcorder.<br><br></li>
<li>
<b>Black-and-white cameras generally perform better than color cameras</b><i>.</i> Because color cameras must send more data, black-and-white cameras will generally offer better performance and clarity than color cameras.<br><br></li>
<li>
<b>Bidirectional parallel ports perform better than unidirectional ports.</b> Computers with a bidirectional extended capabilities port (ECP) or enhanced parallel port (EPP) perform noticeably better with parallel video cameras than computers with a unidirectional parallel port.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<b>What type of connection can I use for video?</b></p>
<p>
Like NetMeeting audio, the product's video feature is designed to work over Transport Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) connections only, and can <i>only</i> be used to conference with one other person. For example, you can use video over a dial-up connection to your Internet Service Provider (ISP) using a 28.8kbps (or higher) modem.</p>
<p>
<b>How can I improve video performance and quality?</b></p>
<p>
Here are a few suggestions for improving video performance and quality:
<ul type=disc>
<li>
<b>Do not run NetMeeting with another program that uses video.</b> You should not run another program that uses video while you're running NetMeeting 2.0.<br><br></li>
<li>
<b>With some cameras, low light slows down the computer.</b> If your camera is located in a dark room, your computer might run very slowly with the My Video window open. Some cameras need to use a lot of the processor's power in order to capture video in low light. To remedy this, increase the amount of light.<br><br></li>
<li>
<b>Minimizing the local My Video window can improve performance.</b> You might experience better video quality and performance if you minimize (or hide) your local My Video window during a call.<br><br></li>
<li>
<b>Use 16-bit or 24-bit color for best results.</b> Video performs best when your color depth (color palette) is set to the maximum possible setting for your monitor. To set color depth, open the <b>Control Panel</b> and double-click <b>Display</b> , then click the <b>Settings</b> tab and set the <b>Color Palette</b> to the highest setting available.</li>
</ul>
<p>
How is the video-conferencing support in NetMeeting 2.0 different from other video-phone solutions available for use on the Internet?</p>
<p>
The videophone capability in NetMeeting 2.0 conforms to the H.323 standard, providing a video-conferencing solution that operates with other H.323-compatible products and services. Many existing videophone solutions are proprietary, so users can only connect and communicate with people who purchased the same product.</p>
<p>
In addition, you can now enjoy higher quality audio and video than has traditionally been available over the Internet. Improved quality is possible through NetMeeting support for the H.323 audio and video codecs (G.723.1 for audio, and H.263 for video) used to send and receive audio and video over low-bandwidth connections. Support for Intel MMX technology enhances the performance of video during a call.</p>
<p>
If an organization does not want to use video (or audio) over its corporate network, is there a way to centrally manage and control usage?</p>
<p>
Yes. NetMeeting 2.0 supports the system policy feature in Windows 95 and Windows NT 4.0, enabling information systems (IS) organizations to centrally deploy and manage the client capabilities of NetMeeting for their users on the network. Refer to the <i>Microsoft NetMeeting 2.0 Resource Kit</i> (<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/netmeeting/reskit/">http://www.microsoft.com/netmeeting/reskit/</a>) for information on how to use NetMeeting system policies.</p>

<h2><a name="netmofaq_confer"></a>Conferencing Standards</h2>
<p>
<b>What is H.323?</b></p>
<p>
H.323 is an International Telecommunications Union (ITU) standard that sets forth a specification for terminals (PCs), equipment, and services for multimedia communication over networks that do not provide a guaranteed quality of service (for example, guaranteed bandwidth). H.323 terminals and equipment can carry real-time video, voice, and data, or any combination of these elements, including video telephony. Products that use H.323 for audio and video let you interconnect and communicate with other people over the Internet, just as people using different makes and models of telephones can communicate over the public switched telephone network (PSTN).</p>
<p>
<b>What additional standards does H.323 support?</b></p>
<p>
For low bandwidth use, the H.323 standard specifies standard codecs for audio (G.723) and for video (H.263) that enable H.323 products to send and receive voice and video images. Also, H.323 specifies that data-conferencing capabilities should conform to the T.120 protocol, providing a set of standards-based conferencing features to enhance audio and video conferencing. More than 120 leading companies in the industry publicly announced their intent to support and implement H.323 in their products and services. This broad support establishes H.323 as the leading solution for audio and video conferencing over the Internet. </p>
<p>
<b>What is T.120?</b></p>
<p>
The ITU T.120 standard is made up of a suite of communication and application layer protocols developed and approved by the international computer and telecommunications industries. These protocols enable developers to create compatible products and services for real-time, multipoint data connections and conferencing. T.120-based applications enable many users to participate in conferencing sessions over different types of networks and connections. Depending on the type of T.120 product, they can make connections, transmit and receive data, and collaborate using compatible data-conferencing features such as application sharing, conferencing whiteboard, and file transfer.</p>
<p>
<b>Where can I read more about the conferencing standards?</b></p>
<p>
The NetMeeting 2.0 Resource Kit provides additional information about the conferencing standards used by NetMeeting. You can download the resource kit from the Microsoft NetMeeting Web site (<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/netmeeting/">http://www.microsoft.com/netmeeting/</a>).</p>

Where can users obtain more information about the international standards used in NetMeeting?</p>
<p>
There are several organizations in the industry responsible for defining, approving, and communicating standards. Following are some of the key organizations:
<ul type=disc>
<li>
<b>International Telecommunications Union (ITU).</b> The ITU, headquartered in Geneva, Switzerland, is an international organization through which governments and the private sector coordinate global telecom networks and services. ITU activities include the coordination, development, regulation, and standardization of telecommunications, and the organization of regional and world telecom events. More information can be found on the International Telecommunications Union Web site (http://www.itu.ch/).<br><br></li>
<li>
