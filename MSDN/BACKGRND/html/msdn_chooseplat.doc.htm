<h1><a name="msdn_chooseplat.doc"></a>Choosing the Best Windows Platform: A Corporate Perspective</h1>
<p>
Microsoft Corporation</p>
<p>
July 1997</p>
<h2>Executive Summary</h2>
<p>
The goal of this document is to help business customers find the best combination of Microsoft® Windows® operating systems and hardware platforms—today and for the future. To do this, we outline deployment guidelines for a variety of situations and then provide supporting information to describe how we arrived at these recommendations. Of course, every business situation is unique and systems should be thoroughly tested before deploying.</p>
<p class=indent>
<b>Note</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you have a deployment plan in progress, we recommend staying the course.</p>
<p>
Microsoft's most important recommendation is to move to <i>32-bit Windows–based applications</i>. These applications offer greater reliability, faster performance, lower cost of ownership, better user productivity, and increased security than older 16-bit Windows–based applications. These applications are also poised to take full advantage of new hardware and operating system innovations.</p>
<p>
To choose the best Windows operating system, the Microsoft strategy is to provide customers with a full range of innovative and high-quality products. Each operating system offers complementary features, price points, and system requirements. Software and hardware are also designed to be manageable, lowering the total cost of ownership. That said, Microsoft believes that when businesses have a choice, they are better suited over the long term moving to the forthcoming Microsoft Windows NT® Workstation 5.0. With increased reliability, security, and performance, we believe Microsoft Windows NT Workstation 5.0 will become the premier desktop operating system for business.</p>
<h4>Windows 32-bit Operating Systems</h4>
<ul type=disc>
<li>
Microsoft Windows 95 is the easiest path to a 32-bit desktop operating system with the broadest hardware and application compatibility, and the lowest system requirements. Windows 98—an evolutionary upgrade from Windows 95—will continue to be the easiest path to a 32-bit desktop and will make computing easier, more reliable, faster, and fully integrated with the Internet. Windows 98 is currently in beta testing and is expected to ship in the first quarter of 1998.<br><br></li>
<li>
Microsoft Windows NT Workstation 4.0 is the most powerful 32-bit desktop operating system with a focus on reliability, manageability, security, networking, and performance. Windows NT Workstation 5.0—a major upgrade to all versions of Windows—will be the premier 32-bit desktop operating system for businesses.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Windows-based Hardware Platforms</h4>
<ul type=disc>
<li>
<b>Windows-based terminals, </b>expected to ship in 1998, are a new super-thin Windows family client device. They are compelling Windows-based replacements for "dumb" terminals. In addition, Windows NT Hydra software can be used to deliver 32-bit applications to legacy or remote desktops until hardware and applications can be upgraded to run on new Net PCs or PCs.<p class=tl>
For more information about Windows NT Hydra, see the article <a href="msdn_hydrawp.htm">"Microsoft Windows NT Hydra: The Benefits of Windows with the Low Cost of a Terminal."</a></P></li>
<li>
PCs are ideal for almost any computing situation; they range from subnotebook portables to advanced 3-D graphics workstations. They are extremely powerful, flexible, and expandable devices. Network PCs are a new type of simple, easy-to-manage Windows-based PC for the corporate environment. They are ideal for Information Technology (IT) managers who want to deploy local processing, local storage, and a familiar user environment, but not the full flexibility of a traditional Windows-based PC.</li>
</ul>
<p>
For businesses purchasing new systems or upgrading Windows 95 and Windows 3.<i>x</i>–based systems, Microsoft makes the following deployment recommendations in Table 1. Details for arriving at these recommendations are provided later in this article.</p>

* To run productivity, database, browser, and other common applications, "Windows 98–optimized" means using an Intel® 486, or equivalent or higher, microprocessor; 16 megabytes (MB) of RAM; and compatible hardware and software. "Windows NT Workstation–optimized" means using an Intel Pentium, or equivalent or higher, microprocessor; 32 MB of RAM; and compatible hardware and software.</p>
<h2>Choosing the Best Windows Operating System</h2>
<p>
The Microsoft Windows family of operating systems features two desktop product lines: Windows 95 (to be succeeded by Windows 98) and Windows NT Workstation 4.0 (to be succeeded by Windows NT Workstation 5.0). Although this document covers these fully featured desktop operating systems, a third Windows family operating system—Windows CE—is customized for specialized devices such as handheld PCs, telephones, and consumer devices.</p>
<h3>The Windows Desktop Product Family Overview</h3>
<p>
As complementary products, all Windows-based operating systems are designed to work in mixed environments. They share the same graphical user and programming interfaces. They also help reduce total cost of ownership (TCO) by supporting the templates, policies, and features of the Microsoft <a href="msdn_zerowin.htm">"Zero Administration Initiative for Windows."</a></p>
<h4>Windows 95 and Windows 98</h4>
<ul type=disc>
<li>
<b>Windows 95.</b> The easiest path to a 32-bit desktop operating system. In addition to running 32-bit Windows–based applications, Windows 95 is the best choice for running 16-bit Windows–based and MS-DOS–based applications, giving corporate customers the ability to run older applications. System requirements for Windows 95 are more modest than Windows NT Workstation 4.0, allowing customers to run on systems with 16 MB of RAM or more. Windows 95 includes several important features for mobile users, such as power management and Plug and Play. Finally, Windows 95 runs on a broader range of hardware devices and components than Windows NT Workstation 4.0.<br><br></li>
<li>
<b>Windows 98.</b> The exciting evolutionary upgrade to Windows 95. Building on Windows 95 innovation as the easiest path to a 32-bit desktop, Windows 98 will make computing easier, more reliable, faster, and fully integrated with the Internet. It will define cutting-edge capabilities, such as enabling powerful new hardware technologies and entertainment platforms, while at the same time maintaining the best support for older Windows-based applications and technologies. For corporations, Windows 98 will provide new manageability features that help reduce TCO. Windows 98 will be the fastest platform for running the new Microsoft Internet Explorer 4.0.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Windows NT Workstation 4.0 and Windows NT Workstation 5.0</h4>
<ul type=disc>
<li>
<b>Windows NT Workstation 4.0.</b> With a focus on reliability, manageability, security, networking, and performance, Windows NT Workstation 4.0 is the most powerful 32-bit desktop operating system. Its multithreaded, multitasking architecture is designed to run 32-bit Windows–based applications more reliably and securely than other Windows operating systems while also supporting some MS-DOS–based and 16-bit Windows–based applications. Windows NT Workstation 4.0 scales to a variety of platforms and processors—from newer laptops to multiple-CPU graphics workstations. Windows NT Workstation 4.0 offers industrial-strength security with complete protection down to the file level. Windows NT Workstation 4.0 is also designed for speed, offering a <i>significantly</i> better price/performance ratio than UNIX-based desktop systems. Windows NT Workstation 4.0 desktops are easier and less costly to manage than Windows 3.<i>x</i>–based systems.<br><br></li>
<li>
<b>Windows NT Workstation 5.0.</b> A major upgrade to all versions of Windows, Windows NT Workstation 5.0 will be the premier 32-bit desktop operating system for businesses. It will incorporate innovative Windows 98 features, such as native Power Management and Plug and Play, plus many unique, cutting-edge capabilities that extend manageability, security, networking, and performance. For example, IntelliMirror™ is a new technology that gives 32-bit Windows customers the advantages of centralized computing with the performance and flexibility of distributed computing. It mirrors users' data, applications, and customized operating system settings to a Windows NT 5.0–based server using intelligent caching and centralized synchronization. This gives users access to all of their information and applications whether they are connected to the network or not, with the assurance that it is safely maintained on the server. IntelliMirror is part of the broader Microsoft <a href="msdn_zerowin.htm">"Zero Administration Initiative for Windows"</a> and will continue to reduce the effort and cost of deployment, installation, and management of PCs.</li>
</ul>
<p>
It is important to note that Windows NT Workstation 5.0 and Windows 98 will share more in common than Windows NT Workstation 4.0 and Windows 95. For example, both operating systems will use the same Windows Driver Model, eliminating many device support differences. Windows NT Workstation 5.0 and Windows 98 will also share Advanced Power Management and Plug and Play features.</p>
<h4>Narrowing the choices</h4>
<p>
Finding the best Windows operating system requires answering yes or no to some simple questions. Resources for answering these questions appear below.</p>
<p>
<img src="chooseplat01.gif" border=0></p>
<p class=label>
<b>Figure 1. Windows NT or Windows 95: which should you choose?</b></p>
<h4>Are 32-bit Windows, 16-bit Windows, and MS-DOS–based applications supported in Windows NT Workstation 4.0?</h4>
<p>
Although they share the Win32 application programming interface (API), security and performance optimizations require some architectural differences between Windows NT and Windows 95. Windows&nbsp;95 and Windows 98 offer the broadest support for running mixed application environments, including MS-DOS, 16-bit Windows and 32-bit Windows. Windows NT Workstation is optimized to run 32-bit Windows–based applications, but also supports many leading 16-bit Windows–based and MS-DOS–based productivity applications. A list of compatible 16-bit Windows– and MS-DOS–based applications is available at the Microsoft Windows Family Web site (<a href="http://microsoft.com/windows/platform/info/16bit.htm">http://microsoft.com/windows/platform/info/16bit.htm</a>).</p>
<p>
For software compatibility questions, talk with the application developer or see the Microsoft listing of retail applications that have received the "Designed for Windows" logo certification, available from the Microsoft Windows Family Web site (<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/thirdparty/winlogo/">http://www.microsoft.com/windows/thirdparty/winlogo/</a>).</p>
<h4>Are all hardware components and peripherals supported in Windows NT Workstation 4.0?</h4>
<p>
For security and other optimizations, Windows 95 and Windows NT Workstation 4.0 support different device driver models. In general, Windows 95 was designed to support a broader range of devices and peripherals than Windows NT. To check hardware compatibility, Microsoft offers a comprehensive listing at the Hardware Testing at Microsoft Web site (<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/hwtest/">http://www.microsoft.com/hwtest/</a>). In Windows 98 and Windows NT 5.0, shared Windows Driver Model and Advanced Configuration and Power Interface features eliminate many differences among drivers, power management, and Plug and Play capabilities.</p>
<h4>Are systems running with 32 MB of RAM or more?</h4>
<p>
Windows NT Workstation 4.0 runs faster than Windows 95 on systems with 32 of MB RAM. Windows 95 runs faster than Windows NT Workstation 4.0 on systems with 16 MB of RAM. Windows NT Workstation 4.0 is not recommended for systems running less than 24 MB of RAM. In general, Microsoft recommends new business systems be purchased with a minimum of 32 MB of RAM.</p>
<h4>Is data and network security a primary business requirement?</h4>
<p>
Although many customers run Windows NT Workstation without having a strong security requirement, Microsoft recommends Windows NT Workstation 4.0 for maintaining highly secure environments. For example, on Windows NT every user must be authenticated on a system before gaining access to information. With Windows NT you can also enable discretionary access to resources all the way to individual files. While Windows 95 provides adequate security in "trusted" environments, it is not possible to create a truly secure network.</p>

<h2>Choosing the Best Hardware Platform</h2>
<p>
Windows-based hardware is available from hundreds of PC manufacturers in thousands of configurations, making it possible to find the right hardware at the best possible price point. In the next few months, most PCs will fall into three general categories:
<ul type=disc>
<li>
<b>Windows-based terminals (WBT)</b>. Windows-based terminals are a new super-thin–client device for the Windows family product line. Designed to work specifically with Windows NT Server Hydra, Windows-based terminals provide a compelling Windows-based replacement for traditional "dumb" terminals. Windows-based terminals help reduce TCO by creating a nearly 100 percent centrally managed environment. In addition, Windows NT Hydra can be used by corporations to deliver 32-bit Windows applications to legacy or remote desktop devices, until systems and applications can be upgraded to run on PCs or Net PCs. While Windows NT "Hydra" provides a strong solution for upgrading legacy systems, it requires an appropriate investment in server and networking infrastructure to support these additional clients. Prices for new Windows-based terminals are expected to start at under $500.<p class=tl>
For more information about Windows NT Hydra, see the article <a href="msdn_hydrawp.htm">"Microsoft Windows NT Hydra: The Benefits of Windows with the Low Cost of a Terminal."</a></P></li>
<li>
<b>Net PCs</b>. Net PCs are a new type of simple, easy-to-manage Windows-based PC for the corporate environment. They are ideal for IT managers who want to deploy local processing, local storage, and a familiar user environment but not the full flexibility of a traditional Windows-based PC. With the availability of Windows NT Server 5.0, Net PCs include the necessary hardware components that allow Windows NT Workstation 5.0 to be automatically installed and configured over the network, even during off-hour periods. You can add software applications and hardware components to Net PCs, but such installations need to be done by an authorized administrator or with permissions. Prices are expected to start at under $1,000.<br><br></li>
<li>
<b>PCs (including mobile PCs and PC workstations).</b> PCs are ideal for almost any computing situation—from subnotebook portables to advanced 3-D graphics workstations. PCs generally ship a full range of devices including CD-ROM, floppy drive, I/O ports, and audio and video capabilities. PCs provide expandability and flexibility to meet virtually every business need. With the Microsoft <a href="msdn_zerowin.htm">Zero Administration Initiative for Windows</a> features, PCs can be managed centrally with the right configurations. Prices range from about $1,000 to $4,000.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Once you have identified business needs, application software, supporting hardware requirements, and the operating system, choosing the best Windows-based hardware platform requires aligning two criteria: how much flexibility do administrators want for changing systems, and how closely do administrators want to manage these systems.</p>
<p>
<img src="chooseplat02.gif" border=0></p>
<p class=label>
<b>Figure 2.Flexibility and central management</b></p>
<h4>How much flexibility and expandability do you need to deploy to users?</h4>
<p>
The best way to segment users is to identify how much flexibility and expandability they need to successfully do their jobs. For example, someone who uses one or two applications, rarely upgrades software, and never upgrades hardware does not need a flexible and expandable environment. This is typical of "task-oriented" users. On the other hand, someone who needs to continually use different applications and upgrades hardware frequently needs more flexibility. This is typical of "knowledge-oriented" users.</p>
<h4>How closely can we manage systems while still enabling users to reach full productivity?</h4>
<p>
In general, centralized management leads to lower total cost of ownership. However, in no environment should the desire to centrally manage systems be more important than giving users the right tools for their jobs.</p>
<h3>Hardware Deployment Scenarios</h3>
<p>
The following are examples of how different Windows-based hardware platforms can be best deployed:</p>
