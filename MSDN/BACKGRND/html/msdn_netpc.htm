<h1><a name="msdn_netpc"></a>Network PCs—Reducing Total Cost of Ownership While Leveraging the Power and Compatibility of PC Computing</h1>
<p>
Microsoft Corporation</p>
<p>
March 1997</p>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
As IT budgets shrink today, and personal computers become more prevalent in business, many organizations are now focusing attention on reducing total cost of ownership (TCO). While cost is unmistakably a critical component of any IT investment, it is also important to consider the comprehensive and long-term value of the computing solution and how it will service all of your organization’s needs.</p>
<p>
Microsoft is delivering on these needs through the ongoing Microsoft® Windows® Client Strategy. This strategy will deliver to customers a complete range of client solutions which address the core problems facing them today—how to reduce TCO and increase return on investment. Microsoft will do this by providing solutions which take advantage of the Windows operating system as it exists today and as it evolves in the future with special emphasis on options and functionality which address customer needs for maximizing their computing investments. </p>
<p>
Microsoft's strategy for reducing TCO is currently supported by two primary efforts—the "Zero Administration" Initiative for Windows and the Network PC Specification, which will be the focus of this document.</p>
<h2>The Network PC Specification</h2>
<p>
The Network PC is the newest member of the PC family, designed to reduce the costs and complexity of managing a distributed PC environment. The Network PC reduces TCO by taking advantage of the latest computing innovations to:
<ul type=disc>
<li>
Reduce end user access to hardware through its recommended sealed case.<br><br></li>
<li>
Enable full remote management from the central IT department, yet still offer all of the traditional computing and standards-based benefits of PCs running the Windows 95 and Windows NT Workstation operating systems. </li>
</ul>
<p>
Microsoft and Intel introduced the Network PC Initiative on October 28, 1996 with support from more than 100 PC manufacturers and others, including Compaq Computer Corp., Dell Computer Corp., Digital Equipment Corp., Gateway 2000 Inc., Hewlett Packard, Packard Bell NEC, and Texas Instruments Inc. On March 12, 1997 they released the Network PC specification for broad industry review. Products meeting the public Network PC specification are expected to start appearing in mid-1997. The Network PC family of products will extend to the highest levels of processing performance and will include entry-level systems starting below the $1,000 price point.</p>
<p>
The Network PC complements Microsoft’s broader "Zero Administration" Initiative for Windows, a set of core technologies that gives IT professionals new levels of control and manageability over their Windows-based environments. For example, it automates such tasks as operating system updates and application installation, and by provides tools for central administration and desktop system lock down. For more information on the "Zero Administration" Initiative for Windows please see <a href="msdn_zerowin.htm">"The 'Zero Administration' Initiative for Windows"</a>.</p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>
The increasing performance and plummeting prices for PC hardware have enabled corporations to put a PC on virtually every desktop in their organizations. Increasingly sophisticated software applications have made those PCs tremendously useful once they get there. Now, intranets and the Internet have enabled corporations to tie all of their desktops—as well as the desktops of their suppliers, partners and customers—into a virtual network that spans the globe and enables real-time transactions, information sharing, and entirely new business processes.</p>
<p>
But with corporations forever seeking competitive advantage, yesterday’s exciting innovation is merely today’s standard—although corporations continue to demand additional productivity gains from their IT infrastructures. As IT budgets shrink and PC saturation of the enterprise becomes complete, many organizations are attempting to boost productivity by reducing the total cost of ownership (TCO). TCO attempts to take into account all costs of owning and managing PCs. It includes the costs of hardware and software acquisition, but goes beyond them to also consider upgrades, continuing support and maintenance, and end-user productivity.</p>
<h2>The Network PC Solution</h2>
<p>
To respond to this need for reduced cost of ownership while maintaining the performance of and compatibility with PCs, Microsoft and Intel along with leading PC manufacturers have worked together to define the Network PC Reference Platform. The Network PC is the newest member of the PC family, not a replacement, that allows PC vendors to build fully functional Windows and Intel architecture-based systems that lower the cost of owning PCs, especially in structured environments where centralized IT control over end-user operations is required. The Network PC serves as a complement to organizations’ existing investment in the PC platform, providing the optimal combination of reduced cost and extensibility, while maintaining full compatibility with Windows-based PCs. </p>
<p>

<p class=label>
<b>Figure 1. Network PC positioning on a cost/benefit curve</b></p>
<p>
The overall benefit is reduced support costs, a stable hardware platform, a lower initial purchase price, and the ability to build upon existing organization training, development, and capital investments in Windows and applications designed for Windows. The Network PC's inclusion of a hard disk boosts performance while reducing network traffic for continued cost savings and enterprise efficiency.</p>
<p>
Network PCs are expected to have a base price below $1,000, and scale up to offer increasingly powerful performance at varying price points. While savings will start with the lower initial purchase price for Network PCs compared with other fully expandable personal computers, the greatest savings from Network PCs at any price point will be the ongoing administration and maintenance savings over time. Customers who purchase Network PC systems this year will be able to use current Windows operating systems, applications, technologies, and Internet software built on both Java™ and ActiveX™ Controls without modification. </p>
<p>
In addition, customers will be assured of a seamless migration path to the advanced Zero Administration capabilities in future Windows operating systems. Key aspects of the Network PC that produce continuing TCO reductions over time include the following: 
<ul type=disc>
<li>
All hardware devices can be recognized and managed by software, aiding in successful remote troubleshooting and repair.<br><br></li>
<li>
Network PCs can be managed remotely via standard interfaces and protocols.<br><br></li>
<li>
Systems can be automatically configured and installed over the network.<br><br></li>
<li>
Network PCs can be automatically updated in off-hour periods. <br><br></li>
<li>
No ISA slots, to ensure that all hardware devices can be recognized and managed by software. <br><br></li>
<li>
A sealed case prevents end user modifications to the hardware configuration.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Network PC System Requirements</h2>
<p>
Following is an “at-a-glance” look at Network PC system requirements. The complete specification will be available in late March 1997 as “Network PC System Design Guidelines" on the Microsoft Web site at <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/hwdev/">http://www.microsoft.com/hwdev/</a>.</p>

<h2>The Network PC and the Windows Family</h2>
<p>
The Network PC differs from traditional PCs by offering a sealed case, smaller size, optional floppy or CD-ROM drive, centralized administration, and network readiness. The Network PC is intended for use in highly structured environments where workers need the benefits of Windows to access information, but don’t need the software and hardware expandability that a flexible PC provides. Microsoft research indicates that this is 10 to 15 percent of the computing device market in Fortune 1000 environments such as customer support, securities trading, retail, and manufacturing. For example, retail point-of-sale, shop floor manufacturing automation, or airline reservation stations could all benefit from Network PCs. </p>
<p>
The traditional workstation PC or laptop remains the better choice for applications where the end user needs at least some control over the computer and peripherals, where access to floppy drives and/or CD-ROM drives is desired, and where expandability to accommodate new or enhanced technology is a plus. These include most uses by experienced or “power” users, scientific/engineering workstations, and mobile computers for traveling executives.</p>
<h2>The PC 97 Hardware Design Guidelines (PC 97) </h2>
<p>
The PC 97 Hardware Design Guidelines (PC 97) is an umbrella term for the system definitions and requirements for PC, bus, and device design that will make up the next generation of guidelines for the "Designed for Microsoft Windows" hardware logo program. PC 97 was designed in a collaborative forum between Microsoft, hardware vendors, and PC manufacturers—an open process of specification, design review, and revision. The guidelines specify three classes of PC—a Basic PC, a Workstation PC, and an Entertainment PC—with different requirements appropriate to the class of PC. </p>
<p>
The goals for PC 97 are the following: 
<ul type=disc>
<li>
Encourage ease-of-use innovations on the PC platform by driving advances that enhance and improve the end-user experience and that advance the quality of PC hardware and firmware. <br><br></li>
<li>
Ensure the availability of high-quality hardware that supports advanced features under Windows and also ensure availability of lower-cost PCs that run the Windows operating system well. <br><br></li>
<li>
Allow room for innovation, so that manufacturers and designers can pursue new solutions to problems and advance new areas for hardware. To this end, PC 97 guidelines are written to refer to existing industry standards or to specify performance goals or benchmarks, rather than prescribe fixed hardware implementations. Where this was not possible (for example, for CPU and RAM), it is because acceptable benchmarks are not yet available. When appropriate benchmarks and tests are available, these will be incorporated in the design guidelines. </li>
</ul>
<h3>PC 97 Reference Platforms </h3>
<p>
PC 97 specifies three different reference platforms for PCs, rather than the single reference platform specified in PC 95. There are several key reasons for providing separate categories for PC design guidelines: </p>
<p>
<b>Basic PC 97. </b>Defines a standard PC (both desktop and mobile) for all customers. This PC is designed to support typical Windows-based applications running under either Windows 95 or Windows NT Workstation operating systems. </p>
<p>
<b>Workstation PC 97. </b>Defines enhanced components for a PC system designed to support the more complex requirements of Win32-based applications that have strenuous graphics or computational demands. A Workstation PC 97 system can run either Windows 95 or Windows NT Workstation, but its design is optimized to support Windows NT Workstation when used for complex applications such as CAD or engineering computing, software development, and content authoring for games, the Internet, or educational applications. </p>
<p>
<b>Entertainment PC 97. </b>Defines enhanced components for a PC system designed as an interactive multimedia system optimized for games, education, personal communications and Internet activities, and video playback. Key features that differentiate Entertainment PC 97 from other system types include support for gaming 3-D graphics and audio, high-performance graphics and video including full motion MPEG-II video, high-fidelity audio, and connections to consumer electronics devices such as home stereos, telephones, VCRs, camcorders, digital satellite systems, and so on. </p>
<p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>
Microsoft’s strategy is to offer a complete range of client solutions that address the core problems facing customers today—how to reduce total cost of ownership and increase return on investment. This includes the need to support a full range of devices, from handheld PCs, to Windows-based terminals where applications and data reside completely on the server, to Network PCs that offer reduced cost and complexity, to portables, desktops, and high-end workstations that offer higher levels of functionality and flexibility.</p>
<p>
<img src="netpc_3.gif" border=0></p>
<p>
The Network PC is an open, standards-based, industry-supported solution to the challenge of achieving lower cost of ownership in the network environment. This complementary member of the Windows-based PC family features a sealed case to inhibit end-user configuration changes, and complete centralized control to reduce the costs of on-site administration. Because its design enforces IT policies that support lower TCO, the Network PC is a key part of the strategy to reduce costs in the network environment. It is an integral piece in Microsoft’s initiatives to reduce cost of ownership, while continuing to innovate on the Windows platform and increase overall value for our customers.
