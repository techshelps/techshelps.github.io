<h1><a name="msdn_sapdcom"></a>The SAP DCOM Component Connector</h1>
<p>
October 28, 1997 </p>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>
SAP's Business Framework is a family of products delivered by SAP and third parties that form a component-based, integrated, and open application software solution. With the Business Framework, SAP ships technologies that allow the automatic, seamless integration of products, both on a technical and on a business level. While the business-level integration focuses on a common business understanding of various products or components, the technical interoperability across networks is the fundamental prerequisite for building component-based solutions. With the DCOM Component Connector, SAP and Microsoft have built a means for the seamless and tight technical interoperability of components on the basis of Microsoft's Distributed Component Object Model (DCOM). This paper discusses the benefits of using the DCOM Component Connector to both corporations and their developers. The DCOM Component Connector will be shipped by SAP in the R/3 4.0 time frame. </p>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<h4>Creating a business ecosystem</h4>
<p>
Today, customers are challenged with increased competitive pressure through globalization, turbulent markets, and ever-growing demands with respect to quality and time-to-market. Companies react to these challenges by taking a detailed view of their complete business system, which includes the consumer, their business partners, and their own internal business units. This business ecosystem is dissected into discrete business activities, which represent the services that are needed to satisfy customers' needs. The business ecosystem approach represents a huge opportunity to identify cases for incremental value chain innovation and business integration, which can lead to improved flexibility and competitiveness. </p>
<h2>The Business Framework</h2>
<p>
The Business Framework delivers on SAP's vision of business ecosystems. It enables customers to assemble their business solution, which seamlessly integrates business components delivered by SAP and other vendors. Business components themselves provide a dedicated business functionality as an encapsulated software product through defined and consistent interfaces. Integrated business components provide a new dimension of maintainability, because they allow customers to upgrade parts of a system step-by-step instead of upgrading the whole system at a single point in time. </p>
<h4>Seamless integration</h4>
<p>
For a long time, the integration of components delivered by different vendors required specialized knowledge in various, widely differing environments and often was an expensive, manual integration process. With R/3 4.0, SAP ships technologies like the DCOM Component Connector with the Business Framework. The DCOM Component Connector, the result of a joint effort of SAP and Microsoft, allows the automatic, seamless integration of products on the basis of Microsoft's DCOM. </p>
<h2>Business Benefits</h2>
<p>
In particular, the DCOM Component Connector provides the following benefits for corporations: 
<ul type=disc>
<li>
<b>A new dimension of openness.</b> The DCOM Component Connector provides interoperability between R/3 objects and COM objects across a heterogeneous network through well-defined business interfaces. It exposes R/3's mature business processes and business objects to open DCOM access, making it easier to complement and extend R/3 using Microsoft tools—for example, to create new front-ends or to extended business processes. <br><br></li>
<li>
<b>Leverage existing programming skills.</b> With the DCOM Component Connector, you have the choice of either extending the Business Framework by using software components written with SAP tools (ABAP Objects) or COM tools (Microsoft Visual Studio™, Visual Basic®, Visual C++®, and Visual J++™). This leverages existing investments in training, people, and in the huge market for pre-built COM components. <br><br></li>
<li>
<b>Eased integration.</b> The integration of R/3 Business Components with third-party products, legacy systems, and home-grown applications has become much easier with the DCOM Component Connector. Now even distributed transactions of several systems containing several databases are possible. <br><br></li>
<li>
<b>Evolutionary approach.</b> The DCOM Component Connector works even if R/3 itself does not run on a Windows NT® platform. This allows corporations to save costs by leveraging their existing infrastructure. And through the built-in scalability of multiple servers in every tier (Microsoft Transaction Server and R/3 Application Server) this solution is able to grow with your needs. </li>
</ul>
<p>
These benefits strengthen the role of SAP as the backbone for your component solution. With the Business Framework, SAP integrates products from different vendors, legacy, and newly created applications to provide every customer with a dedicated business solution. </p>
<h2>Technology</h2>
<h4>DCOM, COM, and more&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</h4>
<p>
The Distributed Component Object Model (DCOM) enables COM software components to communicate directly over a network in a reliable, secure, and efficient manner. DCOM is designed for use across multiple network transports, including Internet protocols such as TCP and HTTP. DCOM is based on the Open Software Foundation's DCE-RPC spec and will work with both Java™ applets and ActiveX® components through its use of the Component Object Model (COM). DCOM is a fast, native object transport for Windows&nbsp;NT and Windows® 95. DCOM is also being licensed to technology vendors through the Open Group as well as through Microsoft, and is currently available from several vendors on UNIX and other platforms. </p>
<h3>Microsoft Transaction Server</h3>
<p>
The Microsoft Transaction Server (MTS) is based on COM and uses DCOM for component-to-component communications across a network. MTS itself is a component-based transaction processing system for developing, deploying, and managing high-performance, scalable, and robust enterprise, Internet, and intranet server applications. The MTS defines an application-programming model for developing distributed component-based applications. It also provides a run-time infrastructure for deploying and managing these applications. </p>
<p>
The rich business processes of R/3 can natively be brought into Windows. However, the integration is bidirectional, that is, the DCOM Component Connector also integrates the vast number of COM components transparently into R/3. </p>
<h2>Benefits for the Developer</h2>
<h4>Single system image</h4>
<p>
Distributed business components implement business logic in possibly various separated run-time environments for improved deployment flexibility. However, even for multiple systems developers need to have a single system image for efficient development. To date, this integration has been achieved manually. The DCOM Component Connector provides a commodity platform, delivering distributed features at low cost, because it 
<ul type=disc>
<li>
Exposes ABAP Objects as COM components to the developer using DCOM tools. ABAP Objects automatically operate in the DCOM multiuser environment through automatic thread and process management. Developers do not need to build this feature into their applications themselves. <br><br></li>
<li>
Exposes COM components to the ABAP developers working with R/3 tools as ABAP Objects. This allows for a seamless integration of new or existing COM applications into R/3. </li>
</ul>
<h4>Support of two-phase commit transaction processing</h4>
<p>
The Microsoft Transaction Server is designed to work with any resource manager, including relational databases, file systems, and image stores, that support a transactional two-phase commit protocol. This enables businesses to leverage existing investments in UNIX and mainframe data stores. The DCOM Component Connector integrates the wide range of SAP's business components into this environment and eases the customer's integration efforts. </p>
<p>
The DCOM Component Connector also automatically integrates COM transaction support with SAP transactions. This transaction support is transparent to the application programmer and provides the R/3 class reliability to the distributed business application programmer. This transparent support frees developers from explicitly programming low-level transaction control primitives into their applications. </p>
<h4>Comprehensive support of DCOM development</h4>
<p>
The DCOM Component Connector allows developers to focus on the development and deployment of business components by freeing them from the need to cope with the traditional obstacles in cross platform integration. In particular, the DCOM Component Connector 
<ul type=disc>
<li>
Manages a pool of connections to R/3. This frees the developer from managing R/3 synchronization issues and guarantees high-performance access to R/3. <br><br></li>
<li>
Automatically exposes RFC result sets as OLEDB row sets. In turn, OLEDB row sets are automatically converted to RFC tables for input or update, freeing the developers from designing data conversion engines. <br><br></li>
<li>
Allows developers and administrators to easily isolate components so they operate in their own system process or even run on their own server, providing an additional level of failure isolation and data protection. This improves system fault isolation, while increasing application performance and scalability. </li>
</ul>
<h4>Security through trusted systems</h4>
<p>
Security is automatically synchronized between SAP R/3 and the COM environment. The DCOM Component Connector leverages the Microsoft Transaction Server distributed security service that is integrated with Windows&nbsp;NT security. This makes it easy to prevent unauthorized access to business applications, even in the distributed environment, and avoids an explicit logon to R/3 when business functionality is invoked. </p>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>
The DCOM Component Connector delivers a series of features that drive down the effort and cost of building and integrating distributed business applications on the basis of Microsoft's DCOM technologies. These features offer a new dimension of openness and performance, enabling developers to focus on building business logic in the environment that they are familiar with—be it ABAP Objects or COM—with a high potential of reuse across the business process chain. The result is shorter development time and easier integration of components extending R/3 running on Windows NT and other platforms. </p>
