<h1><a name="msdn_nt_ntw"></a>Microsoft Windows NT and Advanced Server—The Ideal Way to Run Client-Server Applications on a Novell NetWare Network</h1>
<p>
Microsoft Corporation</p>
<p>
Created: July 1993</p>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>
The Microsoft® Windows NT™ operating system is the high-end operating system of the Windows™ family. Windows NT has an open design and integrated networking, which allow it to act as a workstation to access Novell® NetWare® servers. The Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server operating system allows existing NetWare clients to access server-based applications as they continue to access NetWare file and print servers. Windows NT is the most powerful operating system platform available for client-server computing.</p>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
Microsoft® Windows NT™ operating system is the high-end operating system of the Windows™ platform. It is the most powerful operating system platform for client-server solutions.</p>
<p>
An advanced operating system, Windows NT is powerful, reliable, and open and is designed to make the most of today's powerful machines. It is a 32-bit operating system providing preemptive multitasking and high capacity. It's designed for non-stop performance with a built-in backup utility, and it's open architecture allows it to support a broad range of applications and hardware.</p>
<p>
While Windows NT includes the features necessary to build advanced solutions, its open design makes it easy for third-party vendors to extend Windows NT to address a range of business requirements. One such requirement is consistent access to information stored in a variety of back end systems. An example is the ability of Windows NT to integrate with Novell® networks.</p>
<p>
Microsoft and Novell have worked together to enable complete integration of the Windows NT operating system into existing Novell NetWare® environments. As a powerful client, Windows NT has complete access to existing NetWare servers. Users of powerful business applications running on Windows NT can easily access the same NetWare-based files and printers that are used today by clients running MS-DOS®, Windows and OS/2® operating systems.</p>
<p>
The Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server operating system brings these same benefits to application servers. Windows NT Advanced Server can be used to deploy client-server solutions in networks that can continue to use NetWare as they do today. Client systems, ranging from MS-DOS to Windows to the Macintosh®, can enjoy the benefits of client-server computing while still accessing the files and printers maintained on NetWare servers.</p>
<p>
For customers who do not use NetWare today, the Windows NT Advanced Server is a superior alternative. With all of the file and print capabilities of Novell NetWare, the Windows NT Advanced Server adds high-end power, mission-critical reliability, and the advantage of openness required to deploy cost-effective business solutions that can adapt with your changing information technology needs.</p>
<h2>What Is Windows NT?</h2>
<p>
Windows NT is a powerful, reliable, and open operating system, ready for the demands of client-server computing and the advanced power of personal computers in the 1990s and beyond. Incorporating and building on the benefits of the family of Windows operating systems—ease of use, application integration, and choice of leading applications—the Windows NT operating system extends these benefits in a powerful platform for client-server computing.</p>
<p>
<b><i>Power:</i></b> Windows NT is a full 32-bit, preemptive multi-tasking operating system with a huge capacity to enable power users to fully exploit line-of-business and personal productivity application as well as the latest generation of microprocessors including Intel® and RISC systems, including symmetric multiprocessing systems.</p>
<p>
<b><i>Reliability:</i></b> Windows NT provides the reliability required by MIS professionals and other power users to run line-of-business applications. The advanced microkernel design of Windows NT, along with integrated security and manageability, provide a reliable platform system required by MIS managers.</p>
<p>
<b><i>Open Operating System:</i></b> Windows NT gives you better access to information throughout the enterprise and flexibility in choosing computing solutions. Windows NT was built for network computing and supports industry standard protocols for easy access to resources in heterogeneous computing environments. Windows NT runs existing applications designed for the MS-DOS and Windows operating systems as well as new 32-bit applications for Windows.</p>
<p>
The server version of Windows NT is called the Windows NT Advanced Server. The Windows NT Advanced Server enables organizations to take advantage of powerful capabilities to implement client-server application such as database servers, messaging servers, or communications gateways on many different types of networks.</p>
<p>
The Windows NT Advanced Server builds on the Windows NT operating system, adding centralized management, centralized security for a single logon to the enterprise, advanced fault tolerance, and connectivity to Macintosh and remote clients—everything you need to run mission-critical servers. The Windows NT Advanced Server is a complete file and print server, but first and foremost it is a platform for building the server portion of client-server applications.</p>
<p>
While Novell NetWare is a well accepted file and print server, it does not fully address the requirements of server-based applications. The Windows NT Advanced Server has the capabilities necessary to support the server component of line-of-business applications even on a NetWare LAN.</p>
<h2>Business Trends of the 1990s</h2>
<p>
In 1990s, new economic conditions are forcing companies to reevaluate the way they do business. Competitive advantage is derived from a well-planned combination of cost control and efficiency. In the case of information technology, competitive advantage is derived not only from controlling the cost of information systems, but also from enabling the entire organization to run more effectively through better access to information.</p>
<p>
At the same time, the increased power of PCs permit more cost-efficient computing with PCs integrated into enterprise systems. Increased availability of advanced networking technology drives more information sharing. This information sharing is no longer limited to simple file and print sharing as emphasis shifts to distributed applications based on the client-server model.</p>
<h2>What Is Client-Server Computing?</h2>
<p>
In the most generic sense, client-server architecture splits an application into a "front end" <i>client</i> component that runs on the PC workstation, and a "back end" <i>server</i> component that runs on the PC server. On the front end, the client portion of the application typically consists of a user interface (increasingly a graphical user interface [GUI]) that can launch the application, provide input, manipulate data, and display results.</p>
<p>
On the back end, the server waits for requests from clients. When it receives a request, the server processes it and provides the requested service to the client. Server programs manage shared resources and perform processor-intensive operations, such as record sorting in the case of database, or protocol translation in the case of a communications server. </p>
<p>
A client-server database, such as Microsoft SQL Server, uses its built-in intelligence to extract only the specific data requested, so traffic and overhead are reduced and the network maintains high performance. Additionally, security and data integrity are maintained centrally on the server—an important benefit in a multi-user environment. And when the requested data is presented using the GUI, the results can be integrated with other applications.</p>
<p>
As personal computer networks have developed more capabilities, organizations have begun to transfer important data processing functions from mainframe and mini-computers to the LAN. These <i>line-of-business applications</i> (LoB) are central to the corporation's day-to-day business, and the user depends upon the reliability and security of the LAN for effective operation. </p>
<p>
With the increased power on PC class systems, the client-server model is the best way to build LoB applications. With this architecture, a corporation can provide its workstation users with access to centrally controlled services such as databases, communication gateways, and electronic mail systems. In this environment, the role of the network server is critical, and the reliability and security of the LAN assumes even greater importance.</p>
<p>
Novell optimized the architecture of NetWare to provide workstation users with shared access to simple resources such as printers, disks, and pools of modems. However, the design of NetWare does not lend itself to the implementation of complex server-based application software. NetWare lacks key functionality that is required to build server applications. This functionality includes preemptive multi-tasking, protected virtual memory, and security that extends to applications. Without these features on PC servers, independent software vendors have struggled to provide the applications and development tools that companies need as the basis for transferring significant LoB applications to the LAN.</p>
<h2>Why Use Windows NT with NetWare?</h2>
<p>
Windows NT can enhance an existing network by bringing powerful capabilities to the desktop. Windows NT combines line-of-business solutions with personal productivity applications. With Novell's NetWare Client for Windows NT, desktop systems running Windows NT can be full clients to existing NetWare file and print servers.</p>
<p>
Organizations that use NetWare today often want to downsize or reengineer existing applications that run on mini-computers or mainframes. While NetWare servers are not designed to support such applications, Windows NT Advanced Servers can be integrated into existing NetWare networks. Clients can continue to access resources on the NetWare servers as they access server-based applications running on the Windows NT Advanced Server.</p>
<h2>Using Windows NT Clients in a NetWare Environment</h2>
<p>
The open design of Windows NT enables third-party network redirectors to integrate seamlessly with the operating system. One example is Novell's <i>NetWare Client for Windows NT</i>, which enables Windows NT to be a full client to NetWare servers while concurrently accessing Windows NT Advanced Servers for client-server applications as well as file and print service.</p>
<p>
Windows NT was born to network. As businesses transition from standalone workstations to distributed computing systems, operating systems are also evolving to include networking. As networks become more commonplace, it should be as easy to access network resources as it is to access local resources. Just as it manages local resources such as CPUs, disk drives, and memory, Windows NT also manages network access to distributed applications and remote files and printers. </p>
<p>
The networking checklist for Windows NT responds directly to customer requirements for line-of-business systems:
<ul type=disc>
<li>
Build in networking<br><br></li>
<li>
Make the operating system <i>open</i> to multiple network technologies<br><br></li>
<li>
Make it <i>easy </i>to use<br><br></li>
<li>
Make it <i>reliable </i>for line-of-business applications<br><br></li>
<li>
Ensure <i>interoperability </i>with other established systems<br><br></li>
<li>
Provide a great platform for distributed applications</li>
</ul>
<p>
Networking in Windows NT is a natural extension of the operating system, not an extra piece of software that has to be added. This is true throughout the operating system, including the user interface. For example, the file manager allows you to browse and connect to remote resources and set up printers remotely as easily as you can locally. Network support in the Windows NT operating system is designed to be independent of the underlying network system, so the same user interface and tools work with all networks that run on Windows NT.</p>
<p>
Windows NT allows multiple protocols and network services to run simultaneously. Microsoft and Novell have worked together to make NetWare transports available on Windows NT systems. For example, you can concurrently access a client-server application using DCE compatible remote procedure calls over TCP/IP transports, while browsing directories on a NetWare server over IPX/SPX.</p>
<p>
While Windows NT includes integrated networking, its open design provides for transparent access to other networks such as NetWare. As illustrated in Figure 1, a user of Windows NT can concurrently access files stored on Windows NT and NetWare servers.</p>
<p>

<p>
<b>Figure 1. Concurrent access to Windows NT and NetWare Servers</b></p>
<h4>How Windows NT-based Clients Access NetWare Servers</h4>
<p>
Windows NT supports various file system types such as FAT and HPFS for compatibility with MS-DOS–based clients and Microsoft LAN Manager servers, as well as the Windows NT File System (NTFS) to exploit the advanced capabilities of Windows NT. The same is true for networks, which are, essentially, just remote file systems. </p>
<p>
The Windows NT operating system has an open architecture that enables Windows NT-based desktops or Windows NT Advanced Servers to interoperate with multiple network types at the same time. This allows Novell as well as other third-party network vendors to support heterogeneous networks. The Windows NT architecture includes an open interface that enable consistent access to third-party network file systems. This architectural feature is called <i>the multiple provider router</i>. </p>
<p>
While Windows NT includes support for Windows-based servers, it can also access other file servers such as NetWare. Figure 2 illustrates the basic software architecture used to achieve this file system independence. The key to the multiple provider router is that all file systems, regardless of type and physical location, are accessible through the same set of file system APIs. </p>
<p>
Applications, including the file manager, make file system requests through the Windows NT Win32TM API. The multiple provider router ensures that requests are directed to the proper file system. Local file requests are sent to the local disk; remote requests to Windows-based servers are sent to the proper server by the Windows redirector; and requests to NetWare-based servers are handled by the NetWare Client for Windows NT, and sent to the NetWare server. </p>
<p>
<img src="l1ad.gif" border=0></p>
<p>
<b>Figure 2. Access to multiple network redirectors through the multiple provider router</b></p>
<p>
Users can access network servers independent of the type of server. Because applications access all types of files through a single set of APIs, any application can access any kind of server without affecting the user.</p>
<h4>Why Windows NT Advanced Server Makes a Better Application Server</h4>
<p>
Novell NetWare includes support for server-based applications called NetWare Loadable Modules (NLMs). The environment in which NLMs run is based on the functionality that Novell used to build its file and print server product. Novell NetWare is <i>not</i> designed for powerful server applications because it:
<ul type=disc>
<li>
Does not scale beyond single CPU Intel-based systems<br><br></li>
<li>
Does not provide preemptive multitasking<br><br></li>
<li>
Does not provide virtual memory<br><br></li>
<li>
Provides only limited memory protection in NetWare 4.0 and no protection in NetWare 3.11</li>
</ul>
<p>
Business solutions based on the client-server model require these features—the same features that are standard on most advanced operating systems designed to support mini-computers and mainframes. However, Novell's focus with NetWare is on the network and not the operating system. Like other network operating systems, NetWare is effective at adding networking capabilities to operating systems that do not include these services.</p>
<p>
In contrast, the Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server is a high-end operating system that includes the capabilities that MIS managers, software developers, and systems integrators have come to expect on platforms designed for business solutions. While Windows NT Advanced Server includes all the networking capabilities found in network operating systems (NOSs) like NetWare, it is not a NOS, but rather a high-end server operating system with built-in networking.</p>
<p>
The Windows NT Advanced Server is designed to provide the best features of UNIX®, VMS®, and other high-end operating systems in a package that is consistent and compatible across a variety of hardware implementations. These features include:
<ul type=disc>
<li>
Preemptive multitasking to provide the responsiveness required to support multiple applications and multiple users on a single server<br><br></li>
<li>
Multi-threading to ease in the design and development of complex applications<br><br></li>
<li>
Symmetric multiprocessing to build solutions that benefit from scalable power without limits<br><br></li>
<li>
Portability to RISC-based systems, which gives you a choice of hardware architectures<br><br></li>
<li>
Advanced fault tolerance to provide the data integrity required for important business information<br><br></li>
<li>
Virtual memory with protection so that multiple applications can run on a server without fear of corrupting one another or the system<br><br></li>
<li>
Distributed inter-process communications mechanisms that enable client-server applications to be written easily and independent of the underlying network<br><br></li>
<li>
Security model that provides full discretionary access so that business data can only be accessed by the right people in the right way<table border=1 cellpadding=5 cols=4 frame=below rules=rows>

<h2>How Windows NT Advanced Servers Work in NetWare Environments</h2>
<p>
The Windows NT Advanced Server is designed to add client-server computing to existing NetWare networks without upsetting the existing infrastructure. Client systems can access Windows NT Advanced Servers for application servers while continuing to access existing NetWare servers as they do today.</p>
<p>
To ease in the integration of Windows NT Advanced Server with existing NetWare clients, Microsoft has included its own implementation of the IPX/SPX transport called NWLink. NWLink is a fully compatible implementation of IPX/SPX that is portable to RISC-based systems, runs well on symmetric multiprocessor systems, and is fully accessible through the Windows Sockets interface. </p>
<p>
Client-server applications can be run on the Windows NT Advanced Server using standard IPX/SPX transports. This means clients in a NetWare LANs can have easy access to the Windows NT Advanced Servers and server applications running on them without adding additional software.</p>
<p>
Windows NT Advanced Servers can be accessed from client systems running MS-DOS, Microsoft Windows, Microsoft Windows for Workgroups, Windows NT, and OS/2 as well as Macintosh systems. Access to the Windows NT Advanced Server does not conflict with access to Novell NetWare in any way.</p>
<p>
<img src="l2ad.gif" border=0></p>
<p>
<b>Figure 3. Windows NT-based clients and servers in Novell NetWare networks</b></p>
<p>
In this configuration, client systems can access existing Novell NetWare file and print services while accessing Windows NT Advanced Servers as application servers or additional file and print servers.</p>
<p>
For users who need to use Windows NT Advanced Servers as file and print servers, concurrent access to NetWare is possible by loading the Microsoft redirector along with Novell's client networking software. Microsoft supports multiple client redirectors on MS-DOS, Windows, Windows for Workgroups, and Windows NT operating systems. </p>
<h4>Summary</h4>
<p>
Windows NT and NetWare are a great combination for companies that have built their PC networks on NetWare, but want to add sophisticated Windows NT-based solutions to their computing environment. Windows NT-based desktops and application servers can be added to the existing NetWare networks without changing existing systems and configurations.</p>
<p>
Microsoft and Novell realize that customers want the best of Windows and the best of NetWare. Novell and Microsoft have focused on making NetWare accessible from all Microsoft operating systems, including MS-DOS and all versions of Windows. Our efforts, with Windows NT in particular, highlight our commitment to helping customers integrate advanced Windows NT-based solutions with the NetWare environment.</p>
<p>
A key component of the success of Windows NT will be its networking support. It is full featured, reliable, easy to use and built in. Networking with Windows NT permits interoperability with LAN Manager, Windows for Workgroups, NetWare and other third-party network solutions. Integrated networking, combined with the open architecture, makes the Windows NT operating system an ideal platform for building distributed applications.</p>
<p>
Windows NT adds an exciting new facet to the operations of a NetWare LAN: highly secure, reliable, and scalable applications support. Just as important, the addition of Windows NT does not alter or disrupt the existing operation of the NetWare network. </p>
<p>
The features of Windows NT help ensure the availability of a high-quality base of development tools and server applications. The early support for the operating system from the software industry is evidence of this.</p>
<p>
The Windows NT operating system provides a richer development platform, a more robust execution environment, and a more scalable platform for application deployment than Novell NetWare. Windows NT is quite simply the ideal application platform for a Novell NetWare LAN.</p>
