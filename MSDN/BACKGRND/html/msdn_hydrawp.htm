<h2><a name="hydrawp_tech"></a>Technology Update: What Is Windows&nbsp;NT Hydra?</h2>
<p>
Microsoft® Windows&nbsp;NT® "Hydra" is the code name for a project that will add Windows®-based terminal support to the Microsoft Windows&nbsp;NT Server operating system and a "super-thin client" to the Windows operating system family product line. This new technology will provide enterprise customers with a compelling new extension to the Windows-based computing environment that combines low total cost of ownership, the familiar 32-bit Windows user interface, and the power and choice of the Windows operating system family. Specifically, Windows&nbsp;NT Hydra will:
<ul type=disc>
<li>
<b>Extend the scalable Windows family.</b> Windows&nbsp;NT Hydra plays a critical role in serving companies that want to deploy a super-thin–client solution to deliver 32-bit Windows to a wide range of legacy desktop hardware devices.<br><br></li>
<li>
<b>Combine the low cost of a terminal with the benefits of a managed Windows-based environment.</b> A Windows NT Hydra–based environment offers the same low cost, centrally managed environment of the traditional mainframe with terminals, with the familiarity, ease of use, and breadth of applications support offered by the Windows operating system platform.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Windows&nbsp;NT Hydra is an extension of the Windows&nbsp;NT Server 4.0 product line. In the multiuser environment, a super-thin client allows users to run the Windows desktop operating system and Windows-based applications completely off the server. Windows&nbsp;NT Hydra will provide users access to 16- or 32-bit Windows-based applications from any of the following types of desktops:
<ul type=disc>
<li>
A new class of low-cost hardware, commonly referred to as Windows-based terminals, that will be marketed by third-party hardware vendors.<br><br></li>
<li>
Any existing 32-bit Windows desktop operating system, such as Windows 95 or Windows&nbsp;NT Workstation (running the 32-bit Windows&nbsp;NT Hydra client as a window within the local desktop environment).<br><br></li>
<li>
Older 16-bit Windows–based desktops running the Windows 3.11 operating system (running the 16-bit Windows&nbsp;NT Hydra client as a window within the local desktop environment).<br><br></li>
<li>
X-based terminals, Apple® Macintosh®, MS-DOS®, Networked Computers, and UNIX-based desktops (via a third-party add-on product).</li>
</ul>
<h2><a name="hydrawp_prod"></a>Product Overview</h2>
<p>
Windows&nbsp;NT Hydra consists of three components—the Windows&nbsp;NT Server multiuser core, the T.Share/T.120 remote protocol, and the super-thin Windows–based client software. Specifically:
<ul type=disc>
<li>
<b>Windows&nbsp;NT Hydra server.</b> A multiuser server core that provides the ability to host multiple, simultaneous client sessions on Windows&nbsp;NT Server 4.0, and on future versions of Windows&nbsp;NT Server. Windows&nbsp;NT Hydra is capable of directly hosting compatible multiuser client desktops running on a variety of Windows-based and non-Windows–based hardware. Standard Windows-based applications do not need modification to run on the Windows&nbsp;NT Hydra Server, and all standard Windows&nbsp;NT–based management infrastructure and technologies can be used to manage the client desktops. In this way, corporations can take advantage of the rich choice of applications and tools offered by today's<b> </b>Windows environment.<br><br></li>
<li>
<b>T.Share/T.120 remote protocol.</b> A key component of Windows&nbsp;NT Hydra is the protocol that allows a super-thin client to communicate with the Windows&nbsp;NT Hydra server over the network. This protocol is based on International Telecommunications Union's (ITU) T.120 protocol, an international, standard multichannel conferencing protocol currently used in the Microsoft NetMeeting conferencing software product. It is tuned for high-bandwidth enterprise environments, and will also support encrypted sessions.<br><br></li>
<li>
<b>Super-thin client.</b> The client software that presents, or displays, the familiar 32-bit Windows user interface on a range of desktop hardware:<ul type=disc>
<li>
New Windows-based terminal devices.<br><br></li>
<li>
Personal computers running Windows 95 and Windows&nbsp;NT Workstation.<br><br></li>
<li>
Personal computers running Windows for Workgroups (Windows 3.11).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="hydrawp_ext"></a>Extending the Scalable Windows Family</h2>
<p>
The ability to deploy a range of cost-effective systems that precisely match user needs is critical to Information Technology (IT) departments. For most companies, "one size fits all" computing does not make business sense. Microsoft is committed to extending the Windows operating system family to meet a broad range of corporate customer needs—from high-end clustered servers handling billions of transactions a day to hand-held roaming devices on factory floors. Windows&nbsp;NT Hydra is the extension of Windows into the super-thin client marketplace. Microsoft will now be able to offer customers a Windows-based solution:
<ul type=disc>
<li>
As a way to deliver 32-bit Windows–based applications to any legacy desktop, including UNIX, Macintosh, or older Windows-based personal computers that cannot be upgraded to 32-bit Windows due to hardware limitations.<br><br></li>
<li>
For upgrading task-based workers to a graphic user interface&nbsp; (GUI) Win32® environment where "green screen" terminals have traditionally been used.<br><br></li>
<li>
For fast remote dial-up or branch access to centralized, Windows-based mission-critical applications.</li>
</ul>
<p>
The combination of the Net PC and Windows&nbsp;NT Hydra provide exciting new opportunities for enterprise customers to take advantage of the many benefits of the Windows operating system environment, while still focusing on low cost of ownership.</p>
<p>

<h3>Super-Thin Universal Client Solution</h3>
<p>
With Windows&nbsp;NT Hydra, corporations can deploy a super-thin client that does not require the downloading of applications or operating systems from the server. The Windows&nbsp;NT Hydra client contains only the minimum amount of software necessary to boot the device, establish a connection to the server, and present the user interface—all other operating-system functions, as well as the applications, run completely on the server.</p>
<h3>Low Total Cost of Ownership</h3>
<p>
Windows&nbsp;NT Hydra offers ways to lower both long-term desktop-management costs, as well as short-term capital-outlay costs. First, since all applications reside only in a single central place—on the server—there is no client software that must be installed or updated on the desktop. This makes application rollouts and updates very simple. Second, because all user-profile information is stored on the Windows&nbsp;NT Hydra Server, client desktops are administered centrally by the server. Third, remote administration capabilities further reduce the cost of handling helpdesk calls. Thus, the Windows&nbsp;NT Hydra environment gains the benefits of all Zero Administration for Windows capabilities available on Windows&nbsp;NT Server. Lastly, with a target price range below $500 per Windows-based terminal desktop, customers will also be able to choose from a wide range of compatible devices from many different hardware vendors. Windows&nbsp;NT Hydra can also be used to extend the life of current low-end Windows-based computer desktops by enabling access to the newest 32-bit applications running off of the Windows NT Hydra server.</p>
<h3>Windows-Based Applications Compatibility</h3>
<p>
In a Windows&nbsp;NT Hydra environment, all applications are run completely from the server. The Windows&nbsp;NT Hydra server provides the host-computing environment, including management of all computing resources on a per-user basis (for example, memory, CPU, and other resources). The multiuser capabilities run on top of Windows&nbsp;NT Server, thus any 16- or 32-bit Windows–based application that will run on a Windows&nbsp;NT-based computer today can be accessed in the Windows NT Hydra environment. In today's server-based multiuser environments, applications compatibility and consistent user-interface presentation can be challenging. Microsoft is committed to a high-quality Windows NT Hydra experience, and will be thoroughly testing popular Windows-based applications such as Microsoft Office, Microsoft Internet Explorer, Microsoft Exchange Server, Microsoft Outlook™, Microsoft Project, and 16- and 32-bit Microsoft Visual Basic®–based applications, as well as other popular 32-bit Windows–based business software products. The underlying goal is to provide the best and most consistent Windows operating system experience for the Windows&nbsp;NT Hydra user.</p>
<h3>Flexible Architecture to Accommodate Growth</h3>
<p>
Because the Windows family of operating systems provides a wide range of solutions, customers are not locked into a Windows&nbsp;NT Hydra environment as their needs change or grow. Virtually any Windows-based desktop (and many non-Windows–based desktops) will work with Windows&nbsp;NT Hydra. If a user requires more power, administrators can easily swap out a Windows-based terminal for a more powerful system, such as a Net PC or personal computer. The user interface, user profile, and applications do not have to be modified, saving end-user training and applications development resources. Also, Windows-based terminals from different manufacturers will be compatible, so they can be mixed and matched.</p>
<h3>Microsoft Industry Partnerships</h3>
<p>
On May 12, 1997, Microsoft Corporation announced a joint development agreement with Citrix Systems Inc. Under this agreement, Microsoft will license existing Citrix multiuser technology and the companies will cooperate on the development of new Windows&nbsp;NT Hydra technologies for Windows&nbsp;NT Server 4.0 and future versions. Citrix will also market an add-on to the Windows&nbsp;NT Hydra Server, code-named "Picasso," that will support existing and future Independent Computing Architecture–based (ICA-based) Citrix clients. For more information on this and other Citrix products, see the Citrix Systems, Inc. Web site (http://www.citrix.com). Microsoft also announced an agreement with Prologue Software on the same day to license its multiuser technology and for Prologue to cooperate in the development and deployment of Windows&nbsp;NT Hydra.</p>
