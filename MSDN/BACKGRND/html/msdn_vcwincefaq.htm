Microsoft Corporation</p>
<h4>What is Visual C++ for Windows CE? </h4>
<p>
Microsoft® Visual C++® for Windows® CE is an add-on to Visual C++ version 5.0. With Visual C++ for Windows CE, developers using Win32® will be able to create applications easily for Windows CE-based devices. Visual C++ for Windows CE is fully integrated into the Visual Studio™ development system IDE, taking advantage of the industry- leading compiler technology in Visual C++ 5.0 and providing remote versions of key Win32-based tools (Debugger, Spy, Zoomin, Registry Editor, MemView). Visual C++ for Windows CE also supports Microsoft Foundation Classes (MFC), including AppWizard and ClassWizard. In addition, Visual C++ for Windows CE provides new tools and technology specifically for Windows CE-based development: cross-compilers for MIPS and SH3 CPUs, the Remote Connection Server, and the Remote Object Viewer. </p>
<h4>How can I obtain Visual C++ for Windows CE? </h4>
<p>
Visual C++ for Windows CE is available directly from Microsoft, priced at $199 (U.S.), $279 (Canadian), plus shipping and handling. To order in the United States or Canada, please call (800) 424-9688. For international availability, visit the Windows CE developer World Wide Web site at <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsce/developer">http://www.microsoft.com/windowsce/developer</a>. </p>
<h4>What do I need to acquire to begin development for Windows CE using Visual C++ for Windows CE? </h4>
<p>
Visual C++ for Windows CE is an add-on to Visual C++ 5.0. Therefore, you will also need Visual C++ 5.0, Professional or Enterprise editions, to use Visual C++ for Windows CE. If you don't currently have Visual C++ 5.0, you can obtain it when you acquire Visual C++ for Windows CE. Note that the Windows CE SDK and DDK are included as part of Visual C++ for Windows CE; nothing additional is required. </p>
<h4>I am a developer who does not reside in the United States or Canada. How can I acquire Visual C++ for Windows CE? </h4>
<p>
Visual C++ for Windows CE is available directly in Europe by calling 00-353-1-708-8690. For other international availability, visit the Windows CE developer World Wide Web site at <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsce/developer">http://www.microsoft.com/windowsce/developer</a>. </p>
<h4>Can I get upgrade pricing for Visual C++ for Windows CE if I already have Visual C++ 5.0? </h4>
<p>
Because Visual C++ for Windows CE is in its initial release, upgrade pricing is not available. With Visual C++ 5.0—which is required to use Visual C++ for Windows CE—separate upgrade pricing from Visual C++ did not make sense. </p>
<h4>Are all MFC classes supported by Visual C++ for Windows CE? What MFC classes are not supported by Visual C++ for Windows CE? </h4>
<p>
Not all MFC classes are supported in MFC for Windows CE. Nonsupported classes are classes that match one of the following patterns below: 
<ul type=disc>
<li>
OLE – COle*, CRichEdit* and related <br><br></li>
<li>
MDI – CMDI*, CMultiDoc* and related <br><br></li>
<li>
ODBC – CRecord*, CDB*, CDatabase and related <br><br></li>
<li>
DAO – CDao* and related <br><br></li>
<li>
Printing – CPrint* and related <br><br></li>
<li>
The various Internet classes are not supported </li>
</ul>
<h4>How does Visual C++ for Windows CE produce high-quality code on each native platform? </h4>
<p>
Visual C++ for Windows CE provides a set of compiler optimizations designed to take advantage of the specific hardware platforms supported by the Windows CE operating system, for example, SH3 and MIPS. (Note that <i>x</i>86 is currently supported only for emulation because no <i>x</i>86 devices are shipping.) </p>
<h4>What are the system requirements for Visual C++ for Windows CE? </h4>
<p>
Visual C++ for Windows CE requires the following: 
<ul type=disc>
<li>
Microsoft Visual C++, 5.0 Professional or Enterprise editions <br><br></li>
<li>
PC with a 486/66 MHz or higher processor <br><br></li>
<li>
The Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 <br><br></li>
<li>
24 MB of RAM (32 MB recommended) <br><br></li>
<li>
100 MB of available hard disk space <br><br></li>
<li>
CD-ROM drive <br><br></li>
<li>
VGA or higher-resolution monitor (Super VGA recommended) <br><br></li>
<li>
Microsoft Mouse or compatible pointing device </li>
</ul>
<p>
A Windows CE-based H/PC is required for remote development on the Handheld PC device. </p>
<h4>What kind of hardware do I need to develop applications for Windows CE using Visual C++ for Windows CE? </h4>
<p>
Visual C++ for Windows CE has a very minimal requirement for additional hardware. Developers can actually accomplish the majority of their development on their PC using emulation-running applications created using the <i>x</i>86 Windows CE compiler. In addition, developing on Handheld PCs requires no additional hardware because Visual C++ for Windows CE uses the serial port on the Handheld PC for application downloading, debugging, and running remote tools on the Handheld PC. </p>
