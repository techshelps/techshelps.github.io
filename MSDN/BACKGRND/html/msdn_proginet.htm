<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
Large enterprises and small-to-medium organizations are continuing to deploy scalable client-server networking solutions that provide an array of new, user-friendly business applications. These applications are designed to integrate enterprise-wide sources of information more effectively and increase end user productivity. The continued growth of these local area network (LAN)-based business computing solutions has created an unprecedented demand for host-based information within organizations that traditionally used mainframe computer systems for their mission-critical operations. </p>
<p>
To achieve complete integration of enterprise-wide sources of information, organizations need a way to transfer large amounts of data from their host-based systems to their new LAN-based client-server systems. The type of mainframe data, and the means required to access the data, generally depend on the specific LAN-based solution deployed. In general, to transfer large amounts of data throughout an enterprise, organizations and users require a reliable, secure, easily managed and high-speed file transfer method between LAN-based systems and mainframe hosts. </p>
<p>
The optimal data transfer solution should take advantage of the new generation of powerful network and desktop operating systems such as Microsoft® Windows NT™, Windows® 95, and Windows for Workgroups, be integrated into the server and desktop environments, and be intuitive to use. The specific file transfer method must transparently bridge the data between the host, the desktop, and the LAN server. Further, highly managed, enterprise-wide file transfer must efficiently communicate over common LAN and wide area network (WAN) protocols such as systems network architecture (SNA) and transmission control protocol/Internet protocol (TCP/IP). </p>
<p>
These enterprise-wide data transfer requirements are fulfilled through a unique combination of products from Proginet and Microsoft Corporation. This article briefly reviews the history of mainframe to desktop file transfer and explains the benefits of using the Proginet Fusion File Transfer Management System (Fusion FTMS™) in conjunction with Microsoft SNA Server to support the deployment of scalable client-server networking solutions.</p>
<h2>Traditional Mainframe-to-PC File Transfer Solutions</h2>
<p>
Historically, common mainframe-to-PC file transfer software solutions consist of a mix of file transfer alternatives. Many mainframe-centric networks still use old Bisync and RJE-based SNA file transfer utilities that were primarily developed by in-house applications development staff. Perhaps the most widely used file transfer method in large corporate networks is the 3270 terminal emulation method.</p>
<h3>The Evolution of Mainframe-to-PC File Transfer</h3>
<p>
In the early 1980s, personal computers were adapted to support the 3270 host access terminal, thus enabling PC users to access host resources and transfer files to and from their computers more easily. Although the 3270 or LU 2-based file transfer methods are still in use, they cannot adequately meet the demanding requirements of today's data-intensive networked applications.</p>
<p>
During the late 1980s, a new breed of LU 6.2 file transfer applications were introduced. These applications promised higher performance, richer functionality, and a wide range of platform coverage. Although they were very robust and useful, they were primarily developed for organizations that used the IBM® SNA as their backbone network. </p>

<h3>Trends in Mainframe-to-PC File Transfer</h3>
<p>
Large organizations began shifting their focus to more pervasive network communications standards such as TCP/IP during the early 1990s. This standard is being adopted by large companies and government agencies as the preferred backbone and WAN protocol. File transfer protocol (FTP), the common protocol for TCP/IP connections, is the only commercial file transfer solution for TCP/IP networks. Although FTP is implemented by every computer and operating system vendor, it lacks the robust management functionality required for production- level applications, features often found in SNA-based file transfer solutions. </p>
<p>
What most current mainframe-to-PC file transfer software fail to provide is a clear SNA-to- TCP/IP migration solution that is based on a reliable, high performance, and extensible server platform. Proginet Fusion FTMS, based on Microsoft Windows NT Server and SNA Server, provides this migration solution.</p>
<h2>Next-Generation File Transfer Solution: Fusion FTMS</h2>
<p>
Fusion FTMS is the first multi-protocol, next-generation file transfer management system designed and optimized for integrating host-based data with new client-server based mission-critical business applications. </p>
<h3>Host-Based Component</h3>
<p>
Based on the IBM MVS/ESA host and Windows NT Server with SNA Server combination, Fusion FTMS manages high-speed file transfers between the MVS host, LAN servers and desktops. Fusion FTMS supports a variety of network communications protocols, such as SNA, TCP/IP, IPX/SPX, and remote access service (RAS).</p>

<h2>SNA Server and the Benefits of Using SNA Gateways</h2>
<h3>SNA Server Overview</h3>
<p>
Microsoft SNA Server is a LAN-to-SNA gateway that provides SNA communications for LAN-based services and multiple-platform PC workstations that run a variety of network protocols. SNA Server employs a client-server architecture that is tightly integrated with, and leverages the strengths of, Microsoft Windows NT Server. SNA Server can be configured as an IBM PU 2.0, PU 2.1, APPN LEN node, or it can support a downstream physical unit (DSPU). The LU services provided by SNA Server are LU 0, 1,2,3 and LU 6.2. SNA API support is comprehensive, with the inclusion of APPC, EHNAPPC, CPI-C, CSV, and LUA/SLI. SNA Server also supports TN3270 clients via the inclusion of a TN3270 server, and it provides for high-speed LU 6.2/APPC file transfer through integrated support of Proginet's Fusion FTMS.</p>
<p>
SNA Server allows for comprehensive bidirectional SNA access while maintaining LAN protocol transport independence. All popular PC operating systems are supported, including Windows NT Workstation, Windows, Windows for Workgroups, Windows 95, MS-DOS®, OS/2, UNIX, and Macintosh. SNA Server also supports multiple network protocols, including Novell® IPX/SPX, TCP/IP, Banyan VINES IP, named pipes, Appletalk, and RAS.</p>
<h3>Benefits of Using an SNA Gateway</h3>
<p>
Most large enterprises that employ mainframes and AS/400® systems generally possess a variety of LANs, but do not use SNA gateways. Direct connection of PCs to mainframes and AS/400 systems remains the most popular connection scheme. Despite widespread acceptance, these approaches are expensive, waste resources on both ends, and are difficult to administer. The drawbacks of direct connections to SNA-based systems are alleviated through the use of flexible and robust SNA gateways such as Microsoft SNA Server. SNA Server provides many significant advantages for the desktop user, LAN administrator, and host administrator, when compared to connecting PCs directly to SNA host computers.</p>
<p>
<img src="proginet_4.gif" border=0></p>
<p class=label>
<b>Figure 4. The SNA Server client-server architecture allows for transport-independent host access through all popular LAN protocols.</b></p>
<h3>Benefits to the Desktop User</h3>
<p>
Microsoft SNA Server increases stability, saves memory, and reduces complexity at the desktop by allowing the choice of only one protocol per desktop. In contrast, when connecting directly, the DLC [802.2/LLC) protocol will be required to connect to the host, and a LAN protocol (such as TCP/IP, IPX/SPX, or Banyan VINES) will be required to connect to the file/print/database/mail/systems management server on the LAN. </p>
<p>
Below are some of the benefits of SNA Server:
<ul type=disc>
<li>
<i>Increased stability and memory savings</i>. <ul type=disc>
<li>
The data link control (DLC) protocol is a terminate-and-stay-resident (TSR) program, and thus requires a real-mode network device interface specification (NDIS) or open data-link (ODI) driver. Eliminating real-mode TSRs and drivers not only saves real mode memory—it can also improve the stability of the desktop. Most systems running Windows will stop working when there are problems in the interaction between real and protected modes. <br><br></li>
<li>
Computers running Windows for Workgroups version 3.11 or Windows 95 can use the fully protected-mode NDIS or ODI protocol stacks.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<i>Reduced complexity</i>. <ul type=disc>
<li>
The IBM DLC protocol (LAN support program) only works with certain adapters and protocol stacks. Selecting compatible products, and then creating and maintaining configurations that provide concurrent SNA and LAN protocol support is too complex compared to using an SNA Gateway.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<i>Increased LAN protocol choice</i>.<ul type=disc>
<li>
Desktop users can select the LAN protocol that best suits their needs.<br><br></li>
<li>
Complementary solutions provided by Microsoft business partners are written to the SNA Server client-server API, and take full advantage of the protocol independence designed into the SNA Server client and server software.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Benefits to the LAN Administrator</h3>
<p>
SNA Server is designed to provide easier administration, greater security, and configuration flexibility. When connecting directly, each desktop must be configured individually with the host's network address, LU name, and XID. Whenever there is a change on the host side, such as when the XID is updated, all desktops must be reconfigured. In large organizations, where thousands of desktop systems need access to host applications, reconfiguration of large desktop populations can be an overwhelming task. With SNA Server, there's nothing to configure on the client end. All host changes can be tracked centrally by the LAN administrator through the SNA Server Admin tool.
<ul type=disc>
<li>
<i>SNA Server eases administration with built-in performance and troubleshooting tools</i>. When all host-bound traffic is concentrated through SNA Server, the LAN administrator can use the performance monitoring, event logging, and tracing capabilities of the server platform. An individual desktop problem is easier to work around by simply assigning a new LU, while the administrator performs tracing and debugging at the server without interrupting other users or restarting the server.<br><br></li>
<li>
<i>SNA Server provides integrated security for all users</i>. The LAN administrator can control access to the host by using the integrated security features of Windows NT Server and SNA Server. In contrast, direct connection allows each desktop user to access the host by simply knowing the applicable host parameters. A gateway adds another level of flexible security.<br><br></li>
<li>
<i>SNA Server provides exceptional configuration flexibility</i>. SNA Server lets LAN administrators configure and implement a variety of host connectivity options. SNA Server can be located at remote locations and use leased line or dial-up SDLC, X.25, integrated services digital network (ISDN), or Frame Relay connectivity to the host. This is illustrated by the branch configuration in Figure 5, below.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<img src="proginet_5.gif" border=0></p>
<p class=label>
<b>Figure 5. Branch configuration—SNA Server provides the host link for remote clients. No configuration is required at the client desktops.</b></p>
<p class=tl>
Optionally, SNA Server can be located at or close to the host by employing direct channel attachment, Twinax, DFT, Token Ring, or Ethernet connections. This centralized configuration is depicted in Figure 6, below. The variety of host connectivity options allows administrators and solution providers to tailor the configuration to meet their needs.</P><p>
<img src="proginet_6.gif" border=0></p>
<p class=label>
<b>Figure 6. Centralized configuration—All host access is routed through SNA Server. SNA traffic is isolated to the data center while native LAN protocols are used on the corporate WAN.</b></p>
<h3>Benefits to the Host Administrator</h3>
<p>
Microsoft SNA Server reduces the frequency of VTAM® gen redefinitions, lessens host memory requirements, frees up expensive host CPU cycles, saves network bandwidth, and provides more reliability than direct connect client configurations.
<ul type=disc>
<li>
<i>SNA Server reduces frequency of VTAM gens</i>. SNA Server dramatically reduces (re)definition work on the host. With SNA Server, hundreds of users can be supported by defining a single PU or controller, instead of having to define one for each end user. Especially on mainframe systems, VTAM gens must be scheduled in advance. With the high cost and inevitable downtime involved, there is little margin for error. With SNA Server, however, host administrators can rely on end-user definitions to minimize downtime and allow for more flexible changes at the gateway as needed.<br><br></li>
<li>
<i>SNA Server reduces host memory requirements</i>. In the direct connection model, the hundreds of end-user definitions are typically stored in resident memory on the host system, consuming expensive host resources. By assigning individual user accounts to host resources on the SNA Server computer, SNA Server allows memory savings to be realized on the host system, which can result in hardware savings and improved host performance. Many large enterprises reach a point where they are forced to start using SNA gateways because they run out of physical address space for definitions in VTAM.<br><br></li>
<li>
<i>SNA Server allows expensive host CPU cycles to be focused on their primary objective—running applications</i>. If you have direct connections to the host, each of these connections must be managed individually by the host's control software, consuming expensive CPU cycles. Some studies have shown that you can free up as much as 30 percent of an AS/400's CPU simply by switching from direct connections to a gateway approach. In the mainframe environment, IBM invented the front-end processor (FEP) because host performance was substantially degraded when a large number of network connections were maintained. In fact, a FEP can be considered a gateway. A channel-attached SNA Server can augment or replace FEP hardware, plus the associated annual software maintenance fees. <br><br></li>
<li>
<i>SNA Server saves network bandwidth</i>. Instead of the host having to poll all desktops individually to maintain direct connections (even when there's no activity), the host has to maintain one connection when using a gateway. This can dramatically reduce network traffic and result in better network performance, as well as reduce session time-out problems.<br><br></li>
<li>
<i>SNA Server provides higher reliability</i>. SNA Server overcomes the typical objections to using gateways through its excellent stability, hot backup, and load balancing features. In addition, because it is integrated with Windows NT Server, SNA Server can provide the scalability of symmetric multiprocessing and offer more raw CPU power than any other SNA gateway.</li>
</ul>
<h2>SNA Server Integrates Heterogeneous Environments</h2>
<p>
Most enterprise environments include desktops running Windows, Windows for Workgroups, Windows NT Workstation, Windows 95, MS-DOS, Macintosh, OS/2 and UNIX. The networking mix contains IPX/SPX, TCP/IP, NetBEUI, Banyan VINES IP, and Appletalk, in addition to SNA protocols. IS directors wish they had a single solution to provide IBM mainframe and AS/400 data to every desktop. Corporate data on the host systems must be made available to users in the simplest and most efficient manner. The days of hard copy reports and hand-keying of information back into disparate systems are long over. Online access and the sophisticated integration of enterprise data offered by client-server technologies are demanded by end users. </p>
<p>
Microsoft SNA Server provides the solution for this heterogeneous reality, while offering the extensibility demanded by the ever-changing computing environment. Large enterprises and small to medium organizations no longer have to worry about how users will access host data across the network today or tomorrow.</p>
<p>
<img src="proginet_7.gif" border=0></p>
<p class=label>
<b>Figure 7. SNA Server offers a flexible SNA gateway, multiple client support, and intelligent server-based host services for today's heterogeneous environments.</b></p>
<h3>Integrating LAN and SNA Protocols Made Easy</h3>
<p>
Microsoft SNA Server provides a single access method for all hosts by solving the problem of mixing disparate LAN and SNA protocols on a single network. Due to SNA Server's extensive support for SNA and LAN protocols, in most cases LAN administrators do not have to make any changes to their current network structure. It fits right in. Whether organizations are using protocols such as TCP/IP or IPX, or need to support Banyan VINES IP, Appletalk, NetBEUI or remote dial-up clients, SNA Server can meet their needs. SNA Server extends access to all SNA functions, to all network clients, through its protocol-independent client-server architecture. The result is that desktop users can use their favorite host access product, no matter which client operating system or networking architecture is currently in place or planned for the future.</p>
<h3>Scalable Platform from 1 to 10,000 Host Sessions</h3>
<p>
Because Microsoft SNA Server is integrated with Windows NT Server, it can grow with organizations as they increase the number of users connecting through the gateway, the number of host connections, or the types of applications that use gateway services.
<ul type=disc>
<li>
<i>Server capacity</i>. SNA Server provides the highest capacity of any SNA gateway.<ul type=disc>
<li>
Each SNA Server can support up to 2,000 users and 10,000 sessions. <br><br></li>
<li>
Each SNA Server can connect to up to 250 mainframes, AS/400s, or downstream devices. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<i>SNA Server is designed for growth</i>. SNA Server can take advantage of the following new hardware platforms for best performance.<ul type=disc>
<li>
Intel® x86<br><br></li>
<li>
Pentium®<br><br></li>
<li>
MIPS®<br><br></li>
<li>
Alpha AXP™<br><br></li>
<li>
PowerPC™</li>
</ul>
<p class=tl>
The SNA Server architecture is also designed to take advantage of multiprocessor versions of each of these systems. Running SNA Server on a multiprocessor system can dramatically improve performance in cases of high load or heavy traffic<i> </i></P></li>
<li>
<i>Integration with Windows NT Server</i>. SNA Server takes advantage of the following advanced features in Microsoft Windows NT Server.<ul type=disc>
<li>
Windows NT domain security<br><br></li>
<li>
Performance monitoring<br><br></li>
<li>
Event logging and auditing<br><br></li>
<li>
Multithreading<br><br></li>
<li>
Virtual memory management</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<i>A large number of server-based applications run on SNA Server</i>. SNA Server's APIs and Windows NT Server's Win32 APIs are fully documented and available in the public domain. SNA Server supports an ever-increasing number of Microsoft and third-party host-to-LAN services running on the SNA Server computer.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Hot Backup and Load Balancing</h3>
<p>
In any large IS environment, a gateway can be viewed as a single point of failure. For mission-critical use, Microsoft recommends a minimum of two SNA Servers to provide fault tolerance. Up to 50 SNA Servers can be grouped together to provide load balancing and hot backup, allowing sessions to be automatically rerouted to a backup gateway should the primary gateway or host link fail. The load balancing and hot backup features work both for mainframe connections and AS/400 connections, and for dependent and independent LUs. For highest speed mainframe connectivity, SNA Server works with direct channel attached technology such as Barr System's Channel Adapter or Bus-Tech Inc.'s 3172-NT. Each of these devices can provide host access much more quickly than the fastest direct LAN attachments.</p>
<h3>Administration</h3>
<p>
A single Windows NT Workstation or Windows NT Server located anywhere in the corporate network can configure and manage all the SNA Servers in the network by using graphical tools that are included with the product. If&nbsp; the servers reside at a central location, the IS staff can be responsible for administering and monitoring all host access. This can also be accomplished from the IBM host console because of the integration of SNA Server with NetView facilities.
<ul type=disc>
<li>
<i>IBM NetView Alerts</i>. SNA Server can be configured to provide custom alerts to NetView, in addition to informational messages and alerts to any Windows NT Server in the domain .<br><br></li>
<li>
<i>IBM NetView RunCmd</i>. NetView RunCmd support enables the NetView operator to directly control all functions on the Windows NT Server running SNA Server. The SNA Server RunCmd service is a daemon service running on the server that extends access of the Windows NT command line to NetView.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Licensing Flexibility</h3>
<p>
For maximum acquisition and implementation flexibility, SNA Server licenses can be purchased under two different models. 
<ul type=disc>
<li>
<i>Client-based</i>. In this model, you purchase as many SNA Server licenses as you need, and a client license for each desktop that can access any of the SNA Servers in your network. On a large network with multiple servers, this model provides substantial cost savings. Any additional cost is accrued through the addition of the server license. Other gateway vendors often require twice the total cost of the first server to gain fault tolerance. As in the server-based model, increasing your capacity is as easy as purchasing additional client licenses. You can move at your own pace as users are added and your network grows. <br><br></li>
<li>
<i>Server-based</i>. In this model, you purchase an SNA Server license and as many client licenses as there are concurrent desktops accessing the server. To add additional desktops, simply purchase additional client licenses. There is no requirement to purchase packs of licenses beyond what you need. </li>
</ul>
<p>
Each of these models has specific advantages when implementing SNA Server solutions. The client-based approach is more desirable for multiple server environments that require extra capacity, load balancing, or hot backup.</p>
