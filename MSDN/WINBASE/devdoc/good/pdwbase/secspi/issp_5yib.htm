<h3><a name="_win32_datagram_contexts"></a>Datagram Contexts</h3>
<p>
Datagram, or connectionless, contexts have slightly different semantics from connection-oriented contexts. A connectionless context implies that the server has no way of determining when the client has shut down or otherwise terminated the connection. In other words, no termination notice is passed from the transport application to the server, as would occur in a connection context. To better support some models, particularly DCE-style RPC, the following rules apply when the client specifies the ISC_REQ_DATAGRAM flag in its call to the <a href="issp_93ec.htm"><b>InitializeSecurityContext</b></a> function:
<ol>
<li>
The security package does not produce an authentication blob (binary large object) on the first call to the <b>InitializeSecurityContext</b> function. However, the client can immediately use the returned security context in a call to the <a href="issp_2b51.htm"><b>MakeSignature</b></a> function to generate a signature for a message.</li>
<li>
The security package must allow for the context to be re-established multiple times to allow the server to drop the connection without notice. This also implies that any keys used in the <b>MakeSignature</b> and <a href="issp_0t45.htm"><b>VerifySignature</b></a> functions can be reset to a consistent state.</li>
<li>
The security package must allow for the caller to specify sequence information, and must provide it back again at the other end. This is not exclusive of any sequence information maintained by the package, and can be viewed as a special payload.</li>
</ol>
<p>
A security package sets the SECPKG_FLAG_DATAGRAM flag to indicate that it supports datagram semantics. </p>
