<h2><a name="_win32_sspi_model"></a>SSPI Model</h2>
<p>
The Security Support Provider Interface (SSPI) allows an application to use any of the various security models available on a computer or network without changing the interface to the security system. SSPI does not establish credentials (logon), because that is generally a privileged operation handled by the operating system.</p>
<p>
A <i>security provider</i> is a dynamic-link library that implements the Security Support Provider Interface to make one or more <i>security packages</i> available to applications. Each security package provides the necessary mapping between the SSPI and the actual security model, such as Kerberos or Microsoft LAN Manager. </p>
<p>
An application can use the <a href="issp_0tpw.htm">package management</a> functions to list the security packages available and select one to support its needs. The application then uses the <a href="issp_3oxg.htm">credential management</a> functions to obtain a handle to the credentials of the user on whose behalf they are executing. With this handle, the application can use the <a href="issp_4jn8.htm">context management</a> functions to create a security context to a service. A <i>security context</i> is an opaque data structure that contains the security data relevant to a connection, such as a session key, the duration of the session, and so on. Finally, the application uses the security context with the <a href="issp_4w38.htm">message support</a> functions to ensure message integrity and privacy during the connection.</p>
