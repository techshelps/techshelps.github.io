<h2><a name="_win32_credential_management"></a>Credential Management</h2>
<p>
The credential management functions of the Security Support Provider Interface enable applications to gain access to the credentials of a principal, or to free such access. This interface does not allow any other access to the credentials. A <i>principal</i> is an entity recognized by the security system. This includes human users as well as autonomous processes. <i>Credentials</i> are data, such as a password or a Kerberos ticket, used by a principal to establish the identity of the principal.</p>
<p>
The <a href="issp_9azp.htm"><b>AcquireCredentialsHandle</b></a> function acquires a handle to the pre-existing logon credentials of a specified principal. Applications can use the credentials handle with the <a href="issp_4jn8.htm">context management</a> functions to create a security context. </p>
<p>
The <a href="issp_710l.htm"><b>FreeCredentialsHandle</b></a> function releases a credential handle and associated resources back to the security package.</p>
<p>
The <b>QueryCredentialsAttributes<u> </u></b>function queries attributes, such as the associated name, of the credential handle.</p>
<p>
The credential management functions use a credential handle, which is a reference to an opaque security object. All references to security objects, such as credentials and contexts, are done through a handle. The security provider dereferences a handle to access the credentials. A credential handle with the value {0xFFFFFFFF, 0xFFFFFFFF} is always invalid.</p>
