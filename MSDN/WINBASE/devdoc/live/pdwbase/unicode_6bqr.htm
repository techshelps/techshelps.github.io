<h1><a name="_win32_unicode_and_character_sets"></a>Unicode and Character Sets</h1>
<p>
The Microsoft® Win32® API provides support for the many different written languages of the international marketplace through Unicode and traditional character sets. Unicode is a worldwide character-encoding standard that uses 16-bit character values to represent all the characters used in modern computing, including technical symbols and special characters used in publishing. Traditional character sets are previous character-encoding standards, such as the Windows ANSI character set, that use 8-bit character values or combinations of 8-bit values to represent the characters used in a specific language or geographical region.</p>
<p>
This overview describes the character set functions and explains how to use them in your Win32-based applications.</p>
