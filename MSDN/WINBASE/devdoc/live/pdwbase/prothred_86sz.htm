<h1><a name="_win32_processes_and_threads"></a>Processes and Threads</h1>
<p>
A Win32®-based application consists of one or more processes. A <i>process</i>, in the simplest terms, is an executing program. One or more threads run in the context of the process. A <i>thread</i> is the basic unit to which the operating system allocates processor time. A thread can execute any part of the process code, including parts currently being executed by another thread. A <i>fiber</i> is a unit of execution that must be manually scheduled by the application. Fibers run in the context of the threads that schedule them. </p>
<p>
A <i>job object</i> allows groups of processes to be managed as a unit. Job objects are namable, securable, sharable objects that control attributes of the processes associated with them. Operations performed on the job object affect all processes associated with the job object. </p>
