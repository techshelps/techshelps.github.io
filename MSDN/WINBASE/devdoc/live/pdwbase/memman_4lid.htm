<h3><a name="_win32_page_state"></a>Page State</h3>
<p>
The pages of a process's virtual address space can be in one of the following states. </p>
<table cellspacing=4 cols=2>
<tr valign=top>
<th align=left width=18%>State</th>
<th align=left width=82%>Description</th>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=18%>Free</td>
<td width=82%>A free page is not currently accessible, but it is available to be committed or reserved.</td>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=18%>Reserved</td>
<td width=82%>A reserved page is a block of the process's virtual address space that has been set aside for future use. The process cannot access a reserved page, and there is no physical storage associated with it. A reserved page reserves a range of virtual addresses that cannot be used subsequently by other allocation functions. A process can use the <a href="memman_3elf.htm"><b>VirtualAlloc</b></a> function to reserve pages of its address space and later to commit the reserved pages. It can use the <a href="memman_0dr9.htm"><b>VirtualFree</b></a> function to release them.</td>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=18%>Committed</td>
<td width=82%>A committed page is one for which physical storage (in memory or on disk) has been allocated. It can be protected to allow either no access or read-only access, or it can have read and write access. A process can use the <b>VirtualAlloc</b> function to allocate committed pages. The <a href="memman_66qr.htm"><b>GlobalAlloc</b></a> and <a href="memman_2fxf.htm"><b>LocalAlloc</b></a> functions allocate committed pages with read-write access. A committed page allocated by <b>VirtualAlloc</b> can be decommitted by the <b>VirtualFree</b> function, which releases the page's storage and changes the state of the page to reserved.</td>
