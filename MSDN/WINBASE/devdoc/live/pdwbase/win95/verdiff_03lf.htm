<h1><a name="_win95_edit_control_differences"></a>Edit Control Differences</h1>
<p>
In a version 3.<i>x</i> application, an edit control that is the descendant of an inactive window takes the input focus when the user clicks the control; an edit control in a version 4.0 application does not. Not taking the input focus prevents the situation where the user can enter text into what appears to be an inactive window. </p>
<p>
An edit control in a version 3.<i>x</i> application retrieves its text and background colors by sending the WM_CTLCOLOREDIT message to its parent window. In a version 4.0 application, an edit control sends the WM_CTLCOLOREDIT or WM_CTLCOLORSTATIC message. The edit control sends WM_CTLCOLORSTATIC if it is disabled or read-only; otherwise, it sends WM_CTLCOLOREDIT. In addition, a disabled multiline edit control in a version 4.0 application uses the COLOR_GRAYTEXT value as its text color. </p>
<p>
A multiline edit control in a version 4.0 application has a proportional scroll box (thumb), but a multiline edit control in a version 3.<i>x</i> application does not. </p>
<p>
In a version 3.<i>x</i> application, the <i>wParam</i> parameter of the EM_REPLACESEL message is not used. In a version 4.0 application, the <i>wParam</i> parameter is a flag that specifies whether the replacement operation can be undone.</p>
