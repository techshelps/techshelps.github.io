<h2><a name="_win95_last_access_date"></a>Last Access Date</h2>
<p>
The Windows 95 last access date is intended to reflect the last time a file was accessed for the purpose for which it was created. This date is intended to provide a means for applications, users, or both to determine which files have not been used recently. When an application saves a file, the system automatically resets the last access date. An application that cannot understand the contents of the files it is accessing should save the last access date and restore it after closing the file. For example, applications that back up a file, search files for strings, and scan for viruses should save and restore the last access date.</p>
<p>
Applications should allow the system to set the last access date in the following cases:
<ul>
<li>
Running a program should set the last access date for the .EXE file.</li>
<li>
Loading a dynamic-link library (DLL) should set the last access date for the .DLL file.</li>
<li>
Editing or printing a document should set the last access date for the document file.</li>
<li>
In general, any use of a document by an application that creates or modifies that type of document should set the last access date (unless the document is being opened only to decide whether it is to be used in a find operation).</li>
<li>
Application use of peripheral files (.INI files and so on) should set the last access date.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Win32-based applications can preserve the last access date by using the <a href="../time_5r51.htm"><b>GetFileTime</b></a> and <a href="../time_33qd.htm"><b>SetFileTime</b></a> functions. Applications written for MS-DOS or Windows version 3. <i>x</i> can use Get Last Access Date and Time (<a href="95func_6foo.htm">Interrupt 21h Function 5704h</a>) and Set Last Access Date and Time (<a href="95func_6fqg.htm">Interrupt 21h Function 5705h</a>), or they can open the file with Create or Open File (<a href="95func_2i3s.htm">Interrupt 21h Function 716Ch</a>) using the OPEN_ACCESS_RO_NOMODLASTACCESS (0004h) access mode.</p>
