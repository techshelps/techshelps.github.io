<h3><a name="_win95_preserving_filenames"></a>Preserving Filenames</h3>
<p>
Certain operations, such as copy, backup, and restore, using older versions of utilities that have not been updated to support long filenames will destroy the long filename. Running a utility called LFNBK that comes with Windows 95 before using older backup utilities will preserve the long filenames. Following are the steps for using LFNBK to backup and restore a disk:
<ol>
<li>
Preserve the long filename and alias (the 8.3 filename) association<b> </b>by running<b> LFNBK /b </b><i>drive-letter</i>, where <i>drive-letter</i> is the drive that you plan to back up.</li>
<li>
Back up the drive (specified as <i>drive-letter</i> in the previous step) using an old backup program that is not be aware of long filenames.</li>
<li>
Restore the backup files to a drive, when necessary at some later point, using an old restore program that is not be aware of long filenames.</li>
<li>
Restore the long filenames on the drive, by running <b>LFNBK /r </b><i>drive-letter</i>, where <i>drive-letter</i> is the drive where the files were restored to.</li>
</ol>
