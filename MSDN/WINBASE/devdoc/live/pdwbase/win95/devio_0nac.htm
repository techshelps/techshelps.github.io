<h2><a name="_win95_closing_a_vxd"></a>Closing a VxD</h2>
<p>
When you have finished using a VxD, you can close the associated device handle by using the <a href="../handobj_289x.htm"><b>CloseHandle</b></a> function, or you can let the operating system close the handle when the application terminates. The following example closes a VxD.</p>
<pre><code>CloseHandle(hDevice);
 </code></pre>
<p>
Closing a VxD does not necessarily remove the VxD from memory. If you open a dynamically loadable VxD using the FILE_FLAG_DELETE_ON_CLOSE value, <a href="../handobj_289x.htm"><b>CloseHandle</b></a> also removes the VxD if no other valid handles are present in the system. The system maintains a reference count for dynamically loadable VxDs, incrementing the count each time the VxD is opened and decrementing when the VxD is closed. <b>CloseHandle</b> checks this count and removes the VxD from memory when the count reaches zero. The system does not keep a reference count for static VxDs; it does not remove these VxDs when their corresponding handles are closed. </p>
<p>
In rare cases, you may need to use the <a href="../filesio_5n8l.htm"><b>DeleteFile</b></a> function to remove a dynamically loadable VxD from memory. For example, you use <b>DeleteFile</b> if another application has loaded the VxD and you just want to unload it. You also use <b>DeleteFile</b> if you have successfully loaded a VxD by using <a href="../filesio_7wmd.htm"><b>CreateFile</b></a>, but the VxD does not support the device IOCTL interface. In such cases, <b>CreateFile</b> loads the VxD but provides no handle to close and remove the VxD. The following example removes the VxD named SAMPLE from memory.</p>
<pre><code>DeleteFile("\\\\.\\SAMPLE");
 </code></pre>
<p>
In this example, SAMPLE is the module name of the VxD. (Do not specify the filename.) Be aware that the module name of a VxD is not necessarily the same as the VxD's filename without a filename extension. In general, avoid using <a href="../filesio_5n8l.htm"><b>DeleteFile</b></a> to remove a VxD from memory.</p>
