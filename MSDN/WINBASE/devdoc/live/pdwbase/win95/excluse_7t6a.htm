<h3><a name="_win95_level_2"></a>Level 2</h3>
<p>
The level 2 lock prevents all processes except the lock owner from writing to the disk, but the lock allows any application to read from it. Depending on the permissions set when the application obtained the level 1 lock, the system will either block or fail write operations and either allow or fail new file mappings. Before obtaining a level 3 lock, an application should call Get Lock Flag State (<a href="95func_9s14.htm">Interrupt 21h Function 440Dh Minor Code 6Ch</a>) to determine if anything on the disk has changed, such as the swap file growing or shrinking. Calling Get Lock Flag State at this point is an optimization that is done to avoid obtaining the level 3 lock unnecessarily.</p>
<p>
Calling an unlock physical or logical volume function on a level 2 lock decrements the lock level to 1 and causes the system to perform previously blocked operations that are allowed at the lower lock level.</p>
