<h3><a name="_win32_overlapped_operations"></a>Overlapped Operations</h3>
<p>
Overlapped operations enable a thread to execute a time-consuming I/O operation in the background, leaving the thread free to perform other tasks. To enable overlapped I/O operations on a communications resource, the thread must specify the FILE_FLAG_OVERLAPPED flag in the <a href="filesio_7wmd.htm"><b>CreateFile</b></a> function when the handle is opened. To execute the <a href="filesio_39id.htm"><b>ReadFile</b></a> or <a href="filesio_3kkl.htm"><b>WriteFile</b></a> function as an overlapped operation, the calling thread must specify a pointer to an <a href="synchro_8tf6.htm"><b>OVERLAPPED</b></a> structure.The <b>OVERLAPPED</b> structure must contain a handle to a manual-reset (not an auto-reset) event object. The system sets the state of the event object to not-signaled when a call to the I/O function returns before the operation has been completed. The system sets the state of the event object to signaled when the operation has been completed. The thread uses a wait function to check the current state of the event object or to wait for its state to be signaled. </p>
<p>
The <a href="filesio_0660.htm"><b>ReadFileEx</b></a> and <a href="filesio_8r08.htm"><b>WriteFileEx</b></a> functions can be performed only as overlapped operations. The calling thread specifies a pointer to the <a href="filesio_1v1h.htm"><b>FileIOCompletionRoutine</b></a> function, which is executed when the overlapped operation is completed. The completion routine is executed only if the calling thread performs an alertable operation. </p>
<p>
For more information about event objects, wait functions, alertable waits, and completion routines, see <a href="synchro_4q3y.htm">Synchronization</a>. </p>
