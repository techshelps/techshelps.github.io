<h3><a name="_win32_context_switches"></a>Context Switches</h3>
<p>
The scheduler maintains a queue of executable threads for each priority level. These are known as <i>ready threads</i>. When a processor becomes available, the system performs a <i>context switch</i>. The steps in a context switch are: 
<ol>
<li>
Save the context of the thread that just finished executing. </li>
<li>
Place the thread that just finished executing at the end of the queue for its priority. </li>
<li>
Find the highest priority queue that contains ready threads. </li>
<li>
Remove the thread at the head of the queue, load its context, and execute it. </li>
</ol>
<p>
The following classes of threads are not ready threads. 
<ul>
<li>
Threads created with the CREATE_SUSPENDED flag </li>
<li>
Threads halted during execution with the <a href="prothred_7gkk.htm"><b>SuspendThread</b></a> or <a href="prothred_30h0.htm"><b>SwitchToThread</b></a> function </li>
<li>
Threads waiting for a synchronization object or input. </li>
</ul>
<p>
Until threads that are suspended or blocked become ready to run, the scheduler does not allocate any processor time to them, regardless of their priority. </p>
<p>
The most common reasons for a context switch are: 
<ul>
<li>
The time slice has elapsed. </li>
<li>
A thread with a higher priority has become ready to run. </li>
<li>
A running thread needs to wait. </li>
</ul>
<p>
When a running thread needs to wait, it relinquishes the remainder of its time slice. </p>
