<h2><a name="_win32_thread_connection_to_a_desktop"></a>Thread Connection to a Desktop</h2>
<p>
After a <a href="winsta_2v1q.htm">process connects to a window station</a>, the Win32 server assigns a desktop to the thread making the connection to Win32. The desktop assigned during this connection process cannot be closed by calling the <a href="winsta_99v4.htm"><b>CloseDesktop</b></a> function. The Win32 server determines the desktop to assign to the thread according to the following rules:
<ol>
<li>
If the thread has called the <a href="winsta_9v3k.htm"><b>SetThreadDesktop</b></a> function, it connects to the specified desktop.</li>
<li>
If the thread did not call <b>SetThreadDesktop</b>, it connects to the desktop inherited from the parent process.</li>
<li>
If the thread did not call <b>SetThreadDesktop</b> and did not inherit a desktop, the Win32 server attempts to open for MAXIMUM_ALLOWED access and connect to a desktop as follows:<ol type=a>
<li>
If a desktop name was specified in the <b>lpDesktop</b> member of the <a href="prothred_7sdu.htm"><b>STARTUPINFO</b></a> structure that was passed to the <a href="prothred_9dpv.htm"><b>CreateProcess</b></a> function when the process was created, the thread connects to the specified desktop.</li>
<li>
Otherwise, the thread connects to the default desktop of the window station to which the process connected.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>
The desktop assigned during this connection process cannot be closed by calling the <a href="winsta_99v4.htm"><b>CloseDesktop</b></a> function.</p>
