<h3><a name="_win32_the_localsystem_account"></a>The LocalSystem Account</h3>
<p>
The LocalSystem account is a predefined local account used by system processes. The name of the account is .\System. This account does not have a password. If you specify the LocalSystem account in a call to the <a href="services_3p9h.htm"><b>CreateService</b></a> function, any password information you supply is ignored. </p>
<p>
A service that runs in the context of the LocalSystem account inherits the security context of the SCM. It is not associated with any logged-on user account and does not have credentials (domain name, user name, and password) to be used for verification. This has several implications: 
<ul>
<li>
The service cannot open the registry key <b>HKEY_CURRENT_USER</b>. </li>
<li>
The service can open the registry key <b>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SECURITY</b>.</li>
<li>
The service has limited access to network resources, such as shares and pipes, because it has no credentials and must connect using a null session. The following registry key contains the <b>NullSessionPipes</b> and <b>NullSessionShares</b> values, which are used to specify the pipes and shares to which null sessions may connect: <ul>
<li>
<b>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\<br>
LanmanServer\Parameters</b></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
Alternatively, you could add the REG_DWORD value <b>RestrictNullSessAccess</b> to the key and set it to 0 to allow all null sessions to access all pipes and shares created on that machine.</li>
<li>
The service cannot share objects (pipes, file mapping, synchronization, and so on) with other applications, unless it creates them using either a DACL which allows a user or group of users access to the object or a NULL DACL, which allows everyone access to the object. Note that specifying a NULL DACL is not the same as specifying NULL. If you specify NULL in the <b>lpSecurityDescriptor</b> member of the <a href="accctrl_8gs2.htm"><b>SECURITY_ATTRIBUTES</b></a> structure, access to the object is granted only to processes with the same security context as the process that created the object. For information on specifying a NULL DACL in the security descriptor field, see <a href="acctrlow_6yk3.htm">Allowing Access Using the Low-Level Functions</a>. </li>
<li>
If the service opens a command window and runs a batch file, the user could hit CTRL+C to terminate the batch file and gain access to a command window with LocalSystem permissions. </li>
</ul>
