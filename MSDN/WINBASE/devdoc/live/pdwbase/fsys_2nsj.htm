On an NTFS version 5.0 volume, a file or directory can contain a <i>reparse point</i>, which is a collection of user-defined data. The format of this data is understood by the application which stores the data, and a <i>file system filter</i>, which you install to interpret the data and process the file. When an application sets a reparse point, it stores this data, plus a <i>reparse tag</i>, which uniquely identifies the data it is storing. When the file system opens a file with a reparse point, it attempts to find the file system filter associated with the data format identified by the reparse tag. If such a file system filter is found, the filter processes the file as directed by the reparse data. If no such file system filter is found, the file open operation fails.</p>
<p>
For example, in Windows NT 5.0, reparse points are used to implement NTFS links and the Microsoft Hierarchical Storage Management (HSM) Server. HSM Server uses an administrator-defined set of rules to move infrequently used files to long term storage, such as tape or CD-ROM. It uses reparse points to store information about the file in the file system. This information is stored in a stub file that contains a reparse point whose data points to the device where the actual file is now located. The file system filter can use this information to retrieve the file. </p>
