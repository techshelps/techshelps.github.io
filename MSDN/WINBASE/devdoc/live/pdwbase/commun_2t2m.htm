<h2><a name="_win32_modem_configuration"></a>Modem Configuration</h2>
<p>
Modem configuration functions enable you to configure a modem before making a connection. An application can set modem options and determine the features of a modem without using commands specific to any modem device. Following are the general features an application may set before making a call:
<ul>
<li>
Primary mode of operation (synchronous, asynchronous, and whether error control is enabled).</li>
<li>
V.42 error control (defined by CCITT recommendation V.42), including specific parameters. CCITT stands for the International Telegraph and Telephone Consultative Committee.</li>
<li>
V.42bis (defined by CCITT recommendation V.42bis) and MNP5 data compression.</li>
<li>
Time-out options, including call setup, inactivity, and buffered data delivery.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Before setting a modem's configuration, an application should determine the capabilities of the modem device by using the <a href="commun_4f8z.htm"><b>GetCommProperties</b></a> function. This function fills in a <a href="commun_5w4y.htm"><b>COMMPROP</b></a> structure. This structure contains both a general portion, which applies to all communications devices, and a portion that is specific to each provider subtype. For modem devices, the provider-specific portion of the <b>COMMPROP</b> structure is a <a href="commun_3xf6.htm"><b>MODEMDEVCAPS</b></a> structure.</p>
<p>
An application can get and set the current configuration of a modem by using the <a href="commun_7icn.htm"><b>GetCommConfig</b></a> and <a href="commun_29lz.htm"><b>SetCommConfig</b></a> functions, both of which use a <a href="commun_57qq.htm"><b>COMMCONFIG</b></a> structure. This structure contains both a general portion, which applies to all communications devices, and a portion that is specific to each provider subtype. For modem devices, the provider-specific portion of the <b>COMMCONFIG</b> structure is a <a href="commun_33ea.htm"><b>MODEMSETTINGS</b></a> structure.</p>
<p>
After configuring a modem, an application can use the Telephony Application Programming Interface (TAPI) to actually establish a connection.</p>
<p>
The modem configuration functions do not provide for long-term management and maintenance of a modem. Modem service providers should supply modem configuration dialog boxes for this purpose.</p>
