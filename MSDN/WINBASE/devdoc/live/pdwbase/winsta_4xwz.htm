<h2><a name="_win32_inherited_handles"></a>Inherited Handles</h2>
<p>
When a process is connecting to a window station or desktop, the Win32 server searches the process's handle table for inherited handles. The Win32 server uses the first window station and desktop handles that it finds. If you want a child process to connect to a particular inherited window station or desktop, you must ensure that the only the desired handles are marked inheritable. If a child process inherits multiple window station or multiple desktop handles, the results of the window station and desktop connection are undefined.</p>
<p>
Handles to a window station and desktop that the Win32 server opens while connecting a process to a window station or desktop are not inheritable.</p>
