<p>
Windows NT supports C2-level security as defined by the U.S. Department of Defense. Following are some of the most important requirements of C2-level security: 
<ul>
<li>
It must be possible to control access to a resource by granting or denying access to individual users or named groups of users. </li>
<li>
Memory must be protected so its contents cannot be read after a process frees it. Similarly, a secure file system, such as NTFS, must protect deleted files from being read. </li>
<li>
Users must identify themselves in a unique manner when they log on. All auditable actions must identify the user performing the action. </li>
<li>
System administrators must be able to audit security-related events. Access to this audit data must be limited to authorized administrators. </li>
<li>
The system must protect itself from external interference or tampering, such as modification of the running system or of system files stored on disk. </li>
</ul>
