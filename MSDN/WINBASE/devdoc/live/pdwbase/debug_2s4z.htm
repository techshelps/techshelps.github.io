<h2><a name="_win32_debugging_events"></a>Debugging Events</h2>
<p>
A <i>debugging event</i> is an incident in the process being debugged that causes the kernel to notify the debugger. Debugging events include creating a process, creating a thread, loading a dynamic-link library (DLL), unloading a DLL, sending an output string, and generating an exception. </p>
<p>
If a debugging event occurs while a debugger is waiting for one, the kernel fills the <a href="debug_9gc2.htm"><b>DEBUG_EVENT</b></a> structure specified by <a href="debug_17jo.htm"><b>WaitForDebugEvent</b></a> with information describing the event. </p>
<p>
When the kernel notifies the debugger of a debugging event, it also suspends all threads in the affected process. The threads do not resume execution until the debugger continues the debugging event by using <a href="debug_30qc.htm"><b>ContinueDebugEvent</b></a>. The following debugging events may occur while a process is being debugged. </p>

<td width=75%>Besides the standard exception conditions, an additional exception code can occur during console process debugging. The kernel generates a DBG_CONTROL_C exception code when ctrl+c is input to a console process that handles ctrl+c signals and is being debugged. This exception code is not meant to be handled by applications. An application should never use an exception handler to deal with it. It is raised only for the benefit of the debugger and is only used when a debugger is attached to the console process.</td>
