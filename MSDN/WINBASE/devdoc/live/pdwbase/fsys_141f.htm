<p>
A very large file without a lot of data is said to contain a sparse data set. Applications that use sparse data sets include image processors and high-speed databases. In versions of NTFS prior to version 5.0, the portions of the file that did not contain useful data occupied valuable disk space.</p>
<p>
The file compression introduced in NTFS 3.51 is a partial solution to the problem. The portions of the file that do not contain useful data are set to zero, and file compression compacts the non-data portions. However, file compression has its own drawbacks. Access time may increase due to data compression and decompression.</p>
<p>
NTFS 5.0 introduces another solution, called a <i>sparse file</i>. When the sparse file facilities are used, the system does not allocate hard drive space to a file except in regions where it contains something other than zeros. The default data value of a sparse file is zero.</p>
