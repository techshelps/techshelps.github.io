<h1><a name="_win32_initializecriticalsectionandspincount"></a>InitializeCriticalSectionAndSpinCount</h1>
<p>
The <b>InitializeCriticalSectionAndSpinCount</b> function initializes a critical section object and sets the spin count for the critical section. </p>
<pre><code><b>BOOL InitializeCriticalSectionAndSpinCount(
  LPCRITICAL_SECTION</b><i> lpCriticalSection</i><b>,</b>
<b>                      </b>// pointer to critical section
<b>  DWORD</b><i> dwSpinCount</i>   // spin count for critical section
<b>);</b>
 </code></pre>
<h4>Parameters</h4>
<dl>
<dt>
<i>lpCriticalSection</i></dt>
<dd>
Pointer to the critical section object. </dd>
<dt>
<i>dwSpinCount</i></dt>
<dd>
Specifies the spin count for the critical section object. On single-processor systems, the spin count is ignored and the critical section spin count is set to 0. On multiprocessor systems, if the critical section is unavailable, the calling thread will spin <i>dwSpinCount</i> times before performing a wait operation on a semaphore associated with the critical section. If the critical section becomes free during the spin operation, the calling thread avoids the wait operation. 
</dd>
</dl>
<h4>Return Values</h4>
<p>
If the function succeeds, the return value is nonzero. </p>
<p>
If the function fails, the return value is zero. To get extended error information, call <a href="errors_3uwi.htm"><b>GetLastError</b></a>. </p>
<h4>Remarks</h4>
<p>
The threads of a single process can use a critical section object for mutual-exclusion synchronization. There is no guarantee about the order in which threads will obtain ownership of the critical section, however, the system will be fair to all threads. </p>
<p>
The process is responsible for allocating the memory used by a critical section object, which it can do by declaring a variable of type <b>CRITICAL_SECTION</b>. Before using a critical section, some thread of the process must call the <a href="synchro_2dke.htm"><b>InitializeCriticalSection</b></a> or <b>InitializeCriticalSectionAndSpinCount </b>function to initialize the object. You can subsequently modify the spin count by calling the <a href="synchro_0wvo.htm"><b>SetCriticalSectionSpinCount</b></a> function. </p>
<p>
Once a critical section object has been initialized, the threads of the process can specify the object in the <b>EnterCriticalSection, TryEnterCriticalSection,</b> or <b>LeaveCriticalSection</b> function to provide mutually exclusive access to a shared resource. For similar synchronization between the threads of different processes, use a mutex object. </p>
<p>
A critical section object cannot be moved or copied. The process must also not modify the object, but must treat it as logically opaque. Use only the critical section functions provided by the Win32 API to manage critical section objects. </p>
<p>
The spin count is useful for critical sections of short duration that can experience high levels of contention. Consider a worst-case scenario, in which an application on an SMP system has two or three threads constantly allocating and releasing memory from the heap. The application serializes the heap with a critical section. In the worst-case scenario, contention for the critical section is constant, and each thread makes an expensive call to the <b>WaitForSingleObject</b> function. However, if the spin count is set properly, the calling thread will not immediately call <b>WaitForSingleObject</b> when contention occurs. Instead, the calling thread can acquire ownership of the critical section if it is released during the spin operation. </p>
<p>
You can improve performance significantly by choosing a small spin count for a critical section of short duration. The heap manager uses a spin count of roughly 4000 for its per-heap critical sections. This gives great performance and scalability in almost all worst-case scenarios.</p>
<p>
In low memory situations, <b>InitializeCriticalSectionAndSpinCount</b> can raise a STATUS_NO_MEMORY exception. </p>
