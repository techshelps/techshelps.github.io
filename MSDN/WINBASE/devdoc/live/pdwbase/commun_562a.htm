<p>
The <b>COMSTAT</b> structure contains information about a communications device. This structure is filled by the <a href="commun_5e42.htm"><b>ClearCommError</b></a> function. </p>
<pre><code>typedef struct _COMSTAT { 
    DWORD fCtsHold : 1;   // Tx waiting for CTS signal 
    DWORD fDsrHold : 1;   // Tx waiting for DSR signal 
    DWORD fRlsdHold : 1;  // Tx waiting for RLSD signal 
    DWORD fXoffHold : 1;  // Tx waiting, XOFF char received 
    DWORD fXoffSent : 1;  // Tx waiting, XOFF char sent 
    DWORD fEof : 1;       // EOF character sent

<h4>Members</h4>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>fCtsHold</b></dt>
<dd>
Specifies whether transmission is waiting for the CTS (clear-to-send) signal to be sent. If this member is TRUE, transmission is waiting. </dd>
<dt>
<b>fDsrHold</b></dt>
<dd>
Specifies whether transmission is waiting for the DSR (data-set-ready) signal to be sent. If this member is TRUE, transmission is waiting. </dd>
<dt>
<b>fRlsdHold</b></dt>
<dd>
Specifies whether transmission is waiting for the RLSD (receive-line-signal-detect) signal to be sent. If this member is TRUE, transmission is waiting. </dd>
<dt>
<b>fXoffHold</b></dt>
<dd>
Specifies whether transmission is waiting because the XOFF character was received. If this member is TRUE, transmission is waiting. </dd>
<dt>
<b>fXoffSent</b></dt>
<dd>
Specifies whether transmission is waiting because the XOFF character was transmitted. If this member is TRUE, transmission is waiting. Transmission halts when the XOFF character is transmitted to a system that takes the next character as XON, regardless of the actual character. </dd>
<dt>
<b>fEof</b></dt>
<dd>
Specifies whether the end-of-file (EOF) character has been received. If this member is TRUE, the EOF character has been received. </dd>
<dt>
<b>fTxim</b></dt>
<dd>
If this member is TRUE, there is a character queued for transmission that has come to the communications device by way of the <a href="commun_5e0i.htm"><b>TransmitCommChar</b></a> function. The communications device transmits such a character ahead of other characters in the device's output buffer.</dd>
<dt>
<b>fReserved</b></dt>
<dd>
Reserved; do not use. </dd>
<dt>
<b>cbInQue</b></dt>
<dd>
Specifies the number of bytes received by the serial provider but not yet read by a <a href="filesio_39id.htm"><b>ReadFile</b></a> operation. </dd>
<dt>
<b>cbOutQue</b></dt>
<dd>
Specifies the number of bytes of user data remaining to be transmitted for all write operations. This value will be zero for a nonoverlapped write. 
</dd>
