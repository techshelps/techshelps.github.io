<h4>Members</h4>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>TotalUserTime</b></dt>
<dd>
Specifies the total amount of user-mode execution time, in 100-nanosecond ticks, for all active processes associated with the job object, as well as all terminated processes no longer associated with the job object.</dd>
<dt>
<b>TotalKernelTime</b></dt>
<dd>
Specifies the total amount of kernel-mode execution time, in 100-nanosecond ticks, for all active processes associated with the job object, as well as all terminated processes no longer associated with the job object.</dd>
<dt>
<b>ThisPeriodTotalUserTime</b></dt>
<dd>
Specifies the total amount of user-mode execution time, in 100-nanosecond ticks, for all active processes associated with the job object (as well as all terminated processes no longer associated with the job object) since the last call that set a per-job user-mode time limit. 
<p>
This member is set to 0 on creation of the job object, and each time a per-job user-mode time limit is established.
</dd>
<dt>
<b>ThisPeriodTotalKernelTime</b></dt>
<dd>
Specifies the total amount of kernel-mode execution time, in 100-nanosecond ticks, for all active processes associated with the job object (as well as all terminated processes no longer associated with the job object) since the last call that set a per-job kernel-mode time limit. 
<p>
This member is set to 0 on creation of the job object, and each time a per-job kernel-mode time limit is established.
</dd>
<dt>
<b>TotalPageFaultCount</b></dt>
<dd>
Specifies the total number of page faults encountered by all active processes associated with the job object, as well as all terminated processes no longer associated with the job object.</dd>
<dt>
<b>TotalProcesses</b></dt>
<dd>
Specifies the total number of processes associated with the job object during its lifetime, including those that have terminated. For example, when a process is associated with a job, but the association fails because of a limit violation, this value is incremented. </dd>
<dt>
<b>ActiveProcesses</b></dt>
<dd>
Specifies the total number of processes currently associated with the job object. When a process is associated with a job, but the association fails because of a limit violation, this value is temporarily incremented. When the terminated process exits and all references to the process are released, this value is decremented.</dd>
<dt>
<b>TotalTerminatedProcesses</b></dt>
<dd>
Specifies the total number of processes terminated because of a limit violation.
</dd>
