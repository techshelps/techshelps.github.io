<h2><a name="_win32_logging_guidelines"></a>Logging Guidelines</h2>
<p>
Event logs store records of significant events on behalf of Windows NT and applications running on Windows NT. Because the logging functions are general purpose, you must decide what information is appropriate to log. Generally, you should log only information that could be useful in diagnosing a hardware or software problem. Event logging is not intended to be used as a tracing tool. </p>
<p>
The following are examples of cases in which event logging can be helpful. 
<ul>
<li>
Resource problems. If an application gets into a low-memory situation (caused by a code bug or inadequate memory) that degrades performance, logging a warning event when memory allocation fails might provide a clue about what went wrong. </li>
<li>
Hardware problems. If a device driver encounters a disk controller time-out, a power failure in a parallel port, or a data error from a network or serial card, logging information about these events can help the system administrator diagnose hardware problems. The device driver logs the error. </li>
<li>
Bad sectors. If a disk driver encounters a bad sector, it may be able to read from or write to the sector after retrying the operation, but the sector will go bad eventually. Therefore, if the disk driver can proceed, it should log a warning; otherwise, it should log an error event. If a file system driver finds a large number of bad sectors, fixes them, and logs warning events, logging information of this type might indicate that the disk is about to fail. </li>
<li>
Information events. A server application (such as a database server) records a user logging on, opening a database, or starting a file transfer. The server can also log error events it encounters (cannot access file, host process disconnected, and so on), a corruption in the database, or whether a file transfer was successful. </li>
</ul>
<p>
Event logging consumes resources such as disk space and processor time. The amount of disk space that an event log requires and the overhead for an application that logs events depend on how much information you choose to log. This is why it is important to log only essential information. It is also good to place event logging calls in an error path in the code rather than in the main code path, which would reduce performance. </p>
<p>
The amount of disk space required per event log record includes the members of the <a href="eventlog_7mcy.htm"><b>EVENTLOGRECORD</b></a> structure. This is a variable length structure; strings and binary data are stored following the structure. </p>
