<h2><a name="_win32_access_rights_and_access_masks"></a>Access Rights and Access Masks</h2>
<p>
An <i>access right</i> is a bit flag that corresponds to a particular set of operations that a thread can perform on a securable object. For example, a registry key has the KEY_SET_VALUE access right, which corresponds to the ability of a thread to set a value under the key. If a thread tries to perform an operation on an object but does not have the necessary access right to the object, the system does not carry out the operation. </p>
<p>
An <i>access mask</i> is a 32-bit value whose bits correspond to the access rights supported by an object. All securable objects use a <a href="accctrl_3wdw.htm">Windows NT access mask format</a> that includes bits for the following types of access rights:
<ul>
<li>
<a href="accctrl_4gvn.htm">Generic access rights</a></li>
<li>
<a href="accctrl_6gdv.htm">Standard access rights</a></li>
<li>
The <a href="accctrl_92b8.htm">SACL access right</a></li>
<li>
Object-specific access rights. Each type of securable object defines its own set of access rights. For a list of the specific access rights that apply to each type of object, see the documentation for that type of object. </li>
</ul>
<p>
When a thread tries to open a handle to an object, the thread typically specifies an access mask to <a href="accctrl_3ohg.htm">request a set of access rights</a>. For example, an application that needs to set and query the values of a registry key can open the key using an access mask to request the KEY_SET_VALUE and KEY_QUERY_VALUE access rights. </p>
