<h2><a name="_win32_exception_handling"></a>Exception Handling</h2>
<p>
Exceptions can be initiated by hardware or software, and can occur in kernel-mode as well as user-mode code. Structured exception handling provides a single mechanism for the handling of kernel-mode and user-mode exceptions. </p>
<p>
The execution of certain instruction sequences can result in exceptions that are initiated by hardware. For example, an access violation is generated by the hardware when a process attempts to read from or write to a virtual address to which it does not have the appropriate access. </p>
<p>
Events that require exception handling may also occur during execution of a software routine (for example, when an invalid parameter value is specified). When this happens, a thread can initiate an exception explicitly by calling the <a href="structex_2ylq.htm"><b>RaiseException</b></a> function. This function enables the calling thread to specify information that describes the exception. </p>
<p>
An exception can be continuable or noncontinuable. A noncontinuable<i> </i>exception arises when the event is not continuable in the hardware, or if continuation makes no sense. A noncontinuable exception does not terminate the application. Therefore, an application may be able to catch the exception and run. However, a noncontinuable exception typically arises as a result of a corrupted stack or other serious problem, making it difficult to recover from the exception.</p>
