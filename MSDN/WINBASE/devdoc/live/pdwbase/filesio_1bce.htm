<h2><a name="_win32_file_system_organization"></a>File System Organization</h2>
<p>
A volume is a storage device, such as a fixed disk or floppy disk, formatted to store directories and files. Each volume has a root directory. Directories and files on the volume are organized in a tree structure that starts at the root directory. Each directory entry identifies the name, attributes, location, and size of a file or subdirectory. </p>
<p>
A large volume can be divided into more than one logical volume, also called a partition. To the user and to the operating system, each partition appears to be a separate volume. </p>
<p>
A file system is operating system software that manages the low-level organization of files on a volume. The operating system supports one or more of the following file systems: 
<ul>
<li>
File Allocation Table (FAT) </li>
<li>
NTFS File System (NTFS) </li>
</ul>
<p>
The type of file system defines the filename conventions on a volume and may also provide specific file system features, such as security, recoverability, and high I/O performance. Each volume can use a different file system. </p>
<p>
For more information on FAT and NTFS, see <a href="fsys_4jeb.htm">File Systems</a>. </p>
