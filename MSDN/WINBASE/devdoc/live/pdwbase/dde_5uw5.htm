<p>
DDE is most appropriate for data exchanges that do not require ongoing user interaction. Usually, an application provides a method for the user to establish the link between the applications exchanging data. Once that link is established, however, the applications exchange data without further user involvement. </p>
<p>
DDE can be used to implement a broad range of application features — for example: 
<ul>
<li>
Linking to real-time data, such as to stock market updates, scientific instruments, or process control. </li>
<li>
Creating compound documents, such as a word processing document that includes a chart produced by a graphics application. Using DDE, the chart will change when the source data is changed, while the rest of the document remains the same. </li>
<li>
Performing data queries between applications, such as a spreadsheet querying a database for accounts past due. </li>
</ul>
