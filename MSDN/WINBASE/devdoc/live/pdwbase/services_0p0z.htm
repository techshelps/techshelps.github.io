<h1><a name="_win32_services"></a>Services</h1>
<p>
Microsoft® Windows NT® supports an application type known as a service. A <i>Win32-based service</i> conforms to the interface rules of the Service Control Manager (SCM). It can be started automatically at system boot, by a user through the Services control panel applet, or by a Win32-based application that uses the service functions included in the Microsoft® Win32® application programming interface (API). Services can execute even when no user is logged on to the system. </p>
<p>
Windows NT also supports a <i>driver service</i>, which conforms to the device driver protocols for Windows NT. It is similar to the Win32-based service, but it does not interact with the SCM. For simplicity, the term <i>service</i> refers to a <i>Win32-based service</i> in this overview. </p>
<p>
<b>Note</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;Windows 95 and Windows 98 support a subset of the functionality provided by the Windows NT SCM. For more information, see <a href="win95/95scm_890y.htm">Windows 95 Service Control Manager</a>. </p>
