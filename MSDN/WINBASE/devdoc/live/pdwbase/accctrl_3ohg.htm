<h3><a name="_win32_requesting_access_rights_to_an_object"></a>Requesting Access Rights to an Object</h3>
<p>
When you open a handle to an object, the returned handle has some combination of access rights to the object. Some functions, such as <a href="synchro_9zol.htm"><b>CreateSemaphore</b></a>, do not require you to specify a set of requested access rights; they always try to open the handle for full access. Other functions, such as <a href="filesio_7wmd.htm"><b>CreateFile</b></a> and <a href="prothred_478z.htm"><b>OpenProcess</b></a>, allow you to specify the set of access rights that you want. You should request only the access rights that you need, rather than opening a handle for full access. This prevents you from using the handle in a way that you didn't intend, and also increases the chances that your access request will succeed if the object's DACL only allows you limited access.</p>
<p>
You can use <a href="accctrl_4gvn.htm">generic access rights</a> to specify the type of access you need when you are opening a handle to an object. This is typically simpler than specifying all the corresponding standard and specific rights. Alternatively, you can use the MAXIMUM_ALLOWED constant to request that the object be opened with all the access rights that are valid for the caller. Note that you cannot use the MAXIMUM_ALLOWED constant in an ACE. </p>
<p>
To get or set the SACL in an object's security descriptor, you must request the <a href="accctrl_92b8.htm">ACCESS_SYSTEM_SECURITY access right</a> when you open a handle to the object. </p>
