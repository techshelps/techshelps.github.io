<h3><a name="_win32_communications_errors"></a>Communications Errors</h3>
<p>
There are other circumstances where a read or write operation can be completed with fewer than the requested number of characters, even though a time-out has not occurred. Following are some examples: 
<ul>
<li>
Some drivers support the use of special characters, which complete a read operation immediately with only the characters that have been read up to the point when they are received. </li>
<li>
The <a href="commun_3y5p.htm"><b>PurgeComm</b></a> function can be called to prematurely terminate pending read or write operations. This function can also delete the contents of the output or input buffers, or both. </li>
<li>
If a communications error occurs during a read or write operation, all I/O operations on the communications resource are terminated. Break conditions, parity errors, or framing errors are examples of such errors. When an error occurs, the process must call the <a href="commun_5e42.htm"><b>ClearCommError</b></a> function to clear the error flag before it can begin additional I/O operations. <b>ClearCommError</b> reports the specific error that occurred and the current status of the device. </li>
</ul>
