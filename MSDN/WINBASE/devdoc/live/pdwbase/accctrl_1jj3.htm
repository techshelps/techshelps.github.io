<h2><a name="_win32_access_control_lists_acls_"></a>Access-Control Lists (ACLs)</h2>
<p>
An access-control list (ACL) is a list of <a href="accctrl_0vfj.htm"><i>access-control entries</i> (ACEs)</a>. Each ACE in an ACL identifies a <a href="accctrl_5j8z.htm">trustee</a> and specifies the <a href="accctrl_6xmb.htm"><i>access rights</i></a> allowed, denied, or audited for that trustee. The <a href="accctrl_3fub.htm">security descriptor</a> for a securable object can contain two ACLs: a DACL and a SACL. </p>
<p>
A DACL identifies the trustees that are allowed or denied access to a securable object. When a process tries to access a securable object, the system checks the ACEs in the object<u>'</u>s DACL to determine whether to grant access. If the object does not have a DACL, the system grants full access to everyone. If the object<u>'</u>s DACL has no ACEs, the system denies all attempts to access the object because the DACL does not allow any access rights. The system checks the ACEs in sequence until it finds one or more ACEs that allow all the requested access rights, or until any of the requested access rights are denied. For more information, see <a href="accctrl_6790.htm">Checking a Thread's Access to an Object</a>.</p>
<p>
A SACL enables administrators to log attempts to access a secured object. Each ACE specifies the types of access attempts by a specified trustee that cause the system to generate a record in the security event log. An ACE in a SACL can generate audit records when an access attempt fails, when it succeeds, or both. In future releases, a SACL will also be able to raise an alarm when an unauthorized user attempts to gain access to an object. For more information about SACLs, see <a href="accctrl_0v5a.htm">Audit Generation</a> and <a href="accctrl_92b8.htm">SACL Access Right</a>. </p>
<p>
Do not try to work directly with the contents of an ACL. To ensure that ACLs are semantically correct, use the appropriate Win32 functions to create and manipulate ACLs. For more information, see <a href="accctrl_2elv.htm">Modifying an Object's ACLs</a>. </p>
