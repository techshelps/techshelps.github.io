<h1><a name="_win32_about_processes_and_threads"></a>About Processes and Threads</h1>
<p>
Each process provides the resources needed to execute a program. A process has a virtual address space, executable code, data, object handles, environment variables, a base priority, and minimum and maximum working set sizes. Each process is started with a single thread, often called the <i>primary thread</i>, but can create additional threads from any of its threads. </p>
<p>
All threads of a process share its virtual address space and system resources. In addition, each thread maintains exception handlers, a scheduling priority, and a set of structures the system will use to save the thread context until it is scheduled. The <i>thread context</i> includes the thread's set of machine registers, the kernel stack, a thread environment block, and a user stack in the address space of the thread's process. </p>
<p>
Windows NT, Windows 95, and Windows 98 support <i>preemptive multitasking</i>, which creates the effect of simultaneous execution of multiple threads from multiple processes. On a multiprocessor computer, Windows NT can simultaneously execute as many threads as there are processors on the computer.</p>
