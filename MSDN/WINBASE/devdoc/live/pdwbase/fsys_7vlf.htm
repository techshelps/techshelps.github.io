<h1><a name="_win32_about_file_systems"></a>About File Systems</h1>
<p>
Depending on the configuration of a computer, a Win32®-based application may have access to volumes managed by any of the following file systems:
<ul>
<li>
<a href="fsys_538t.htm">NTFS file system</a></li>
<li>
<a href="fsys_9up9.htm">FAT file system</a></li>
<li>
<a href="fsys_1xnx.htm">Protected-mode FAT file system</a></li>
</ul>
<p>
Because the different volumes your application connects to can be managed by different file systems, it is important to understand the differences between file systems and to prepare your application to work effectively with all file systems. Before you access files and directories on a given volume, you should determine the capabilities of the file system by using the <a href="fsys_6wfi.htm"><b>GetVolumeInformation</b></a> function. This function returns values that you can use to adapt your application to work effectively with the file system. </p>
<p>
In general, you should avoid using static buffers for filenames and paths. Instead, use the values returned by <b>GetVolumeInformation</b> to allocate buffers as you need them. If you must use static buffers, reserve 256 characters for filenames and 260 characters for paths. </p>
