<p>
To obtain media to use, an application uses the <a href="ntms_api_6275.htm"><b>AllocateNtmsMedia</b></a> function specifying a media pool from which to obtain the medium. The <b>AllocateNtmsMedia</b> function assigns media to the application and returns a logical media identifier (<a href="ntmsglos_6ni1.htm#_zaw_lmid_gly">LMID</a>) to the application. Only media in online libraries can be allocated to the application.</p>
<p>
The media pool can be set up to automatically draw from the Scratch pool upon allocation. If no media are available in its media pool, RSM automatically moves online media from the Scratch pool and assigns it to the application. If no media are available, RSM generates an operator request for new media, or the applications are notified of the problem. </p>
<p>
Because the application is not guaranteed the type of label on the specified medium, the application is required to write its own label on the medium and use the <a href="ntms_api_33vz.htm"><b>UpdateNtmsOmidInfo</b></a> function to notify RSM of the new label identifier. This does not have to be done immediately after the allocate command, because RSM can use the current label identifier until the current owner overwrites the label. After the application overwrites the label, the application must notify RSM of the change as soon as possible to prevent a mismatch between the RSM version of the label and the actual label. If the application does not notify RSM of the label change, the medium is moved to the Import pool, and the application must import<i> </i>the medium to access it again.</p>
