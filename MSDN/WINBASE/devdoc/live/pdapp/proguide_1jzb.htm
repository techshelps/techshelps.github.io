<p>
This section explains media handling in RSM. Media handling is defined as the actions and reactions that RSM makes in response to operations performed by both administrators and applications. In particular, the label semantics of RSM are defined as media, entered into the system, moved between media pools, and allocated and deallocated for use by applications. Because the behavior of RSM in some circumstances varies by media type, the description of its behavior has been divided by media type and presented in tables. </p>
<p>
The second part of this section describes importing<i> </i>media into an RSM system. This is the case where an application has been integrated with RSM and has media that was written without RSM (for example, in a previous version of the application) that it is moving under RSM control.</p>
