<p>
The administrator must always know the location of the most recent RSM database backup. To help identify the backup during disaster recovery, the administrator should record and maintain the following information about the latest database backup in a safe place (such as a notebook or a spreadsheet):
<ul>
<li>
Sequence number</li>
<li>
Bar code<p>
The administrator can look for the appropriate sequence number and bar code (if available).
</li>
<li>
On-media identifier (<a href="ntmsglos_5fnd.htm#_zaw_omid_gly">OMID</a>)<p>
The administrator can use the RSM MMC snap-in to look up the OMID. The RSM MMC snap-in displays the OMID of media in the import pool on the media property page. However, a recovery application that is fully integrated with RSM can select the right media for disaster recovery based on this reconstructed OMID information.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
During disaster recovery, the administrator typically reinstalls the operating system and generates an empty RSM database. When the system is started with a new RSM database, RSM places all online media in the import media pool. The sequence number, bar code, and OMID can help the administrator identify the media with the most recent database backup during disaster recovery.</p>
