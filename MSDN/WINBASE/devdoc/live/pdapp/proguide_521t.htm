<p>
RSM manages many tape media types. RSM depends on the ability of media to mark itself as scratch when the media is committed to the scratch pool. Tape <a href="ntmsglos_5fnd.htm#_zaw_omid_gly">OMID</a> formats such as MTF are supported by default in RSM. Applications that employ proprietary label formats can extend the OMID label recognition package so that their media formats are recognized by RSM during media classification. </p>
<p>
RSM accesses the tape drive at the raw driver level. Since tape drives are not mapped to drive letters, the application uses the raw path of the tape device (for example, \\.\Tapex) to open and access the tape device. </p>
