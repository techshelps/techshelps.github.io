<p>
There are four types of media pools in RSM:
<ul>
<li>
Foreign<p>
Media that is new or unrecognized
</li>
<li>
Import<p>
Media that have labels that are recognized by the system but are not in the RSM catalog
</li>
<li>
Scratch<p>
Media available for writing
</li>
<li>
Application<p>
Media used by a particular application on the system
</li>
</ul>
<p>
All media in an application media pool are in the RSM catalog by default. Media in the <a href="ntmsglos_14ah.htm#_zaw_available_state_gly">available state</a> can reside in both the scratch media pools and application pools. Note that there are individual Import, Foreign, and Scratch media pools for each media type detected on the system.</p>
<p>
Media in Scratch, Import, or Foreign media pools are deleted from the RSM catalog when they are ejected from the library or drive.</p>
