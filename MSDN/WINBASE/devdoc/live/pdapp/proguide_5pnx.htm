<p>
<span style=color:#FF0000>[This is preliminary documentation and subject to change.]</span> </p>
<p>
RSM is a service included with Windows NT that facilitates communication among applications, robotic changers, and media libraries. It enables multiple applications to share local robotic media libraries and tape or disk drives, and manage removable media within a single-server system. A group of libraries, drives, and media that are managed by RSM is called an RSM system. RSM can help you create an application that makes effective use of the media resources in an RSM system.</p>
<p>
RSM includes the following components:
<ul>
<li>
The RSM application programming interface (API)</li>
<li>
The RSM database</li>
<li>
The RSM MMC snap-in</li>
</ul>
<p>
The following figure illustrates the relationships among the components of RSM, devices, and Windows NT. RSM components are shown in solid white.</p>

<p>
The RSM MMC snap-in includes a <b>Mount</b> menu command. This command uses the <b>MountNtmsMedia</b> function to issue a mount request for the specified medium. RSM reads the database for location and identification information of the medium. If the medium is offline, RSM generates an operator request to insert it. If the medium is online, RSM mounts it and updates the database.</p>
