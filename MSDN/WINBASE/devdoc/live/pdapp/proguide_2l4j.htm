<p>
<span style=color:#FF0000>[This is preliminary documentation and subject to change.]</span> </p>
<p>
RSM requires that all media be labeled so that it can be identified when it is inserted into a drive. Applications are required to identify media they are using by providing a Media label library that identifies the media it has labeled. </p>
<p>
By providing this flexibility, RSM can support multiple labeling methods simultaneously, and allow proprietary labels to be used as well. RSM requires that an application relabel<i> </i>media assigned to it using the <a href="ntms_api_6275.htm"><b>AllocateNtmsMedia</b></a> function. After the application relabels the media it should use the <a href="ntms_api_33vz.htm"><b>UpdateNtmsOmidInfo</b></a> function to notify RSM of the identification change.</p>
<p>
RSM supports a default or Scratch label for both sequential and optical rewritable media. Writing a Scratch label destroys all data on the media. For sequential media, RSM uses a Microsoft tape format (MTF) label that is applied as media enters the Scratch pool. RSM does not update the media description when writing a Scratch label. RSM currently uses a binary label to identify optical media that are placed in the scratch pool. </p>
<p>
RSM supports CD-ROM that cannot be relabeled. For CD-ROM media, RSM recognizes CDFS as a valid label. Since duplicated CD-ROMs are a common occurrence, RSM handles a CD-ROM quite differently from writable media.</p>
