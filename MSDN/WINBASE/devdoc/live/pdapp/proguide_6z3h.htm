<p>
An RSM operator request is a request for a human operator to perform a task. Operator requests can be issued by RSM or by RSM applications. RSM generates operator requests in the following situations:
<ul>
<li>
Media must be moved online because an application has initiated a mount request for media that is offline.</li>
<li>
There are no Available media online in the specified application media pool or in the appropriate scratch media pool when an application requests media allocation. The operator can supply new media or Available media that is offline to satisfy the request.</li>
<li>
A device failed and requires service.</li>
<li>
A drive needs to be cleaned and there is no usable cleaner cartridge available in the library unit.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Operator requests are displayed in the RSM MMC snap-in. Operators can satisfy or cancel operator requests. When an operator satisfies an operator request, the operator must acknowledge the request in the RSM MMC snap-in. When an operator cancels an operator request, RSM notifies the application that generated the request. RSM saves operator requests for less than one hour after they have been satisfied or canceled.</p>
<p>
The RSM API includes the following functions to manage operator requests.
<ul>
<li>
<a href="ntms_api_6cvo.htm"><b>SubmitNtmsOperatorRequest</b></a><p>
This function submits an operator request and returns the status of the request (Satisfied or Cancelled) or times out (if the operator does not act upon the request). The <i>dwRequest</i> parameter of this function specifies the request type. Use the NTMS_OPREQ_MESSAGE type for your application messages.
</li>
<li>
<a href="ntms_api_6jsk.htm"><b>WaitForNtmsOperatorRequest</b></a><p>
Typically, applications use the <b>SubmitNtmsOperatorRequest</b> function to submit operator requests and use the <b>WaitForNtmsOperatorRequest</b> function to wait for their resolution.
</li>
<li>
<a href="ntms_api_925w.htm"><b>CancelNtmsOperatorRequest</b></a><p>
This function cancels an existing operator request.
</li>
<li>
<a href="ntms_api_0kl0.htm"><b>SatisfyNtmsOperatorRequest</b></a><p>
If an application detects that the operator did not acknowledge a satisfied operator request, the application can use this function to remove the request.
</li>
</ul>
