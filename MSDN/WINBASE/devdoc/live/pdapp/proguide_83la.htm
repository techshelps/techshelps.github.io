<p>
RSM supports two types of device configuration: autoconfiguration and manual configuration. Administrators can use the autoconfiguration feature of RSM only if the following statements are true:
<ul>
<li>
All drives are installed on the same SCSI bus as the associated changer.</li>
<li>
All library hardware units currently in use in the system support drive element address reporting with the ReadElementStatus SCSI command.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Because not all library hardware units and system configurations support the RSM autoconfiguration feature, RSM provides a method for manually configuring library hardware units. However, administrators should not use this method unless it is absolutely necessary because manually configured devices do not recognize system configuration changes. Each time a change is made to a device in an RSM system that contains one or more manually configured devices, the administrator must repeat the manual configuration process.</p>
