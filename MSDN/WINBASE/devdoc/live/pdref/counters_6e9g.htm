<h1><a name="_win32_server_work_queues_object"></a>Server Work Queues Object</h1>
<p>
The Server Work Queues performance object consists of counters that monitor the length of the queues and objects in the queues. </p>
<p>
<b>Queue Length</b></p>
<p>
Queue Length is the current length of the server work queue for this CPU. A sustained queue length greater than four might indicate processor congestion. This is an instantaneous count, not an average over time.</p>
<p>
Detail Level: Advanced<br>
Counter Type: PERF_COUNTER_RAWCOUNT</p>
<p>
<b>Active Threads</b></p>
<p>
Active Threads is the number of threads currently working on a request from the server client for this CPU. The system keeps this number as low as possible to minimize unnecessary context switching. This is an instantaneous count for the CPU, not an average over time.</p>
<p>
Detail Level: Advanced<br>
Counter Type: PERF_COUNTER_RAWCOUNT</p>
<p>
<b>Available Threads</b></p>
<p>
Available Threads is the number of server threads on this CPU not currently working on requests from a client. The server dynamically adjusts the number of threads to maximize server performance.</p>
<p>
Detail Level: Advanced<br>
Counter Type: PERF_COUNTER_RAWCOUNT</p>
<p>
<b>Available Work Items</b></p>
<p>
Every request from a client is represented in the server as a 'work item,' and the server maintains a pool of available work items per CPU to speed processing. This is the instantaneous number of available work items for this CPU. A sustained near-zero value indicates the need to increase the MinFreeWorkItems registry value for the Server service. This value will always be 0 in the Blocking Queue instance.</p>
<p>
Detail Level: Advanced<br>
Counter Type: PERF_COUNTER_RAWCOUNT</p>
<p>
<b>Borrowed Work Items</b></p>
<p>
Every request from a client is represented in the server as a 'work item,' and the server maintains a pool of available work items per CPU to speed processing. When a CPU runs out of work items, it borrows a free work item from another CPU. An increasing value of this running counter might indicate the need to increase the 'MaxWorkItems' or 'MinFreeWorkItems' registry values for the Server service. This value will always be 0 in the Blocking Queue instance.</p>
<p>
Detail Level: Advanced<br>
Counter Type: PERF_COUNTER_RAWCOUNT</p>
<p>
<b>Work Item Shortages</b></p>
<p>
Every request from a client is represented in the server as a 'work item,' and the server maintains a pool of available work items per CPU to speed processing. A sustained value greater than zero indicates the need to increase the 'MaxWorkItems' registry value for the Server service. This value will always be 0 in the Blocking Queue instance.</p>
<p>
Detail Level: Advanced<br>
Counter Type: PERF_COUNTER_RAWCOUNT</p>
<p>
<b>Current Clients</b></p>
<p>
Current Clients is the instantaneous count of the clients being serviced by this CPU. The server actively balances the client load across all of the CPU's in the system. This value will always be 0 in the Blocking Queue instance.</p>
<p>
Detail Level: Advanced<br>
Counter Type: PERF_COUNTER_RAWCOUNT</p>
<p>
<b>Bytes Received/sec</b></p>
<p>
The rate at which the Server is receiving bytes from the network clients on this CPU. This value is a measure of how busy the Server is.</p>
<p>
Detail Level: Advanced<br>
Counter Type: PERF_COUNTER_BULK_COUNT</p>
<p>
<b>Bytes Sent/sec</b></p>
<p>
The rate at which the Server is sending bytes to the network clients on this CPU. This value is a measure of how busy the Server is.</p>
<p>
Detail Level: Advanced<br>
Counter Type: PERF_COUNTER_BULK_COUNT</p>
<p>
<b>Bytes Transferred/sec</b></p>
<p>
The rate at which the Server is sending and receiving bytes with the network clients on this CPU. This value is a measure of how busy the Server is.</p>
<p>
Detail Level: Advanced<br>
Counter Type: PERF_COUNTER_BULK_COUNT</p>
<p>
<b>Read Operations/sec</b></p>
<p>
Read Operations/sec is the rate the server is performing file read operations for the clients on this CPU. This value is a measure of how busy the Server is. This value will always be 0 in the Blocking Queue instance.</p>
<p>
Detail Level: Advanced<br>
Counter Type: PERF_COUNTER_BULK_COUNT</p>
<p>
<b>Read Bytes/sec</b></p>
<p>
Read Bytes/sec is the rate the server is reading data from files for the clients on this CPU. This value is a measure of how busy the Server is.</p>
<p>
Detail Level: Advanced<br>
Counter Type: PERF_COUNTER_BULK_COUNT</p>
<p>
<b>Write Operations/sec</b></p>
<p>
Write Operations/sec is the rate the server is performing file write operations for the clients on this CPU. This value is a measure of how busy the Server is. This value will always be 0 in the Blocking Queue instance.</p>
<p>
Detail Level: Advanced<br>
Counter Type: PERF_COUNTER_BULK_COUNT</p>
<p>
<b>Write Bytes/sec</b></p>
<p>
Write Bytes/sec is the rate the server is writing data to files for the clients on this CPU. This value is a measure of how busy the Server is.</p>
<p>
Detail Level: Advanced<br>
Counter Type: PERF_COUNTER_BULK_COUNT</p>
<p>
<b>Total Bytes/sec</b></p>
<p>
Total Bytes/sec is the rate the Server is reading and writing data to and from the files for the clients on this CPU. This value is a measure of how busy the Server is.</p>
<p>
Detail Level: Advanced<br>
Counter Type: PERF_COUNTER_BULK_COUNT</p>
<p>
<b>Total Operations/sec</b></p>
<p>
Total Operations/sec is the rate the Server is performing file read and file write operations for the clients on this CPU. This value is a measure of how busy the Server is. This value will always be 0 in the Blocking Queue instance.</p>
<p>
Detail Level: Advanced<br>
Counter Type: PERF_COUNTER_BULK_COUNT</p>
<p>
<b>Context Blocks Queued/sec</b></p>
<p>
Context Blocks Queued per second is the rate at which work context blocks had to be placed on the server's FSP queue to await server action.</p>
<p>

Counter Type: PERF_COUNTER_COUNTER</p>
