<h1><a name="_win32_redirector_object"></a>Redirector Object</h1>
<p>
The Redirector performance object consists of counter that monitor network connections originating at the local computer. </p>
<p>
<b>Bytes Total/sec</b></p>
<p>
Bytes Total/sec is the rate the Redirector is processing data bytes. This includes all application and file data in addition to protocol information such as packet headers.</p>
<p>
Detail Level: Novice<br>
Counter Type: PERF_COUNTER_BULK_COUNT</p>
<p>
<b>File Data Operations/sec</b></p>
<p>
File Data Operations/sec is the rate the Redirector is processing data operations. One operation includes (hopefully) many bytes. We say hopefully here because each operation has overhead. You can determine the efficiency of this path by dividing the Bytes/sec by this counter to determine the average number of bytes transferred/operation.</p>
<p>
Detail Level: Novice<br>
Counter Type: PERF_COUNTER_COUNTER</p>
<p>
<b>Packets/sec</b></p>
<p>
Packets/sec is the rate the Redirector is processing data packets. One packet includes (hopefully) many bytes. We say hopefully here because each packet has protocol overhead. You can determine the efficiency of this path by dividing the Bytes/sec by this counter to determine the average number of bytes transferred/packet. You can also divide this counter by Operations/sec to determine the average number of packets per operation, another measure of efficiency.</p>

<p>
<b>Bytes Received/sec</b></p>
<p>
Bytes Received/sec is the rate of bytes coming in to the Redirector from the network. It includes all application data as well as network protocol information (such as packet headers.)</p>
<p>
Detail Level: Advanced<br>
Counter Type: PERF_COUNTER_BULK_COUNT</p>
<p>
<b>Packets Received/sec</b></p>
<p>
Packets Received/sec is the rate at which the Redirector is receiving packets (also called SMBs or Server Message Blocks). Network transmissions are divided into packets. The average number of bytes received in a packet can be obtained by dividing Bytes Received/sec by this counter. Some packets received might not contain incoming data, for example an acknowledgment to a write made by the Redirector would count as an incoming packet.</p>

Counter Type: PERF_COUNTER_BULK_COUNT</p>
<p>
<b>Read Bytes Paging/sec</b></p>
<p>
Read Bytes Paging/sec is the rate at which the Redirector is attempting to read bytes in response to page faults. Page faults are caused by loading of modules (such as programs and libraries), by a miss in the Cache (see Read Bytes Cache/sec), or by files directly mapped into the address space of applications (a high-performance feature of Windows NT.)</p>
<p>
Detail Level: Expert<br>
Counter Type: PERF_COUNTER_BULK_COUNT</p>
<p>
<b>Read Bytes Non-Paging/sec</b></p>
<p>
Read Bytes Non-Paging/sec are those bytes read by the Redirector in response to normal file requests by an application when they are redirected to come from another computer. In addition to file requests, this counter includes other methods of reading across the network such as Named Pipes and Transactions. This counter does not count network protocol information, just application data.</p>
<p>
Detail Level: Expert<br>
Counter Type: PERF_COUNTER_BULK_COUNT</p>
<p>
<b>Read Bytes Cache/sec</b></p>
<p>
Read Bytes Cache/sec is the rate at which applications are accessing the file system cache by using the Redirector. Some of these data requests are satisfied by retrieving the data from the cache. Requests that miss the cache cause a page fault (see Read Bytes Paging/sec). </p>
<p>
Detail Level: Expert<br>
Counter Type: PERF_COUNTER_BULK_COUNT</p>
<p>
<b>Read Bytes Network/sec</b></p>
<p>
Read Bytes Network/sec is the rate at which applications are reading data across the network. This occurs when data sought in the file system cache is not found there and must be retrieved from the network. Dividing this value by Bytes Received/sec indicates the proportion of application data traveling across the network (see Bytes Received/sec.)</p>
<p>
Detail Level: Novice<br>
Counter Type: PERF_COUNTER_BULK_COUNT</p>
<p>
<b>Bytes Transmitted/sec</b></p>
<p>
Bytes Transmitted/sec is the rate at which bytes are leaving the Redirector to the network. It includes all application data as well as network protocol information (such as packet headers and the like.)</p>
<p>
Detail Level: Advanced<br>
Counter Type: PERF_COUNTER_BULK_COUNT</p>
<p>
<b>Packets Transmitted/sec</b></p>
<p>
Packets Transmitted/sec is the rate at which the Redirector is sending packets (also called SMBs or Server Message Blocks). Network transmissions are divided into packets. The average number of bytes transmitted in a packet can be obtained by dividing Bytes Transmitted/sec by this counter.</p>

Counter Type: PERF_COUNTER_BULK_COUNT</p>
<p>
<b>Write Bytes Paging/sec</b></p>
<p>
Write Bytes Paging/sec is the rate at which the Redirector is attempting to write bytes changed in the pages being used by applications. The program data changed by modules (such as programs and libraries) that were loaded over the network are 'paged out' when no longer needed. Other output pages come from the cache (see Write Bytes Cache/sec).</p>
<p>
Detail Level: Expert<br>
Counter Type: PERF_COUNTER_BULK_COUNT</p>
<p>
<b>Write Bytes Non-Paging/sec</b></p>
<p>
Write Bytes Non-Paging/sec is the rate at which bytes are written by the Redirector in response to normal file outputs by an application when they are redirected to another computer. In addition to file requests this counter includes other methods of writing across the network such as Named Pipes and Transactions. This counter does not count network protocol information, just application data.</p>
<p>

Counter Type: PERF_COUNTER_BULK_COUNT</p>
<p>
<b>Write Bytes Cache/sec</b></p>
<p>
Write Bytes Cache/sec is the rate at which applications on your computer are writing to the file system cache using the Redirector. The data might not leave your computer immediately; it can be retained in the cache for further modification before being written to the network. This saves network traffic. Each write of a byte into the cache is counted here.</p>
<p>
Detail Level: Expert<br>
Counter Type: PERF_COUNTER_BULK_COUNT</p>
<p>
<b>Write Bytes Network/sec</b></p>
<p>
Write Bytes Network/sec is the rate at which applications are writing data across the network. This occurs when the file system cache is, such as for named pipes or transactions, or else the cache writes the bytes to disk to make room for other data. Dividing this counter by Bytes Transmitted/sec will indicate the proportion of application data being written to the network (see Transmitted Bytes/sec.)</p>
<p>

Counter Type: PERF_COUNTER_BULK_COUNT</p>
<p>
<b>File Read Operations/sec</b></p>

<p>
Detail Level: Novice<br>
Counter Type: PERF_COUNTER_COUNTER</p>
<p>
<b>Read Operations Random/sec</b></p>
<p>
Read Operations Random/sec counts the rate at which, on a file-by-file basis, reads are made that are not sequential. If a read is made using a particular file handle, and then is followed by another read that is not immediately the contiguous next byte, this counter is incremented by one.</p>
<p>
Detail Level: Advanced<br>
Counter Type: PERF_COUNTER_COUNTER</p>
<p>
<b>Read Packets/sec</b></p>

<p>
<b>Reads Large/sec</b></p>
<p>
Reads Large/sec is the rate at which reads over 2 times the server's negotiated buffer size are made by applications. Too many of these could place a strain on server resources. This counter is incremented once for each read. It does not count packets.</p>

Counter Type: PERF_COUNTER_COUNTER</p>
<p>
<b>Read Packets Small/sec</b></p>
<p>
Read Packets Small/sec is the rate at which reads less than one-fourth of the server's negotiated buffer size are made by applications. Too many of these could indicate a waste of buffers on the server. This counter is incremented once for each read. It does not count packets.</p>

Counter Type: PERF_COUNTER_COUNTER</p>
<p>
<b>Reads Denied/sec</b></p>
<p>
Reads Denied/sec is the rate at which the server is unable to accommodate requests for Raw Reads. When a read is much larger than the server's negotiated buffer size, the Redirector requests a Raw Read which, if granted, would permit the transfer of the data without lots of protocol overhead on each packet. To accomplish this the server must lock out other requests, so the request is denied if the server is really busy.</p>

<p>
<b>Network Errors/sec</b></p>
<p>
Network Errors/sec counts serious unexpected errors that generally indicate the Redirector and one or more Servers are having serious communication difficulties. For example an SMB (Server Manager Block) protocol error will generate a Network Error. These result in an entry in the system Event Log, so look there for details. </p>

<p>
<b>Server Sessions</b></p>
<p>
Server Sessions counts the total number of security objects the Redirector has managed. For example, a logon to a server followed by a network access to the same server will establish one connection, but two sessions.</p>
<p>
Detail Level: Novice<br>
Counter Type: PERF_COUNTER_RAWCOUNT</p>
<p>
<b>Server Reconnects</b></p>
<p>
Server Reconnects counts the number of times your Redirector has had to reconnect to a server in order to complete a new active request. You can be disconnected by the Server if you remain inactive for too long. Locally even if all your remote files are closed, the Redirector will keep your connections intact for (nominally) ten minutes. Such inactive connections are called Dormant Connections. Reconnecting is expensive in time.</p>
