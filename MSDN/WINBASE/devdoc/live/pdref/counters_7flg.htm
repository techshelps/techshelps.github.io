<p>
Detail Level: Expert<br>
Counter Type: PERF_COUNTER_RAWCOUNT</p>
<p>
<b>Blocking Requests Rejected</b></p>
<p>
The number of times the server has rejected blocking SMBs due to insufficient count of free work items. Indicates whether the MaxWorkItem or MinFreeWorkItems server parameters might need tuning.</p>
<p>
Detail Level: Advanced<br>
Counter Type: PERF_COUNTER_COUNTER</p>
<p>
<b>Work Item Shortages</b></p>
<p>
The number of times STATUS_DATA_NOT_ACCEPTED was returned at receive indication time. This occurs when no work item is available or can be allocated to service the incoming request. Indicates whether the InitWorkItems or MaxWorkItems parameters might need to be adjusted.</p>
<p>
Detail Level: Advanced<br>
Counter Type: PERF_COUNTER_COUNTER</p>
<p>
<b>Files Opened Total</b></p>
<p>
