<h1><a name="_win32_udp_object"></a>UDP Object</h1>
<p>
The UDP performance object consists of counters that measure the rates at which UDP datagrams are sent and received by using the UDP protocol. It includes counters that monitor UDP protocol errors.</p>
<p>
<b>Datagrams/sec</b></p>
<p>
Datagrams/sec is the rate at which UDP datagrams are sent or received by the entity.</p>
<p>
Detail Level: Advanced<br>
Counter Type: PERF_COUNTER_COUNTER</p>
<p>
<b>Datagrams Received/sec</b></p>
<p>
Datagrams Received/sec is the rate at which UDP datagrams are delivered to UDP users.</p>
<p>
Detail Level: Advanced<br>
Counter Type: PERF_COUNTER_COUNTER</p>
<p>
<b>Datagrams No Port/sec</b></p>
<p>
Datagrams No Port/sec is the rate of received UDP datagrams for which there was no application at the destination port.</p>
<p>
Detail Level: Advanced<br>
Counter Type: PERF_COUNTER_COUNTER</p>
<p>
<b>Datagrams Received Errors</b></p>
<p>
Datagrams Received Errors is the number of received UDP datagrams that could not be delivered for reasons other than the lack of an application at the destination port.</p>
<p>
Detail Level: Advanced<br>
Counter Type: PERF_COUNTER_RAWCOUNT</p>
<p>
<b>Datagrams Sent/sec</b></p>
<p>
Datagrams Sent/sec is the rate at which UDP datagrams are sent from the entity.</p>
<p>
Detail Level: Advanced<br>
Counter Type: PERF_COUNTER_COUNTER</p>
