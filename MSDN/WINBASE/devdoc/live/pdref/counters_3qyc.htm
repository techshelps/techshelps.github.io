<h1><a name="_win32_image_object"></a>Image Object</h1>
<p>
The Image performance object consists of counters that monitor virtual address usage of images executed by processes on the computer.</p>
<p>
<b>No Access</b></p>
<p>
Image Space is the virtual address space in use by the selected image with this protection. No Access protection prevents a process from writing or reading these pages and will generate an access violation if either is attempted.</p>
<p>
Detail Level: Wizard<br>
Counter Type: PERF_COUNTER_RAWCOUNT</p>
<p>
<b>Read Only</b></p>
<p>
Image Space is the virtual address space in use by the selected image with this protection. Read Only protection prevents the contents of these pages from being modified. Any attempts to write or modify these pages will generate an access violation.</p>
<p>
Detail Level: Wizard<br>
Counter Type: PERF_COUNTER_RAWCOUNT</p>
<p>
<b>Read/Write</b></p>
<p>
Image Space is the virtual address space in use by the selected image with this protection. Read/Write protection allows a process to read, modify and write to these pages.</p>
<p>
Detail Level: Wizard<br>
Counter Type: PERF_COUNTER_RAWCOUNT</p>
<p>
<b>Write Copy</b></p>
<p>
Image Space is the virtual address space in use by the selected image with this protection. Write Copy protection is used when memory is shared for reading but not for writing. When processes are reading this memory, they can share the same memory, however, when a sharing process wants to have read/write access to this shared memory, a copy of that memory is made for writing to.</p>
<p>
Detail Level: Wizard<br>
Counter Type: PERF_COUNTER_RAWCOUNT</p>
<p>
<b>Executable</b></p>
<p>
Image Space is the virtual address space in use by the selected image with this protection. Executable memory is memory that can be executed by programs, but cannot be read or written. This type of protection is not supported by all processor types.</p>
<p>
Detail Level: Wizard<br>
Counter Type: PERF_COUNTER_RAWCOUNT</p>
<p>
<b>Exec Read Only</b></p>
<p>
Image Space is the virtual address space in use by the selected image with this protection. Execute/Read Only memory is memory that can be executed as well as read.</p>
<p>
Detail Level: Wizard<br>
Counter Type: PERF_COUNTER_RAWCOUNT</p>
<p>
<b>Exec Read/Write</b></p>
<p>
Image Space is the virtual address space in use by the selected image with this protection. Execute/Read/Write memory is memory that can be executed by programs as well as read and written.</p>
<p>
Detail Level: Wizard<br>
Counter Type: PERF_COUNTER_RAWCOUNT</p>
<p>
<b>Exec Write Copy</b></p>
<p>
Image Space is the virtual address space in use by the selected image with this protection. Execute Write Copy is memory that can be executed by programs as well as read and written. This type of protection is used when memory needs to be shared between processes. If the sharing processes only read the memory, then they will all use the same memory. If a sharing process desires write access, then a copy of this memory will be made for that process.</p>
