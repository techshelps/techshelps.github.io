The System performance object consists of those counters that apply to more than one component on the computer </p>
<p>

<b>Context Switches/sec</b></p>
<p>
Context Switches/sec is the combined rate at which all processors on the computer are switched from one thread to another.

Counter Type: PERF_COUNTER_COUNTER</p>
<p>
<b>Total Processor Time</b></p>
<p>
% Total Processor Time is the average percentage of time that all processors on the computer are executing non-idle threads. This counter was designed as the primary indicator of processor activity on multiprocessor computers. It is equal to the sum of Process: %&nbsp;Processor Time for all processors, divided by the number of processors. It is calculated by summing the time that all processors spend executing the thread of the Idle process in each sample interval, subtracting that value from 100%, and dividing the difference by the number of processors on the computer. (Each processor has an Idle thread which consumes cycles when no other threads are ready to run.) For example, on a multiprocessor computer, a value of 50% means that all processors are busy for half of the sample interval, or that half of the processors are busy for all of the sample interval. </p>

<b>Total User Time</b></p>

(User mode is a restricted processing mode designed for applications, environment subsystems, and integral subsystems. The alternative, privileged mode, is designed for operating system components and allows direct access to hardware and all memory. The operating system switches application threads to privileged mode to obtain operating system services.) </p>

% Total Privileged Time is the average percentage of non-idle time all processors spent in privileged (kernel) mode. It is the sum of Processor: %&nbsp;Privileged Time for all processors on the computer, divided by the number of processors. System: %&nbsp;Total User Time and System: %&nbsp;Total Privileged Time sum to % Total Processor Time, but not always to 100%. (Privileged mode is an processing mode designed for operating system components which allows direct access to hardware and all memory. The operating system switches application threads to privileged mode to obtain operating system services. The alternative, user mode, is a restricted processing mode designed for applications and environment subsystems.) </p>

Counter Type: PERF_100NSEC_TIMER</p>
<p>
<b>Total Interrupts/sec</b></p>
<p>
Total Interrupts/sec is the combined rate of hardware interrupts received and serviced by all processors on the computer It is the sum of Processor: Interrupts/sec for all processors, and divided by the number of processors, and is measured in numbers of interrupts. It does not include DPCs, which are counted separately. This value is an indirect indicator of the activity of devices that generate interrupts, such as the system timer, the mouse, disk drivers, data communication lines, network interface cards and other peripheral devices. These devices normally interrupt the processor when they have completed a task or require attention. Normal thread execution is suspended during interrupts. Most system clocks interrupt the processor every 10 milliseconds, creating a background of interrupt activity. </p>

<b>Processor Queue Length</b></p>
<p>
Processor Queue Length is the number of threads in the processor queue. There is a single queue for processor time even on computers with multiple processors. Unlike the disk counters, this counter counts ready threads only, not threads that are running. A sustained processor queue of greater than two threads generally indicates processor congestion. </p>
