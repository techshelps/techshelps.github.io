<h1><a name="_win32_tcp_object"></a>TCP Object</h1>
<p>
The TCP performance object consists of counters that measure the rates at which TCP Segments are sent and received by using the TCP protocol. It includes counters that monitor the number of TCP connections in each TCP connection state.</p>
<p>
<b>Segments/sec</b></p>
<p>
Segments/sec is the rate at which TCP segments are sent or received using the TCP protocol.</p>
<p>
Detail Level: Advanced<br>
Counter Type: PERF_COUNTER_COUNTER</p>
<p>
<b>Connections Established</b></p>
<p>
Connections Established is the number of TCP connections for which the current state is either ESTABLISHED or CLOSE-WAIT.</p>
<p>
Detail Level: Advanced<br>
Counter Type: PERF_COUNTER_RAWCOUNT</p>
<p>
<b>Connections Active</b></p>
<p>
Connections Active is the number of times TCP connections have made a direct transition to the SYN-SENT state from the CLOSED state.</p>
<p>
Detail Level: Advanced<br>
Counter Type: PERF_COUNTER_RAWCOUNT</p>
<p>
<b>Connections Passive</b></p>
<p>
Connections Passive is the number of times TCP connections have made a direct transition to the SYN-RCVD state from the LISTEN state.</p>
<p>
Detail Level: Advanced<br>
Counter Type: PERF_COUNTER_RAWCOUNT</p>
<p>
<b>Connection Failures</b></p>
<p>
Connection Failures is the number of times TCP connections have made a direct transition to the CLOSED state from the SYN-SENT state or the SYN-RCVD state, plus the number of times TCP connections have made a direct transition to the LISTEN state from the SYN-RCVD state.</p>
<p>
Detail Level: Advanced<br>
Counter Type: PERF_COUNTER_RAWCOUNT</p>
<p>
<b>Connections Reset</b></p>
<p>
Connections Reset is the number of times TCP connections have made a direct transition to the CLOSED state from either the ESTABLISHED state or the CLOSE-WAIT state. </p>
<p>
Detail Level: Advanced<br>
Counter Type: PERF_COUNTER_RAWCOUNT</p>
<p>
<b>Segments Received/sec</b></p>
<p>
Segments Received/sec is the rate at which segments are received, including those received in error. This count includes segments received on currently established connections. </p>
<p>
Detail Level: Advanced<br>
Counter Type: PERF_COUNTER_COUNTER</p>
<p>
<b>Segments Sent/sec</b></p>
<p>
Segments Sent/sec is the rate at which segments are sent, including those on current connections, but excluding those containing only retransmitted bytes.</p>
<p>
Detail Level: Advanced<br>
Counter Type: PERF_COUNTER_COUNTER</p>
<p>
<b>Segments Retransmitted/sec</b></p>
<p>
Segments Retransmitted/sec is the rate at which segments are retransmitted, that is, segments transmitted containing one or more previously transmitted bytes.</p>
<p>
Detail Level: Advanced<br>
Counter Type: PERF_COUNTER_COUNTER</p>
