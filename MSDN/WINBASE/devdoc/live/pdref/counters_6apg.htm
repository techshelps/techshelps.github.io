<p>
The NBT Connection performance object consists of counters that measure the rates at which bytes are sent and received over the NBT connection between the local computer and a remote computer. The connection is identified by the name of the remote computer.</p>
<p>
<b>Bytes Received/sec</b></p>
<p>
Bytes Received/sec is the rate at which bytes are received by the local computer over an NBT connection to some remote computer. All the bytes received by the local computer over the particular NBT connection are counted.</p>
<p>
Detail Level: Advanced<br>
Counter Type: PERF_COUNTER_BULK_COUNT</p>
<p>
<b>Bytes Sent/sec</b></p>
