<h1><a name="_win32_process_address_space_object"></a>Process Address Space Object</h1>
<p>
The Process Address Space performance object consists of counters that monitor memory allocation and use for a selected process.</p>
<p>
<b>Bytes Image Reserved</b></p>
<p>
Bytes Image Reserved is the sum of all virtual memory reserved by images run within this process.</p>
<p>
Detail Level: Wizard<br>
Counter Type: PERF_COUNTER_RAWCOUNT</p>
<p>
<b>ID Process</b></p>
<p>
ID Process is the unique identifier of this process. ID Process numbers are reused, so they only identify a process for the lifetime of that process.</p>
<p>
Detail Level: Wizard<br>
Counter Type: PERF_COUNTER_RAWCOUNT</p>
<p>
<b>Bytes Image Free</b></p>
<p>
Bytes Image Free is the amount of virtual address space that is not in use or reserved by images within this process.</p>
<p>

<p>
<b>Mapped Space No Access</b></p>
<p>
Mapped Space is virtual memory that has been mapped  to a specific virtual address (or range of virtual addresses) in the process's virtual address space. No Access protection prevents a process from writing to or reading from these pages and will generate an access violation if either is attempted.</p>
