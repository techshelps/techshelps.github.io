<h1><a name="introductiontomobilepcplatformguidelines"></a>Introduction to Mobile PC Platform Guidelines</h1>
<p>
Many of the features required for Basic PC&nbsp;98 demand significant power and heat dissipation, which will not work physically in the notebook environment. For mobile&nbsp;PC users, the issues of greater importance are portability (weight) and availability (battery life). The mini-notebook, an emerging class of machines, presents new demands with more stringent constraints that also must be addressed.</p>
<p>
New external buses, support for multimedia applications, and other changes in PCs challenge mobile PC designers to incorporate the features that users want in a&nbsp;way that does not reduce the value of the core system.</p>
<p>
The overall goal for mobile PC design is the same as for PC&nbsp;98 design—enhanced user experience—but the design tradeoffs are different. This section presents mobile&nbsp;PC requirements in a manner that will encourage industry innovation across a wide range of design solutions without creating extreme power demands. Mobile&nbsp;PC requirements allow OEMs the flexibility they need to manage power and heat considerations in their designs.</p>
<p>
Because OnNow and ACPI standards are now spreading throughout the industry, 1998 represents a transition for mobile computing. The new standards allow the&nbsp;operating system to take over the critical operations, such as dynamic configuration and power management, in support of mobile PCs.</p>
<p>
The key mobile PC design issues include:
<ul>
<li>
Low weight and small size.<br><br></li>
<li>
Available battery life to meet user expectations.<br><br></li>
<li>
Power demands and heat dissipation on notebook computers managed to ensure reliable operation of internal components.<br><br></li>
<li>
Mobile units docked or connected to AC power versus battery power (DC).<p>
Many of the projected uses for PC&nbsp;98 computers include CPU-intensive and memory-intensive activities that further stress the power demands on mobile PCs.
