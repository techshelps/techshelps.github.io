Graphics Adapter and Multimedia Requirements</h1>

<p>
This section summarizes the Net PC requirements for the graphics adapter and monitor. </p>

<p>
<b>56. Display adapter meets PC 97 and Net PC minimum requirements</b></p>
<p>
<i>Required</i></p>

<p>
Recommended: PCI 2.1 or AGP </p>

<p>
A Net PC system must contain a graphics adapter that permits a color depth of 16 bits per pixel (bpp), minimum. The following are the minimum requirements:</p>

<ul>
<li>
Minimum resolution: 800x600x16 bpp for Windows desktop and 640x480x16 bpp double buffered for Microsoft DirectDraw® &ndash; based full-screen applications.
<p>
Display RAM requirements are tied directly to the minimum graphics resolution supported by the adapter. The requirement to support double buffering implies 1.5 MB of display RAM. However, PC 97 requirements do not specify minimum display RAM support; rather, the adapter designer can implement any solutions for supporting the minimum resolution requirements.

</li>
<li>
Graphics adapters do not use legacy bus.
<p>
For the graphics adapter, the video bus must not use ISA. A higher-performance solution is required to optimize performance of the packed-pixel frame buffer. Possible implementations that meet this requirement can include PCI 2.1 for all system types or the Intel Accelerated Graphics Port version 1.0 (AGP) interface for systems that have Pentium Pro processors. If the graphics adapter uses the PCI bus, it must comply with PCI 2.1 and additional requirements as defined in the &ldquo;PCI&rdquo; and &ldquo;Graphics Adapters&rdquo; chapters in <i>PC 97 Hardware Design Guide</i>.

</li>
<li>
System operates normally with default VGA-mode driver.
<p>
The default VGA driver is required for installing the operating system. <br>
The adapter must support 4-bit planar VGA mode as described in the Windows 95 DDK.

</li>
<li>
Multimonitor/multiple-display adapter support meets PC 97 requirements, if dual adapter capabilities are possible in the Net PC system as provided by the system manufacturer.
<p>
For complete information, see items #1 &ndash; 16 in the &ldquo;Graphics Adapters&rdquo; chapter of <i>PC 97 Hardware Design Guide</i>. 

<p>
<b>57. Support for NTSC or PAL television output meets PC 97 requirements, if present</b>
<p>
<i>Required</i>

<p>
Implementing this support is optional. If implemented, this functionality should meet PC 97 guidelines as defined in item #34 in the &ldquo;Graphics Adapters&rdquo; chapter of <i>PC 97 Hardware Design Guide</i>.

<p>
<b>58. Monitor supports DDC 2.0 Level B, EDID, 800x600 minimum, and PC 97 requirements</b>
<p>
<i>Required</i>

<p>
A monitor designed for or included with a Net PC system must be compliant with Display Data Channel Standard version 2.0, Level B (DDC2B), which defines the communication channel between the display and host system. In addition, the monitor must transmit an Extended Display Identification Data (EDID) structure containing unique ID Manufacturer Name and ID Product Code identifiers, and all required fields as described in Section 3 of EDID Standard 1.0, revision 1.0. 

<p>
For implementation guidelines, see item #28 in the &ldquo;Video Components&rdquo; chapter of <i>PC 97 Hardware Design Guide</i> and the changes and clarifications on http://www.microsoft.com/hwdev/desguid/pc97faq.htm<i>.</i>

<p>
<b>59. System supports MPEG-1 playback requirements for PC 97 if system has CD-ROM plus multimedia audio and video capabilities</b>
<p>
<i>Required</i>

<p>
For Net PC systems that include device support for multimedia, operating system support is provided through Microsoft DirectShow™ (formerly ActiveMovie™). The minimum system requirements to support MPEG-1 playback include:

</li>
<li>
Audio and video decode performance: 30 frames per second, minimum, as defined in item #13 in the &ldquo;Video Components&rdquo; chapter of <i>PC 97 Hardware Design Guide.</i>
</li>
<li>
Graphics support for color space conversion and arithmetic stretching, including hardware arithmetic stretching and YUV off-screen surfaces for color space conversion, as defined in item #14 in the &ldquo;Video Components&rdquo; chapter of <i>PC 97 Hardware Design Guide.</i>
<p>
<b>60. PC 97 DVD playback requirements, if system includes DVD-Video</b>
<p>
<i>Required</i>

<p>
All Net PC systems that include DVD-Video support must provide PC 97 playback support for DVD content, including:

</li>
<li>
Video support for decoding MPEG-2 Main Profile and Main Level video streams.
</li>
<li>
Audio support for MPEG-2 and Dolby AC-3 decoding and DVD audio mixed with other PC audio streams.
</li>
<li>
Synchronized audio and video, meeting general broadcast industry guidelines.
</li>
<li>
Independent audio/video streams supported by the decode subsystem.
</li>
<li>
WDM-based implementation for MPEG-2 acceleration.
<p>
For implementation guidelines, see item #15 in the &ldquo;Video Components&rdquo; chapter of <i>PC 97 Hardware Design Guide.</i>

<p>
<b>61. Audio support meets PC 97 requirements, if present</b>
<p>
<i>Required</i>

<p>
Recommended: USB or host-based digital audio

<p>
If audio capabilities are implemented in a Net PC system, audio must meet PC 97 requirements, whether implemented as baseline audio (items #3 &ndash; #7) or advanced audio (items #8 &ndash; #11), as defined in the &ldquo;Audio Components&rdquo; chapter of <i>PC 97 Hardware Design Guide</i>.
