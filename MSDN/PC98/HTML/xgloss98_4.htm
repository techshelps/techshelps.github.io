<p>
<b>ECP&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>Extended capabilities port. An asynchronous, 8-bit–wide parallel channel defined by IEEE 1284-1944 that provides PC-to-peripheral and peripheral-to-PC data transfers.</p>
<p>
<b>EISA</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;Extended Industry Standard Architecture. A&nbsp;32-bit PC expansion bus designed as a superset of&nbsp;the ISA bus. Designed to expand the speed and data width of the legacy expansion bus while still supporting older ISA cards.</p>
<p>
<b>embedded controller&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>The general class of microcontrollers used to support OEM-specific implementations, mainly in mobile environments. The embedded controller performs complex low-level functions through a simple interface to the host&nbsp;microprocessor.</p>
<p>
<b>embedded controller interface</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;ACPI defines a standard hardware and software communications interface between an operating system driver and an embedded controller—for example, Smart Battery and AML code. This allows any operating system to&nbsp;provide a standard driver that can directly communicate with an embedded controller in the system, thus allowing other drivers to communicate with and use the resources of system embedded controllers.</p>
<p>
<b>EPG</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;Electronic program guide. The on-screen user&nbsp;interface that allows users to select, manage, and search television programs and other content-viewing options.</p>
<p>
<b>expansion bus&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>A group of control lines that provide a buffered interface to devices located either on the system board or on cards that are plugged into expansion connectors. Common expansion buses included on the system board are USB, PC Card, and PCI.</p>
<p>
<b>expansion card&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>A card that connects to an expansion bus and contains one or more devices.</p>
<p>
<b>expansion ROM&nbsp;&nbsp;</b><i>See</i> option ROM.</p>
