<h1><a name="chapter3basicpc98"></a>Chapter 3: Basic PC 98</h1>
<p>
This chapter provides a summary of features for the system types defined in the PC&nbsp;98 requirements. As introduced in Part&nbsp;1 of this guide, this chapter describes two different forms of the Basic PC&nbsp;98 system. It is assumed that the OEM designs and builds a baseline platform that meets the Basic PC&nbsp;98 requirements, with specific models targeted for either of two categories: Office or Consumer.</p>

<p>
<b>Important: </b>The system requirements defined in this guide provide guidelines for designing PC systems that will result in an optimal user experience with typical Windows-based applications running under either the Microsoft Windows or Windows&nbsp;NT Workstation operating systems. These design requirements are not&nbsp;the basic system requirements for running the Windows operating system.</p>

<p>
<b>Note: </b>All references in this chapter to requirements for Network PC (Net&nbsp;PC) systems refer to similarly named requirements in the <i>Network&nbsp;PC System Design Guidelines,</i> <i>Version 1.0b, </i>co-authored by Compaq Computer Corporation, Dell Computer Corporation, Hewlett-Packard Company, Intel Corporation, and Microsoft Corporation. The Net&nbsp;PC guide is included as Appendix&nbsp;E in the References part of this guide. Information about Net PC is provided as a context for Office PC&nbsp;98 requirements; Net PC is not a PC&nbsp;98 system type.</p>
