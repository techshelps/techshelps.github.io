<b>Abstract</b></p>
<p>
The interoperability of configuration services based on the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) [1] in an environment of heterogeneous clients depends on clients accurately identifying themselves and their relevant characteristics to configuration servers.  The class identifier provided through DHCP option 60 [2] helps in this regard, but such identifiers essentially only enable clients and servers that are "good friends" to find each other. This draft proposes the definition of two options that convey particular, generally useful information about the client system.  This enables all servers to recognize this information, and is a step toward a richer form of interoperability for configuration services.</p>
