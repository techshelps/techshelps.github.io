Industrial Design Requirements</h1>

<p>
This section summarizes physical design requirements for Net PC systems. Actual form factors are OEM design choices.</p>

<p>
<b>29. Minimum set of user indicators</b></p>
<p>
<i>Required</i></p>

<p>
The minimum indicator is a power light. Indicators for hard-disk activity and LAN activity are optional and can be placed for access by service personnel only, with no requirement for end users to be able to view indicators. </p>

<p>
<b>30. End user can easily control power through switches and software</b></p>
<p>
<i>Required</i></p>

<p>
The power control buttons must be implemented to meet PC 97 requirements for hardware support for the OnNow design initiative, as defined in item #5 in the &ldquo;Basic PC 97&rdquo; chapter of <i>PC 97 Hardware Design Guide, </i>plus changes and clarifications published on http://www.microsoft.com/hwdev/desguid/pc97faq.htm.</p>

<p>
<b>31. Minimal footprint</b></p>
<p>
<i>Recommended</i></p>

<p>
In general, the form factor chosen for the Net PC should be small and should accommodate the full processor range. </p>

<p>
<b>32. Lockable or sealed-case design with no end-user accessible internal expansion capabilities</b></p>
<p>
<i>Required</i></p>

<p>
Net PC systems include no internal expansion slots that are accessible to end users. The Net PC goals do not allow end users to add devices using traditional internal expansion capabilities. The meaning of this requirement is the equivalent of &ldquo;no user-serviceable parts inside&rdquo; for consumer electronics or appliances. It does not preclude providing internal expansion slots to allow the OEM to provide additional devices in manufacturing or to allow qualified service personnel to install internal devices.</p>

<p>
See also the requirements and recommendations for external expansion buses in the &ldquo;System Buses&rdquo; section later in this document.</p>

<p>
<b>33. Thermal sensor for monitoring temperature in the chassis</b></p>
<p>
<i>Optional</i></p>

<p>
This solution must be implemented under the ACPI specification, version 1.0 or higher. If implemented in any Net PC system, this must provide support for automatic shutdown in overtemp conditions. </p>

<p>
