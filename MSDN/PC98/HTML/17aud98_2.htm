<h1><a name="pcaudiotransitions"></a>PC Audio Transitions</h1>
<p>
Throughout 1997 and 1998, audio in the PC will offer a wide array of possibilities as a number of transitions take place. Perhaps the most significant transition is the continuing shift from where hardware exclusively processes audio to where the host processor shares some if not all of the burden. To provide the flexibility and performance that is required, a new architecture is needed to connect audio hardware and software. WDM will serve as the support mechanism for the next generation of PC audio.</p>
<p>
As the PC is increasingly called upon to play the part of a consumer-electronics device (for example, video-disc playback), sound quality becomes more important. A number of initiatives are underway to achieve optimal sound quality. Another implication of this trend is the need for simpler operation and hardware configuration.</p>
<p>
The state of audio functionality is far from stagnant, presenting a challenge for the&nbsp;industry to maximize performance and simplicity, and to add more advanced features. This chapter will focus on how and when this can be done.</p>
<p>
The shift to higher quality and support for external digital connectivity will not happen overnight. One objective of PC 98 Audio is to facilitate the transition over the next few years. The remainder of this section is a summary of the projected evolution of PC audio.</p>
<p>
The following figure demonstrates that by mid-1998, four viable audio solutions will exist in the PC marketplace. The figure also projects the estimated market share for each solution over the next three years.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<b>Digital Audio Migration</h1>
<p>
The following explains the marketplace options illustrated in the previous figure:
<ul>
<li>
<b>ISA (legacy MS-DOS–compatible).</b> These are mature, low-cost, single-chip implementations that deliver support for Sound Blaster registers and mixing, Yamaha OPL-compatible frequency modulation (FM) synthesis, MPU 401 MIDI UART, and game port. Each is fully Plug and Play-compatible.<br><br></li>
<li>
<b>PCI (legacy MS-DOS–compatible).</b> The majority of current PCI implementations are two-chip split digital/analog system-board or add-on designs based on Audio Codec ’97 architecture. Many of these designs incorporate hardware support for legacy ISA devices using PC/PCI DMA, distributed DMA (DDMA), or other similar techniques, and are fully Plug and Play-compatible. Many also support high-quality wave table MIDI synthesis and DirectX acceleration.<br><br></li>
<li>
<b>PCI (digital ready).</b> The next generation of PCI-based designs have the potential to deliver WDM-compatible audio acceleration that can be part of&nbsp;a&nbsp;filter graph targeting either a built-in audio codec or an external USB codec for&nbsp;output. These designs have the option of leveraging the WDM legacy emulation capabilities or incorporating hardware legacy compatibility. A digital-ready PC can support mixed configuration of analog and/or digital peripherals.<br><br></li>
<li>
<b>USB (digital only). </b>These systems eliminate all built-in audio rendering resources and use external USB speakers and microphones for audio I/O. Hardware acceleration can be provided by WDM-compatible PCI devices.</li>
</ul><p>
The following factors will determine which of the previously listed audio solutions are suitable in 1998:
</p>
<ul><li>
Cost. The total bill of materials for ISA, PCI, and USB solutions, including microphone and speakers.<br><br></li>
<li>
Compatibility. The desired level of legacy MS-DOS–based game compatibility.<br><br></li>
<li>
Quality. The system output dynamic range and total harmonic distortion plus&nbsp;noise (THD+N) performance necessary to meet specific market requirements.<br><br></li>
<li>
Features. Support for 48-kHz sample rate operation, which is necessary for&nbsp;DVD.<br><br></li>
<li>
Performance. Dependent on the choice of host processor, audio bus (ISA,&nbsp;PCI,&nbsp;or USB), and system audio hardware acceleration features, such&nbsp;as&nbsp;Downloadable Samples (DLS) wave-table MIDI synthesis and multistream Head Related Transfer Function (HRTF) 3-D.<br><br></li>
<li>
Connectivity. Internal analog mixer connectivity for legacy CD audio, analog&nbsp;television tuner, line input, or video capture audio input.<p>
Three audio applications merit more detailed discussion and are described in the&nbsp;following sections:
</li>
<li>
Scalable audio for 3-D games<br><br></li>
<li>
CD and DVD media playback<br><br></li>
<li>
Full-duplex H.323/H.324 video and audio conferencing</li>
</ul>
