<h1><a name="workstationplatformguidelines"></a>Workstation Platform Guidelines</h1>
<p>
The goal of this chapter is to describe requirements that define a workstation that&nbsp;is optimized to run Windows&nbsp;NT Workstation and to support Win32-based applications created for the workstation. The workstation is a platform for users whose principal computing tasks involve running mission-critical networked applications, engineering or scientific applications, media-authoring tools, or software-development tools.</p>
<p>
Although Windows&nbsp;NT Workstation is used on stand-alone systems, the PC&nbsp;98 requirements support the more common use of Windows&nbsp;NT Workstation as a platform for network productivity.</p>
<p>
The key design issues for PC&nbsp;98 workstations include processor, memory, and bus&nbsp;architecture requirements to support intensive computational activities.</p>
<p>
<b>1. Workstation meets all requirements for Office PC&nbsp;98</h1>
<table border=1 cols=3 frame=void rules=rows>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=30%><b>Required</b></td>
<td width=30%></td>
<td width=30%></td>
</tr>
</table><br>
<p>
Each Basic PC&nbsp;98 component indicated as a requirement for Office PC&nbsp;98 is also a requirement for PC&nbsp;98 workstations.</p>
<p>
<b>Note: </b>Systems designed to run only on Windows&nbsp;NT are not required to meet PC&nbsp;98 requirements for legacy Plug and Play support. If the system is designed to run either Windows&nbsp;98 or Windows&nbsp;NT, it must meet all PC&nbsp;98 requirements for legacy Plug and Play support.</p>
<p>
<b>2. Workstation meets requirements for optimal performance</h1>
<table border=1 cols=3 frame=void rules=rows>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=30%><b>Required</b></td>
<td width=30%></td>
<td width=30%></td>
</tr>
</table><br>
<p>
In addition to the basic PC&nbsp;98 minimum requirements, the following items are required for optimal workstation performance:
<ul>
<li>
Pentium Pro or Pentium II processor, RISC-based processor, or equivalent&nbsp;performance.<br><br></li>
<li>
64-MB RAM.</li></ul>
<p>
For multiprocessor systems, 64 MB minimum is required for each processor.
</p>
<ul><li>
Minimum 512K L2 cache (per processor for multiple processors).</li></ul>
<p>
<b>3. Workstation supports multiple processors</b></p>
<table border=1 cols=3 frame=void rules=rows>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=30%><b>Recommended</b></td>
<td width=30%></td>
<td width=30%></td>
</tr>
</table><br>
<p>
Multiprocessor support using Intel Architecture processors must comply with <i>MultiProcessor Specification, Version 1.4</i> or higher, from Intel Corporation.</p>
<p>
If multiprocessor support is provided, each processor must have a separate L2&nbsp;cache.</p>
<p>
<b>4. Workstation RAM can be expanded</h1>
<table border=1 cols=3 frame=void rules=rows>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=30%><b>Recommended</b></td>
<td width=30%></td>
<td width=30%></td>
</tr>
</table><br>
<p>
Workstation RAM should be capable of being expanded to at least 1&nbsp;GB.</p>
<p>
<b>5. Workstation system memory includes ECC memory protection</h1>
<table border=1 cols=3 frame=void rules=rows>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=30%><b>Required</b></td>
<td width=30%></td>
<td width=30%></td>
</tr>
</table><br>
<p>
The system memory and L2 cache must be protected with Error Correction Code (ECC) memory protection. The ECC must be able to detect a double-bit error in one word and to correct a single-bit error in one word, where “word” means the base width in bits of the memory subsystem. To detect the failure of a single DRAM device, the ECC should be capable of detecting a 4-bit or 8-bit error in&nbsp;one word, with detection of 4-bit errors preferred. An error that cannot be corrected must result in a system fault.</p>
<p>
<b>6. Workstation includes APIC support</h1>
<table border=1 cols=3 frame=void rules=rows>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=30%><b>Required</b></td>
<td width=30%></td>
<td width=30%></td>
</tr>
</table><br>
<p>
The workstation must include APIC support, implemented as defined in the APIC&nbsp;extension to the ACPI 1.0 specification. Features such as targeted interrupts, broadcast interrupts, and prior-owner interrupts must be supported. Intel Architecture processor implementations can use the Intel APIC component.</p>
<p>
<b>7. Workstation includes high-performance components</h1>
<table border=1 cols=3 frame=void rules=rows>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=30%><b>Recommended</b></td>
<td width=30%></td>
<td width=30%></td>
</tr>
</table><br>
<p>
Basic PC&nbsp;98 requirements support high-performance components for workstations, such as bus mastering for I/O and storage and write combining for Pentium Pro and Pentium II processors. In addition, the PC&nbsp;98 recommendation for ensuring that drivers are tuned for 32-bit performance is especially recommended for workstations.</p>
<p>
<b>8. Workstation supports 64-bit I/O bus architecture</h1>
<table border=1 cols=3 frame=void rules=rows>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=30%><b>Recommended</b></td>
<td width=30%></td>
<td width=30%></td>
</tr>
</table><br>
<p>
For PCI, the workstation should support the 64-bit physical address space, and PCI adapters should be able to address any location in that address space.</p>
<p>
<b>9. Workstation does not include ISA expansion slots</h1>
<table border=1 cols=3 frame=void rules=rows>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=30%><b>Recommended</b></td>
<td width=30%></td>
<td width=30%></td>
</tr>
</table><br>
<p>
It is strongly recommended that workstations not include ISA expansion slots. ISA devices cannot meet the high-performance requirements for workstation systems, resulting in a performance bottleneck.</p>
<p>
<b>10. Graphics subsystem supports workstation performance demands</h1>
<table border=1 cols=3 frame=void rules=rows>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=30%><b>Required</b></td>
<td width=30%></td>
<td width=30%></td>
</tr>
</table><br>
<p>
This requirement is for workstations designed to support high-resolution graphics&nbsp;applications. A workstation does not have to meet this requirement if it&nbsp;is&nbsp;designed for financial or transaction-based markets and is not intended to support graphics-intensive applications.</p>
<p>
For a workstation PC that is intended to support graphics-intensive applications the following PC&nbsp;98 support must be provided:
<ul>
<li>
For Pentium Pro and Pentium II or compatible processors, 4&nbsp;MB of display RAM and support for write-combining optimizations under Windows&nbsp;NT.<br><br></li>
<li>
Support for 3-D hardware acceleration with DirectX support or OpenGL acceleration.</li></ul>
<p>
Direct3D hardware designed to support OpenGL-based applications must be capable of meeting the OpenGL rasterization rules. Direct3D drivers must report through the appropriate capabilities bit whether or not the hardware actually conforms to OpenGL requirements.</P>
<p>
For information about 3-D hardware acceleration supported by Direct3D, see the “Graphics Adapters” chapter in Part&nbsp;4 of this guide. For information about OpenGL rasterization requirements and conformance rules, see the web site at http://www.sgi.com/technology/opengl/arb.html.</P>
<p>
For workstation systems intended for use with computer-aided design (CAD) or other high-performance graphical applications, 1280&nbsp;×&nbsp;1024&nbsp;×&nbsp;24&nbsp;bpp resolution is recommended. Hardware that implements 32-bpp display modes (for example, display hardware for high-end engineering workstations) should implement RGB-mode rasterization.</p>
<p>
<b>11. Workstation meets PC 98 DVD-Video and MPEG-2 playback requirements</b></p>
<table border=1 cols=3 frame=void rules=rows>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=30%><b>Required, with DVD-Video </b></td>
<td width=30%></td>
<td width=30%></td>
</tr>
</table><br>
<p>
Support for DVD-Video playback is required for a workstation only if the workstation supports playback on DVD-Video devices.</p>
<p>
If the workstation does include a DVD-Video device, then the system must support MPEG-2 and DVD-Video playback as described in the “Graphics Adapters” and “Video and Broadcast Components” chapters in Part&nbsp;4 of this&nbsp;guide.</p>
<p>
<b>12. Storage components rely on SCSI controller</h1>
<table border=1 cols=3 frame=void rules=rows>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=30%><b>Recommended</b></td>
<td width=30%></td>
<td width=30%></td>
</tr>
</table><br>
<p>
SCSI is a flexible I/O bus that supports good performance for access and throughput to meet a workstation’s intensive data transfer needs. For more information about related requirements, see the “SCSI” chapter in Part&nbsp;3 of this&nbsp;guide.</p>
<p>
<b>13. Workstation includes multiple hard drives</h1>
<table border=1 cols=3 frame=void rules=rows>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=30%><b>Recommended</b></td>
<td width=30%></td>
<td width=30%></td>
</tr>
</table><br>
<p>
Recommended: Hardware acceleration of RAID (redundant array of inexpensive disks) drives.</p>
<p>
Multiple hard drives can be incorporated for improved performance (multiple spindle access and striping with RAID 0) or for data integrity (RAID 1/5).</p>
