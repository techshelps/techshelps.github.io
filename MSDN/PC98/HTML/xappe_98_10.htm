WMI Driver Instrumentation</h1>

<p>
This section summarizes the requirements related to implementing instrumentation for WMI-capable systems using the WMI extensions.</p>

<p>
<b>17. Support WMI/CIM and Win32 extensions schema objects and data </b></p>
<p>
<i>Required</i></p>

<p>
For Net PCs running WMI-capable operating systems, the CIM and Win32 extensions schema classes and associations listed in &ldquo;Attachment H: WMI/CIM and Win32 Extensions Instrumentation Details&rdquo; must be supported through WMI. Subsequent revisions of <i>Network PC System Design Guidelines</i> will incorporate additions to this set of classes and associations.</p>

<p>
<b>18. Support WMI alert generation for required events </b></p>
<p>
<i>Optional</i></p>

<p>
None of the classes defined in the required schema have required events. Therefore, support for WMI alert generation is not required at this time, but might become required in subsequent revisions of <i>Network PC System Design Guidelines</i>.</p>

<p>
<b>19. Compliant with WMI alert model for WMI alerts </b></p>
<p>
<i>Required</i></p>

<p>
WMI alerts that fit within the size limitation of the alert buffer can be sent directly with the alert packet. Larger alerts are required to send a global unique ID (GUID) in the alert, which is then later queried to obtain the full alert data.</p>

<p>
All WMI alerts must supply a WMI alert severity level as recognized by the WMI alert model.</p>

<p>
<b>20. WMI instrumentation interface meets device-specific requirements</b></p>
<p>
<i>Required</i></p>

<p>
WMI-based component instrumentation must comply with the device-specific requirements that will be described in the Microsoft Windows Device Driver Kit (DDK) WMI supplement.</p>

<p>
DMI Component Instrumentation</p>

<p>
This section summarizes the requirements if a DMI-based instrumentation solution is implemented.</p>

<p>
<b>21. DMI standard groups instrumented and deployed</b></p>
<p>
<i>Required</i></p>

<p>
The standard groups listed in &ldquo;Attachment I: DMI Instrumentation Details&rdquo; must be instrumented and deployed on DMI-instrumented Net PCs.</p>

<p>
<b>22. Components compliant with DMI Component Interface</b></p>
<p>
<i>Required</i></p>

<p>
DMI-instrumented components on Net PCs must comply with the Component Interface (CI) as specified for DMI version 2.0. This interface includes compliance with the Service Provider API for Components and the Component Provider API. The required DMI instrumentation must be deployed with each DMI-instrumented platform and installed with the operating system. See the DMTF compliance guidelines regarding backward compatibility for existing instrumentation implemented using the DMI version 1.x block interface.</p>

<p>
<b>23. DMI event generation for DMI events in required groups</b></p>
<p>
<i>Optional</i></p>

<p>
Some of the required standard groups specified in &ldquo;Attachment I: MI Instrumentation Details&rdquo; are associated with event generation groups. Event generation for these groups is optional.</p>

<p>
<b>24. Compliant with DMI event model for DMI events generated</b></p>
<p>
<i>Required</i></p>

<p>
If DMI-based instrumentation generates events associated with a required group, event generation must be compliant with the event model specification defined in <i>Desktop Management Interface Specification, Version 2.00</i>.</p>
