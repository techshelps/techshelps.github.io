<h1><a name="plugplayisasystemrequirements"></a>Plug and Play ISA System Requirements</h1>
<p>
Although in general ISA devices are excluded from PC&nbsp;98, many PC 98 systems will include ISA support that allows users to insert ISA add-on devices. This section summarizes the basic requirements for a PC system that includes the ISA bus. In PC&nbsp;97, ISA was required to be implemented with full support for Plug and Play ISA boot devices.</p>
<p>
In addition to ISA expansion cards, the following are also ISA devices:
<ul>
<li>
8042 and similar controllers, ports, keyboards, and mice<br><br></li>
<li>
DMA controllers and slaves<br><br></li>
<li>
FDCs<br><br></li>
<li>
Interrupt controllers<br><br></li>
<li>
Legacy parallel and serial ports<br><br></li>
<li>
Math coprocessors<br><br></li>
<li>
PITs<br><br></li>
<li>
VGA controllers</li></ul><p>
Any such devices located at I/O addresses below 100h can use fixed resources and are exempt from Plug and Play requirements for unique IDs, flexible resource configuration, and dynamic disable capabilities.</P>

<p>
If ISA support is included in a PC 98 system, the manufacturer must implement the standards described in the following Plug and Play specifications:
<ul>
<li>
<i>Plug and Play ISA Specification, Version 1.0a</i><br><br></li>
<li>
<i>Plug and Play BIOS Specification, Version 1.0a</i><br><br></li>
<li>
<i>Clarifications to the Plug and Play BIOS Specification, Version 1.0a.</i></li>
</ul>
<p>
The Plug and Play specifications are available at http://www.microsoft.com/hwdev/specs/pnpspecs.htm. Additional ISA clarifications and white papers related to ISA Plug and Play under the Microsoft Windows operating system are available at http://www.microsoft.com/hwdev/busbios/.</p>
<p>
<b>Note: </b>Standard system devices are excluded from this requirement. The system can reserve static resources for devices such as interrupt controllers 1 and 2, timer (8254-2), keyboard controller (8042), real-time clock, DMA page registers, DMA controllers 1 and 2, and math coprocessor (if present). For a system based on Intel Architecture, these fixed resources are located at I/O addresses below 100H and can also include an NMI mask.</p>
