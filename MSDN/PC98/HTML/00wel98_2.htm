<p>
In this guide, hardware features are described as <i>Required</i>, <i>Recommended</i>, or&nbsp;<i>Optional.</i> For PC&nbsp;98, these terms are used to mean the following:
<ul>
<li>
<b>Required: </b>These basic features must be implemented in order for hardware to&nbsp;comply with PC&nbsp;98 requirements. <br><br></li>
<li>
<b>Recommended: </b>These features add capabilities that are supported by the Windows family of operating systems. Recommended features take advantage of the native capabilities of the device drivers included with the operating system, usually without imposing major cost increases. <br><br></li>
<li>
Notice that for compliance testing, if a recommended feature is implemented, it&nbsp;must meet the requirements for that feature as defined in this guide.<br><br></li>
<li>
Some recommended features might become requirements in the future.<br><br></li>
<li>
<b>Optional: </b>These features are neither required nor recommended, but if the&nbsp;feature is implemented in a PC&nbsp;98 system, it must meet the specified requirements. Optional features will not become requirements in the future.<p>
In this guide, these words can be understood as follows with regard to PC&nbsp;98 requirements:
</li>
<li>
<b>Must:</b> Required<br><br></li>
<li>
<b>Should:</b> Recommended</li>
</ul>
<p>
<b>Important: </b>The requirements and recommendations in this guide are often provided in the form of references to industry specifications. These specifications might contain intellectual property of Intel, Microsoft, or other third parties. Each of these industry specifications might have different intellectual property licensing arrangements. It is the original equipment manufacturer’s (OEM’s) responsibility to consult these industry specifications or their issuance bodies for licensing specifics or details.</p>
