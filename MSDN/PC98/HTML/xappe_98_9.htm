Component Instrumentation Requirements</h1>

<p>
To ensure a basic level of manageability, a baseline set of platform management information for each Net PC needs to be available to management applications. This section addresses how system components make this information available and which information must be made available.</p>

<p>
<b>16. Baseline platform management information capabilities</b></p>
<p>
<i>Required</i></p>

<p>
The solution for Net PC component instrumentation for WMI-capable systems is use of the WMI extensions to WDM that use the CIM and Win32 extensions schema. </p>

<p>
The solution for advancing manageability and deploying manageable platforms with operating systems that are not WMI-capable is the DMI 2.0-based instrumentation solution. Intel and Microsoft are working together to ensure that there will be no loss of functionality as Net PCs are upgraded to use WMI-enabled operating systems.</p>
