<h1><a name="floppydiskcontroller"></a>Floppy Disk Controller</h1>
<p>
This section describes the specific requirements for any FDC provided with a PC&nbsp;98 system. The device must also meet the general requirements defined in the&nbsp;“Storage Peripherals Basic Features” section earlier in this chapter and the “PC 98 Design for Storage Components” section later in this chapter.</p>
<p>
PC 98 does not require an FDC. Although most systems include some form of floppy disk drive, some Office PC&nbsp;98 systems might not need one.</p>
<p>
<b>11. Floppy disk capabilities provided through expansion card or external&nbsp;bus</h1>
<table border=1 cols=3 frame=void rules=rows>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=30%><b>Recommended</b></td>
<td width=30%></td>
<td width=30%></td>

</table><br>
<p>
To support migration away from legacy devices, it is recommended that support for floppy disk drives be provided by a solution based on an external bus, such as USB or PC Card, or an expansion card for SCSI or IDE.</p>
<p>
<b>12. IDE floppy drive complies with SFF 8070</h1>
<table border=1 cols=3 frame=void rules=rows>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=30%><b>Required</b></td>
<td width=30%></td>
<td width=30%></td>
</tr>
</table><br>
<p>
The SFF 8070 specification defines the required implementation supported by the Windows operating system, including support for ATA floptical drives.</p>
<p>
<b>13. Legacy FDC built into system</h1>
<table border=1 cols=3 frame=void rules=rows>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=30%><b>Optional</b></td>
<td width=30%></td>
<td width=30%></td>
</tr>
</table><br>
<p>
Including a legacy FDC on a PC&nbsp;98 system is optional. However, if a legacy FDC is included, it must meet the requirements listed in this section.</p>
<p>
<b>14. Legacy FDC device meets resource configuration requirements</h1>
<table border=1 cols=3 frame=void rules=rows>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=30%><b>Required</b></td>
<td width=30%></td>
<td width=30%></td>
</tr>
</table><br>
<p>
The following resource requirements must be met for each FDC device on the system (not shared among devices of the same type):
<ul>
<li>
Use static I/O addresses 3F2h, 3F4h, and 3F5h. Additional addresses can be provided in the event of conflict.<br><br></li>
<li>
Use IRQ 6.<br><br></li>
<li>
Use DMA Channel 2 if FDC supports block data transfers to memory using DMA&nbsp;controllers.</li>
</ul><p>
<b>15. System supports conflict resolution and dynamic disable capabilities for legacy FDC</b>
</p>
<table border=1 cols=3 frame=void rules=rows>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=30%><b>Required</b></td>
<td width=30%></td>
<td width=30%></td>
</tr>
</table><br>
<p>
The FDC must be capable of being disabled. For example, if the FDC is located on the system board and an adapter card that includes an FDC is added to the system, the system-board FDC must be capable of being disabled to prevent conflicts with the new card. If the FDC is located on an expansion card, the expansion card must allow independent dynamic disabling of the FDC and the hard disk controller. In this case, the adapter will continue to function if the FDC is disabled because of conflicts, and vice versa.</p>
