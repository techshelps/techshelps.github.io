<h1><a name="entertainmentmonitorrequirements"></a>Entertainment Monitor Requirements</h1>
<p>
The Entertainment PC system requires a picture tube ideal for both PC graphics and television/movie video. This section defines the requirements for large-screen entertainment monitors.</p>
<p>
Although an entertainment monitor is not required for Entertainment PC&nbsp;98, a large-screen monitor that is sold with an Entertainment PC&nbsp;98 system must meet the requirements defined in this section.</p>
<p>
<b>6. Large-screen monitor is 20 inches or larger if included with an Entertainment&nbsp;PC system</h1>
<table border=1 cols=3 frame=void rules=rows>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=30%><b>Required</b></td>
<td width=30%></td>
<td width=30%></td>
</tr>
</table><br>
<p>
Recommended: 31 inches or 33 inches, measured on the diagonal.</p>
<p>
<b>7. Large-screen monitor is 16:9 if included with an Entertainment PC system</h1>
<table border=1 cols=3 frame=void rules=rows>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=30%><b>Recommended</b></td>
<td width=30%></td>
<td width=30%></td>
</tr>
</table><br>
<p>
Recommended: Support 1280&nbsp;×&nbsp;720 resolution at 60 Hz.</p>
<p>
The 16:9 ratio supports the output capabilities for high-definition television (HDTV) display.</p>
<p>
<b>8. Entertainment monitor supports 800&nbsp;×&nbsp;600 at 60&nbsp;Hz refresh rate</h1>
<table border=1 cols=3 frame=void rules=rows>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=30%><b>Required</b></td>
<td width=30%></td>
<td width=30%></td>
</tr>
</table><br>
<p>
Recommended refresh rate: An integral multiple of the video frame rate for any mode in which video is displayed full screen.</p>
<p>
DVD movies and typical satellite digital broadcasts provide main-level/main-profile MPEG-2 streams, which is the middle level of the five possible levels of MPEG-2–encoded video data. This translates to 720&nbsp;×&nbsp;480&nbsp;×&nbsp;30&nbsp;fps for NTSC and 720&nbsp;×&nbsp;576&nbsp;×&nbsp;25&nbsp;fps for PAL. Consequently, 800&nbsp;×&nbsp;600 is the optimal resolution.</p>
<p>
For PAL, this is an integral multiple of 25&nbsp;Hz. For NTSC, this is an integral multiple of 30&nbsp;Hz, with an ideal rate of 120 Hz to support 24 to 30 fps content. Because most broadcast video content (such as NTSC or satellite MPEG-2 video and film) is created or adjusted through temporal rescaling or pulldown expressly for 60-Hz television monitors (at a 3:2 ratio), further pulldown to other refresh rates (such as 72&nbsp;Hz) will introduce unacceptable motion artifacts, such as non-linear screen motion.</p>
<p>
<b>9. Entertainment monitor’s host control is DDC2B-compliant, with digitally controlled geometry</h1>
<table border=1 cols=3 frame=void rules=rows>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=30%><b>Recommended</b></td>
<td width=30%></td>
<td width=30%></td>
</tr>
</table><br>
<p>
The host control of the monitor should be managed using DDC2B-compatible adapters and drivers. This recommendation is based on DDC2B, which defines the communications channel between the display and host system.</p>
<p>
Geometry control is necessary for adjustment of PC television images and includes the following controls: skew, pin cushion, size, brightness, contrast, and position. If implemented, geometry control must be provided through a software application rather than through dials on the monitor case. Controls must be revealed through a driver with a remote-controllable user interface.</p>
