<h1><a name="mobilepcdesignrequirements"></a>Mobile PC Design Requirements</h1>
<p>
This section summarizes the additional design exceptions and design requirements for mobile PCs beyond those defined for Basic PC 98.</p>
<p>
<b>1. Mobile PC performance meets PC 98 minimum requirements</h1>
<table border=1 cols=3 frame=void rules=rows>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=30%><b>Required</b></td>
<td width=30%></td>
<td width=30%></td>
</tr>
</table><br>
<p>
For mobile PC systems based on Intel Architecture processors, minimum PC&nbsp;98 performance requirements include the following:
<ul>
<li>
Minimum required CPU performance is 166-MHz Pentium processor with MMX technology, or equivalent performance.<br><br></li>
<li>
Minimum required performance is an L2 cache with 256K, or equivalent performance.<br><br></li>
<li>
Minimum required system memory is 24 MB. The Basic PC&nbsp;98 limitations for&nbsp;memory available to the operating system apply for mobile PCs.</li></ul>
<p>
Recommended: 32 MB RAM.</P><BR>
<p>
For mini-notebook requirements, see the “Mini-notebook Guidelines” section later in this chapter.
<p>
<b>2. Mobile PC supports Smart Battery or ACPI-specified battery</b></p>

<table border=1 cols=3 frame=void rules=rows>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=30%><b>Required</b></td>
<td width=30%></td>
<td width=30%></td>
</tr>
</table><br>
<p>
Recommended: Smart Battery.</p>
<p>
If Smart Battery is implemented, the battery must meet the requirements defined in the <i>Smart Battery System Specification</i>, and the charger must comply with the <i>Smart Battery Charger Specification, Version 1.0</i>, both of which are available at http://www.sbs-forum.org.</p>
<p>
If a multiple-battery system using Smart Battery is implemented, the system must&nbsp;have a battery selector that complies with <i>the Smart Battery Selector Specification, Version 1.0</i>, also available at http://www.sbs-forum.org.</p>
<p>
An embedded controller or System Management Bus (SMBus) interface is required on systems that contain a Smart Battery solution, as described Section 13 of the ACPI 1.0 specification.</p>
<p>
An ACPI Control Method Battery, defined in Section 11 of the ACPI 1.0 specification, also meets the PC 98 battery requirement.</p>
<p>
<b>3. Expansion capabilities of mobile PC are accessible to users</h1>
<table border=1 cols=3 frame=void rules=rows>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=30%><b>Required</b></td>
<td width=30%></td>
<td width=30%></td>
</tr>
</table><br>
<p>
Expansion capabilities in a mobile PC usually require external connections and, occasionally, additional internal components. The expansion slot is almost always physically blocked by access doors. Such doors are recommended for traveling integrity and to minimize entry of dust. This requirement is met if the user can access such external expansion slots without tools.</p>
<p>
Internal expansion capabilities that require internal replacements, such as CPU, memory, built-in modem, and so on, are exempt from this requirement.</p>
<p>
<b>4. Mobile PC connections use icons plus keyed or shrouded connectors</h1>
<table border=1 cols=3 frame=void rules=rows>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=30%><b>Required</b></td>
<td width=30%></td>
<td width=30%></td>
</tr>
</table><br>
<p>
This requirement is the same as for Basic PC&nbsp;98, except that for mobile PC designs, with small-height considerations, connector icons might not fit on the back of the case. In such cases, it is acceptable to wrap the icons to the bottom of&nbsp;the unit or place them on the inside of an access door.</p>
<p>
<b>5. Mobile PC includes a USB port</h1>
<table border=1 cols=3 frame=void rules=rows>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=30%><b>Required</b></td>
<td width=30%></td>
<td width=30%></td>
</tr>
</table><br>
<p>
For mobile PCs, a USB port must be built into the PC, not provided solely by port&nbsp;replicators or docking stations, although these units can provide extra USB connectors.</p>
<p>
<b>6. Mobile PC includes an IEEE 1394 port</h1>
<table border=1 cols=3 frame=void rules=rows>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=30%><b>Recommended</b></td>
<td width=30%></td>
<td width=30%></td>
</tr>
</table><br>
<p>
A docking station should include at least one IEEE 1394 port, as defined in the PC&nbsp;98 system requirements in the “Basic PC&nbsp;98” chapter in Part&nbsp;2 of this guide. If&nbsp;implemented on a mobile PC unit, the IEEE 1394 port must comply with the requirements defined in the <i>1394 Device Power Management</i> specification when the final draft is approved by the 1394 Trade Association. For more information about power management requirements for IEEE 1394, see the “IEEE 1394” chapter in Part&nbsp;3 of this guide.</p>
<p>
<b>7. USB-connected device does not maintain fully on power state</h1>
<table border=1 cols=3 frame=void rules=rows>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=30%><b>Required</b></td>
<td width=30%></td>
<td width=30%></td>
</tr>
</table><br>
<p>
An internal device that connects to the mobile PC using USB must not continually maintain the system in a fully-on power state. Such a device will override system power-management settings that control power-saving modes to protect battery life. When any USB device is connected but not active, the driver must allow system power management to suspend the notebook.</p>
<p>
<b>8. Mobile PC includes CardBus</h1>
<table border=1 cols=3 frame=void rules=rows>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=30%><b>Required</b></td>
<td width=30%></td>
<td width=30%></td>
</tr>
</table><br>
<p>
At least one 32-bit Type-2 CardBus slot (not 16-bit) is required. Additionally, Zoomed Video (ZV) support is recommended.</p>
<p>
<b>Note: </b>Each<b> </b>device in a multifunction add-on device—such as a CardBus card—must separately meet the power management device class specifications for its device class and be independently power managed. This means that both device A and device B on the same add-on card do not have to be idle before the devices can be power managed. For information, including all requirements for CardBus support, see the “PC Card” chapter in Part 3 of this guide.</p>
<p>
<b>9. Mobile PC keyboard and pointing device meet PC&nbsp;98 requirements</h1>
<table border=1 cols=3 frame=void rules=rows>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=30%><b>Required</b></td>
<td width=30%></td>
<td width=30%></td>
</tr>
</table><br>
<p>
The internal keyboard and any built-in pointing devices such a mouse, stylus, pen,&nbsp;touch pad, touch screen, trackball, stick, and so on required for a mobile PC should use standard system-board devices. The USB port can be used to support the requirement for external pointing device and keyboard connections. Alternatively, two PS/2-style ports can be implemented for the pointing device and keyboard, or a single PS/2-style port can be provided for both the pointing device and the keyboard.</p>
<p>
For more information, see the “I/O Ports and Devices” chapter in Part&nbsp;4 of this guide, which also provides information about implementing the recommended Windows and application logo keys on mobile PCs.</p>
<p>
<b>10. Mobile PC includes wireless capabilities</h1>
<table border=1 cols=3 frame=void rules=rows>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=30%><b>Recommended</b></td>
<td width=30%></td>
<td width=30%></td>
</tr>
</table><br>
<p>
If implemented, IrDA fast IR is recommended for synchronizing data exchanges with new peripherals such as digital still cameras. In addition, the software must have access to turning off the interface (D3 power state) using bus-specific methods or the methods defined in Section 3.4 of the ACPI 1.0 specification.</p>
<p>
Standards for wireless PC peripherals are being developed within IrDA, with completion expected in 1997. For information, see the “I/O Ports and Devices chapter in Part&nbsp;4 of this guide.</p>
<p>
<b>11. Mobile PC includes support for installing the operating system</h1>
<table border=1 cols=3 frame=void rules=rows>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=30%><b>Required</b></td>
<td width=30%></td>
<td width=30%></td>
</tr>
</table><br>
<p>
For mobile PCs, it is recognized that the system as purchased might not include all peripherals required for operating-system installation. Therefore, the Basic PC&nbsp;98 system support for user installation of the operating system is required, but the user might need to access another PC&nbsp;98 computer using a serial, parallel, or network connection to complete installation.</p>
<p>
<b>12. Mobile PC audio meets PC 98 audio requirements</h1>
<table border=1 cols=3 frame=void rules=rows>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=30%><b>Recommended</b></td>
<td width=30%></td>
<td width=30%></td>
</tr>
</table><br>
<p>
If audio is implemented in a mobile PC system, it should meet the requirements for&nbsp;PC 98 audio as defined in the “Audio Components” chapter in Part&nbsp;4 of this guide.</p>
<p>
<b>13. Mobile PC includes communications device</h1>
<table border=1 cols=3 frame=void rules=rows>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=30%><b>Recommended</b></td>
<td width=30%></td>
<td width=30%></td>
</tr>
</table><br>
<p>
The recommended communication devices and guidelines are the same for mobile PCs as for Basic PC&nbsp;98. The exception for modems is that if modem capabilities are integrated in the base platform, then V.80 or better is required. If modem capabilities are not integrated in the base platform, then V.80 is recommended. The exception for network adapters is that support is optional for remote new system setup capabilities as defined in the “Network Communications” chapter in&nbsp;Part&nbsp;4 of this guide.</p>
<p>
Notice that the presence of a CardBus slot on the mobile PC meets the Basic PC&nbsp;98 requirement for providing either a modem or network adapter with a Mobile PC&nbsp;98 system.</p>
<p>
<b>14. Built-in display adapter meets PC&nbsp;98 minimum requirements</h1>
<table border=1 cols=3 frame=void rules=rows>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=30%><b>Required</b></td>
<td width=30%></td>
<td width=30%></td>
</tr>
</table><br>
<p>
The minimum required resolution for the built-in display is 800&nbsp;×&nbsp;600&nbsp;×&nbsp;16&nbsp;bpp or&nbsp;1024&nbsp;×&nbsp;768&nbsp;×&nbsp;8 bpp.</p>
<p>
<b>Important: </b>For mobile PCs, most Basic PC&nbsp;98 graphics requirements apply. However, the following are recommended rather than required for mobile PCs:
<ul>
<li>
Compliance with VESA 60-Hz noninterlaced refresh rate.<br><br></li>
<li>
General support for multiple adapters and multiple monitors.</li></ul><p>
Notice that if a docking station is implemented, the base unit BIOS must have&nbsp;support for multiple adapters and multiple monitors as defined in the “Graphics Adapters” chapter in Part 4 of this guide. This support allows a user&nbsp;to add a graphics adapter in the docking station.</P>
<ul><li>
MPEG-2 and DVD-Video support features.<br><br></li>
<li>
3-D features to accelerate texture mapping, lighting, and so on.<br><br></li>
<li>
Accelerated Graphics Port (AGP).</li></ul><p>
<b>15. Mobile system supports hot pluggable devices and alternative server connections</b>
</p>
<table border=1 cols=3 frame=void rules=rows>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=30%><b>Recommended</b></td>
<td width=30%></td>
<td width=30%></td>
</tr>
</table><br>
<p>
For a mobile system, the following are additional design considerations:
<ul>
<li>
Supporting hot-pluggable devices that do not require a system reboot for insertion or removal.<br><br></li>
<li>
Including alternative methods for server connection because a LAN or dialup connection might not always be available. Methods can include a floppy boot disk, PC Card network adapter, LAN on the system board, or docking to support remote new system setup.</li></ul><p>
Support for remote wake up is not required for mobile PCs running on battery power. A CardBus implementation that supports the power management event (PME) signal meets this requirement, whether or not cards are available for testing. For information about PME signal definition, see <i>PCI Bus Power Management Interface Specification for PCI to CardBus Bridge, Revision 1.0</i> or&nbsp;higher.
