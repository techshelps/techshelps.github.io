The items in this section are requirements for Plug and Play capabilities. For Plug and Play requirements related to parallel ports, see the “I/O Ports and Devices” chapter in Part&nbsp;4 of this guide or the related bus port requirements in Part&nbsp;3 of this&nbsp;guide.</p>

Complete Plug and Play capabilities must be implemented for all buses that the device supports. For information about the Plug and Play requirements, see the related bus requirements in Part&nbsp;3 of this guide.</p>

All devices for all buses must supply a human-readable device ID in the manner required for the bus it uses. The device ID requirements for each bus type are defined in Part&nbsp;3 of this guide; however, the device ID requirements for devices that use parallel ports are defined in the IEEE 1284 specification, as summarized in the “I/O Ports and Devices” chapter in Part 4 of this guide.</p>
