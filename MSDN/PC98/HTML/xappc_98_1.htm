<h1><a name="introduction"></a>Introduction</h1>
<p>
Personal computers are powerful tools that enable people to work, create, and communicate in ways that might otherwise be difficult or impossible. The vision of making computers easier for everyone to use, however, can be realized only when people with disabilities have equal access.</p>
<p>
Computer accessibility has become an increasingly important issue in the home and workplace. An estimated eight out of ten major corporations employ people with disabilities who might need to use computers as part of their jobs. In the United States alone, more than 30 million people have disabilities that affect PC&nbsp;accessibility. In addition, as the post-war generation ages and more people experience functional limitations, computer accessibility will become a more important issue. Addressing disabilities in design will benefit all users by simplifying tasks.</p>
<p>
In the United States, legislation such as the Americans with Disabilities Act and&nbsp;Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act has brought accessibility to national attention in both the public and private sectors. Accessibility is also being incorporated into official and international standards for usability, such as ANSI&nbsp;200. Such recommendations affect the following:
