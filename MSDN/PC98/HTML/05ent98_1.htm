<h1><a name="entertainmentpc98systemrequirements"></a>Entertainment PC 98 System Requirements</h1>
<p>
This section summarizes the requirements for the basic components of Entertainment PC&nbsp;98 systems. System requirements for computational capabilities and memory are the same for Entertainment PC 98 as for all PC&nbsp;98 systems.</p>
<p>
<b>1. Entertainment PC&nbsp;98 system includes two USB ports, with at least one easily accessible connector</h1>
<table border=1 cols=3 frame=void rules=rows>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=30%><b>Required</b></td>

</table><br>
<p>
The Entertainment PC&nbsp;98 system must include two USB ports, with at least one USB connector in an easily accessible location (not on the rear panel). This is to support connection of auxiliary input devices such as game pads, joysticks, and track balls.</p>
<p>
The recommended location for an easily accessible connector is to place a port on the front of the PC. The second connector for static connections to continuously used devices can be placed on the rear of the PC.</p>
<p>
The USB implementation must meet the requirements defined in the “USB” chapter in Part&nbsp;3 of this guide.</p>
<p>
<b>2. Entertainment PC&nbsp;98 system includes two IEEE&nbsp;1394 ports, with at least one easily accessible connector</h1>
<table border=1 cols=3 frame=void rules=rows>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=30%><b>Required</b></td>
<td width=30%></td>

</table><br>
<p>
The Entertainment PC 98 system must include two IEEE 1394 ports, with at least one IEEE 1394 connector in an easily accessible location (not on the rear panel) to support camcorders and other digital consumer-electronics devices.</p>
<p>
The recommended location for an easily accessible connector is to place a port on the front of the PC. The second connector for static connections to continuously used devices can be placed on the rear of the PC.</p>
<p>
The IEEE 1394 implementation must meet the requirements defined in the “IEEE&nbsp;1394” chapter in Part 3 of this guide.</p>
<p>
<b>3. Entertainment PC&nbsp;98 system does not include ISA expansion slots</h1>
<table border=1 cols=3 frame=void rules=rows>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=30%><b>Required</b></td>
<td width=30%></td>
<td width=30%></td>
</tr>
</table><br>
<p>
For Entertainment PC&nbsp;98, the system must not contain ISA expansion slots that can be accessed by the end user. The benefits of designing ISA-free systems include easier and more stable system configuration, lower support cost, and improved performance.</p>
<p>
Any on-board legacy implementations, such as BIOS ROM, Super I/O, 8042 controllers, math coprocessors, and so on, must meet the requirements defined in&nbsp;the “Legacy Support” appendix in the References part of this guide.</p>
<p>
<b>4. All Entertainment PC 98 input devices meet USB HID specifications</h1>
<table border=1 cols=3 frame=void rules=rows>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=30%><b>Required</b></td>
<td width=30%></td>
<td width=30%></td>

</table><br>
<p>
Recommended: Wireless connection for all input devices.</p>
<p>
For Entertainment PC&nbsp;98, all keyboards, pointing devices, and game pads and their connections must be compliant with the <i>USB Device Class Definition for Human Interface Devices, Version 1.0</i> or higher, and with the <i>USB HID Usages Table, </i>whether implemented as wired or wireless devices.</p>
<p>
The game device must support at least four devices simultaneously, and its driver must support Microsoft DirectInput.</p>
<p>
<b>Note:</b> For family-room PC design, a wireless connection is strongly recommended for the keyboard, pointing device, and game pad. For a pointing device, this requirement can be satisfied by using a remote-control pointing device or by using a wireless keyboard that includes a connector to enable a standard mouse to be attached. The ability to attach a standard two-button mouse is strongly encouraged, although the device itself does not need to be included with the PC.</p>
<p>
For more information about input devices, see the “I/O Ports and Devices” chapter in Part 4 of this guide.</p>
<p>
<b>5. Entertainment PC&nbsp;98 includes remote-control pointing device</h1>
<table border=1 cols=3 frame=void rules=rows>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=30%><b>Recommended</b></td>
<td width=30%></td>
<td width=30%></td>
</tr>
</table><br>
<p>
If a remote-control pointing device is implemented on an Entertainment PC&nbsp;98 system, its command structure must be compliant with the <i>USB HID Usages Table</i>.</p>
<p>
There is no requirement for implementing an IR or RF remote-control pointing device.</p>
<p>
If included with an Entertainment PC&nbsp;98 system, the remote-control device must have the following controls:</p>
<table border=1 cols=3 frame=void rules=rows>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=62><b>Label</b></td>
<td width=102><b>Icon</b></td>
<td width=292><b>Function</b></td>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=62>Power</td>
<td width=102>—</td>
<td width=292>Toggle switch between On and Standby power state </td>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=62>Start</td>
<td width=102>Windows flag (under Microsoft licensing agreement)</td>
<td width=292>Display Start menu (same action as the keyboard Windows logo key)</td>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=62>—</td>
<td width=102>—</td>
<td width=292>Mouse pointer control, including left and right mouse&nbsp;buttons</td>
</tr>
</table><br>
<p>
In addition, the following button is recommended for remote-control devices.</p>
<table border=1 cols=3 frame=void rules=rows>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=62><b>Label</b></td>
<td width=102><b>Icon</b></td>
<td width=292><b>Function</b></td>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=62>Cancel</td>
<td width=102>—</td>
<td width=292>Same as the keyboard ESCAPE key</td>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=62>Enter</td>
<td width=102>—</td>
<td width=292>Same as the keyboard ENTER key</td>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=62>Menu</td>
<td width=102>—</td>
<td width=292>Display application menus or toolbar (same as the <br>
keyboard F10 key)</td>
</tr>
</table><br>
<p>
All buttons and any additional controls implemented by the independent hardware vendor (IHV) must comply with the current USB HID specifications, including HID usage-code specifications as defined in the <i>USB HID Usages Table</i>.</p>
<p>
<b>Note: </b>When the industry adopts standards for wireless controls, these will be incorporated as Entertainment PC system requirements.</p>
<p>
<b>6. All Entertainment PC&nbsp;98 pointing devices support DirectInput and work simultaneously</h1>
<table border=1 cols=3 frame=void rules=rows>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=30%><b>Required</b></td>
<td width=30%></td>
<td width=30%></td>
</tr>
</table><br>
<p>
All pointing devices implemented in the Entertainment PC 98 system must have drivers that support Microsoft DirectInput. All pointing devices must also be able to correctly provide simultaneous input. This means that the pointing devices must not use competing protocols and that no pointing device is automatically disabled when another pointing device is in use. This also applies to game input devices in order to enable multiplayer gaming.</p>
<p>
For information about implementing drivers that support simultaneous use of devices, see the Microsoft DirectX DDK.</p>
<p>
<b>7. Entertainment PC 98 includes data/fax/voice modem that supports V.pcm</h1>
<table border=1 cols=3 frame=void rules=rows>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=30%><b>Required</b></td>
<td width=30%></td>
<td width=30%></td>
</tr>
</table><br>
<p>
Recommended: NDIS 5.0-supported dial-up high-speed communications.</p>
<p>
The Entertainment PC&nbsp;98 minimum requirement for modem support is an internal PCM data/fax/voice modem, with WDM support where relevant. If the modem does not support V.pcm, it must be capable of being upgraded by end users to support V.pcm. For more information, see the “Modems” chapter in Part&nbsp;4 of this&nbsp;guide.</p>
<p>
<b>8. Entertainment PC&nbsp;98 includes DVD-ROM drive and DVD-Video playback</h1>
<table border=1 cols=3 frame=void rules=rows>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=30%><b>Required</b></td>
<td width=30%></td>
<td width=30%></td>
</tr>
</table><br>
<p>
The DVD-ROM device included in an Entertainment PC&nbsp;98 system must meet the requirements defined for DVD in the “Storage and Related Peripherals” chapter in Part&nbsp;4 of this guide. An Entertainment PC&nbsp;98 system must also provide playback support for DVD-Video content, as defined in the “Video and Broadcast Components” chapter in Part&nbsp;4 of this guide.</p>
