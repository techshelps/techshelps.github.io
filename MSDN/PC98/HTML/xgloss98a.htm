<p>
<b>AC-3&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>An audio standard developed by Dolby Laboratories for delivering 5.1 audio. This system compresses six channels of digital audio into 384 Kbps versus 4 Mb/s uncompressed.</p>
<p>
<b>ACPI</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;Advanced Configuration and Power Interface. A specification that defines a new interface to the system board. This interface enables the operating system to implement operating system–directed power management and system configuration. ACPI allows system manufacturers to&nbsp;build systems consistent with the OnNow design initiative for instantly available PCs.</p>
<p>
<b>ACPI hardware</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;Computer hardware with the features necessary to support operating system power management and with the interfaces to those features described using the Description Tables as specified in the ACPI specification.</p>
<p>
<b>adapter</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>See </i>device.</p>
<p>
<b>add-on devices</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;Devices that are traditionally added to the base PC system to increase functionality, such as audio, networking, graphics, SCSI controller, and so on. Add-on devices fall into two categories: devices built onto the system board, and devices on&nbsp;expansion cards added to the system through a&nbsp;system-board connector such as PCI.</p>
<p>
<b>ADSL</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line. A method for moving data over regular phone lines. An ADSL circuit is much faster than a regular phone connection, even though the wires coming into the subscriber’s premises are the same (copper) as used for regular phone service.</p>
<p>
<b>analog</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;A method of signal representation by an&nbsp;infinitely smooth universe of numeric values. Measurements that are characterized as analog include readings of voltage and current. <i>Compare with</i> digital.</p>
<p>
<b>analog video</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;A video signal that represents an infinite number of smooth gradations between given video levels. <i>Compare with</i> digital video.</p>
<p>
<b>API</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;Application programming interface. A set of routines that an applications program uses to request and carry out lower-level services performed by a computer operating system.</p>
<p>
<b>APM</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;Advanced Power Management. A software interface (defined by Microsoft and Intel) between hardware-specific power management software (such as that located in a system BIOS) and an operating system power management driver.</p>
<p>
<b>architecture</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;A general term referring to the structure of all or part of a computer system. Also refers to the design of system software, such as the operating system, as well as to the combination of hardware and basic software that links machines on a computer network.</p>
<p>
<b>ASCII</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;American Standard Code for Information Interchange. The most popular coding method used by small computers for converting letters, numbers, punctuation, and control codes into digital format.</p>
<p>
<b>ATA</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;AT Attachment. A compatible register set, and a 40-pin connector and its associated signals. More commonly known as IDE.</p>
<p>
<b>ATAPI</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;ATA Packet Interface. A hardware and software specification that documents the interface between a host computer and the CD-ROM drives using the ATA bus.</p>
<p>
<b>ATM</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;Asynchronous transfer mode. A transmission protocol that segments user traffic into small, fixed-size units called cells that are transmitted to their destination, where they are reassembled into the original traffic. During transmission, cells from different users may be intermixed asynchronously to&nbsp;maximize utilization of network resources.</p>
<p>
<b>AUI</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;Attachment Unit Interface. The portion of the Ethernet standard that specifies how a cable is to be connected to an Ethernet card. AUI specifies a cable connected to a transceiver that plugs into a 15-pin socket on the network adapter.</p>
