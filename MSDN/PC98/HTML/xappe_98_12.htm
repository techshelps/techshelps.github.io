WBEM-based Management Information Provider</h1>

<p>
Having a WBEM-based management information provider allows a Net PC to be managed by applications that can access the platform through industry-standard WBEM protocols and/or interfaces.</p>

<p>
Microsoft will implement HMMP (a protocol for which standardization is currently being proposed to the IETF) for local and remote access to CIMOM and will also implement Common Object Model (COM) for local CIMOM access in Windows NT 5.0 and Windows 98. Highest performance local accesses are achievable using the COM interface; greatest portability is achieved using HMMP.</p>

<p>
Furthermore, newly developed applications for managing WBEM-capable Net PC platforms should be written to access those platforms through industry-standard WBEM protocols and/or interfaces.</p>

<p>
<b>26. WBEM-based service provider enabled on system</b></p>
<p>
<i>Required</i></p>

<p>
The CIMOM protocol and the CIM and Win32 extensions schema will be provided automatically with WMI-instrumented Windows operating systems. For Net PC systems that are pre-installed with these operating systems, these providers must be enabled when the systems are shipped.</p>
