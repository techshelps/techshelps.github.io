<h1><a name="adslrequirements"></a>ADSL Requirements</h1>
<p>
New support is provided in the Windows and Windows&nbsp;NT operating systems for&nbsp;ADSL adapters, which provide a faster method for moving data over regular phone lines.</p>
<p>
It is recommended that manufacturers participate in developing standards for this technology. For example, review the white paper, <i>An Interoperable End-to-End Broadband Service Architecture over ADSL Systems, </i>which discusses end-to-end service interoperability over ATM over ADSL. This paper, available at http://www.microsoft.com/isp/supercomm, was jointly developed by leading ADSL vendors.</p>

For PC&nbsp;98, the driver must support NDIS 5.0. It is also recommended that the manufacturer participate in developing standards for ATM solutions.</p>
<p>

Refer to ATM Adapter requirements for ATM specific requirements if an ATM/ADSL solution is implemented.</p>

<p>
On a rate adaptive digital subscriber line (RADSL), the downstream and upstream data rates are independently set either by an automatic adaptive algorithm or by manual selection.</p>
<p>
RADSL provides the capability to optimize the transmission speed and performance over a range of telephone-line loop distances. Adaptive channel equalization ensures more robust performance in the presence of channel impairments and narrow-band interference.</p>
<p>
This also helps telephone companies to provision RADSL access on their existing networks. RADSL products can be provisioned on many telephone lines without costly and time-consuming network upgrades.</p>
