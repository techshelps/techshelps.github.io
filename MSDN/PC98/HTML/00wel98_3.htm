<td width=140>Add-on device</td>
<td width=340>Refers to devices that are traditionally added to the basic PC system to increase functionality. Examples include audio, networking, graphics, small computer system interface (SCSI) controller, and so on. Add-on devices fall into two categories: devices built on to the system board and devices on expansion cards added to the system through a system-board connector, such as Peripheral Component Interconnect (PCI).</td>

<tr valign=top>
<td width=140>Intel Architecture </td>
<td width=340>Refers to computers based on 32-bit microprocessors that use the&nbsp;Intel Architecture instruction set, such as Intel® 80486, Intel Pentium®, Intel Pentium with MMX™ technology, Pentium Pro, Pentium II, or compatible processors. MMX technology refers to&nbsp;Intel’s media-enhancement technology that includes new instructions to the Intel Architecture instruction set. </td>

<tr valign=top>
<td width=140>RISC-based</td>
<td width=340>Refers to computers based on reduced instruction set computing (RISC) architecture. Notice that all requirements and recommendations for RISC-based PCs are for the Windows&nbsp;NT operating system only.</td>

<tr valign=top>
<td width=140>System device</td>
<td width=340>Also <i>on-board device. </i>Refers to devices on the system board such&nbsp;as interrupt controllers, keyboard controller, real-time clock, direct memory access (DMA) page registers, DMA controllers, memory controllers, floppy disk controller (FDC), Integrated Device Electronics (IDE) ports, serial and parallel ports, PCI bridges, and so on. In today’s PCs, these devices are typically integrated with the&nbsp;supporting chip set.</td>
