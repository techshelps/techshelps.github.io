<h1><a name="scalableaudiofor3dgames"></a>Scalable Audio for 3-D Games</h1>
<p>
WDM audio supports the following features specifically for 3-D games under Windows&nbsp;98 and Windows&nbsp;NT 5.0:
<ul>
<li>
Software emulation of legacy hardware to support MS-DOS–based games. WDM drivers, which run in kernel mode, provide virtual Sound Blaster Pro, MPU 401, and legacy joystick interfaces.<br><br></li>
<li>
A standard interface for the application to provide multiple streams of 3-D–positioned audio. DirectSound 3-D supports software-simulated 3-D (pan and volume) and true HRTF 3-D processing at 22.05 kHz, or hardware acceleration. The architecture supports optimal configuration based on CPU performance and installed hardware.<br><br></li>
<li>
A wave-table General MIDI synthesizer entirely in kernel-mode software. This provides 24 voices of music synthesis with 22.05-kHz output. DirectShow, DirectMusic, MMSYS, and virtual MPU 401 can use the synthesizer functions. The architecture supports optimal configuration based on CPU performance and installed hardware.<br><br></li>
<li>
A high-quality kernel-mode software SRC capability, which converts data streams (including composite mixes of all 11.025-kHz or 22.05-kHz sources) to the final output mix format, typically 16-bit 44.1&nbsp;kHz (general SRC support includes other rates).<br><br></li>
<li>
A kernel-mode system-wide software mixer, which supports DirectSound, DirectShow, and MMSYS clients, plus kernel-mode WDM filters, including Red Book CD-ROM and MIDI drivers. The mixer implements highly optimized, same sample rate PCM mixing at 8-bit or 16-bit 11.025, 22.05, 44.1, and 48 kHz (general mixing support includes other formats).<br><br></li>
<li>
Flexible control of the output destination. The WDM drivers can send the master 16-bit 44.1-kHz or 48-kHz or other format output to an ISA, PCI, USB, or IEEE 1394 audio device. Additionally, support is provided for redirection of PCI-device final-mix output to USB speakers.</li>
</ul><p>
The minimum PC&nbsp;98 audio hardware support necessary for 3-D games is built-in or external audio codec support for playback of 16-bit stereo PCM data at a 44.1-kHz sample rate. For a list of the PC&nbsp;98 requirements, see the “Basic Audio Requirements” section later in this chapter.</p>
<p>
The system designer might choose to include the following optional software or hardware in order to provide additional capabilities:
</p>
<ul><li>
Hardware that provides legacy MS-DOS–based interfaces for compatibility with games (Sound Blaster Pro, FM synthesizer, MPU 401, game port)<br><br></li>
<li>
Hardware for higher quality or concurrency DLS wave-table MIDI synthesis, with associated mixing and SRC support<br><br></li>
<li>
Hardware for higher concurrency HRTF 3-D positional audio, with associated mixing and SRC support<br><br></li>
<li>
Digital-ready, WDM-compatible MIDI and HRTF 3-D hardware acceleration</li>
</ul>

<td colspan=2 width=464><sup>1</sup>Actual performance is dependent on specific processor, chip-set, memory, and I/O subsystem implementations, as well as the software implementation (integer, floating point [FP], or MMX technology). To estimate the performance on other processor speeds with MMX technology, use a ratio based on the processor’s MHz rating.<p>
<sup>2</sup>HRTF 3-D performance is based on the 3Q1997 release of Intel 3D Realistic Sound eXperience (RSX); performance of the 1Q1997 3D RSX is 20 percent.</p>
