<h1><a name="plugplaybusdesignfornetworkcommunications"></a>Plug and Play and Bus Design for Network Communications</h1>
<p>
The items in this section are PC 98 requirements for Plug and Play capabilities.</p>
<p>
<b>35. Each device has a unique Plug and Play device ID</h1>
<table cols=3>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=30%><b>Required</b></td>
<td width=30%></td>
<td width=30%></td>
</tr>
</table><br>
<p>
For a system-board device, there must be a Plug and Play device-specific ID.</p>
<p>
Each bus-specific device must provide Plug and Play device IDs in the manner required for the bus it uses, as defined in Part 3 of this guide. For example, a PCI&nbsp;device must comply with PCI 2.1 requirements and also must provide a Subsystem ID and Subsystem Vendor ID as defined in the “PCI” chapter in Part&nbsp;3&nbsp;of this guide.</p>
<p>
<b>36. Automatic resource assignment and dynamic disable capabilities are&nbsp;supported</h1>
<table cols=3>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=30%><b>Required</b></td>
<td width=30%></td>
<td width=30%></td>
</tr>
</table><br>
<p>
The system must be capable of automatically assigning, disabling, and relocating the resources used by this device as necessary using the method required for the related bus class. When an end user changes this device or adds it to the system, setting resource assignments must not require changing jumpers or switches on either the adapter or the system board. In the event of an irreconcilable conflict with other devices on the system, the system must be able to disable the device to&nbsp;prevent the system from stalling.</p>
<p>
<b>37. Plug and Play capabilities support multiple adapters</h1>
<table cols=3>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=30%><b>Required</b></td>
<td width=30%></td>
<td width=30%></td>
</tr>
</table><br>
<p>
For network communications devices, the Plug and Play IDs and resource support must be sufficient to automatically support the addition of multiple network communications devices to the system. This is true for the same and differing types of network communications devices.</p>
<p>
<b>38. All resource settings are reported in the user interface</h1>
<table cols=3>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=30%><b>Required</b></td>
<td width=30%></td>
<td width=30%></td>
</tr>
</table><br>
<p>
All resource settings must be viewable in Device Manager and in adapter properties dialog boxes. All resource settings that can be changed by the user must be changed using the standard Windows user interface, not by way of INI&nbsp;files or other setting files.</p>
