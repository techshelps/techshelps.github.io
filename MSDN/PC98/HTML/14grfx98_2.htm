<h1><a name="graphicsadaptersbasicfeatures"></a>Graphics Adapters Basic Features</h1>
<p>
This section defines basic PC 98 feature requirements for graphics adapters.</p>
<p>
<b>6. Adapter meets PC 98 general device requirements</h1>

<p>
This includes the PC 98 requirements for a Plug and Play device ID, automated software-only settings for device configuration, device drivers and Windows-based installation, and icons for external connectors. For more information, see&nbsp;the “Basic PC&nbsp;98” chapter in Part 2 of this guide.</p>
<p>
<b>7. Screen resolution and local memory capacity meet PC 98 minimum requirements</h1>

Recommended: 1024&nbsp;×&nbsp;768&nbsp;×&nbsp;24 bpp and 1280&nbsp;×&nbsp;1024&nbsp;×&nbsp;[8, 15, 16, 24]&nbsp;bpp.</p>
<p>
The adapter must support all VESA standard timings for all PC&nbsp;98 required resolutions, including 640&nbsp;×&nbsp;480&nbsp;×&nbsp;[8, 15, 16,&nbsp;24] bpp, 800&nbsp;×&nbsp;600&nbsp;× [8,&nbsp;15,&nbsp;16,&nbsp;24]&nbsp;bpp, and 1024&nbsp;×&nbsp;768&nbsp;×&nbsp;[8, 15, 16] bpp.</p>
<p>
For a mobile PC’s external display support, the graphics subsystem must support the Basic PC&nbsp;98 requirements. For a mobile PC’s internal display, see the requirements in the “Monitors” chapter in Part&nbsp;4 of this guide.</p>
<p>
For any PC 98 system that requires quality rendering of 2-D graphics, the minimum support is double buffering for up to 800&nbsp;×&nbsp;600&nbsp;×&nbsp;16&nbsp;bpp. For any PC&nbsp;98 system that requires 3-D rendering in any fashion, whether using software or hardware acceleration, the minimum requirements are 800&nbsp;×&nbsp;600&nbsp;×&nbsp;16&nbsp;bpp double-buffered, Z buffer, and 1.25-MB local texture cache. On AGP systems, there is no requirement for local texture cache.</p>
<p>
For future 3-D titles, the high triangle content will make increased demands on graphics bandwidth. High-performance designs for systems such as Entertainment PC&nbsp;98 or Consumer PC&nbsp;98 that will support Direct3D applications should provide sufficient 3-D texture access to meet the 3-D performance recommendations defined in the item “Hardware meets PC&nbsp;98 3-D accelerator performance requirements” later in this chapter.</p>
<p>
Texture compression can provide additional effective texture memory, and it also increases the effective memory bandwidth that is available.</p>
<p>
<b>Note: </b>When the user selects 1024&nbsp;×&nbsp;768 resolution, by default the graphics adapter must use a non-interlaced refresh rate. A graphics adapter can default to&nbsp;1024&nbsp;×&nbsp;768 interlaced mode in either of the following situations:
<ul>
<li>
The attached monitor is not DDC-compatible and the user has not selected a&nbsp;monitor type in the display control panel.<br><br></li>
<li>
The monitor does not support 1024&nbsp;×&nbsp;768 non-interlaced mode, as determined from the Extended Display Identification Data (EDID) or registry settings.</li>
</ul><p>
<b>8. Adapter meets VESA specifications for ergonomic timing rates</b>

</table><br>
<p>
Recommended: 85 Hz for 1024&nbsp;×&nbsp;768, non-interlaced.</p>
<p>
The graphics adapter must support, at a minimum, the ergonomic timings documented in the current version of <i>VESA and Industry Standards and Guidelines for Computer Display Monitor Timing</i> for all resolutions up to 1280&nbsp;×&nbsp;1024 that are supported by the monitor. The minimum required support is&nbsp;75&nbsp;Hz for 1024&nbsp;×&nbsp;768, non-interlaced. Higher scan rates are preferable under standards published by VESA.</p>
<p>
<b>9. All supported color depths are enumerated</h1>
<table border=1 cols=3 frame=void rules=rows>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=30%><b>Required</b></td>
<td width=30%></td>
<td width=30%></td>

</table><br>
<p>
The driver and INF file must enumerate all modes supported so that applications can choose their preferred color depth. The driver and INF file must follow the following guidelines for enumeration:
<ul>
<li>
At a minimum, either 5:5:5 or 5:6:5 modes must be supported.<br><br></li>
<li>
If only 5:5:5 mode is supported, the driver must also enumerate this as 16-bpp mode. This is required because some applications only look for 16-bpp support and will run in 8-bit mode if they fail to find a 16-bit mode.<br><br></li>
<li>
If both 5:5:5 and 5:6:5 modes are supported, both modes are enumerated.</li>
</ul><p>
For each color depth supported, color ordering must be implemented as shown in the following list. Color ordering is shown in the following table from the most-significant bit (MSB) to the least-significant bit (LSB.)

<b>10. Graphics operations use relocatable registers only</h1>
<table border=1 cols=3 frame=void rules=rows>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=30%><b>Required</b></td>
<td width=30%></td>
<td width=30%></td>

</table><br>
<p>
VGA registers must not be used to perform graphics operations such as bit blting, palette setting, and pointer movement. The registers used for these graphics operations can be either I/O locations or memory-mapped locations, but must be&nbsp;relocatable. Normal system operation—except for system startup and mode setting—should never require use of base VGA registers.</p>
<p>
DirectDraw and Direct3D functionality must be independent of VGA. This means that graphics require VGA only for initialization.</p>
<p>
<b>11. Adapter supports downloadable RAMDAC entries for image color matching</h1>
<table border=1 cols=3 frame=void rules=rows>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=30%><b>Required</b></td>
<td width=30%></td>
<td width=30%></td>
</tr>
</table><br>
<p>
For graphics adapters that support 24-bit or higher displays, downloadable RAM digital-to-analog converter (RAMDAC) entries should be included to perform gamma correction in hardware. This capability supports the related requirement to&nbsp;use VGA only for system initialization.</p>
<p>
This capability is also one of the most frequently requested features from independent software vendors (ISVs). For example, it supports transition effects in Internet Explorer 4.0 and other applications.</p>
<p>
Image color matching (ICM) uses this capability to ensure that gamma is correct in the monitor and that games applications use this for palette switches.</p>
<p>
<b>12. Adapter supports DDC monitor detection</h1>
<table border=1 cols=3 frame=void rules=rows>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=30%><b>Required</b></td>
<td width=30%></td>
<td width=30%></td>
</tr>
</table><br>
<p>
This requirement is based on the <i>Display Data Channel Standard, Version 2.0</i> (DDC), which defines the communication channel between the display and host system. The software can use this information to properly manage output to the various displays and to prevent the disabling of television output if no monitor is&nbsp;attached.</p>
