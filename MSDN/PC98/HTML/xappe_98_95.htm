Specification</h1>
<p>
A UUID is an identifier that is unique across both space and time, with respect to the space of all UUIDs. To be precise, the UUID consists of a finite bit space. Thus the time value used for constructing a UUID is limited and will roll over in the future (approximately at A.D. 3400, based on the specified algorithm). A UUID can be used for multiple purposes, from tagging objects with an extremely short lifetime, to reliably identifying very persistent objects across a network.</p>
<p>
The generation of UUIDs does not require that a registration authority be contacted for each identifier. Instead, it requires a unique value over space for each UUID generator. This spatially unique value is specified as an IEEE 802 address, which is usually already available to network-connected systems. This 48-bit address can be assigned based on an address block obtained through the IEEE registration authority. This section of the UUID specification assumes the availability of an IEEE 802 address to a system desiring to generate a UUID, but if one is not available section 4 specifies a way to generate a probabilistically unique one that can not conflict with any properly assigned IEEE 802 address.</p>
