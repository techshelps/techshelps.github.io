Storage and Related Components</h1>

<p>
This section presents the requirements and recommendations for storage and related peripheral devices for Net PC systems. See also system BIOS requirements to support high-capacity drives in the &ldquo;BIOS and Remote New System Setup&rdquo; section earlier in this guide.</p>

<p>
<b>62. Host controller meets PC 97 requirements</b></p>
<p>
<i>Required</i></p>

<p>
Minimum requirements for SCSI, ATA and ATAPI, and IEEE 1394 are defined in related chapters in Part 3 of <i>PC 97 Hardware Design Guide</i>. </p>

<p>
<b>63. Primary host controller and devices support bus mastering</b></p>
<p>
<i>Required</i></p>

<p>
The primary host controller must support bus mastering, whether using IDE, SCSI, or IEEE 1394. Bus-mastering support must also be enabled for IDE devices, including hard disks, CD-ROM, and tape drives. Bus-master capabilities must meet the related specification for the particular controller. For example, the programming register set for PCI IDE bus master DMA is defined in Small Form Factor (SFF) 8038i.</p>

<p>
<b>64. Hard drive meets PC 97 requirements</b></p>
<p>
<i>Required</i></p>

<p>
A hard disk drive is required for the Net PC. The hard drive must meet the PC 97 requirements for hard drives and for the bus it uses, including:</p>

<ul>
<li>
Drive spin-up time supports OnNow capabilities, as defined in item # 23 in the &ldquo;Storage and Related Peripherals&rdquo; chapter of <i>PC 97 Hardware Design Guide</i>.
</li>
<li>
If IDE is used, each IDE drive must support Master, Slave, and Cable Select settings, as defined in item #24 in the &ldquo;Storage and Related Peripherals&rdquo; chapter of <i>PC 97 Hardware Design Guide</i>.
<p>
<b>65. Hard drive is SMART-compliant</b>
<p>
<i>Required</i>

<p>
SMART-compliant drive uses SMART IOCTL API, as defined in item #24 in the &ldquo;ATA and ATAPI&rdquo; chapter of <i>PC 97 Hardware Design Guide</i>.

<p>
<b>66. CD-ROM meets PC 97 and Net PC requirements, if present</b>
<p>
<i>Required</i>

<p>
Recommended: CD-ROM not included in system

<p>
If this device is present, the host controller must meet PC 97 requirements, as defined in the related chapter in Part 3 of <i>PC 97 Hardware Design Guide</i>. The CD-ROM drive must meet the PC 97 requirements defined in items #25 &ndash; #30 in the &ldquo;Storage and Related Components&rdquo; chapter of <i>PC 97 Hardware Design Guide.</i>

<p>
For Net PC, the device must be capable of remote lockdown and boot device selection. For information about requirements for remote management capabilities, see the &ldquo;Platform Management Information Requirements&rdquo; section earlier in this document and the related attachments.

<p>
<b>67. Media status notification support for ATAPI removable media, if present</b>
<p>
<i>Required</i>

<p>
IDE and ATAPI removable devices must follow the Microsoft specification named Media Status Notification, version 1.03 or higher (included in SFF 8070i ). 

<p>
CD-ROM and DVD-ROM manufacturers must use the Media Status Notification specification contained within the Mt. Fuji specification, which will be provided as SFF 8090 by the SFF Committee. 

<p>
<b>68. Legacy floppy-disk controller</b>
<p>
<i>Optional </i>

<p>
Recommended: Floppy disk capabilities not included in system

<p>
If a legacy FDC is included on a Net PC system, the drive and controller must meet PC 97 requirements, as defined in items #17 &ndash; 21 in the &ldquo;Storage and Related Peripherals&rdquo; chapter of <i>PC 97 Hardware Design Guide</i>.

<p>
For any implementation of a floppy drive on a Net PC system, the floppy drive must be capable of being remotely disabled (as a boot selection) and must make provisions for locking. For information about requirements for remote management capabilities, see the &ldquo;Platform Management Information Requirements&rdquo; section earlier in this document and the related attachments. For information about locking removable media, see the &ldquo;Hardware Security Features&rdquo; section later in this document.
