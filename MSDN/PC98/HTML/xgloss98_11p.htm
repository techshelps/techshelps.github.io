<b>Plug and Play&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>A design philosophy and set of specifications that describe hardware and software changes to the PC and its peripherals that automatically identify and arbitrate resource requirements among all devices and buses on the system. Plug and Play specifies a set of API elements that are used in addition to, but not in place of, existing driver architectures.</p>
<p>
<b>Plug and Play BIOS&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>A BIOS with responsibility for configuring Plug and Play cards and system-board devices during system power up. Provides run-time configuration services for system-board devices after start-up. <i>See also</i> ACPI.</p>
<p>
<b>power management&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>Mechanisms in software and hardware to minimize system power consumption, to&nbsp;manage system thermal limits, and to maximize system battery life.

<b>push technology</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;In client/server applications, to send data to a client without the client requesting it—for example, sending e-mail. In contrast, the World Wide Web is based on a pull technology, where the client browser must request a web page before it is sent. Broadcast media are push technologies because they send information out regardless of whether anyone is tuned in.</p>
