BIOS and Remote New System Setup</h1>

<p>
A Net PC system must be capable of remote configuration and booting, even when the operating system is not loaded. This section defines the requirements that support this capability, which specify baseline capabilities required to support remote boot and remote diagnostics.</p>

<p>
<b>5. Limit user access in preboot modes</b></p>
<p>
<i>Required</i></p>

<p>
For a Net PC system, the operating system provides the capability for centrally enabling or disabling capabilities on the system. To ensure TCO objectives, security to protect enable/disable capabilities for hardware components must also be provided before the operating system boots. The purpose of this feature is to prevent end users from accidentally or purposefully circumventing operating-system level security as applied by an administrator.</p>

<p>
<b>6. System BIOS support for boot devices, for Intel architecture</b></p>
<p>
<i>Required</i></p>

<p>
For network adapters, the system BIOS must comply with the requirements defined in Sections 3 and 4 (as they apply to Plug and Play devices) of the Compaq, Phoenix, Intel BIOS Boot Specification, version 1.01 or higher, which describes the requirements for Initial Program Load (IPL) devices.</p>

<p>
If a CD-ROM device is provided as a boot device in the system, the system must support No Emulation mode in &ldquo;El Torito &mdash; Bootable CD-ROM Format Specification, Version 1.0&rdquo; by Compaq, Intel, and Phoenix or an equivalent method that supports the Windows NT CD-ROM installation process. For information about requirements for remote management capabilities for CD-ROM, see the &ldquo;Platform Management Information Requirements&rdquo; section and related attachments later in this document.</p>

<p>
<b>7. Support Int 13h Extensions in system BIOS and option ROMs, for Intel architecture</b></p>
<p>
<i>Required</i></p>

<p>
The Int 13h Extensions ensure correct support for high-capacity drives. Support for the fixed-disk access subset of Int 13h Extensions must be provided in the system BIOS and in any option ROMs for storage devices that include BIOS support. </p>

<p>
<b>8. BIOS boot support for USB keyboard, if USB is the only keyboard</b></p>
<p>
<i>Required</i></p>

<p>
For any system that uses the Intel architecture and has a USB keyboard as the only keyboard in the system, the system BIOS must provide boot support for USB keyboards. The specification for this support is defined in <i>Universal Serial Bus PC Legacy Compatibility Specification, Version 1.0</i> or higher, available from http://www.teleport.com/~usb/data/usb_le9.pdf.</p>

<p>
<b>9. Remote new system setup and service boot supported using DHCP and TFTP as defined in Attachment A</b></p>
<p>
<i>Required</i></p>

<p>
Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) is an open, industry standard designed to reduce complexity of TCP/IP network administration. DHCP provides methods for dynamic configuration of computers on TCP/IP networks. DHCP is specified by IETF RFCs 1533, 1534, 1541, and 1542. Trivial File Transfer Protocol (TFTP, Revision 2) to support boot image download is implemented under IETF RFC 1350.</p>

<p>
The required implementation for remote new system setup is defined in &ldquo;Attachment A: DHCP Extensions for New System Setup&rdquo; in these guidelines. </p>

<p>
<b>10. Preboot execution environment</b></p>
<p>
<i>Required</i></p>

<p>
The execution environment provided by the client for the downloaded code described in the previous requirement must conform to the description given in &ldquo;Attachment B: Preboot Execution Environment&rdquo; in these guidelines.</p>

<p>
<b>11. Remote BIOS update and revision support </b></p>
<p>
<i>Required</i></p>

<p>
Recommended: Implement a mechanism to validate that the program arrived intact after download.</p>

<p>
BIOS ROMs must be implemented to allow them to be upgraded to a new image through OEM-provided programs using either: 1) the remote new system setup mechanism that will be downloaded and executed at boot time, or 2) normal file access and execution methods when the system is fully booted into the normal operating system environment.</p>

<p>
If they are provided, option ROMs must also be capable of being upgraded.</p>
