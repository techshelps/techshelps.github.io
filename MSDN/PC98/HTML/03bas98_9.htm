<h1><a name="manageabilitycomponentinstrumentationrequirements"></a>Manageability Component Instrumentation Requirements</h1>
<p>
This section presents new requirements and recommendations for PC 98 systems&nbsp;related to the Wired for Management (WfM) initiative and the Zero Administration initiative for Windows. The WfM initiative seeks to raise the level of management capabilities for mobile, desktop, and server platforms. The Zero Administration initiative seeks to ensure a controlled, highly manageable enterprise.</p>
<p>
The baseline for these requirements is <i>Windows Hardware Instrumentation Implementation Guidelines</i>,<i> Version 1.0</i> (WHIIG), which also defines the Windows-specific requirements of the <i>Wired for Management Baseline Specification, Version 2.0,</i> for hardware instrumentation.</p>
<p>
Collectively, the items in this section represent the Manageability Baseline requirements for Office PC 98. Platform management information requirements are defined for two key areas:
<ul>
<li>
Component instrumentation. Interfaces through which information is supplied by PC 98 platform management components.<br><br></li>
<li>
Management information providers. Interfaces used by applications to access PC 98 platform management information.<p>
<b>Tips for implementing management capabilities. </b>For PC 98 systems and components, these are the design steps to pursue:
</li>
<li>
Implement the component instrumentation features defined for PC&nbsp;98 systems in WHIIG.<br><br></li>
<li>
For those components that require Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI), ensure that WMI is enabled in device minidrivers as defined in the Windows&nbsp;NT 5.0 DDK.<br><br></li>
<li>
Refer to WHIIG for other driver requirements and design tips.<br><br></li>
<li>
For all instrumented components, test against the baseline features required in&nbsp;WHIIG.<br><br></li>
<li>
For each component, extend the Web-Based Enterprise Management (WBEM) and Common Information Model (CIM) schema to expose the device’s custom features in any CIM-ready management browser.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Requirements and recommendations related to implementing WMI for Windows&nbsp;NT 5.0 and Windows are defined in WHIIG.</p>
<p>
Support for WMI, CIM, and Win32 extension schema objects and data must be implemented as defined in WHIIG.</p>
<p>
<b>52. Management information service provider enabled by default</h1>
<table cols=3>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=30%><i>Consumer PC 98</i></td>
<td width=30%><i>Office PC 98</i></td>
<td width=30%><i>Entertainment PC 98</i></td>

<tr valign=top>
<td width=30%><b>Not applicable</b></td>
<td width=30%><b>Required</b></td>
<td width=30%><b>Not applicable</b></td>
</tr>
</table><br>
<p>
The management information service providers must be enabled on Office PC&nbsp;98 and Net PC systems as defined in WHIIG.</p>
<p>
Also, newly developed applications for managing WBEM-capable PC&nbsp;98 systems should be written to access those systems through industry-standard WBEM protocols and interfaces.</p>
<p>
<b>53. Expansion devices can be remotely managed</h1>
<table cols=3>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=30%><i>Consumer PC 98</i></td>

</table><br>
<p>
Devices provided as expansion devices must be capable of being remotely managed to ensure that control and TCO policies can be realized. For example, for any implementation of a floppy disk drive on an Office PC&nbsp;98 system, the drive must be capable of being remotely disabled as a boot selection and provisions must be made for locking.</p>
<p>
It is not a requirement that certain devices be capable of being remotely disabled, including the primary hard disk drive, the network adapter, and any standard devices that use legacy connections, such as a keyboard or pointing device that uses a PS/2 connection. However, it must be possible that permissions, policies, or other methods can be used to remotely manage capabilities such as hard disk access or to control end-user ability to change the MAC address or configuration settings for the network adapter.</p>
