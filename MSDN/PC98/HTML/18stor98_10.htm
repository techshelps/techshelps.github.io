<h1><a name="devicedriversinstallationforstorage"></a>Device Drivers and Installation for Storage</h1>
<p>
This section summarizes the basic requirements for device drivers and installation procedures for storage devices.</p>
<p>
<b>40. Device drivers and installation meet PC 98 requirements</h1>
<table border=1 cols=3 frame=void rules=rows>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=30%><b>Required</b></td>
<td width=30%></td>
<td width=30%></td>
</tr>
</table><br>
<p>
The manufacturer does not need to supply a driver if a PC&nbsp;98-compliant driver provided with the operating system can be used. If the manufacturer supplies a driver, the requirements for the device drivers and installation are defined in the “Basic PC&nbsp;98” chapter in Part&nbsp;2 of this guide. The basic requirements include driver support for unattended installation and Help file support if special driver parameters are used.</p>
<p>
Ease-of-use requirements for installation and configuration are defined for SCSI&nbsp;peripherals and for IDE and ATAPI devices in Part&nbsp;3 of this guide. For information about WDM support for devices that use a USB or IEEE 1394 bus, see the Windows NT 5.0 DDK. See also the related articles on the web site at http://www.microsoft.com/hwdev/pcfuture/.</p>
<p>
<b>41. Device and file system run in protected mode following installation</h1>
<table border=1 cols=3 frame=void rules=rows>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=30%><b>Required</b></td>
<td width=30%></td>
<td width=30%></td>
</tr>
</table><br>
<p>
The device driver and the file system must be running in 32-bit protected mode (not compatibility mode) immediately following installation.</p>
<p>
<b>Note:</b> Although it is strongly preferred that a system reboot not be required as part of device installation, it is recognized that installation of boot devices presents a special situation. For PC 98, it is acceptable that installation includes restarting the system during installation of a boot device.</p>
<p>
<b>42. Applications provided with the device meet Win32 requirements</h1>
<table border=1 cols=3 frame=void rules=rows>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=30%><b>Required</b></td>
<td width=30%></td>
<td width=30%></td>
</tr>
</table><br>
<p>
Any Windows-based applications provided with the device must meet Microsoft requirements for software compatibility as defined in the Win32 SDK. However, any software applications included with the device can be installed using an alternate Windows-based installation method as defined in the Win32&nbsp;SDK.</p>
<p>
<b>43. Driver for partitioned media supports all Windows and Windows&nbsp;NT partition types</h1>
<table border=1 cols=3 frame=void rules=rows>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=30%><b>Required</b></td>
<td width=30%></td>
<td width=30%></td>
</tr>
</table><br>
<p>
Device drivers that support partitioned media must support all Windows and Windows&nbsp;NT partition types, which include but are not limited to FAT16, FAT32, NTFS, and UDF.</p>
<p>
<b>44. Driver for block-mode device supports extended BPBs</h1>
<table border=1 cols=3 frame=void rules=rows>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=30%><b>Required</b></td>
<td width=30%></td>
<td width=30%></td>
</tr>
</table><br>
<p>
Storage subsystems that include an MS-DOS–based block-mode device driver (for example, Aspidisk.sys) must support Extended BIOS Parameter Blocks (BPBs) in the Build BPB device driver function call, and must support category=48 in the generic IOCTL device driver interface calls, as specified in the&nbsp;1996 update to the Windows DDK.</p>
