<h1><a name="plugplayforidecontrollersperipherals"></a>Plug and Play for IDE Controllers and Peripherals</h1>
<p>
This section summarizes the Plug and Play requirements for IDE controllers and peripherals.</p>
<p>
<b>13. Operating system recognizes the boot drive in a multiple-drive system </h1>
<table border=1 cols=3 frame=void rules=rows>
<tr valign=top>

<p>
The implementation of boot-drive determination in multiple-drive systems is defined in Section 5.0 of the <i>Compaq, Intel, Phoenix BIOS Boot Specification</i>. This is the format that both Windows and Windows&nbsp;NT operating systems use for&nbsp;determining the boot drive as new bootable devices are introduced for PCs. The system designer can use an equivalent method for boot-drive determination, but the method must ensure that the Windows and Windows NT operating systems recognize the boot drive.</p>
<p>
<b>14. Each device has a Plug and Play device ID</h1>
<table border=1 cols=3 frame=void rules=rows>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=30%><b>Required</b></td>
<td width=30%></td>
<td width=30%></td>
</tr>
</table><br>
<p>
For a system-board device, there must be a Plug and Play device-specific ID.</p>
<p>
Each IDE controller or peripheral device must provide device IDs in the manner required for the bus it uses, as defined in the related chapter for the specific bus in&nbsp;Part&nbsp;3 of this guide.</p>
<p>
For example, an add-on PCI IDE device must comply with PCI&nbsp;2.1 and also must&nbsp;provide a Subsystem ID and Subsystem Vendor ID as defined in the “PCI” chapter in Part&nbsp;3 of this guide. PCI IDE controllers integrated into core logic on the system board do not have to provide Subsystem IDs and Subsystem Vendor IDs, but must meet other PCI 2.1 requirements.</p>
<p>
<b>15. Dynamic resource configuration supported for all devices</h1>
<table border=1 cols=3 frame=void rules=rows>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=30%><b>Required</b></td>
<td width=30%></td>
<td width=30%></td>
</tr>
</table><br>
<p>
All devices must be capable of being automatically disabled by the system. Also, disabling the device must result in freeing all its resources for use by other devices.</p>
<p>
Changing or adding a controller to the system must not require changing jumpers or switches on either the controller or the system board.</p>
<p>
<b>16. Resource configuration meets bus requirements</h1>
<table border=1 cols=3 frame=void rules=rows>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=30%><b>Required</b></td>
<td width=30%></td>
<td width=30%></td>
</tr>
</table><br>
<p>
Plug and Play resource-configuration requirements are defined by the bus used by&nbsp;the IDE/ATAPI controllers and peripheral devices, as defined in the related chapter for the specific bus in Part 3 of this guide.</p>
<p>
<b>17. ISA address ranges 3F7h and 377h are not claimed by IDE controllers</h1>
<table border=1 cols=3 frame=void rules=rows>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=30%><b>Required</b></td>
<td width=30%></td>
<td width=30%></td>
</tr>
</table><br>
<p>
Although IDE controllers might use these addresses, 3F7h and 377h also contain registers used by the FDC. To prevent resource conflicts, these addresses must not be claimed as device-register resources.</p>
