<p>
<b>CD-ROM</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;Compact disc read-only memory. A 4.75-inch laser-encoded optical memory storage medium (developed by NV Philips and Sony Corporation) with the same constant linear velocity&nbsp;(CLV) spiral format as compact audio discs&nbsp;and some video discs. CD-ROMs can hold about 550 MB of data.</p>
<p>
<b>class</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;For hardware, the manner in which devices and buses are grouped for purposes of installing and managing device drivers and allocating resources. The hardware tree is organized by device class.</p>
<p>
<b>class driver</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;A driver that provides system-required, hardware-independent support for a given class of physical devices. Such a driver communicates with a corresponding hardware-dependent port driver, using a set of system-defined device control requests, possibly with additional driver-defined device control requests. Under WDM, the class driver creates a device object to represent each adapter registered by minidrivers. The class driver is&nbsp;responsible for multiprocessor and interrupt synchronization.</p>
<p>
<b>codec</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;Coder-decoder. A filter that manipulates data in some form, usually by compressing or decompressing the data stream.</p>
<p>
<b>COM</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Component Object Model; the core of&nbsp;OLE (object linking and embedding). Defines how OLE objects and their clients interact within processes or across process boundaries. (2) Legacy serial port.</p>
<p>
<b>concatenate</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;To join sequentially.</p>
<p>
<b>configuration manager</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;The Windows Plug and&nbsp;Play system component that drives the process of locating devices, setting up their nodes in the hardware tree, and running the resource allocation process. Each of the three phases of configuration management—boot time, real mode, and protected mode—have their own configuration managers.</p>
<p>
<b>controllerless modem</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;Also host-based controller. A modem that consists of a DSP without the usual microcontroller. The host CPU provides the AT command interpreter, modem-control functions, and&nbsp;v.42bis implementation. Compare with software&nbsp;modem.</p>
<p>
<b>control method</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;A definition of how an ACPI-compatible operating system can perform a simple hardware task. For example, the operating system invokes control methods to read the temperature of a thermal zone. Control methods are&nbsp;written in an encoded language called AML (ACPI Machine Language).</p>
<p>
<b>CPU</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;Central processing unit. A computational and control unit of a computer; the device that interprets and executes instructions. By definition, the CPU functions as the “brain” of the computer.</p>
<p>
<b>CSN</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;Card Select Number. The handle created by the system BIOS or the operating system through the isolation process and assigned as a unique ID to each Plug and Play card on the ISA&nbsp;bus.</p>
