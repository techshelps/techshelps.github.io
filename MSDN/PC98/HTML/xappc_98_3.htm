<h1><a name="whatisaccessibility"></a>What Is Accessibility?</h1>
<p>
Accessibility means making computers accessible to a wider range of users than would otherwise be the case. Special needs can be addressed in several ways:
<ul>
<li>
New features built into hardware and operating systems help make computers accessible to users with and without specialized needs. These solutions, often referred to as “electronic curb cuts,” are preferred because the features are available on all workstations and can be used with all applications.<br><br></li>
<li>
Usability features can be built into mainstream products, making them easier to&nbsp;use for people with disabilities. Examples include customizable colors and keyboard accelerators. In many cases, these features also benefit people without disabilities.<br><br></li>
<li>
Utilities that upgrade a system make the PC more usable by people with disabilities. Examples of utilities include Braille-output systems for people who are blind or software that modifies the behavior of the keyboard and mouse.<br><br></li>
<li>
Specialized applications, such as a word processor designed to integrate voice and text, help individuals with limited reading and writing skills.</li></ul><p>
A variety of hardware and software products have been designed to help people with disabilities make use of PCs. Following are some of the different products available for upgrading the accessibility of the Microsoft Windows operating system:
</p>
<ul><li>
Programs that enlarge or alter the color of information on the screen<br><br></li>
<li>
Programs that describe on-screen information in Braille or synthesized speech<br><br></li>
<li>
Hardware and software utilities that modify the behavior of the mouse and the&nbsp;keyboard<br><br></li>
<li>
Programs that enable users to “type” using a mouse or their voice<br><br></li>
<li>
Word or phrase prediction software that allows quicker typing with fewer keystrokes<br><br></li>
<li>
Alternative input devices, such as single-switch or puff-and-sip devices</li>
</ul>
