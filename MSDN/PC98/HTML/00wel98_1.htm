<p>
The PC&nbsp;98 requirements are defined by system type and for individual bus classes and device classes. This guide is divided into five parts, with each part addressing a particular element of PC&nbsp;98 design.</p>
<p>
<b>Part 1: System Design Issues. </b>Introduces the important design issues for PC&nbsp;98. Study this part first to understand the key design issues being addressed in the PC&nbsp;98 requirements.</p>
<p>
<b>Part 2: PC&nbsp;98 Systems. </b>Presents system-type definitions and PC&nbsp;98 requirements for each system type. Study this part for an understanding of the overall system requirements.</p>
<p>
<b>Part 3: Bus Design Guidelines. </b>Presents requirements for each bus type and I/O host controller supported under Windows&nbsp;98 and Windows&nbsp;NT. Study this part for a detailed understanding of how buses and controllers are to be implemented on PC&nbsp;98 systems.</p>
<p>
<b>Part 4: Device Design Guidelines. </b>Defines design requirements for each particular device type, whether the device is an integral part of a PC system or designed as an add-on device. Study this part for a detailed understanding of the design requirements for each device type.</p>
<p>
<b>References. </b>Includes the PC 98 checklist, which summarizes all the requirements defined in this guide, plus other technical appendixes, a comprehensive hardware glossary with a list of acronyms and abbreviations used in this guide, and an index.</p>
