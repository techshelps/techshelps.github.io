<h1><a name="plugplaybusdesignforvideobroadcastcomponents"></a>Plug and Play and Bus Design for Video and Broadcast Components</h1>
<p>
The items in this section summarize requirements for Plug and Play and other resource-related and bus-related capabilities.</p>
<p>
<b>40. Each device has a Plug and Play device ID</h1>
<table border=1 cols=3 frame=void rules=rows>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=30%><b>Required</b></td>
<td width=30%></td>
<td width=30%></td>
</tr>
</table><br>
<p>
Each device must have a Plug and Play device ID as required for the bus it uses, as defined in Part 3 of this guide. For example, a PCI device must comply with PCI 2.1 requirements and must provide a Subsystem ID and Subsystem Vendor ID as defined in the “PCI” chapter in Part&nbsp;3 of this guide.</p>
<p>
For video and broadcast hardware, a device can be implemented as a single function device or as part of a multifunction device. All memory and register resources for this functionality must be distinct and separate from any other functions in the multifunction case.</p>
<p>
<b>41. Conflict resolution and dynamic disable capabilities are supported</h1>
<table border=1 cols=3 frame=void rules=rows>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=30%><b>Required</b></td>
<td width=30%></td>
<td width=30%></td>
</tr>
</table><br>
<p>
The operating system must be capable of automatically assigning, disabling, and relocating the resources used by this device when necessary, using the method required for the related bus class. All configuration settings must be capable of being made through software, with no system reboot required.</p>
<p>
When the end user changes this device or adds it to the system, setting resource assignments must not require changing jumpers or switches on either the adapter or the system board. In the event of an irreconcilable conflict with other devices on the system, the operating system must be capable of disabling the device to prevent the system from stalling. A disabled device must not claim any resources while disabled.</p>
<p>
<b>42. Dependent video device is not independently enumerated</h1>
<table border=1 cols=3 frame=void rules=rows>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=30%><b>Required</b></td>
<td width=30%></td>
<td width=30%></td>
</tr>
</table><br>
<p>
If a video device is implemented as a dependent device on a multifunction adapter, it must not be independently enumerated. Instead, its parent must be responsible for installing and loading its driver and for updating the registry on&nbsp;its&nbsp;behalf.</p>
