<h1><a name="powermanagementfornetworkcommunications"></a>Power Management for Network Communications</h1>
<p>
This section summarizes the specific power management requirements for network communications devices.</p>
<p>
<b>39. Device complies with device class power management reference specification</h1>

<p>
The <i>Network Device Class Power Management Reference Specification, Version 1.0</i> or higher, provides definitions of the OnNow device power states (D0–D3) for network adapters. The specification also covers device functionality expected in each power state and the possible wake-up event definitions for the class.</p>
<p>
<b>40. Device supports wake-up events</h1>
<table cols=3>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=30%><b>Required</b></td>

<p>
This requirement applies specifically to Ethernet and Token Ring adapters. The <i>Network Device Class Power Management Reference Specification</i> does not support ATM and ISDN adapters.</p>
<p>
The system must be capable of being awakened from a lower power state based on network events specified by the local networking software. This capability yields the result that any standard Windows network access—such as connections to shared drives and WinSock connections, as well as focused service and management applications—has the capability to wake machines in lower power&nbsp;states.</p>
<p>
For PC 98, support is required for peer-to-peer networking, personal web servers, and other transparent networking applications. Wake-up capabilities must be based on pattern matching, which is a method of filtering, in addition to the normal address filtering that occurs when the system is fully on.</p>
<p>
Implementation details are described in the “Network Wake-up Frames” and “Network Wake-up Frame Details” sections of <i>Network Device Class Power Management Reference Specification, Version 1.0</i> or higher.</p>
