<h1><a name="mouseportperipheralrequirements"></a>Mouse Port and Peripheral Requirements</h1>
<p>
This section defines the specific PC 98 requirements for pointing-device connections and peripherals. Because the Windows and Windows&nbsp;NT operating systems require a pointing device, a PC&nbsp;98 system board should include an auxiliary port for an external pointing device (most commonly a mouse). For PC&nbsp;98, it is recommended that systems designers use the USB port for the connection and also that they consider implementing wireless support for an external pointing device.</p>
<p>
The PC 98 general device requirements are defined in the “System Requirements for I/O Ports and Devices” section earlier in this chapter, including the requirements for a device ID, automated software-only settings for device configuration, device drivers and Windows-based installation, and icons for external connectors.</p>
<p>
For wireless-capabilities requirements, see the “Wireless Component Requirements” section later in this chapter.</p>
<p>
<b>20. Pointing-device connection meets requirements for its bus class</h1>

<p>
The following requirements must be met, depending on the connection type used in the system. These requirements ensure that all Plug and Play requirements are met and that Microsoft drivers support this device.</p>
<p>
If a PS/2-style port is used, the following requirements must be met:
<ul>
<li>
Comply in full with requirements in <i>Personal System/2 Specification,</i> by IBM.<br><br></li>
<li>
Use an 8042 chip (or equivalent) to ensure compatibility with Windows. In&nbsp;most cases, the existing 8042 keyboard port is sufficient. The 8042 chip initiates a PIC-based IRQ&nbsp;12 interrupt when the pointing device is connected to the port.<br><br></li>
<li>
Support PCI-based IRQ&nbsp;12 to ensure the proper functioning of software written for legacy systems that use this IRQ signal.<br><br></li>
<li>
Return expected codes, including send ID (0F2h) and response ACK (0FAh), plus 1-byte ID.<p>
If a USB port is used, the following requirements must be met:
</li>
<li>
Meet requirements in <i>USB Specification, Version 1.0</i> or higher<br><br></li>
<li>
Meet requirements in <i>USB Human Interface Device Class Specifications, Version 1.0</i> or higher<br><br></li>
<li>
Implement minidriver support based on WDM Human Interface Device (HID) class support in the operating system</li>
</ul><p>
<b>21. Remote control provides PC 98 minimum support</b></p>

<p>
If a remote-control device is provided with a PC&nbsp;98 system, the range of functions implemented on the device will depend on whether the remote control is designed for the business desktop or for the Entertainment PC&nbsp;98.</p>
<p>
There is no defined list of functions that must be included on a remote-control device, but such a device might provide the following types of functions and buttons:
<ul>
<li>
Power button that turns devices on and off.<br><br></li>
<li>
Start button, such as the Windows logo key, that causes a Start menu to be displayed. For information about the Windows logo key, see the “Keyboard Port and Peripheral Requirements “ section later in this chapter.<br><br></li>
<li>
Menu button that causes an application-specific menu to be displayed.<br><br></li>
<li>
Help button that causes application-specific Help file to be displayed.<br><br></li>
<li>
Directional capabilities, which function similarly to the arrow keys on a&nbsp;keyboard.<br><br></li>
<li>
Select button that functions similarly to the <small>enter</small> key on a keyboard.<p>
The following functions and buttons can also be considered for a remote-control device used with an Entertainment PC&nbsp;98 system:
</li>
<li>
Television button to select the television as the device that will receive input<br><br></li>
<li>
Mute button<br><br></li>
<li>
Device control buttons, including Volume Up, Volume Down, Channel Up, Channel Down, Fast Forward, Rewind, Play, Stop, Pause, and Record<br><br></li>
<li>
Number keys equivalent to a telephone keypad</li>
</ul>
