<h1><a name="devicedriversinstallationforvideobroadcastcomponents"></a>Device Drivers and Installation for Video and Broadcast Components</h1>
<p>
This section summarizes the PC 98 requirements for video and broadcast components.</p>
<p>
<b>43. Device drivers and installation meet PC 98 requirements</h1>
<table border=1 cols=3 frame=void rules=rows>

<p>
The manufacturer does not need to supply a driver for a device if the device passes PC 98 compliance testing using a driver provided with the operating system. If the manufacturer supplies a driver, then the requirements for the device drivers and installation are defined in the “Basic PC&nbsp;98” chapter in Part&nbsp;2 of this guide. The basic requirements include driver support for unattended installation and Help file support if special driver parameters are used.</p>
<p>
All video components must use a WDM minidriver instead of a VfW driver. For PC&nbsp;98, a VfW driver is not compliant with these requirements. For information about WDM driver support, see the Windows NT 5.0 DDK. See also the related articles at http://www.microsoft.com/hwdev/pcfuture/.</p>
<p>
Drivers for hardware decoders and for the audio and video subsystems must be implemented as described in the Windows&nbsp;NT 5.0 DDK in order to support DirectShow, DirectDraw 5.0 VPE, and WDM.</p>
<p>
<b>44. Software drivers are installed during hardware driver installation</h1>
<table border=1 cols=3 frame=void rules=rows>

<td width=30%><b>Required</b></td>

</table><br>
<p>
Any additional required device-dependent software such as software codecs or NDIS transports must be installed during the device driver installation routine and&nbsp;must be included in the device INF file.</p>
<p>
<b>45. Applications provided with device meet Win32 requirements</h1>
<table border=1 cols=3 frame=void rules=rows>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=30%><b>Required</b></td>
<td width=30%></td>
<td width=30%></td>
</tr>
</table><br>
<p>
Recommended: Video and image editing applications bundled with the device should support DirectShow.</p>
<p>
Any Windows-based applications provided with the device must meet software compatibility requirements as defined by the Win32 SDK. Applications installed with the device must use a standard Windows-based installation method as defined in the Win32 SDK.</p>
