Power Management Requirements</h1>

<p>
Net PC systems are power-managed systems based on solutions provided under the OnNow design initiative, so that the platform enters a low-power state when not in use. This section describes the requirements that ensure the Net PC system is power managed.</p>

<p>
<b>12. ACPI support meets PC 97 requirements</b></p>
<p>
<i>Required</i></p>

<p>
The system board must support the Advanced Configuration and Power Interface (ACPI) Specification, version 1.0 or higher. This requirement ensures that the system correctly supports the ACPI-based Plug and Play and power management functionality.</p>

<p>
For complete information about requirements for ACPI support, see item #4 in the &ldquo;Basic PC 97&rdquo; chapter of <i>PC 97 Hardware Design Guide</i>. For information about clarifications for implementation of ACPI, see http://www.microsoft.com/hwdev/desguid/pc97faq.htm.</p>

<p>
<b>13. Hardware support for the OnNow initiative</b></p>
<p>
<i>Required</i></p>

<p>
Elements of the OnNow design initiative ensure that the operating system and device drivers control the state of individual devices and the system board. For complete design information and related requirements, see item #5 in the &ldquo;Basic PC 97&rdquo; chapter of <i>PC 97 Hardware Design Guide.</i></p>

<p>
<b>14. BIOS support for the OnNow initiative, for Intel architecture</b></p>
<p>
<i>Required</i></p>

<p>
This requirement applies only to systems that use the Intel architecture. For complete design information and related requirements, see item #6 in the &ldquo;Basic PC 97&rdquo; chapter of <i>PC 97 Hardware Design Guide.</i></p>

<p>
<b>15. Wakeup on LAN supported</b></p>
<p>
<i>Recommended until 1/1/98; Required as of 1/1/98</i></p>

<p>
Until January 1, 1998, for Net PCs with Ethernet or token ring network adapters, it is recommended that the system should be capable of being awakened from a lower power state for services and management. Magic Packet capability is a possible implementation. After January 1, 1998, wakeup capabilities are required for Net PCs and must be based on matching patterns specified by the local networking software, as described in &ldquo;Network Wake-up Frames&rdquo; and &ldquo;Network Wake-up Frame Details&rdquo; in <i>Network Device Class Power Management Reference Specification, Version 1.0</i> or higher. </p>

<p>
Pattern matching-based wakeup enables any standard Windows network TCP/IP      access, such as connections to shared drives and WinSock connections, as well as focused service and management applications, to &ldquo;wake up&rdquo; machines from lower power states.  Microsoft operating system support for wake on LAN capabilities will be compliant with this pattern matching solution.  There is no guarantee of functionality with these operating system services for wake on LAN solutions that are not based on <i>Network Device Class Power Management Reference Specification</i> pattern matching.</p>

<p>
This requirement applies specifically to Ethernet and token ring adapters. <i>Network Device Class Power Management Reference Specification</i> does not support ATM and ISDN adapters. </p>

<p>
For additional implementation guidelines, see items #34 &ndash; 35 in the &ldquo;Network Communications&rdquo; chapter of <i>PC 97 Hardware Design Guide</i>. Implementation details are described in &ldquo;Network Wake-up Frames&rdquo; and &ldquo;Network Wake-up Frame Details&rdquo; in <i>Network Device Class Power Management Reference Specification, Version 1.0</i> or higher.</p>
