<p>
The items in this section are requirements for Plug and Play capabilities.</p>
<p>
<b>34. Each device has a Plug and Play device ID</h1>
<table border=1 cols=3 frame=void rules=rows>

<td width=30%><b>Required</b></td>
<td width=30%></td>

</table><br>
<p>
For each device, there must be a device-specific ID. Each device must provide Plug and Play device IDs in the manner required for the bus it uses as defined in Part 3 of this guide. For example, a PCI add-on device must comply with PCI&nbsp;2.1 requirements and also must provide a Subsystem ID and Subsystem Vendor ID, as defined in the “PCI” chapter in Part&nbsp;3 of this guide.</p>
<p>
<b>35. Conflict resolution and dynamic disable capabilities supported for all&nbsp;devices</h1>
<table border=1 cols=3 frame=void rules=rows>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=30%><b>Required</b></td>
<td width=30%></td>
<td width=30%></td>

</table><br>
<p>
To ensure conflict resolution for resource allocation, the device must conform to the Plug and Play specifications for the bus it uses as described in Part 3 of this guide. The system must have a method for automatically disabling or relocating the resources used by the device if conflicts occur when an expansion card is added to the system.</p>
<p>
Devices must be capable of being disabled with software settings only, that is, without requiring rebooting or jumper setting changes. Disabling the device must result in freeing all its resources for use by other devices. DIP switches on boot devices can be used for an initial power-on default state or for non-Plug and Play system compatibility, but must be able to be overridden by software configuration after system power up.</p>
<p>
The primary hard disk controller is not required to support dynamic disable capabilities.</p>
<p>
<b>Note: </b>This requirement does not apply to jumper settings used by the OEM to make basic system-related settings in the factory. This requirement applies only to settings that the end user must make to configure the hardware.</p>
<p>
<b>36. 3F7h and 377h are unclaimed by devices</h1>
<table border=1 cols=3 frame=void rules=rows>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=30%><b>Required</b></td>
<td width=30%></td>
<td width=30%></td>
</tr>
</table><br>
<p>
To avoid having two devices in the system claim 3F7h and 377h, these addresses should not be claimed as resources in device registers, especially by IDE devices.</p>
<p>
It is recognized that some FDC devices claim this range. Such devices can be implemented in a PC&nbsp;98 system; however, the system manufacturer must ensure that only a single device in the system claims this range.</p>
<p>
<b>37. Physical security is provided for storage devices</h1>
<table cols=3>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=30%><i>Consumer PC 98</i></td>

<p>
External drive devices should have locking capabilities. This is recommended for PC&nbsp;98 systems and required for Net&nbsp;PC hardware. Each removable media device should be capable of being locked to prevent unauthorized access to data. This means that the device is rendered useless, either electronically or mechanically.</p>
