<h1><a name="i"></a>I</h1>
<p>
<b>ID</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;Identifier. Generally, any text string used as a label, such as the name of a procedure or a variable in a program, or the name attached to a hard drive or floppy disk.</p>
<p>
<b>IDE&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>Integrated Device Electronics. A type of&nbsp;disk drive interface where the controller electronics reside on the drive itself, eliminating the need for a separate adapter&nbsp;card.</p>
<p>
<b>IEEE&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, pronounced “I-triple-E.” Founded in 1963, IEEE is an organization composed of engineers, scientists, and students. IEEE is best known for developing standards for the computer and electronics industry.</p>
<p>
<b>INF file&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>Information file. A file created for a particular adapter that provides the operating system with information required to set up a device, such as a list of valid logical configurations for the device, the names of driver files associated with the device, and so on. The device manufacturer typically provides an INF file on a disk with an adapter.</p>
<p>
<b>INI file&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>Initialization file. Commonly used under Windows 3.<i>x</i> and earlier, INI files have been used by both the operating system and individual applications to store persistent settings related to an application, driver, or piece of hardware. In Windows and Windows&nbsp;NT, INI files are supported for backward compatibility, but the registry is the preferred location for storing such settings.</p>
<p>
<b>I/O&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>Input/output. Two of the three activities that characterize a computer (input, processing, and output). Refers to the complementary tasks of gathering data for the microprocessor to work with and making the results available to the user through a device such as the display, disk drive, or printer.</p>
<p>
<b>IOCTL&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;I/O control. A custom class of IRPs available to user mode. Each WDM class driver has a set of IOCTLs that it uses to communicate with applications. The IOCTLs give the class driver information about intended usage by applications. The class driver performs all IOCTL parameter validation.</p>
<p>
<b>IPL&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>Initial program load. A device used by the system during the boot process to load the operating system into memory.</p>
<p>
<b>IRP&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>I/O request packet. Data structures that drivers use to communicate with each other. The basic method of communication between kernel-mode devices. An IRP is a key data structure for WDM, which features multiple layered drivers.</p>
<p>
<b>IRQ&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>Interrupt request. A method by which a device can request to be serviced by the device’s software driver. The system board uses a PIC to monitor the priority of the requests from all devices. When a request occurs, a microprocessor suspends the current operation and gives control to the device driver associated with the interrupt.</p>
<p>
<b>ISA&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>Industry Standard Architecture. An 8-bit (and&nbsp;later, a 16-bit) legacy expansion bus that provides a buffered interface from devices on expansion cards to the PC internal bus.</p>
<p>
<b>ISDN&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>Integrated Service Digital Network. A set of&nbsp;communications standards that enables a single phone line or optical cable to carry voice, digital network services, and video.</p>
<p>
<b>ISR&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>Interrupt service routine. A routine whose function is to service a device when it generates an&nbsp;interrupt.</p>
