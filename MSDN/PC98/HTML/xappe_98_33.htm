Executable Download and Execution</h1>
<p>
In this state, the client is to download all or some portion of the executable file using the standard TFTP. The portion of the file downloaded and the placement of the downloaded code in memory is dependent on the client&rsquo&rsquo;s CPU architecture. </p>
<p>
For Net PC systems based on Intel Architecture, the entire bootstrap image (up to 32K in size) is downloaded into the client PC starting at location 07C00h.  The TFTP/MTFTP session that was used to download the bootstrap image is terminated and the logical network connection to the TFTP server is closed.</p>
<p>
After the bootstrap image is downloaded, the TFTP connection is closed and control is passed to the bootstrap image. The way in which this is done is dependent on the client&rsquo&rsquo;s CPU type. For Net PC systems based on Intel Architecture, the boot ROM code is to execute a far call to location 0:7C00h.</p>
