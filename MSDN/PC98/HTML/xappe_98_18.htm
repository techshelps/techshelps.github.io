I/O Devices</h1>

<p>
This section defines the general requirements for I/O devices. </p>

<p>
<b>49. Keyboard connection and keyboard</b></p>
<p>
<i>Required</i></p>

<p>
Recommended: USB</p>

<p>
The external connection requirements on any PC can also be met using a PS/2-style port or wireless capabilities in the system. A mobile or all-in-one system that has a built-in keyboard must also provide the capability for an external keyboard connection, which can be implemented using a port replicator or a single PS/2-style port with special cabling for both external keyboard and mouse. For complete requirements for keyboard ports and peripherals, see the &ldquo;Input Components&rdquo; chapter in <i>PC 97 Hardware Design Guide</i>.</p>

<p>
<b>50. Pointing-device connection and pointing device</b></p>
<p>
<i>Required</i></p>

<p>
Recommended: USB or other external bus</p>

<p>
The external connection requirements on any PC can also be met using a PS/2-style port or wireless capabilities in the system. A mobile or all-in-one system that has a built-in pointing device must also provide the capability for an external mouse connection, which can be implemented using a port replicator or a single PS/2-style port with special cabling for both external keyboard and mouse. A second serial port is not permitted as the external connection for a pointing device. For complete requirements for mouse ports and peripherals, see the &ldquo;Input Components&rdquo; chapter of <i>PC 97 Hardware Design Guide</i>.</p>

<p>
<b>51. Connection for external parallel devices</b></p>
<p>
<i>Optional</i></p>

<p>
If a parallel port is present, it must be implemented as an Extended Capabilities Port (ECP) mode parallel port. For information about requirements for remote management capabilities, see the &ldquo;Platform Management Information Requirements&rdquo; section earlier in this document and the related attachments.</p>

<p>
<b>52. Connection for external RS-232C or equivalent devices</b></p>
<p>
<i>Optional </i></p>

<p>
If present, the RS-232C serial connection must be implemented using a 16550A serial port or equivalent. For information about requirements for remote management capabilities, see the &ldquo;Platform Management Information Requirements&rdquo; section earlier in this document and the related attachments.</p>

<p>
<b>53. Wireless capabilities meet PC 97 requirements, if present</b></p>
<p>
<i>Required</i></p>

<p>
If wireless capabilities are included in the system, PC 97 requirements must be met as defined in the &ldquo;Serial, Parallel, and Wireless Support&rdquo; chapter of <i>PC 97 Hardware Design Guide</i>. For information about requirements for remote management capabilities, see the &ldquo;Platform Management Information Requirements&rdquo; section earlier in this document and the related attachments.</p>

<p>
<b>54. Network connectivity meets PC 97 requirements and supports remote new system setup</b></p>
<p>
<i>Required</i></p>

<p>
The Net PC system must include I/O device support and system BIOS support for boot devices to allow installation of the operating system, as described in the &ldquo;BIOS and Remote New System Setup&rdquo; section earlier in this document. In addition, the manufacturer must ensure the ability to upgrade the network adapter&rsquo&rsquo;s option ROM using software, for forward compatibility with remote new system setup capabilities.</p>

<p>
The network connectivity device must meet related PC 97 requirements for network communications and for the bus to which it is attached as defined in the &ldquo;Network Communications&rdquo; chapter and Part 3 of <i>PC 97 Hardware Design Guide. </i>The network connectivity device must be capable of remote configuration and control. For information about requirements for remote management capabilities, see the &ldquo;Platform Management Information Requirements&rdquo; section earlier in this document and the related attachments.</p>

<p>
The PC 97 guidelines define requirements for NDIS 4.0 support. For Net PC systems that come pre-installed with a Microsoft operating system that supports the extensions in NDIS 5.0, the system must include an NDIS 5.0 network adapter driver. A MAC or NDIS 4.0 implementation is not allowed because NDIS 5.0 support is required to take advantage of new operating system capabilities.</p>

<p>
<b>55. Communications device meets PC 97 requirements, if present</b></p>
<p>
<i>Required</i></p>

<p>
Modems or other communications devices such as ISDN cards implemented in the Net PC system must meet PC 97 requirements as defined in the &ldquo;Modems&rdquo; and &ldquo;Network Communications&rdquo; chapters of <i>PC 97 Hardware Design Guide</i>. For information about requirements for remote management capabilities, see the &ldquo;Platform Management Information Requirements&rdquo; section earlier in this document and the related attachments.</p>
