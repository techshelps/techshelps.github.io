<p>
This section summarizes the modem power management requirements. See also the specific power management requirements for each bus defined in Part&nbsp;3 of this&nbsp;guide.</p>

The <i>Communications Device Class Power Management Reference Specification, Version 1.0</i> or higher, provides definitions of the OnNow device power states (D0–D3) for these devices, including modems. The specification also covers the device functionality expected in each power state and the possible wake-up event definitions for the class.</p>
<p>
Power states D0 and D3 are required for modems on power-managed buses, including PCI, CardBus, and USB.</p>
<p>

<p>
For PC&nbsp;98, a required modem feature is the ability to cause a wake-up event on an incoming ring as defined in <i>Communications Device Class Power Management Reference Specification.</i> Notice that this applies for modems on power-managed buses, including PCI, CardBus, and USB.</p>
<p>
The D2 power state is defined specifically for this purpose in the power management reference specification. The ability for a modem to cause a wake-up event from the D3 power state might also be possible and is recommend to realize better system power savings. To comply with this requirement, a modem must be&nbsp;able to cause a wake-up event from either the D2 state, the D3 state, or both states.</p>
<p>
Because caller-ID reporting would be missed by PCs while in a sleep state, the&nbsp;ability for a modem to retain and repeat the last caller-ID reporting on demand&nbsp;is strongly recommended. The mechanism for doing this is described in&nbsp;<i>Communications Device Class Power Management Reference Specification</i> and in the V.voice and TIA-695 voice modem specifications.</p>
