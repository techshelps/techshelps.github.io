<p>
Device Bay provides manageability and interoperability for a range of PC peripherals and PC categories, including business and consumer desktop computers and portable computers, Net PC systems, and home-theater technology.</p>
<p>
The Device Bay technologies support devices for mass storage, security, and communications and connectivity, and a variety of other devices. Device Bay technology allows OEMs, retailers, and end users to easily add peripherals in order to support specific application needs. For example, an IEEE 1394 hard drive could be added to provide a large storage medium for digital imaging or audio authoring, a DVD-ROM drive could be added to enable DVD-Video playback, or a smart card reader could be added for secure online banking or shopping.</p>
<p>
Device Bay technologies also support swapping a hard disk drive—and thus a set of data and applications—between a desktop system and a laptop PC. And in the corporate environment, a hard disk drive could be removed from a failed system and inserted into a working system, minimizing employee downtime and thus lowering TCO.</p>
<p>
<b>Storage Devices. </b>Storage is currently near the top of users’ shopping lists for hardware upgrades. Users want a means of transporting large files. Device Bay supports both removable and fixed-media storage devices, including hard disk drives, tape backup, high-density floppy disk drives, CD-ROM, DVD-ROM, DVD-RAM, magneto-optical, and other removable media devices.</p>
<p>
<b>Communications and Connectivity Devices. </b>Modem cards are also among the most popular end-user PC upgrades. Device Bay supports this device class, including AT-style modems, Integrated Service Digital Network (ISDN) adapters, network adapters, cable interfaces, and wireless infrared (IR) and radio frequency (RF) devices. Device Bay supports multiple-usage models and connections using USB and IEEE 1394 buses.</p>
<p>
<b>Security Devices. </b>The current lack of security has been cited by consumers as a primary reason why they do not make online purchases over the Internet. Device Bay supports security devices that provide a means for user authentication. For home users, a smart card reader can enable secure credit-card shopping over the Internet. Higher levels of security can be achieved with encryption security devices. Adding a Device Bay smart card reader to a corporate or mobile system also provides a high level of data security, meeting requirements for PCs purchased by the U.S. government.</p>
