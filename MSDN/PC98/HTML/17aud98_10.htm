<p>
The items in this section are requirements for all audio components.</p>
<p>
<b>15. Each device has a unique Plug and Play device ID</h1>

<p>
Each bus-specific device must have a Plug and Play device ID for the bus it uses, as defined in Part 3 of this guide. For example, a PCI device must comply with PCI 2.1 requirements and also provide a Subsystem ID and Subsystem Vendor ID as defined in the “PCI” chapter in Part&nbsp;3 of this guide. As another example, a USB device must provide a unique ID as defined in the <i>Universal Serial Bus Specification, Version 1.0</i> or higher.</p>
<p>
<b>Note: </b>Each separate device or function enumerated by the BIOS on an audio adapter must have a separate Plug and Play device ID and separate resource configuration. If a game port or CD-ROM interface is supplied, resources must be&nbsp;allocated in addition to those required for the audio device. Such devices must also have independent dynamic disable capabilities. For complete information about requirements for multifunction cards, see the “Basic PC&nbsp;98” chapter in Part&nbsp;2 of this guide.</p>
<p>
<b>16. Automatic resource assignment and dynamic disable capabilities are supported</h1>
<table border=1 cols=3 frame=void rules=rows>

<p>
The system must be capable of automatically assigning, disabling, and relocating the resources used by this device when necessary, using the method required for the related bus class. All configuration settings must be capable of being made through software, with no system reboot required.</p>
<p>
When the end user changes this device or adds it to the system, setting resource assignments must not require changing jumpers or switches on either the adapter or the system board. In the event of an irreconcilable conflict with other devices on the system, the system must be able to disable the device in order to prevent the system from stalling. The device must not claim any resources while disabled.</p>
