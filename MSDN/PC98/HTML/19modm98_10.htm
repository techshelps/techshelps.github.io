<h1><a name="devicedriversinstallationformodems"></a>Device Drivers and Installation for Modems</h1>
<p>
This section summarizes device driver requirements for modems. The items in this section are requirements for all PC 98 systems.</p>
<p>
<b>37. Device drivers and installation meet PC 98 requirements</h1>
<table cols=3>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=284><b>Required </b></td>
<td width=89></td>
<td width=89></td>
</tr>
</table><br>
<p>
The manufacturer does not need to supply a driver if a PC&nbsp;98-compliant driver provided with the operating system can be used. If the manufacturer supplies a driver, the requirements for the device drivers and installation are defined in the “Basic PC&nbsp;98” chapter in Part&nbsp;2 of this guide. The basic requirements include driver support for unattended installation and Help file support if special driver parameters are used.</p>
<p>
For information about support for controllerless and software modems under WDM, see the Windows NT 5.0 DDK. See also the related articles at http://www.microsoft.com/hwdev/pcfuture/. For information about WDM-based modem driver support under Windows&nbsp;NT, see the Windows&nbsp;NT 5.0&nbsp;DDK.</p>
<p>
For guidelines about implementing driver and installation support for modems under the Windows operating system, see the Windows MDK.</p>
<p>
<b>38. Driver supports Unimodem</h1>
<table cols=3>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=284><b>Required </b></td>
<td width=89></td>
<td width=89></td>
</tr>
</table><br>
<p>
The device driver must include Unimodem support. Typically, this requires a modem INF file, developed and verified using the MDK and pretested by the modem manufacturer.</p>
<p>
<b>39. Applications provided with device meet Win32 requirements</h1>
<table cols=3>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=284><b>Required </b></td>
<td width=89></td>
<td width=89></td>
</tr>
</table><br>
<p>
Any Windows-based applications provided with the device, such as fax utilities, must meet requirements for software compatibility as defined in the Win32 SDK.</p>
<p>
As an API, the Windows Telephony API (TAPI) is the cornerstone of telephony for Windows and Windows&nbsp;NT. Telephony applications and service providers provided with PC&nbsp;98 systems must be implemented using TAPI 2.0.</p>
<p>
Among other enhancements, applications can request, negotiate, and renegotiate QOS parameters with the network and receive indication of QOS on inbound calls&nbsp;and when QOS is changed by the network. For a summary of the TAPI 2.0 architecture and a description of how to write a TAPI service provider, see http://www.microsoft.com/ntserver/communications/. For implementation information, see the Win32 SDK.</p>
