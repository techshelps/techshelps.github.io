General Device Requirements</h1>

<p>
This section summarizes requirements for the devices and peripherals provided with Net PC systems.</p>

<p>
<b>34. Device driver and installation meet PC 97 requirements for Windows operating systems</b></p>
<p>
<i>Required</i></p>

<p>
Each device supplied with the system must meet PC 97 requirements for that device class, and its drivers must be tested by Windows Hardware Quality Labs (WHQL). The manufacturer does not need to supply a driver if a driver provided with the operating system can be used. If the manufacturer supplies drivers, the requirements for installation include:</p>

<ul>
<li>
All devices and drivers must pass Microsoft WHQL testing.
</li>
<li>
All configuration settings are stored in the registry. The driver must not use INI files for configuration settings. 
</li>
<li>
The correct minidriver or any other manufacturer-supplied files specified in the device&rsquo&rsquo;s INF must be installed in the correct locations. For manufacturer-supplied files, the vendor must not be identified as Microsoft and all other copyright and version information must be correct for the manufacturer.
</li>
<li>
Driver installation and removal uses the Windows-based methods defined in the appropriate Windows or Windows NT DDK. However, any software applications included with the device can be installed using an alternative Windows-based installation method.
</li>
<li>
Driver files provided by the vendor must not use the same file names as used by files included in Microsoft operating systems unless specifically agreed upon by Microsoft.
</li>
<li>
It must be possible for the device&rsquo&rsquo;s driver support to be installed without the user being present, with required parameters supplied by way of a script or other mechanism for predefining settings.
<p>
For systems that come pre-installed with Windows NT:

</li>
<li>
Only 32-bit protected-mode system-level components are installed. No real-mode or 16-bit protected-mode system-level components are provided.
<p>
For systems that come pre-installed with either Windows 98 or Windows NT 5.0, the following requirements apply for drivers:

</li>
<li>
For any device for which WDM-based support is provided in the operating system, the driver supplied by the manufacturer must be a WDM minidriver.
</li>
<li>
Every WDM driver (or minidriver) must support Plug and Play IRPs.
<p>
For systems that come pre-installed with Windows 98, the following requirements apply for drivers:

</li>
<li>
Every VxD must support Plug and Play messages.
</li>
<li>
Where power management support is provided in the operating system, the VxD must implement device power management as defined in the DDK information provided for Windows 98.
<p>
For complete details about installation requirements for drivers, see item #22 in the &ldquo;Basic PC 97&rdquo; chapter of <i>PC 97 Hardware Design Guide</i>.

<p>
<b>35. Each device complies with current Plug and Play specifications</b>
<p>
<i>Required</i>

<p>
Each device provided in a Net PC system must meet the current Plug and Play specifications related to its class, including requirements defined in the ACPI specification and clarifications published for some Plug and Play specifications. This includes requirements for automatic device configuration, resource allocation, and dynamic disable capabilities.

<p>
Standard system devices, such as interrupt controllers, timers, keyboard controllers, RTC, DMA controllers 1 and 2 and page registers, and math <br>
co-processors, are exempt from this requirement. 

<p>
For complete information about this requirement, see item #14 in the &ldquo;Basic PC 97&rdquo; chapter of <i>PC 97 Hardware Design Guide.</i>

<p>
For information about requirements for remote management capabilities, see the &ldquo;Platform Management Information Requirements&rdquo; section earlier in this document and the related attachments.

<p>
<b>36. Unique Plug and Play device ID for each system device and add-on device</b>
<p>
<i>Required</i>

<p>
Each device connected to an expansion bus must be able to supply its own unique Plug and Play identifier. Each type of bus contains different information for uniquely identifying devices on expansion cards, with guidelines and exceptions defined in <i>PC 97 Hardware Design Guide</i>. For complete requirements, see item #15 in the &ldquo;Basic PC 97&rdquo; chapter of <i>PC 97 Hardware Design Guide.</i>

<p>
Methods for asset-number assignment and serial-number assignment for system components are OEM specific, but must be reported using compliant instrumentation technology. For more information, see the &ldquo;Platform Management Information Requirements&rdquo; section earlier in this document and the related attachments.

<p>
<b>37. Option ROMs meet Plug and Play requirements, for Intel architecture</b>
<p>
<i>Required</i>

<p>
This requirement applies only for any devices that might use option ROMs on systems based on Intel architecture, whether the device is present on the system board or provided through an expansion card. Related option ROM requirements are also defined for specific bus classes and specific devices, such as SCSI and graphics adapters, respectively. For complete guidelines, see item #16 in the &ldquo;Basic PC 97&rdquo; chapter of <i>PC 97 Hardware Design Guide</i>.

<p>
<b>38. All devices must support correct 16-bit decoding for I/O port addresses</b>
<p>
<i>Required</i>

<p>
Each device must support a unique I/O port address in the 16-bit address range. This requirement means that, at a minimum, the upper address lines A10 &ndash; A15 can be used as device enable so the device does not respond to addresses outside of the 10-bit address range. For complete guidelines, see item #18 in the &ldquo;Basic PC 97&rdquo; chapter of <i>PC 97 Hardware Design Guide</i>. CardBus controllers and cards, if present, must meet the requirements defined in the &ldquo;PC Card&rdquo; chapter of <i>PC 97 Hardware Design Guide</i>.

<p>
<b>39. Users are protected from connecting devices incorrectly</b>
<p>
<i>Required</i>

<p>
This requirement is to help ensure that the end user or service support personnel can correctly make the physical connections required for adding a device to the system. For implementation guidelines, see item #20 in the &ldquo;Basic PC 97&rdquo; chapter of <i>PC 97 Hardware Design Guide</i>.

<p>
<b>40. Minimal interaction required to install and configure devices</b>
<p>
<i>Required</i>

<p>
After physically installing the device, qualified service personnel must not be required to perform any action other than to provide a pointer to a source that contains drivers and other files. For implementation guidelines, see item #21 in the &ldquo;Basic PC 97&rdquo; chapter of <i>PC 97 Hardware Design Guide</i>.

<p>
<b>41. Multifunction add-on devices meet general device requirements for each device</b>
<p>
<i>Required</i>

<p>
This requirement is provided as a guideline for OEM-installed devices in a Net PC system. When integrated into a Net PC system, multifunction add-on devices must meet the PC 97 requirements referenced earlier in this section for automated software-only settings for device configuration, device drivers, and Windows-based installation. For implementation guidelines, see item #23 in the &ldquo;Basic PC 97&rdquo; chapter of <i>PC 97 Hardware Design Guide</i>. 

<p>
<b>42. Standard system board devices use ISA-compatible addresses, for Intel architecture</b>
<p>
<i>Required</i>

<p>
This includes devices with I/O port addresses within the reserved range 0h through 0ffh.
