Comparing UUIDs</h1>
<p>
Consider each field of the UUID to be an unsigned integer as shown in the table in section 3.1. Then, to compare a pair of UUIDs, arithmetically compare the corresponding fields from each UUID in order of significance and according to their data type. Two UUIDs are equal if and only if all the corresponding fields are equal. The first of two UUIDs follows the second if the most significant field in which the UUIDs differ is greater for the first UUID. The first of a pair of UUIDs precedes the second if the most significant field in which the UUIDs differ is greater for the second UUID.</p>
