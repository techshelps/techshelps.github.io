<h1><a name="storageperipheralsbasicfeatures"></a>Storage Peripherals Basic Features</h1>
<p>
This section summarizes the hardware requirements for storage peripherals. For related acoustical requirements for storage devices, see the “Basic PC&nbsp;98” chapter in Part&nbsp;2 of this guide.</p>
<p>
<b>1. Storage device and controller support bus master capabilities</h1>
<table border=1 cols=3 frame=void rules=rows>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=284><b>Required </b></td>
<td width=89></td>
<td width=89></td>
</tr>
</table><br>
<p>
Bus master capabilities must meet the related specification for the particular controller. For example, the programming register set for PCI IDE bus master DMA is defined in SFF 8038i.</p>
<p>
Correctly implemented bus master support ensures improved performance and Windows-compatible device driver support.</p>
<p>
<b>Note: </b>This requirement does not apply to legacy FDCs and will not become a requirement for legacy FDCs.</p>
<p>
<b>2. Removable media includes media status notification support</h1>
<table border=1 cols=3 frame=void rules=rows>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=30%><b>Required</b></td>
<td width=30%></td>
<td width=30%></td>
</tr>
</table><br>
<p>
The following list shows the required specifications for implementing media status notification, depending in device type.</p>
<table border=1 cols=2 frame=void rules=rows>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=128><b>Device type</b></td>
<td width=336><b>Media status notification implementation</b></td>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=128>CD-ROM and <br>
DVD-ROM </td>
<td width=336>Required. Comply with all provisions in the Media Event Status Notification subsection of SFF 8090 (Mt. Fuji specification), available at ftp://fission.dt.wdc.com/pub/standards/SFF/specs/. </td>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=128>Other types of IDE/ATAPI removable storage devices</td>
<td width=336>Required. Comply with <i>Media Status Notification Support, Version 1.03</i> or higher, available at http://www.microsoft.com/hwdev/specs/. </td>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=128>ATAPI floppy drives</td>
<td width=336>Required. Comply with media status notification as defined in SFF 8070.</td>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=128>Other ATAPI devices, including tape drives</td>
<td width=336>Recommended. Comply with SFF 8090 (Mt. Fuji specification) if&nbsp;implemented.</td>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=128>Other types of SCSI removable devices</td>
<td width=336>Not required. Comply with SFF 8090 (Mt. Fuji specification) if&nbsp;implemented.</td>
</tr>
</table><br>
<p>
<b>3. Option ROMs support Int 13h Extensions</h1>
<table border=1 cols=3 frame=void rules=rows>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=30%><b>Required</b></td>
<td width=30%></td>
<td width=30%></td>
</tr>
</table><br>
<p>
The Int 13h Extensions ensure correct support for high-capacity drives, consistent drive-letter mapping between real mode and protected mode, and other capabilities for both Windows and Windows&nbsp;NT. Support for the fixed-disk access subset of Int 13h Extensions must be provided in the system BIOS and in any option ROMs for storage devices that include BIOS support. The Int&nbsp;13h Extensions are defined in the “Layered Block Device Drivers” section of the Windows&nbsp;98 DDK and in the Windows&nbsp;NT 5.0 DDK.</p>
<p>
<b>4. Device meets PC 98 general device requirements</h1>
<table border=1 cols=3 frame=void rules=rows>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=30%><b>Required</b></td>
<td width=30%></td>
<td width=30%></td>
</tr>
</table><br>
<p>
These include the PC 98 requirements for a Plug and Play device ID, automated software-only settings for device configuration, device drivers and Windows-based installation, and icons for external connectors. For more information, see the “Basic PC&nbsp;98” chapter in Part 2 of this guide.</p>
<p>
<b>5. Device meets PC 98 requirements for ports or buses</h1>
<table border=1 cols=3 frame=void rules=rows>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=30%><b>Required</b></td>
<td width=30%></td>
<td width=30%></td>
</tr>
</table><br>
<p>
The device must meet all requirements for the port or bus to which it is attached. For example, a drive that uses the parallel port must meet all the requirements defined for legacy parallel peripherals (including requirements for ECP mode), as&nbsp;defined in the “I/O Ports and Devices” chapter in Part&nbsp;4 of this guide. If the device uses a PCI, IDE, or SCSI connection, the device must meet the related requirements defined in Part&nbsp;3 of this guide.</p>
<p>
<b>6. Device Bay storage device meets PC&nbsp;98 requirements</h1>
<table border=1 cols=3 frame=void rules=rows>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=30%><b>Required</b></td>
<td width=30%></td>
<td width=30%></td>
</tr>
</table><br>
<p>
All Device Bay peripherals must meet the requirements defined in <i>Device Bay Interface Specification, Version 1.0. </i>Any storage device designed as a Device Bay peripheral must also interface with either the USB or IEEE 1394 bus, or both, and must support the <i>Universal Serial Bus Device Class Definition for Mass Storage Devices, Version 1.0</i> or higher, if it interfaces with USB.</p>
<p>
<b>7. IDE/ATAPI devices supported on IEEE 1394</h1>
<table border=1 cols=3 frame=void rules=rows>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=30%><b>Recommended</b></td>
<td width=30%></td>
<td width=30%></td>
</tr>
</table><br>
<p>
For PC&nbsp;98 systems, IDE/ATPI device support on IEEE 1394 is recommended. An&nbsp;interface device or dongle that allows all IDE/ATAPI devices to be connected to IEEE&nbsp;1394 can be included with the system. If IDE/ATAPI support is included, the operating system must be able to boot from this device.</p>
<p>
This recommended support is defined in relation to the emerging Device Bay standard. For more information about PC&nbsp;98 recommendations and requirements for Device Bay, see the “Basic PC&nbsp;98” chapter in Part&nbsp;2 of this guide.</p>
<p>
<b>8. IDE/ATAPI devices and controllers support Ultra DMA/33</h1>
<table border=1 cols=3 frame=void rules=rows>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=30%><b>Required</b></td>
<td width=30%></td>
<td width=30%></td>
</tr>
</table><br>
<p>
Ultra DMA/33 (also known as Ultra-ATA) is required to avoid the bottleneck created by the current 16.6&nbsp;Mb/s limit on disk transfer. Ultra&nbsp;DMA/33 also provides error checking for improved robustness over previous IDE implementations. This is a requirement for all IDE/ATAPI controllers and&nbsp;devices.</p>
<p>
PCI chip sets must implement DMA as defined in SFF 8020i and must implement Ultra&nbsp;DMA/33 as defined in the specification submitted by Quantum Corporation for inclusion in the ATA-4 specification.</p>
<p>
<b>9. USB-based mass storage device meets PC&nbsp;98 requirements for USB </h1>
<table border=1 cols=3 frame=void rules=rows>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=30%><b>Required</b></td>
<td width=30%></td>
<td width=30%></td>
</tr>
</table><br>
<p>
If a USB-based mass-storage device (including tape and CD-ROM) is implemented in a PC&nbsp;98 system, it must meet the requirements defined in the “USB” chapter in Part&nbsp;3 of this guide. It must also meet the requirements defined in <i>Universal Serial Bus Device Class Definition for Mass Storage Devices, Version 1.0</i> or higher.</p>
<p>
<b>10. System BIOS or option ROM supports El Torito No Emulation mode</h1>
<table border=1 cols=3 frame=void rules=rows>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=30%><b>Required</b></td>
<td width=30%></td>
<td width=30%></td>
</tr>
</table><br>
<p>
For PC systems that include CD-ROM or DVD-ROM devices, the system BIOS or option ROM must support the No Emulation mode defined in the specification <i>El Torito—Bootable CD-ROM Format Specification, Version 1.0,</i> published by IBM and Phoenix.</p>
