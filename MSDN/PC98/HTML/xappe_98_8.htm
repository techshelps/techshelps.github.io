Platform Management Information Requirements</h1>

<p>
Each Net PC system must be able to provide consistent and dependable platform information for use by any management application. The management solution must ensure that the Net PC is manageable in heterogeneous networking environments and that there is a basic set of management information that is guaranteed to be available for management applications. This section defines the requirements to support these capabilities.</p>

<p>
Overview of Platform Management Information Technologies</p>

<p>
This section briefly describes the platform management information technologies referenced in these guidelines and gives references to full definitions and descriptions of these technologies. To provide useful guidelines for products prior to the availability of technologies under development, these guidelines include specifications for both the currently available and the forthcoming technologies for providing platform management information.</p>

<p>
To understand the relationships of the technologies referenced in these guidelines, note that platform management information technologies generally have three key elements: </p>

<ul>
<li>
Component Instrumentation &mdash; an interface by which information is supplied by manageable platform components.
</li>
<li>
Management Information Provider &mdash; an interface used by applications to access platform management information.
</li>
<li>
Management Information Schema &mdash; the logical structure of the information handled by the component instrumentation and the management information provider.
<p>
The platform management information technologies referenced in these guidelines are the following, defined in alphabetical order:

</li>
<li>
<b>Common Information Model.</b> CIM is the management information schema for WBEM. It is an object-oriented schema that is being defined by a subcommittee of the DMTF. CIM is designed to be extended for each operating environment in which it is used; as an example of this extensibility, Windows operating systems use the CIM and have added Win32 extensions. 
<p>
For CIM specifications, see http://www.dmtf.org/work/cim.html.

</li>
<li>
<b>Desktop Management Interface.</b> DMI is a platform management information framework created by the DMTF. DMTF specifications define industry-standard interfaces for component instrumentation and management applications.
<p>
For specifications on DMI Management Information Interfaces, see <i>Desktop Management Interface Specification, Version 2.00</i>. For specification of DMI Component Interfaces, see <i>Desktop Management Interface Specification, Version 2.00</i>. Compliance of Net PC platforms to the DMI specifications referenced in these guidelines is measured by <i>DMI Compliance Guidelines, Version 1.0</i>.

</li>
<li>
<b>CIM Object Manager.</b> CIMOM is a software component that interacts with the CIM schema and its extensions and in turn serves as a access point for management data providers to acquire data from the schema. Microsoft will implement CIMOM within Windows NT 5.0 and Windows 98 as well as other Win32 platforms, and will create a portable, platform-independent reference implementation. Versions of CIMOM for other operating systems may be available from other vendors. CIMOM handles both schema interactions and requests from management data providers.
<p>
An example of use of CIMOM is its capability to integrate and associate management data from different sources, as in the case where one would associate a particular desktop application with its required network services, which would in turn be associated with a particular network card and a particular path through the network to the application running on a remote server. For further explanation of this example, please see the conceptual demonstration on http://wbem.freerange.com.

</li>
<li>
<b>Simple Network Management Protocol.</b> SNMP is used widely throughout the industry as the standard under which servers, routers, hubs, and other network-based devices are managed. Enterprise-level management applications have long used SNMP as their manageability protocol because of its stability, flexibility, and wide-spread adoption.
</li>
<li>
<b>Web-Based Enterprise Management.</b> WBEM is a set of platform management information technologies originally proposed by BMC Software, Inc., Cisco Systems, Inc., Compaq Computer Corporation, Intel Corporation, and Microsoft Corporation based on standards being developed in a number of industry bodies, including the DMTF and the IETF. WBEM is being designed to provide uniform access for management applications to management information from a variety of sources, such as DMI, SNMP, and operating system&ndash;specific component instrumentation.
<p>
For specifications on WBEM, see http://wbem.freerange.com. 

</li>
<li>
<b>Win32 Extensions Schema.</b> This term is another name for the Win32 extensions to the CIM schema for Windows operating systems. For specifications on the Win32 Extensions Schema, see http://www.microsoft.com/management/wbem/.
</li>
<li>
<b>Windows Management Interface.</b> WMI is an extension to WDM and is a new component instrumentation approach for Microsoft operating systems. WMI drivers have their schema built into the driver image as a resource, which enables simple, dynamic &ldquo;import&rdquo; of specific driver schema data into the CIM schema.
<p>
WDM and WMI will be available in Windows NT 5.0 and Windows 98. For specifications on WMI, see http://www.microsoft.com/management/wbem/. 

<p>
In the following sections, platform management information requirements are divided into two categories: 

</li>
<li>
Component Instrumentation Requirements. Describes interfaces by which instrumentation is supplied by manageable platform components.
</li>
<li>
Management Information Providers. Describes interfaces used by applications to access platform management information.
</li>
</ul>
