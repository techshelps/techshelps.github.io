<h1><a name="chapter22scannersdigitalcameras"></a>Chapter 22: Scanners and Digital Cameras</h1>
<p>
This chapter presents the PC&nbsp;98 requirements and recommendations for still-image devices, specifically digital cameras and scanners, including sheetfed, flatbed, handheld, and film-scanning devices.</p>
<p>
The still-image device market is growing rapidly in the consumer and mass-market segments, stimulated by applications such as Internet authoring and home publishing, and by the availability of low-cost, high-resolution color printers. For PC&nbsp;98, the important design issues include the following:
<ul>
<li>
Increased image-resolution quality at consumer price points<br><br></li>
<li>
Incorporation of new bus standards such as USB and IEEE 1394 into still-image peripheral devices<br><br></li>
<li>
Integration of a fast transfer mechanism for non-tethered devices such as digital cameras<br><br></li>
<li>
Improved ease of connectivity and installation for the end user—that is, by reducing components to be installed, such as power supplies and add-on cards, by simplifying the installation procedure to limit the number of user responses required, and by ensuring compliance with Plug and Play requirements<br><br></li>
<li>
Incorporation of color-calibration support across devices<br><br></li>
<li>
Implementation of push-model behavior, where events are triggered based on user-initiated actions at the device, such as inserting paper or pushing a&nbsp;button</li>
</ul>
