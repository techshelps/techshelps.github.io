<h1><a name="cd-romperipherals"></a>CD-ROM Peripherals</h1>
<p>
This section summarizes the requirements for CD-ROM peripherals and the specific features for PC 98. The device must also meet the general requirements defined in the “Storage Peripherals Basic Features” and “PC 98 Design for Storage Components” sections in this chapter, including the requirement for bus&nbsp;mastering.</p>
<p>
<b>18. CD-ROM drive provides 8x or higher performance</h1>
<table border=1 cols=3 frame=void rules=rows>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=30%><b>Required</b></td>
<td width=30%></td>
<td width=30%></td>
</tr>
</table><br>
<p>
The CD-ROM drive must support 1200K per second average throughput or higher performance when running in the fully on power state.</p>
<p>
<b>19. CD-ROM drive is CD-Enhanced compatible</h1>
<table border=1 cols=3 frame=void rules=rows>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=30%><b>Required</b></td>
<td width=30%></td>
<td width=30%></td>
</tr>
</table><br>
<p>
For PC 98, the CD-ROM drive must be able to mount multisession CD-ROM discs, even if track 1 is Red Book audio. Microsoft recommends use of the Sony ReadTOC method for SCSI-2 multisession support as noted in SFF 8020i, Version&nbsp;2.5.</p>
<p>
CD-Enhanced support must be Blue Book compliant, as defined in <i>Enhanced Music CD Specification, Version 1.0.</i></p>
<p>
<b>20. CD-ROM drive supports specified logical and physical CD formats</h1>
<table border=1 cols=3 frame=void rules=rows>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=30%><b>Required</b></td>
<td width=30%></td>
<td width=30%></td>
</tr>
</table><br>
<p>
At a minimum, the CD-ROM device must be compatible with the following formats to ensure cross-media compatibility:
<ul>
<li>
Logical formats: CD Red Book, Yellow Book, White Book, and Blue Book<br><br></li>
<li>
Physical formats: CD-ROM and CD-Audio</li>
</ul><p>
CD-E and CD-R (Orange Book format) can be implemented; however, there are no PC&nbsp;98 requirements or recommendations for this format.</p>
<p>
<b>Note: </b>Any ATAPI CD-ROM drive designed to play back CD-I content must return a minimum of two track entries for the READ_TOC (0x43) command. These two track entries must be a track 01 entry and a track 0xAA entry for the lead-out address. Drives that do not comply with this minimum requirement cannot play back CD-I movies.</p>
<p>
<b>21. IDE/ATAPI CD-ROM drive complies with SFF 8020i, Version 1.2</b>
</p>
<table border=1 cols=3 frame=void rules=rows>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=30%><b>Required</b></td>
<td width=30%></td>
<td width=30%></td>
</tr>
</table><br>
<p>
CD-ROM drives attached to the system must support the hardware and protocols documented in <i>ATA Packet Interface for CD-ROMs, Version&nbsp;1.2 </i>or&nbsp;higher.</p>
<p>
<b>Note:</b> For PC&nbsp;98, support for the READ CD-DA command as defined in SFF&nbsp;8020i, Version&nbsp;1.2, is recommended. This might become a requirement in&nbsp;future versions of these guidelines.</p>
<p>
For DVD drives, see the “DVD device meets SFF 8090 specification” requirement later in this chapter.</p>
<p>
<b>22. CD-ROM drive supports multisession and compatibility forms of the READ_TOC command</h1>
<table border=1 cols=3 frame=void rules=rows>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=30%><b>Required</b></td>
<td width=30%></td>
<td width=30%></td>
</tr>
</table><br>
<p>
Both multisession forms (01b and 10b) as well as the compatibility form (00b) of the READ_TOC command must be implemented. This ensures complete support for CD-ROM multisession capabilities.</p>
<p>
<b>Note: </b>Any ATAPI CD-ROM drive designed to play back CD-I content must return a minimum of two track entries for the READ_TOC (0x43) command. These two track entries must be a track 01 entry and a track 0xAA entry for the lead-out address. Drives that do not comply with this minimum requirement cannot play back CD-I movies.</p>
<p>
<b>23. IDE/ATAPI CD changer meets SFF 8070 specification</h1>
<table border=1 cols=3 frame=void rules=rows>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=30%><b>Required</b></td>
<td width=30%></td>
<td width=30%></td>
</tr>
</table><br>
<p>
If an ATAPI-compatible CD changer is present that has a capacity for seven or fewer discs, the device must comply with SFF 8070.</p>
