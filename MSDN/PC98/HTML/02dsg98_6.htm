<h1><a name="devicebaybenefits"></a>Device Bay Benefits</h1>
<p>
This section summarizes the potential benefits that Device Bay offers to end users and hardware manufacturers.</p>
<p>
<b>Benefits of Device Bay for End Users. </b>The following list shows some of the ways Device Bay features can benefit end users:
<ul>
<li>
Device Bay bays are accessible. Devices can be inserted without opening the case.<br><br></li>
<li>
Devices inserted into Device Bay-capable bays are automatically configured, and devices can be inserted into, removed from, and swapped among Device Bay-capable bays while the PC is powered up.<br><br></li>
<li>
Fear of obsolescence is reduced because future higher performance peripherals will work in Device Bay bays and, as time goes on, earlier Device Bay peripherals will be accepted by future Device Bay-enabled systems.<br><br></li>
<li>
A broad diversity of peripherals can be Device Bay devices, and PCs can be quickly and easily reconfigured to a user’s specific application needs at any given time.</li></ul><p>
<b>Benefits of Device Bay for OEMs. </b>The following list shows some of the ways Device Bay features can benefit OEMs:</p>
<ul>
<li>
Device Bay’s modular nature allows for cost-effective delivery of tailored PC configurations. Device Bay simplifies the manufacturing process and system configuration, allowing OEMs to design and deliver customized systems while optimizing manufacturing and distribution processes.<br><br></li>
<li>
Device Bay enables simplified product design and rapid adoption of new technologies into product lines, without altering either PC system design or manufacturing processes, because of standardized Device Bay form factors and device interfaces.<br><br></li>
<li>
Device Bay reduces obsolescence issues for OEMs.<br><br></li>
<li>
Device Bay lowers support costs and TCO. A principal goal of the Device Bay specification is to reduce support costs related to improper installation of new peripherals. Device Bay design ensures that many current configuration conflicts will be eliminated, thus reducing support calls.</li></ul><p>
<b>Benefits of Device Bay for IHVs. </b>The following list shows some of the ways Device Bay features can benefit independent hardware vendors (IHVs):</p>
<ul>
<li>
Device Bay enables development of new product segments and enables faster integration of devices by OEMs into their platforms. Implementing new designs based on Device Bay will also mean more rapid adoption of new technologies once an installed base of Device Bay-enabled systems is present.<br><br></li>
<li>
Device Bay specifies a standardized design for device interfaces, connectors, and form factors. The enhanced interoperability of Device Bay ensures that IHVs have a clear indication of what to build and that they can realize great economies of scale for connectors, casings, and other components.</li>
