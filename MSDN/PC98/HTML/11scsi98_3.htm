<h1><a name="plugplayforscsihostadaptersperipherals"></a>Plug and Play for SCSI Host Adapters and Peripherals</h1>
<p>
This section summarizes the Plug and Play requirements for SCSI devices.</p>
<p>
<b>18. Each device has a Plug and Play device ID</h1>
<table border=1 cols=3 frame=void rules=rows>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=30%><b>Required</b></td>
<td width=30%></td>
<td width=30%></td>
</tr>
</table><br>
<p>
For a system-board device, there must be a Plug and Play device-specific ID.</p>
<p>
Each SCSI controller or peripheral device must provide device IDs as defined in the <i>Plug and Play SCSI Specification, Version 1.0</i>, and in the specification for the bus it uses as defined in the related chapter in Part 3 of this guide. For example, a PCI device must comply with PCI 2.1 and also must provide a Subsystem ID and Subsystem Vendor ID as defined in the “PCI” chapter in Part&nbsp;3 of this guide.</p>
<p>
PCI controllers integrated into core logic on the system board do not have to provide Subsystem IDs and Subsystem Vendor IDs, but must meet other PCI&nbsp;2.1 requirements.</p>
<p>
<b>19. Automatic resource assignment and dynamic disable capabilities supported for all devices</h1>
<table border=1 cols=3 frame=void rules=rows>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=30%><b>Required</b></td>
<td width=30%></td>
<td width=30%></td>
</tr>
</table><br>
<p>
For SCSI on-board controllers and add-on adapters, the system must be capable as&nbsp;necessary of automatically assigning, disabling, and relocating the resources used by the device. Changing this device or adding it to the system must not require changing jumpers or switches on either the adapter or the system board. In&nbsp;the event of an irreconcilable conflict with other devices, the operating system must be able to disable the device in order to prevent the system from stalling.</p>
<p>
<b>20. SCSI controllers provide multi-initiator support</h1>
<table border=1 cols=3 frame=void rules=rows>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=30%><b>Recommended</b></td>
<td width=30%></td>
<td width=30%></td>
</tr>
</table><br>
<p>
Multi-initiator support allows two SCSI controllers—each installed in a separate computer system—to coexist on a shared SCSI bus with a set of shared devices. If&nbsp;this capability is supported, the SCSI IDs must be changeable from the default SCSI controller ID of 7, and the boot-time SCSI bus reset operation must be able to be disabled on each controller attached to a shared bus.</p>
