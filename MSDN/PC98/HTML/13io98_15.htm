<p>
The items in this section are PC 98 requirements for Plug and Play capabilities.</p>
<p>
<b>34. Each device has a unique Plug and Play device ID</h1>

<p>
For a non-bus–specific system-board device, there must be a device-specific ID.</p>
<p>
Each bus-specific device must have a Plug and Play device ID as required for the&nbsp;bus it uses, as defined in Part 3 of this guide. For example, a PCI device must&nbsp;comply with PCI 2.1 and also must provide a Subsystem ID and Subsystem Vendor&nbsp;ID, as defined in the “PCI” chapter in Part&nbsp;3 of this guide. A USB device must comply with the <i>Universal Serial Bus Specification, Version 1.0</i> or higher, and also must provide a unique ID.</p>
<p>
<b>35. Automatic resource assignment and dynamic disable capabilities are supported</h1>
<table border=1 cols=3 frame=void rules=rows>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=30%><b>Required</b></td>

</table><br>
<p>
The system must be capable of automatically assigning, disabling, and relocating the resources used by this device when necessary, using the method required for the related bus class. When the end user changes this device or adds it to the system, setting of resource assignments must not require changing jumpers or switches on either the adapter or the system board.</p>
<p>
In the event of an irreconcilable conflict with other devices on the system, the system must be able to disable the device to prevent the system from stalling. If there is a conflict where more than one port or device of the same type is detected on the system, then one of two methods can be used to resolve it:
<ul>
<li>
Completely disable the built-in port or device.</li></ul>
<p>
For example, if there is a conflict when a second serial port is added to a desktop system, the expansion card overrides the system-board device. Using this method, the system disables the device on the system board and enables the expansion card only. This is the recommended conflict-resolution method for add-on serial, parallel, Musical Instrument Digital Interface (MIDI), and joystick devices.</P>
<p>
Or if an expansion card, such as a display adapter with a built-in pointing-device port, is added to a desktop system that has a system-board pointing-device port, then the expansion card overrides the system-board pointing-device port. Using this method, the system disables the pointing-device port on the system board and only accepts pointing-device input from the expansion card.</P>
<ul><li>
Both ports and devices remain active while resolving any conflict by relocating the resources of one or both devices.</li></ul>
<p>
Using this method, either device can be used. For example, in a docking system, the pointing device on a mobile PC and the pointing device on a docking station can be allowed to share pointing responsibilities. Either pointing device can be used, although the software will use only one.</P>
<p>
<b>Note: </b>Fixed (static) resource devices can exist to support standard devices, including the keyboard controller (8042). For a system based on Intel Architecture, these fixed resources are located at I/O addresses under 100h. Standard system-board devices should use their ISA-compatible addresses. For a system based on Intel Architecture, this includes devices with I/O port addresses within the reserved range 0h–0ffh. For more information about legacy resources and ISA-compatible addresses, see the “Legacy Support” appendix in the References part of this guide.</p>
