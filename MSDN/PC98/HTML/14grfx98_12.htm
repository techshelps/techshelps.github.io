<h1><a name="biosoptionromrequirementsforgraphicsadapters"></a>BIOS and Option ROM Requirements for Graphics Adapters</h1>
<p>
The requirements in this section relate to BIOS support for graphics adapters.</p>
<p>
<b>42. Chips support linear packed-pixel frame buffer, relocatable above 16 MB</h1>
<table border=1 cols=3 frame=void rules=rows>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=30%><b>Required</b></td>
<td width=30%></td>
<td width=30%></td>
</tr>
</table><br>
<p>
<b>Note: </b>For DirectDraw, the graphics adapter’s chip set must support linear access to the frame buffer by the host.</p>
<p>
Windows is optimized for a graphics adapter with a packed-pixel frame buffer at&nbsp;all supported resolutions. Memory-mapped packed-pixel frame buffers also provide a fast and simple interface between Windows and the graphics adapter. The Windows DIB engine provides a very fast display by writing directly to packed-pixel frame buffers, and this architecture requires that the hardware developer write only a small, simple device driver.</p>
<p>
For optimized support with Windows, a linear packed-pixel frame buffer is required over a bank-switched frame buffer. Use 32-bit addresses to allow the linear frame buffer to be placed above the 16-MB ISA boundary, which enables a&nbsp;system to be populated with large amounts of RAM.</p>
<p>
If memory or other resources conflict with the frame buffer being mapped into a&nbsp;linear address space, the page frame address can be used with minimal degradation of performance.</p>
<p>
<b>43. Option ROM supports DDC2B</h1>
<table border=1 cols=3 frame=void rules=rows>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=30%><b>Required</b></td>
<td width=30%></td>
<td width=30%></td>
</tr>
</table><br>
<p>
This requirement does not apply for systems that use RISC-based processors. The option ROM for the graphics adapter must meet current DDC host requirements documented in <i>Display Data Channel Standard, Version 2.0</i>, Level B (DDC2B), published by VESA. This standard defines the functions that support the data channel between the graphics adapter and a DDC-compliant monitor.</p>
<p>
<b>44. BIOS setup utility provides option to force use of system-board graphics</h1>
<table border=1 cols=3 frame=void rules=rows>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=30%><b>Recommended</b></td>
<td width=30%></td>
<td width=30%></td>
</tr>
</table><br>
<p>
The OEM should provide an option in the system BIOS setup utility to force the system-board graphics device to be used (that is, to ignore and leave disabled any PCI graphics adapters). This option would ensure that a user with a PCI hot-docking system is always able to undock, because the VGA device will be in the&nbsp;mobile unit.</p>
<p>
<b>45. BIOS supports large frame buffers for graphics adapters</h1>
<table border=1 cols=3 frame=void rules=rows>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=30%><b>Required</b></td>
<td width=30%></td>
<td width=30%></td>
</tr>
</table><br>
<p>
The BIOS must support large frame-buffer graphics adapters that have up to 256&nbsp;MB of frame buffers.</p>
