<h1><a name="devicedriversinstallationfornetworkcommunications"></a>Device Drivers and Installation for Network Communications</h1>
<p>
This section summarizes requirements for network communications device drivers, in addition to the requirements for using an NDIS&nbsp;5.0 miniport driver as&nbsp;defined in the “System Requirements for Network Communications” section earlier in this chapter.</p>
<p>
<b>41. Device drivers and installation meet PC 98 requirements</h1>
<table cols=3>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=30%><b>Required</b></td>
<td width=30%></td>
<td width=30%></td>
</tr>
</table><br>
<p>
The manufacturer does not need to supply a driver if a PC&nbsp;98-compliant driver provided with the operating system can be used. If the manufacturer supplies a driver, the requirements for the device drivers and installation are defined in the “Basic PC&nbsp;98” chapter in Part&nbsp;2 of this guide. The basic requirements include driver support for unattended installation and Help file support if special driver parameters are used.</p>
<p>
For exceptions to unattended installation requirements for ISDN adapters, see the&nbsp;“ISDN Requirements” section earlier in this chapter.</p>
<p>
For information about NDIS status codes and indication mechanisms, see the Microsoft Windows&nbsp;NT 5.0 DDK.</p>
<p>
<b>42. Driver supports promiscuous mode</h1>
<table cols=3>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=30%><b>Required</b></td>
<td width=30%></td>
<td width=30%></td>
</tr>
</table><br>
<p>
This ensures that the adapter can be used with Microsoft Network Monitor Agent. This requirement applies only to LAN (non-switched) media.</p>
<p>
Notice that, by default, promiscuous mode is not turned on. Configuring promiscuous mode should be possible only by using the Microsoft Network Monitor Agent or another similar administrative application.</p>
<p>
<b>43. Driver works correctly with Microsoft network clients and protocols</h1>
<table cols=3>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=30%><b>Required</b></td>
<td width=30%></td>
<td width=30%></td>
</tr>
</table><br>
<p>
This includes the 32-bit Microsoft client and NetWare-compatible clients provided with Windows, whether connected to a Windows NT-based server, a Novell NetWare 3.<i>x</i> or 4.<i>x</i> server, or a Windows-based peer server. In all cases, this includes connections using Microsoft TCP/IP, IPX/SPX-compatible protocol, and NetBEUI.</p>
<p>
<b>44. NDIS miniport driver does not make operating system–specific kernel&nbsp;calls</h1>
<table cols=3>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=30%><b>Required</b></td>
<td width=30%></td>
<td width=30%></td>
</tr>
</table><br>
<p>
A miniport driver that follows the NDIS 5.0 specification must not make operating&nbsp;system–specific calls. A correct driver makes calls only to the NDIS library. The NDIS library provides all the functions a driver needs or should use. This results in binary compatibility of the driver between Windows and Windows&nbsp;NT.</p>
<p>
NDIS conformance must be validated over a single network connection and multiple connections. For Windows NT, this must be validated on a multiprocessor system as part of PC&nbsp;98 testing.</p>
<p>
<b>45. NDIS 5.0 driver uses new INF format</h1>
<table cols=3>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=30%><b>Required</b></td>
<td width=30%></td>
<td width=30%></td>
</tr>
</table><br>
<p>
For NDIS 5.0 drivers (which are required for Windows NT 5.0), all network components must use the new-style INF format, which is based on the Windows&nbsp;95 INF format. For information, see the Windows&nbsp;NT 5.0 DDK.</p>
<p>
<b>Note:</b> For Windows&nbsp;NT 5.0, there will be no legacy INF support and no satisfactory upgrade option for OEM components created for Windows&nbsp;NT 4.0.</p>
