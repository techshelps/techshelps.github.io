<h1><a name="plugplaybusdesignformodems"></a>Plug and Play and Bus Design for Modems</h1>
<p>
The items in this section are requirements for Plug and Play capabilities.</p>
<p>
<b>29. Each device has a unique Plug and Play device ID </h1>
<table cols=3>

<td width=284><b>Required </b></td>

<p>
For a system-board device, there must be a device-specific ID.</p>
<p>
Each bus-specific device must provide device IDs in the manner required for the bus it uses as defined in Part 3 of this guide. For example, PCI devices must comply with PCI 2.1 requirements and also must provide a Subsystem&nbsp;ID and Subsystem Vendor ID as defined in the “PCI” chapter in Part&nbsp;3 of this guide.</p>
<p>
<b>Note: </b>The device must implement either a bus Plug and Play ID or a COM-port Plug and Play ID, but not both.</p>
<p>
<b>30. Each device has a compatible Plug and Play device ID</h1>
<table cols=3>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=284><b>Required </b></td>
<td width=89></td>
<td width=89></td>
</tr>
</table><br>
<p>
The various bus-specific Plug and Play specifications provide the means for reporting a CompatibleID as well as a device unique ID.</p>
<p>
At least one CompatibleID is required for PC 98. Its primary use is for back up in&nbsp;case the driver or INF file associated with the unique ID is not available (for&nbsp;example, if the customer lost the disk). The goal is for the modem to retain essential data functionality.</p>
<p>
The most useful CompatibleIDs would point either to an earlier version of the same product (whose INF file is included in shipping versions of Windows) or&nbsp;point to a reference INF file (that is, one provided by the modem chip-set manufacturer).</p>
<p>
<b>Note:</b> If the CompatibleID is used, it is recommended to provide an accurate, displayable manufacturer and modem name using V.25ter standard ID commands.</p>
<p>
<b>31. Automatic resource assignment and dynamic disable capabilities are&nbsp;supported</h1>
<table cols=3>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=284><b>Required </b></td>
<td width=89></td>
<td width=89></td>
</tr>
</table><br>
<p>
The system must be capable of automatically assigning, disabling, and relocating the resources used by this device when necessary, using the method required for&nbsp;the related bus class. When the end user changes this device or adds it to the&nbsp;system, setting resource assignments must not require changing jumpers or&nbsp;switches on either the adapter or the system board. In the event of an irreconcilable conflict with other devices on the system, the system must be able&nbsp;to disable the device to prevent the system from stalling.</p>
<p>
<b>32. PCI modem meets PCI 2.1 requirements</h1>
<table cols=3>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=284><b>Required </b></td>
<td width=89></td>
<td width=89></td>
</tr>
</table><br>
<p>
This device must comply with PCI 2.1 requirements if PCI is used as the bus connection for the modem. This ensures that all Plug and Play requirements are met and that Windows and Windows&nbsp;NT drivers support this device.</p>
<p>
<b>33. USB modem meets USB specifications</h1>
<table cols=3>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=284><b>Required </b></td>
<td width=89></td>
<td width=89></td>
</tr>
</table><br>
<p>
As required for all PC&nbsp;98 devices, a modem must meet the specific requirements for the bus it uses, including any device class specifications. For example, a modem that uses USB must comply with all related USB specifications, including:
<ul>
<li>
<i>USB Specification, Version 1.0</i> or higher (also known as the USB core specification)<br><br></li>
<li>
<i>Universal Serial Bus Device Class Definition for Communication Devices, Version 1.0</i> or higher</li>
</ul>
<p>
The “Standard Serial Interface Circuit Emulation” appendix in the <i>USB Device Class Definition for Communication Devices </i>specifically addresses serial port compatibility.</p>
<p>
<b>34. Device Bay modem meets PC&nbsp;98 requirements</b></p>
<table cols=3>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=284><b>Required </b></td>
<td width=89></td>
<td width=89></td>
</tr>
</table><br>
<p>
A modem designed as a Device Bay peripheral must interface with either USB, IEEE 1394, or both buses, and must support relevant USB device class specifications. All Device Bay peripherals must meet the requirements defined in&nbsp;<i>Device Bay Interface Specification, Version 1.0</i> or higher<i>.</i></p>
