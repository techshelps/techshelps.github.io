<h1><a name="basicpc98physicaldesignrequirements"></a>Basic PC 98 Physical Design Requirements</h1>
<p>
This section summarizes physical design requirements and recommendations for PC&nbsp;98 systems. These requirements are in addition to those related to the OnNow initiative for power-state indicators and easily accessible power switches.</p>
<p>
<b>6. All expansion slots in the system are accessible for users to insert cards</h1>
<table cols=3>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=30%><i>Consumer PC 98</i></td>
<td width=30%><i>Office PC 98</i></td>
<td width=30%><i>Entertainment PC 98</i></td>

<td colspan=3 width=100%></td>

<tr valign=top>
<td width=30%><b>Required</b></td>
<td width=30%><b>Required</b></td>
<td width=30%><b>Required</b></td>
</tr>
</table><br>
<p>
The internal expansion slots cannot be physically blocked by components or&nbsp;devices provided with the system. This requirement does not exclude configurations that allow space only for half-height cards for some slots, for passive back planes for connectors, and so on.</p>
<p>
For Net PC systems, user-accessible internal expansion slots are not allowed. For mobile guidelines and exceptions, see the “Mobile PC 98” chapter in Part&nbsp;2 of this&nbsp;guide.</p>
<p>
<b>7. Audible noise meets PC 98 requirements</h1>
<table cols=3>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=30%><i>Consumer PC 98</i></td>
<td width=30%><i>Office PC 98</i></td>
<td width=30%><i>Entertainment PC 98</i></td>

<td colspan=3 width=100%></td>

<p>
A PC&nbsp;98 system must be “silent” in the sleep state. That is, it must be perceived as not significantly noisier than the off state to typical users, relevant to an operating position appropriate to the PC’s form factor (such as desktop, minitower, or laptop) and the ambient noise level of its normal usage environment (such as corporate office, home office, family room, and so on). This requirement applies primarily to fan noise, as all other devices will not be active in the sleep state.</p>
<p>
It is hoped that this definition will become more objective over time through standardization of acoustic noise measurement and reporting procedures for PCs. Intel and Microsoft are working on proposals for acoustic noise measurement and reporting. The goal is to achieve common PC acoustic noise measurement methods based on established international standards. With such methods in place, end users will be able to receive reliable acoustic noise specifications about PCs similar to those available for other product categories such as automobiles and appliances.</p>
<p>
Although this PC 98 requirement does not specify noise limits for PCs in idle and working states, manufacturers are strongly encouraged to design systems that operate as quietly as possible, especially Entertainment PCs designed for use in thehome family room. It is expected that future design guidelines will propose operational noise limits for the Entertainment PC category.</p>
<p>
<b>8. System and component design practices follow accessibility guidelines</h1>
<table cols=3>

<td width=30%><i>Consumer PC 98</i></td>

<tr valign=top>
<td width=30%><b>Recommended</b></td>
<td width=30%><b>Recommended</b></td>
<td width=30%><b>Recommended</b></td>
</tr>
</table><br>
<p>
Accessibility design guidelines are provided in the “Accessibility” appendix in the References part of this guide. These guidelines were developed in consultation with the Trace Research and Development Center at the University of Wisconsin at Madison. This recommendation will not become a requirement.</p>
<p>
<b>9. Internal system modification capabilities are not accessible to end users</h1>
<table cols=3>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=30%><i>Consumer PC 98</i></td>
<td width=30%><i>Office PC 98</i></td>
<td width=30%><i>Entertainment PC 98</i></td>

<td width=30%><b>Recommended</b></td>
<td width=30%><b>Recommended</b></td>
<td width=30%><b>Recommended</b></td>
</tr>
</table><br>
<p>
This recommendation is based on goals to reduce TCO by ensuring that end users&nbsp;are prevented from inadvertently (or purposefully) altering the predefined software and hardware configurations. This recommendation, which is a requirement for Net PC systems, can encompass any of the following system requirements as defined in the <i>Network PC System Design Guidelines:</i>
<ul>
<li>
Lockable or sealed-case design, where internal expansion capabilities are not end-user accessible<br><br></li>
<li>
Upgrade capabilities for RAM and CPU are not end-user accessible</li>
</ul>
<p>
<b>10. System design provides physical security</b>
</li>
</ul>
<table cols=3>
<tr valign=top>

<p>
To prevent unauthorized hardware access, the following security features are recommended for PC 98 systems and required for Net&nbsp;PC hardware:</p>
<ul>
<li>
External drive devices have locking capabilities. Each removable media device&nbsp;should be capable of being locked to prevent unauthorized data access. This means that the device is rendered inoperable, either electronically or mechanically, when locked.</li>
<li>
PC case and switches have locking capabilities to prevent unauthorized internal access. An OEM-specific method can be implemented, either electronically or mechanically.</li>
</ul>
