DMI-based Management Information Provider</h1>

<p>
Having a DMI-based management information provider allows a Net PC to be managed by applications that can access the platform through the DMI Management Interface (MI). </p>

<p>
To be guaranteed to be able to manage DMI-instrumented Net PCs compliant with these guidelines, management applications must comply with the procedural version of the MI as specified for DMI version 2.0. This includes compliance with <i>Service Provider API for Management Applications</i> and <i>Management Provider API</i>. The new procedural interface introduced with DMI version 2.0 is an interface that supports remote access using Remote Procedure Call (RPC).</p>

<p>
<b>27. DMI service provider present and configured in system</b></p>
<p>
<i>Required</i></p>

<p>
On each DMI-instrumented Net PC, a DMI 2.0 service provider must be present and configured to run whenever the operating system is running. This supports the ability of any compliant DMI management application to access and manage a DMI-instrumented Net PC as soon as the system is up and running.</p>
