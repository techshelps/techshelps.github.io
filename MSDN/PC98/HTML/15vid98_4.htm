<h1><a name="dvd-videoplaybackrequirements"></a>DVD-Video Playback Requirements</h1>
<p>
In addition to the requirements in the previous section, the following requirements apply for systems that provide DVD-Video playback software and hardware. The goal for DVD and other audio/video (A/V) playback is to ensure that the end-user experience is the same or better than with a stand-alone DVD player.</p>
<p>
<b>15. DVD decoder driver correctly handles media types, time discontinuity, and decode-rate adjustment</h1>
<table border=1 cols=3 frame=void rules=rows>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=30%><b>Required</b></td>
<td width=30%></td>
<td width=30%></td>
</tr>
</table><br>
<p>
This requirement specifies that the vendor-supplied minidrivers for DVD, MPEG-2, and AC-3 decoders have the following capabilities:
<ul>
<li>
Use the correct media types, including validation of all format block fields on&nbsp;connection and on every IPin::QueryAccept message.<br><br></li>
<li>
Query for IMediaSample2 on every received media sample to test for a time discontinuity bit.<br><br></li>
<li>
Adjust the decode rate in response to IPin::NewSegment() calls for video and&nbsp;subpicture.<p>
<b>16. DVD decoder supports subpicture compositing and closed captioning</b>
</li>
</ul>
<table border=1 cols=3 frame=void rules=rows>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=30%><b>Required</b></td>
<td width=30%></td>
<td width=30%></td>
</tr>
</table><br>
<p>
The system must be capable of displaying subpicture data as well as providing closed-captioning support for all such data stored on the disc. This requires YUV offscreen overlay surface support, as defined in the “Adapter supports MPEG-2 and DVD-Video features” requirement in the “Graphics Adapters” chapter in Part&nbsp;4 of this guide.</p>
<p>
Subpicture streams must be supported as defined in <i>DVD Specification, Version 1.0,</i> by Toshiba Corporation.</p>
<p>
<b>Note: </b>Alpha blending is required for static menus. However, until alpha blending of YUV surfaces is implemented in graphics adapters, RGB chroma-keying of subpictures and closed-captioning information appearing over motion video is an&nbsp;acceptable alternative, although visually degraded, for 1998.</p>
<p>
<b>17. Subpicture decoder correctly handles subpicture properties and other functions</h1>
<table border=1 cols=3 frame=void rules=rows>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=30%><b>Required</b></td>
<td width=30%></td>
<td width=30%></td>
</tr>
</table><br>
<p>
The minidriver for the subpicture decoder must be able to correctly handle the&nbsp;following:
<ul>
<li>
Must be able to set the subpicture property<br><br></li>
<li>
Must be able to turn the subpicture compositing on and off<br><br></li>
<li>
Must be able to set the highlight rect parameters</li>
</ul><p>
For more information, see the Microsoft DirectX 5.1 SDK and the DirectX 5.0 information in the Windows&nbsp;NT 5.0 DDK.</p>
<p>
<b>18. System supports seamless DVD-Video 1.0 navigation</b></p>

<table border=1 cols=3 frame=void rules=rows>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=30%><b>Required</b></td>
<td width=30%></td>
<td width=30%></td>
</tr>
</table><br>
<p>
This requirement includes menu navigation, video selection, and language and subpicture track selection in support of the user’s ability to navigate DVD-Video discs. Test sources include but are not limited to the following:
<ul>
<li>
Matsushita Electronics Incorporated (MEI) test disc<br><br></li>
<li>
Joe Kane Productions Video Essentials disc</li>
</ul><p>
<b>19. System provides a licensed CSS copyright protection scheme</b>
</p>
<table border=1 cols=3 frame=void rules=rows>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=30%><b>Required</b></td>
<td width=30%></td>
<td width=30%></td>
</tr>
</table><br>
<p>
The system must provide a licensed copy scramble system (CSS) implementation and support for CSS encoded DVD-Video discs to ensure proper protection for content produced in accordance with CSS, including regionalization and analog video protection/analog protection system (APS).</p>
<p>
To facilitate the authentication process required by this scheme, software is provided as part of the Windows and Windows&nbsp;NT operating system support for DVD. This allows a DVD-ROM drive to authenticate and transfer keys with a CSS decrypter. Windows and Windows&nbsp;NT operating system software will act as&nbsp;the agent to allow either hardware or software decrypters to be authenticated.</p>
<p>
For more information about copyright protection requirements, see the “Storage and Related Peripherals” chapter in Part&nbsp;4 of this guide. For information about CSS or to obtain a CSS license, contact MEI (see http://www.mei.co.jp), or contact the CSS licensing entity when it is established.</p>
