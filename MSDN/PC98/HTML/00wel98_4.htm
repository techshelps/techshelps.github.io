<h1><a name="pc98designedformicrosoftwindowslogoprogram"></a>PC 98 and the “Designed for Microsoft Windows” Logo&nbsp;Program</h1>
<p>
Microsoft will use the requirements and recommendations in this guide as the basis of requirements for the 1998–99 “Designed for Microsoft Windows” hardware logo program. </p>
<p>
The “Designed for Microsoft Windows” logo program—represented in 1997 by the “Designed for Microsoft Windows&nbsp;NT and Windows&nbsp;95” logo program—was developed by Microsoft to help end users easily identify hardware and software products designed specifically for the Windows and Windows&nbsp;NT operating systems. Users can mix and match hardware and software products designated with these logos and can be assured that the products will take advantage of the new technologies integrated into the Microsoft Windows family of 32-bit operating systems. The goal is to ensure that end users will have an optimal experience using the software and hardware products that carry this logo.</p>
<p>
The logo program provides customers with the assurance that their hardware works with the Windows and Windows&nbsp;NT family of products, with an emphasis on how the system performs when running commercially marketed desktop applications. The end result Microsoft is seeking is lower cost of support for both vendors and users.</p>
<p>
Licensing the logo enables vendors to use the logo on web sites, product packaging, advertising, collateral, and other marketing materials. The logo indicates to customers that the product is designed to meet a specific set of standards and to provide an optimal experience when run on either a Windows or&nbsp;Windows&nbsp;NT operating system.</p>
<p>
<b>Logo Compliance Dates. </b>In general, the PC&nbsp;98 requirements go into effect on July&nbsp;1, 1998, for the “Designed for Microsoft Windows” logo. Compliance testing for some requirements will begin later because of the time required for silicon changes to become widely available. For information about actual compliance testing dates for specific requirements, see the web site at http://www.microsoft.com/hwdev/desguid/.</p>
<p>
<b>Logo Testing. </b>Both hardware and software are tested before rights to use the “Designed for Microsoft Windows” logo are granted. The testing organization for&nbsp;the logo program is the Windows Hardware Quality Labs (WHQL), which provides compatibility testing services for Windows and Windows&nbsp;NT hardware and drivers.</p>
<p>
Hardware developers whose products pass the WHQL testing program also receive a detailed test report, inclusion of tested hardware on the Windows Hardware Compatibility List (HCL), and free distribution of drivers in the Windows Driver Library (WDL).</p>
<p>
If you have questions about the program, contact WHQL:</p>
