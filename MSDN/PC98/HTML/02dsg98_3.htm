<h1><a name="manageabilityinitiatives"></a>Manageability Initiatives</h1>

<p>The purpose of the manageability initiatives described in this guide is to help plan, deploy, proactively maintain, and centrally control a distributed computing environment in order to reduce the overall cost of owning and managing computers. To do this, management technology must bring together information from different technology disciplines to provide services oriented toward management functions, which can in turn decrease TCO.</p>

<p>To succeed in significantly reducing TCO, management solutions must adapt to the needs and tasks of the environment to be managed. The solutions must therefore be open, flexible, and extensible: They need to support new technologies and integrate management functions supplied by more than one vendor. Such systems must conform to appropriate existing standards and have sufficient flexibility to extend support to emerging standards and technologies.</p>

<p>Providing management solutions requires establishing a management infrastructure in the operating system, exposing this infrastructure, and then building the tools to use it. This includes:
<ul>
<li>Providing instrumentation as the infrastructure for manageability.</li>
<li>Supporting management tools.</li>
<li>Supporting new developments such as policy management in Windows 98 and Windows NT 5.0.</li>
<li>Providing interfaces for enterprise management vendors.</li></ul>

<p>For hardware platform designers, the technology used for platform instrumentation is of direct interest because it is a design element for their systems. Some 1997 PC platforms were instrumented with the Desktop Management Interface (DMI), as described in the <i>Network PC System Design Guidelines</i> (attached as Appendix E in the References part of this guide).</p>

<p>In the PC 98 time frame, a new Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) component becomes a requirement when it is implemented in the Windows 98 and Windows NT 5.0 operating systems.</p>

<p>A related initiative, the Network PC (Net PC) design initiative, defines the reference design for the Net PC, a new member of the PC family that uses Intel Architecture or other microprocessor architectures and that runs the Windows 98 or Windows NT Workstation operating systems.</p>

<p>The Net PC is designed to reduce the cost of business computing by optimizing the design for users who do not require the flexibility and expandability of the traditional PC, and by allowing organizations to centrally manage their information technology. Although the types of business users will vary, the Net PC will be ideally suited for those involved in activities such as data entry, transaction processing, and intranet and Internet access.</p>
<p>
The current version of the defining specification, <i>Network PC System Design Guidelines,</i> can be downloaded from http://www.microsoft.com/hwdev/netpc.htm and http://developer.intel.com. Version 1.0b is included as Appendix E in the References part of this guide.</p>
<p>There are several high-level design goals for Net PC, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reduce TCO in the corporate environment by designing a PC that is completely optimized for lowest TCO—centrally controllable and managed, and completely capable of being enumerated and configured through software.</li>
<li>Work with the Zero Administration initiative for Windows. For more information on this initiative, see http://www.microsoft.com/management/.</li>
<li>Build on existing investments in Windows-based PC computing for the corporate environment.</li>
<li>Support the broadest range of applications.</li>
<li>Maximize corporate return on investment in the corporate computing infrastructure.</li></ul>

<p>Because the Net PC is a catalyst for improving TCO across all platforms, these guidelines are referred to in the PC 98 requirements as background information for Office PC 98. The following summarizes key Net PC design requirements:</p>
<ul>
<li>Completely deterministic hardware. All devices can be detected and configured by software—consequently, no ISA devices.<br><br></li>
<li>OnNow-enabled, including ACPI.<br><br></li>
<li>Remote operating system installation capabilities.<br><br></li>
<li>No end-user accessible internal expansion capabilities (“sealed case”).<br><br></li>
<li>Platform management instrumentation based on Windows hardware instrumentation for supporting operating systems such as Windows 98 and Windows NT 5.0 (based on DMI for operating systems that do not support Windows hardware instrumentation).</li>
</ul>
<p>
Notice that references to the Net PC requirements are made in this guide only to provide a context for certain Office PC 98 requirements. The actual Net PC requirements are defined in <i>Network PC System Design Guidelines, Version 1.0b</i> or higher.</p>
