<p>
This section summarizes the Entertainment PC&nbsp;98 requirements for graphics adapters and monitors. For complete information about the requirements summarized in this section, see the “Graphics Adapters” chapter in Part&nbsp;4 of&nbsp;this&nbsp;guide.</p>
<p>
<b>10. Graphics adapter uses AGP</h1>
<table border=1 cols=3 frame=void rules=rows>

<td width=30%><b>Required</b></td>

<p>
The graphics subsystem on an Entertainment PC&nbsp;98 system must not use PCI, ISA, or VESA local bus (VLB). For information about implementing AGP, see&nbsp;the “Graphics Adapters” chapter in Part&nbsp;4 of this guide.</p>
<p>
<b>Note:</b> Integrated graphics subsystems that do not use AGP but meet or exceed AGP performance levels are acceptable for Entertainment PC&nbsp;98.</p>
<p>
<b>11. Entertainment PC 98 graphics subsystem includes PC&nbsp;98 hardware acceleration for 2-D and 3-D graphics</h1>
<table border=1 cols=3 frame=void rules=rows>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=30%><b>Required</b></td>
<td width=30%></td>
<td width=30%></td>
</tr>
</table><br>
<p>
Windows and Windows&nbsp;NT operating systems provide application programming interfaces (APIs) that accelerate graphics display through direct manipulation of video display memory, hardware blters, hardware overlays, and page flipping. Hardware-acceleration features for 2-D and 3-D graphics must be implemented to&nbsp;improve overall graphics performance, as defined in the “Graphics Adapters” chapter in Part 4 of this guide.</p>
<p>
<b>12. Entertainment PC 98 graphics subsystem includes support for television output if the system doesn’t have a large-screen monitor</h1>
<table border=1 cols=3 frame=void rules=rows>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=30%><b>Recommended</b></td>
<td width=30%></td>
<td width=30%></td>
</tr>
</table><br>
<p>
Support for NTSC, PAL, or both types of television output is recommended, except for systems bundled with a large-screen super VGA (SVGA) monitor.</p>
<p>
For Entertainment PC 98, the ability to connect to a television is key to its ability to deliver more realistic television, movie, and game experiences, and to enable social computing activities. Television output integrated with the PC graphics adapter will deliver much higher image quality than external converters. As such, this feature optimizes the usability of an Entertainment PC system connected directly to a television in the family room and for desktop systems configured to transmit graphics and video to a television in another room.</p>
<p>
This capability must meet the PC&nbsp;98 requirements for television output for composite and S-Video connectors, parameter control, and hardware filtering and scaling capabilities as defined in the “Graphics Adapters” chapter in Part 4 of this&nbsp;guide.</p>
<p>
<b>13. Entertainment PC&nbsp;98 includes large-screen DDC2B color entertainment monitor</h1>
<table border=1 cols=3 frame=void rules=rows>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=30%><b>Recommended</b></td>
<td width=30%></td>
<td width=30%></td>
</tr>
</table><br>
<p>
A large-screen SVGA monitor that meets the <i>Display Data Channel Standard, Version 2.0</i>, Level B specification (DDC2B) is recommended for Entertainment PC&nbsp;98 systems designed for the family room. Games, movies, and other entertainment software experiences are greatly enhanced by display screens comparable to modern television sizes—for example, 27 inches and larger in the&nbsp;United States.</p>
<p>
An Entertainment PC&nbsp;98 system that includes a large-screen monitor must meet the requirements for entertainment monitors defined in the “Monitors” chapter in Part&nbsp;4 of this guide.</p>
<p>
In addition, in 1999, large-screen entertainment monitors will likely be required to comply with interconnectivity standards currently in development as part of the VESA PC Theater initiative.</p>
