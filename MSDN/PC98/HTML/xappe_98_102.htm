UUID Generation</h1>
<p>
UUIDs are generated according to the following algorithm:
<ul>
<li>
Determine the values for the UTC-based timestamp and clock sequence to be used in the UUID, as described above.<br><br></li>
<li>
For the purposes of this algorithm, consider the timestamp to be a 60-bit unsigned integer and the clock sequence to be a 14-bit unsigned integer. Sequentially number the bits in a field, starting from 0 (zero) for the least significant bit.<br><br></li>
<li>
Set the <i>time_low</i> field equal to the least significant 32-bits (bits numbered 0 to 31 inclusive) of the time stamp in the same order of significance.<br><br></li>
<li>
Set the <i>time_mid</i> field equal to the bits numbered 32 to 47 inclusive of the time stamp in the same order of significance.<br><br></li>
<li>
Set the 12 least significant bits (bits numbered 0 to 11 inclusive) of the<i> time_hi_and_version</i> field equal to the bits numbered 48 to 59 inclusive of the time stamp in the same order of significance.<br><br></li>
<li>
Set the 4 most significant bits (bits numbered 12 to 15 inclusive) of the <i>time_hi_and_version</i> field to the 4-bit version number corresponding to the UUID version being created, as shown in the table above.<br><br></li>
<li>
Set the <i>clock_seq_low</i> field to the 8 least significant bits (bits numbered 0 to 7 inclusive) of the <i>clock sequence</i> in the same order of significance.<br><br></li>
<li>
Set the 6 least significant bits (bits numbered 0 to 5 inclusive) of the <i>clock_seq_hi_and_reserved</i> field to the 6 most significant bits (bits numbered 8 to 13 inclusive) of the <i>clock sequence</i> in the same order of significance.<br><br></li>
<li>
Set the 2 most significant bits (bits numbered 6 and 7) of the <i>clock_seq_hi_and_reserved</i> to 0 and 1, respectively.<br><br></li>
<li>
Set the <i>node</i> field to the 48-bit IEEE address in the same order of significance as the address.</li>
</ul>
