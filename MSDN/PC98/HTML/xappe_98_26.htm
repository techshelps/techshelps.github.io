Relationship to the Standard DHCP Protocol</h1>
<p>
The initial phase of this protocol piggybacks on a subset of the DHCP protocol messages to enable the client to discover an installation server, that is, one that delivers executables for new system setup. The client <i>can</i> use the opportunity to obtain an IP address, which is the expected behavior, but it is not required. Clients that do obtain an IP address using DHCP or BOOTP must implement the protocol as specified in RFC 1541, even though not all possible messages and states of that protocol are described or mentioned in this protocol specification. The points at which this protocol piggybacks or otherwise interacts with the standard DHCP protocol are also noted.</p>
<p>
The second phase of this protocol takes place between the client and an installation server, and uses the DHCP message format simply as a convenient format for communication. This second phase of the protocol is otherwise unrelated to the standard DHCP services.</p>
