    <p><font size="5"><b>Microsoft Readies Visual FoxPro 3.0</b></font></p>
    <p><font size="3"><b>Development tool charts strategic path
    to Windows 95</b></font></p>
    <p><font size="2">March 10, 1995</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Microsoft recently announced details of
    Microsoft Visual FoxPro version 3.0&#151;an advanced
    relational database management and development tool&#151;for
    the Windows operating system.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Scheduled for release this spring, Visual
    FoxPro 3.0 will feature a 32-bit, object-oriented development
    environment for rapid application development with enhanced
    client-server capabilities.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">&quot;Visual FoxPro 3.0 is a major step
    forward for the Xbase community,&quot; said Roger Heinen,
    senior vice president of the developer division at Microsoft.
    &quot;It enables developers to take advantage of Microsoft's
    solutions platforms, including Windows 95 and Microsoft
    BackOffice, by seamlessly bringing their existing
    applications forward and then allowing them to integrate
    object-oriented and client-server functionality.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font size="3"><b>Visual creations</b></font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Although Visual FoxPro 3.0 lets developers
    code objects and classes from scratch at the command line, it
    also allows them to create classes visually.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">The Visual Class Designer PowerTool
    eliminates the need to learn a new development syntax for
    classes. With it, developers can create classes visually by
    dragging and dropping controls and attaching code to those
    controls.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Because the object model in Visual FoxPro
    3.0 fully supports inheritance, any changes to the parent
    class will automatically update every instance of the class
    wherever it is used. Developers can choose to use subclassing
    to protect properties from inheritance. It also fully
    supports encapsulation and polymorphism.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3"><b>Integration via OLE</b></font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Visual FoxPro 3.0 supports OLE services,
    helping developers build custom applications quickly. It
    includes OLE Automation, which enables it to control
    programmatically other business tools such as Microsoft
    Office business productivity applications.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Visual FoxPro 3.0 also supports the new
    32-bit OLE Controls architecture. This provides access to a
    wide range of additional features and functionality in
    hundreds of prebuilt components from third-party vendors.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">In addition, Visual FoxPro 3.0-based
    applications can contain OLE objects. Users, for example, can
    edit &quot;in place&quot; an embedded Microsoft Excel
    spreadsheet chart or Microsoft Word document without leaving
    the Visual FoxPro 3.0 application.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3"><b>Smoothing the way to client-server</b></font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Visual FoxPro 3.0 builds client-server
    connectivity tools into the product, allowing companies to
    create client-server applications that combine its
    functionality and graphical user interface with the speed,
    portability, data storage capability, and built-in security
    of an open database connectivity (ODBC) data source or
    server.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Visual FoxPro 3.0 will ship with the newest
    32-bit ODBC 2.0 drivers. These drivers deliver data to
    applications from multiple database and file formats,
    including Microsoft SQL Server version 4.2; Oracle6 and
    Oracle7; dBASE III and dBASE IV; Microsoft Access versions 1.<i>x</i>
    and 2.0; Paradox versions 3.<i>x</i> and 4.0; Microsoft Excel
    versions 3.0, 4.0, and 5.0; Btrieve; and formatted text
    files. ODBC database drivers are also available from 140
    additional vendors, providing ODBC access for more than 55
    database formats.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">This new version allows users to update
    back-end data directly from their desktops. By bringing
    snapshots of information from the back-end server, it allows
    users to manipulate the data locally. Only when additions or
    modifications to the data have been made does the user send a
    snapshot of the updated information back to the server,
    greatly reducing the network traffic in client-server
    environments.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">In a multiuser environment where users
    attempt to make changes to records on the remote server at
    the same time, Visual FoxPro 3.0 will automatically inform
    users of incremental changes to the data.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Another benefit is the ability to create
    parameterized views, which minimize the amount of data pulled
    down from the server. Users can, for example, specify a
    parameter such as &quot;only customers in the state of
    California&quot; and then update the live back-end data from
    the front end.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3"><b>Complete backward compatibility</b></font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Visual FoxPro 3.0 has a three-pronged
    migration strategy to protect companies' investments in Xbase
    solutions and training.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">First, it will run any legacy application
    that runs under FoxPro 2.6. In addition, developers can use a
    built-in converter to bring FoxPro 2.<i>x</i> screens and
    projects to the 3.0 format automatically. They can also move
    gradually to an object-oriented programming paradigm by
    modifying FoxPro 2.6 code on a property-specific basis,
    thereby learning the new object syntax from the pure coding
    perspective.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Visual FoxPro 3.0 is a fully 32-bit tool
    that will run on either 16-bit or 32-bit Windows operating
    systems&#151;including Windows 3.<i>x</i>, Windows for
    Workgroups, and Windows NT&#151;as well as the upcoming
    Windows 95 operating system. Similarly, solutions developed
    in Visual FoxPro 3.0 will by default be fully 32-bit, but
    will also run on 16-bit Windows-based systems.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3"><b>More information</b></font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Pricing information will be available when
    Visual FoxPro 3.0 is released this spring. Users who purchase
    FoxPro 2.6 for Windows between January 16, 1995 and the
    Visual FoxPro 3.0 shipment date will qualify for a no-cost
    upgrade.</font></p>
