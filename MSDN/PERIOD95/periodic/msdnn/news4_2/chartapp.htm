    <p><font size="5"><b>Windows NT Server, SQL Server Dish up a
    Business Solution for Restaurant Chain</b></font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Dianne Calvi</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">March 10, 1995</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">In the volatile restaurant business,
    keeping customers satisfied is a formidable challenge. But it
    is critical to success. For more than 30 years, Chart House
    Enterprises, Inc., has upheld a reputation for excellence at
    its upscale restaurants. The result: Chart House operates 65
    restaurants across seven time zones and reports annual sales
    of $150 million.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">The management of the Solana Beach,
    California-based company attributes much of its success to
    loyal customers. To reward their patronage, Chart House
    launched the Aloha Club Frequent Dining Program in October
    1993.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Because the program was experimental, Chart
    House turned to an outside fulfillment house for processing
    membership applications and dining transactions. Every day,
    all 65 restaurants had to overnight forms to the fulfillment
    house by courier. The data was then entered manually from the
    hard-copy forms into a minicomputer.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">From the start, customer-service problems
    plagued the project. Membership packets took 12 weeks to
    arrive, applications were lost, and dining transactions were
    improperly credited because of illegible forms. Worse,
    customer-service representatives answering Chart House's
    toll-free number had no access to customer data, which
    resided on the fulfillment house's minicomputer. To respond
    to a customer inquiry, they had to fax a request to the
    fulfillment house and wait&#151;often two or three
    days&#151;for a response. Recalled John Townsend, director of
    information services for Chart House, &quot;We did a
    disservice to customers, probably driving them away from the
    restaurant rather than encouraging them to come in more
    often.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font size="3"><b>Redesign, re-engineer</b></font></p>
    <p><font size="2">The Aloha Club problems put Chart House at
    risk of losing its biggest competitive advantage: excellent
    personalized customer service. So the firm decided in March
    1994 to turn to WinResources Computing, Inc., a San
    Diego-based Microsoft Solution Provider, to redesign the
    Aloha Club completely. &quot;Time was critical,&quot; said
    Bob Karp, president of WinResources. &quot;Chart House
    management realized that the success of the program would be
    jeopardized if we didn't move quickly, because customer
    satisfaction with the program was very low.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">In less than a month, WinResources
    completed the requirements analysis and suggested a complete
    redesign of the system. It identified four key objectives:
    improve access to the data; develop a system that could
    easily integrate with future accounting and point-of-sales
    applications; create an integrated reporting and analysis
    process; and minimize training costs.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Because Chart House had already installed
    486/66 computers running Microsoft Office Professional and a
    Visual Basic-based menu application at the restaurants,
    WinResources suggested a Windows NT-based client-server
    solution.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">The Windows NT Server operating system
    offered 32-bit processing for speed and capacity, along with
    the data security, reliability, and administrative features
    found on many high-end minicomputers. It also offered the
    same Windows-based APIs on both the client and server, which
    meant that Chart House developers wouldn't have to learn two
    sets of APIs to develop applications. All this would help
    Chart House keep development, training, and administration
    time to a minimum.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3"><b>SQL Server steps up to the plate</b></font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Chart House then evaluated Microsoft SQL
    Server for membership transaction processing. Because of the
    scalability of SQL Server and the relatively low cost of the
    hardware and software, Chart House decided to get SQL Server
    and a Compaq ProLiant Dual Pentium 90-MHz computer with 128
    megabytes (MB) of memory and seven 1-gigabyte hard disks to
    run the Aloha Club database. The 300-MB Aloha Club database
    contains 225,000 member records and more than 500,000 dining
    transactions.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">At the time of the Aloha Club system
    evaluation, Chart House was also making plans to migrate all
    the company's data from the Honeywell Bull minicomputer to a
    central server by the end of 1995.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">To accommodate the company's
    mission-critical applications, Chart House needed a powerful
    and secure relational database management system. &quot;With
    symmetric multiprocessing support and 32-bit capacity and
    performance, Microsoft SQL Server provided us with the right
    combination of power and flexibility,&quot; said Townsend.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">By the end of 1995, Chart House expects to
    migrate all the company's accounting and financial data from
    the Honeywell system to SQL Server. Townsend expects no
    degradation in server performance. &quot;By taking the
    approach we did, we didn't have to make a huge investment up
    front. It's much easier to invest in a $15,000 server than a
    quarter-million-dollar minicomputer,&quot; he said.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3"><b>Taking advantage of reusable components</b></font></p>
    <p><font size="2">After Chart House finalized the decision to
    build the back end on SQL Server, WinResources chose to
    develop with the Visual Basic programming system and
    Microsoft Access. &quot;From the beginning, Chart House
    realized that having a development tools strategy is very
    important. It wanted to leverage what it already knew, and it
    wanted to develop applications across the corporation using a
    standard set of tools. It also wanted to take advantage of
    reusable components, including VBX controls and, in the
    future, OLE Controls,&quot; said Karp.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Assigning two full-time developers and one
    part-timer to the project in April 1994, WinResources
    identified five major development modules of the new system:
    new member application entry; restaurant dining transaction
    entry; posting and exceptions reporting; executive
    information system; and the customer service desk.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2"><b><img src="Image356.gif" width="488"
    height="516"></b></font></p>
    <p><font size="2"><b>The Frequent Diner Management System.</b></font></p>
    <p><font size="2">The first development module entailed
    distributing new member application entry from its central
    location to the individual restaurants. Instead of sending
    membership applications to a single location for data entry,
    staff at each restaurant now enter the information daily into
    a local Microsoft Access database. To input the data, the
    restaurant staff uses a membership application developed in
    Visual Basic. The application data is then extracted from the
    Microsoft Access database into a text file, sent by modem to
    a telecommunications server at Chart House headquarters, and
    posted to the SQL Server database. Before the data is
    processed, Microsoft SQL Server performs exception reporting
    and error checking.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">The new procedure eliminated courier costs,
    reduced the time needed to enter member information, and
    required almost no training. &quot;The restaurants were
    already using our Visual Basic menu application, so we were
    able to leverage what they already knew. That is one of the
    nice things about Microsoft technology,&quot; noted Karp.
    &quot;We were able to develop an application that looked and
    acted a lot like the other applications they had on the
    desktop, thus minimizing training.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">To improve the data reliability,
    magnetic-strip readers now enter dining transactions
    electronically at the restaurant. Each member has an Aloha
    Club card that is put through the reader at the time of
    purchase. Dining transaction data is batch uploaded nightly
    to a telecommunications server at headquarters before being
    posted to the SQL Server database. Chart House has virtually
    eliminated dining transaction errors by using stored
    procedures to enforce business rules built into the database.
    For example, the data is checked for transactions under $10,
    which do not qualify for Aloha Club.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2"><i><img src="Image357.gif" width="525"
    height="381"></i></font></p>
    <p><font size="2"><b>In addition to Veriphone automatic
    entry, Aloha Club dining credits and other transactions such
    as gift certificates can be independently posted by
    customer-service reps.</b></font></p>
    <p><font size="2">The third module of the system&#151;a
    Visual Basic posting routine&#151;was developed for use on
    both membership and dining transaction data. Data from the
    telecommunications server is posted to the SQL Server
    database; during this posting, SQL Server performs exception
    reporting. In many database systems, exceptions are simply
    written to a log. By taking advantage of SQL Server's
    mail-enabled extended stored procedures, WinResources could
    integrate the exception-reporting system with electronic
    mail. As Karp explained, &quot;We developed a Visual Basic
    program that finds transactions of closed accounts,
    automatically creates a Word customer letter using OLE
    Automation, merges the account data from the SQL Server
    database into the letter using mail merge, and automatically
    sends the letter via Microsoft Mail to the administrator. The
    letter notifying the customer of his closed account is then
    immediately sent out. All this with only a few lines of
    Visual Basic and five lines of WordBasic.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font size="2"><img src="Image358.gif" width="525"
    height="404"></font></p>
    <p><font size="2"><b>From this screen, customer-service reps
    can view membership information and respond to members'
    questions.</b></font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Management reporting was another critical
    component of the new system. Chart House management wanted to
    track the activity of the program and perform financial
    analyses. To develop the activity reports, WinResources used
    Microsoft Access. Because users at Chart House were already
    familiar with Microsoft Access, they can now modify the
    existing reports and develop new reports on their own.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">To perform the financial analyses,
    WinResources developed an executive information system in
    Visual Basic for Applications using Microsoft Excel
    PivotTable technology, which enables Chart House management
    to bring in the data from the SQL Server database and examine
    it from a &quot;bottom-line&quot; perspective. &quot;With the
    new EIS system, our executives can now effectively assess the
    financial performance of the Aloha Club Program,&quot;
    Townsend said.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">To improve Aloha Club member satisfaction,
    customer service was completely redesigned. After defining
    the new parameters, developers created a
    &quot;customer-service desktop&quot; in Visual Basic. Using
    standard data-aware controls included with the database
    engine in Visual Basic, they readily created an easy-to-use
    front end to the SQL Server database. The new interface
    allows customer-service representatives to get the data they
    need in a matter of seconds and respond immediately to member
    inquiries.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">As soon as development was completed,
    WinResources began the conversion from the minicomputer at
    the fulfillment house to the in-house SQL Server. According
    to Townsend, SQL Server's administration tools made the
    migration relatively painless. The conversion of the 225,000
    membership records to the SQL Server database was
    accomplished in just two days.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3"><b>Aloha Club increases sales</b></font></p>
    <p><font size="2">The new Aloha Club system was fully
    deployed by early July 1994, two months ahead of schedule;
    the time needed to deliver membership packets has decreased
    by 70 percent; and members get answers to their inquires in a
    few seconds rather than a few days. Member dining
    transactions are accurate and timely. As a result, members
    have shown their satisfaction by returning to the restaurant
    more often. &quot;Using the Microsoft Excel incremental sales
    PivotTable, we have tracked an eight percent increase in
    sales thanks to the Aloha Club,&quot; said Townsend.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Chart House is also saving money. The
    fulfillment house fees, courier and fax bills, and costs of
    correcting data-entry mistakes added up to a hefty sum.
    Before moving the Aloha Club program in-house, Chart House
    was spending more than $750,000 a year to maintain the
    program. The entire new system, including hardware, was
    developed in less than four months for a cost of $170,000.
    Maintenance costs are now minimal, and Chart House expects to
    save approximately $400,000 a year.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Aloha Club is just the beginning for Chart
    House; technology will play an increasingly important role in
    the way the company does business. Later this year, Chart
    House plans to deploy a Windows-based point-of-sale system
    from Hospitality Systems, and has already installed it in 16
    restaurants. By year's end, the firm hopes to move all its
    accounting data from the Honeywell Bull system to SQL Server.
    &quot;Our strategic decision to establish the Microsoft
    family of development tools as our corporate standard
    continues to fulfill our needs to rapidly deploy scalable,
    competitive applications,&quot; Townsend said.</font></p>
