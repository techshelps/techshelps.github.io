    <p><font size="5"><b>Tap into the Developer Network
    CompuServe Forum</b></font></p>
    <p><font size="2">March 10, 1995</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">What happens in the Microsoft Developer
    Network forum (GO MSDN) on CompuServe?</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Lots! For example, you can jump into the
    Peer Help/Chat Messages section to post questions or answer
    inquiries from other developers. In Library 1, &quot;New
    Uploads,&quot; you'll find things that didn't make the last
    issue of the Development Library or Platform, such as the
    international terminology glossaries. You can also find the
    MSDN FAQ, a compilation of answers to the most frequently
    asked questions we receive.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">We also sometimes post &quot;flashes&quot;
    highlighting items of importance to developers. If there is a
    flash, you'll automatically get it upon entering the MSDN
    forum. We also use the CompuServe forum to obtain your
    feedback and responses to surveys, particularly when we face
    hard decisions. For example, your input was invaluable in
    figuring out how&#151;or even if&#151;we should go to two CDs
    for the Development Library. When we post surveys, you are
    notified via flashes. You can also talk to us via the MSDN
    forum. Let us know if we're doing well or abysmally, and how
    we can improve. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2">For more information on CompuServe within
    the United States, call (800) 524-3388 and ask for
    representative 230. Outside the United States, call (+1)
    (614) 529-1340 and ask for representative 230.</font></p>
