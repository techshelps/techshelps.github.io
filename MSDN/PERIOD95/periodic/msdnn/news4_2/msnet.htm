    <p><font size="5"><b>Why The Microsoft Network?</b></font></p>
    <p><font size="3"><b>Easier access and richer content to open
    online world to users, businesses</b></font></p>
    <p><font size="2">John Williams<br>
    Microsoft Online Services Group</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">March 10, 1995</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Rapid, efficient information exchange,
    regardless of time or place, is increasingly central to the
    lives of a growing number of people. The integration of
    electronic mail and local area network-based computing has
    become integral to how a large part of our society
    functions&#151;so much so that a personal e-mail delivered
    from across the globe, or the ability to access a file from
    someone else's PC in another building, is often taken for
    granted.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Our reliance on this technology suggests
    how every computer user would benefit, personally and
    professionally, by having this degree of access.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">The recent explosion of interest in the
    Internet and commercial online services shows that an
    enormous number of people agree. Internet usage has tripled,
    and commercial service memberships more than doubled, in the
    past two years. New providers and offerings appear almost
    daily.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Yet despite all the hype, more than 90
    percent of the PC-installed base remains &quot;unwired.&quot;
    Even if the installed base of PCs didn't grow, the current 20
    percent annual growth rate in new online users would result
    in less than 60 percent penetration in 10 years. Microsoft
    researched and built The Microsoft Network (MSN) to
    accelerate the realization of this great opportunity.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2"><img src="Image366.gif" width="280"
    height="171"></font></p>
    <p><font size="3"><b>Getting connected</b></font></p>
    <p><font size="2">The concept of &quot;wiring&quot; together
    the tens of millions of PCs around the world is not new. The
    Internet, local bulletin-board systems,</font><font
    color="#FF0000" size="2"> </font><font size="2">and several
    broadly available commercial online services have been around
    for more than a decade.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">So, Microsoft's first step was to
    understand the roadblocks to broader market adoption of
    online services. After two years of research, what the
    company discovered is a series of fundamental
    &quot;disconnects&quot; between what current online
    technology has to offer and what end users and content
    providers want.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">As with any new medium, online services
    will gain widespread adoption only if they provide uniquely
    rich and valuable solutions to customer needs, offered in a
    more compelling and accessible way than the alternatives.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Online service providers such as MSN have
    two customer bases to which this equation applies: end- user
    members and independent content providers.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">End users want this technology to be easier
    to access and use. They need more predictable pricing, and
    the ability to buy what they really need or want. They also
    need richer, deeper content that is presented in a more
    robust, compelling manner.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">The content and information providers (IPs)
    need a business model that caters to a wide variety of
    different businesses and that promises long-term
    profitability. IPs need to extend brand identities and
    current assets. They need better tools and information for
    managing their businesses. And they need the tools and
    infrastructure to produce and present their offerings in an
    easily accessible, interesting way.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3"><b>The Microsoft Network strategy</b></font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Together, the existing online technology
    and its business model hinder widespread adoption by not
    meeting the needs of either of these customer communities.
    MSN attempts to answer these needs, and thus provide an
    environment that expands the overall online services market.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">The MSN strategy revolves around four
    initiatives driven by the needs of its two customer
    communities:</font></p>
    <p><font size="3"><b>1. Viable, long-term business
    environment</b></font></p>
    <p><font size="2">MSN's viability rests on the success of
    content providers to reach and motivate customers. In a
    nutshell, if they don't make money, MSN won't make money.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Investment by content providers in online
    technology is the only way the content that reaches end users
    will improve. To encourage this, MSN has adopted a new,
    flexible-platform business model that empowers and rewards
    independent content and service providers.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Existing online services inhibit the way
    providers can present their information and services, and
    limit their profits, often to a small share of a shrinking
    revenue model based on customer online connection-time
    charges.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">MSN provides a new business environment
    that puts revenue control entirely in the hands of IPs. This
    means not only control over variable revenue and pricing
    models&#151;such as subscriptions, online transactions,
    advertising subsidies, and ticketed events&#151;but also
    retaining the majority of the revenues generated by their
    content and services.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3"><b>2. Easy, inexpensive access</b></font></p>
    <p><font size="2">The need to make technology easier to use
    is magnified in the arena of online technology, where
    connectivity to and navigation of vast amounts of data are
    necessary. To that end, access to MSN is a feature of Windows
    95.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">By extending the feature set and graphical
    interface of Windows 95, MSN provides a familiar environment
    that facilitates exploration and interaction in the online
    world. In all respects, MSN looks, acts, walks, and talks
    like Windows 95.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">For example, services on MSN can be browsed
    using the Explorer in Windows 95 or from an icon-based
    container view. Such actions as downloading files are simple
    drag-and-drop copy operations. Shortcuts enable personalized
    and efficient navigation. E-mail and rich-text content
    documents are managed through the Microsoft Exchange and
    WordPad applications built into Windows 95. And the same
    familiar user interface carries through all core
    communication functionality.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">MSN also offers affordable access. By
    adopting a business model that emphasizes member and content
    activity rather than connect time, Microsoft plans to deliver
    local phone-call access worldwide at the lowest possible
    price.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3"><b>3. A more compelling online experience</b></font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Interaction is the lifeblood of online
    services. How well the environment is produced, and the
    quality of content depth and presentation, drive a service's
    ability to attract and retain members.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">MSN supports and promotes personalized
    discovery and investment for members and content providers
    alike. A new generation of technology and capabilities lets
    both groups shape dynamic communities around their own
    interests, products, and services. Experienced, knowledgeable
    forum managers will facilitate the expansion and diversity of
    these communities worldwide.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">As with the revenue model, control over
    brand, product, and business extension lies with the content
    provider. But MSN will facilitate a higher quality of content
    and services by providing a new generation of
    content-publishing tools specifically designed to deliver
    personalized multimedia online content.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3"><b>4. World-class communication</b></font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Access to communication abilities that
    transcend the traditional boundaries of time, cost,
    resources, and geography is one of the primary customer needs
    MSN was designed to deliver.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">To meet customer ease-of-use requirements,
    MSN extends the Windows 95 communication environment through
    consistent user interface, OLE support, drag-and-drop
    management, Explorer navigation, and rich-text formatting.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">By fully utilizing the Microsoft Exchange
    e-mail client in Windows 95 and extending this functionality
    to bulletin board, file library, and &quot;chat&quot;
    services, MSN offers easy-to-use communication. It was
    designed from the ground up to accommodate access to the
    network from anywhere in the world&#151;and exchange of
    information between members and content providers anywhere in
    the world.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3"><b>Bringing it together</b></font></p>
    <p><font size="2">MSN represents an opportunity to combine
    the assets, skills, and tools of the Windows environment with
    the online world.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">The benefits of building MSN on Windows 95
    (client) and Windows NT (server) extend beyond ease-of-use
    and feature-set gains. The long-term potential for the online
    medium will, like Windows, unveil itself only through the
    constant innovation encouraged by an open environment.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">From linking desktop applications to online
    components with Shortcuts, to advanced OLE Automation, to
    custom messaging API solutions, to existing and new standards
    that drive your current Windows development efforts, MSN is
    designed to offer new business opportunities. All of this
    will be integrated and supported through Microsoft
    developer-service organizations and events beginning this
    spring.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Because developers will be a crucial part
    of making this happen, the<i> Developer Network News </i>plans
    in future issues to take a closer look at business and
    informational opportunities for developers on MSN, as well as
    to provide more details on MSN's tools and technologies.</font></p>
