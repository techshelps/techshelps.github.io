    <p><font size="5"><b>Visual C++ 2.1: New Classes, Samples,
    Drivers, and More</b></font></p>
    <p><font size="3"><b>First CD subscription release brings
    latest technology</b></font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Jonathan Kagle</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">March 10, 1995</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">What's new with the Microsoft Visual C++
    development system? The big news is the availability of
    Visual C++ version 2.1, the first release of Visual C++ 2.0
    Subscription Edition for Intel platforms.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Visual C++ 2.1 gives new functionality to
    the Microsoft Foundation Class Library (MFC) for both the
    32-bit and 16-bit versions. The new release also adds
    features to the OLE Control Developer's Kit (CDK), including
    the ability to use MFC database classes in OLE Controls. It
    also includes new samples, documentation, and, of course, bug
    fixes.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3"><b>New features</b></font></p>
    <p><font size="2">The following features have been added to
    the editors and wizards in this version of 32-bit Visual C++:</font></p>
    <blockquote>
        <p><font size="2">&#149; Dialog editor support for new
        Windows common controls. You can add spin button, tab,
        tree view, and other common controls to dialog boxes in
        your Windows 95-based applications. If you want to add
        Windows common controls to your application, you must be
        running under the same operating system on which the
        target application will run. For example, you can develop
        an application under Windows NT 3.5 that will run on
        Windows 95, but you cannot include Windows common
        controls. (This will change shortly with the release of
        Windows NT version 3.51.)</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">&#149; ClassWizard support for new
        Windows common controls. You can map control notification
        messages to MFC handler functions, and add classes
        derived from Windows common control classes.
        ClassWizard's improved layout makes these tasks easier.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">&#149; AppWizard support for simple
        MAPI (the Windows messaging API) and Windows Sockets.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">&#149; Complete AppWizard support for
        OLE Automation in a dynamic-link library (DLL).</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">&#149; AppWizard support for creating a
        USRDLL project. AppWizard can now provide you with a
        skeleton <b>CWinApp</b>-derived object, rather than a <b>DllMain</b>
        function, as it does when creating an MFC extension DLL.</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font size="3"><b>New features in 32-bit MFC</b></font></p>
    <p><font size="2">The following features have been added to
    MFC in the 32-bit product:</font></p>
    <blockquote>
        <p><font size="2">&#149; New Windows common control
        classes. Currently you can use these controls only in
        applications that will run under Windows 95. They will
        also be supported by future versions of Windows NT
        (starting with Windows NT 3.51) and Win32s.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">&#149; Support for simple MAPI in <b>CDocument</b>
        and <b>COleDocument</b> classes.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">&#149; Windows Sockets classes for
        network programming (<b>CAsyncSocket</b>, <b>CSocket</b>,
        and <b>CSocketFile</b>).</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">&#149; New 32-bit open database
        connectivity (ODBC) drivers for use with the MFC database
        classes (see the list of drivers, below).</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font size="3"><b>Updated 16-bit version</b></font></p>
    <p><font size="2">This release also contains 16-bit Visual
    C++ version 1.52, an update from version 1.51, which shipped
    with Visual C++ 2.0. Visual C++ 1.52 runs on Windows version
    3.1 or later and Windows NT version 3.5, and includes the
    16-bit MFC version 2.52.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Besides OLE and database classes, this
    version includes classes for OLE control development and a
    number of new MFC 2.52 classes ported from the 32-bit
    product.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Like the 32-bit product, new features in
    MFC 2.52 include support for simple MAPI in <b>CDocument</b>
    and <b>COleDocument</b> classes; Windows Sockets classes for
    network programming; and new 16-bit ODBC drivers for use with
    the MFC database classes (see the list of drivers, below).</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">In addition, the 16-bit version now
    includes <b>CPropertySheet</b> and <b>CPropertyPage</b>, MFC
    classes that support &quot;tabbed dialog
    boxes&quot;&#151;known as &quot;property sheets&quot; in MFC.
    Previously, these were available only in 32-bit Visual C++
    2.0.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3"><b>New to the OLE Control Developer's Kit</b></font></p>
    <p><font size="2">The following features have been added to
    the CDK:</font></p>
    <blockquote>
        <p><font size="2">&#149; Support for using the MFC
        database classes in OLE Controls. This allows you to
        create data-access controls using <b>CDatabase</b> and <b>CRecordset</b>
        classes. The database support also includes a sample
        program, called DB, that illustrates the use of the MFC
        ODBC database classes in an OLE control.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">&#149; OLE Controls that work under
        Win32s.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">&#149; Performance improvements,
        particularly in the areas of control creation and
        property access.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">&#149; Support for &quot;grab
        handles&quot; when controls are active.</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font size="3"><b>MFC Migration Kit</b></font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Many developers have existing applications
    for Windows written in C. To help these developers migrate
    their applications to C++, Visual C++ 2.1 includes the MFC
    Migration Kit. The kit includes:</font></p>
    <blockquote>
        <p><font size="2">&#149; An extensive <i>MFC Migration
        Guide</i>, a Help file that takes you through the
        migration process with both 16-bit and 32-bit sample
        applications using MFC.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">&#149; A migration tool (in 16-bit and
        32-bit versions) that scans your C-language source code
        and suggests things you should do to migrate the code to
        MFC.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">&#149; Both 16-bit and 32-bit sample
        applications&#151;before migration, in C, and after
        migration, in C++.</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font size="2">The migration tool can also help you port
    16-bit applications to 32-bit, with or without MFC. The <i>MFC
    Migration Guide</i> explains where that port fits into your
    migration strategy.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">The Visual C++ subscription program is
    designed to distribute all these improvements quickly and
    efficiently. But what if you can't buy the subscription
    edition because you live outside the U.S. or Canada? The
    Visual C++ subscription is now being launched in Western
    Europe. Outside Europe and North America, the CD will be
    available as a stand-alone upgrade through your local
    subsidiary. (See below, &quot;Where's my Visual C++ 2.1
    CD?&quot;)</font></p>
    <blockquote>
        <p><font size="2"><b>Note:</b> The documentation for
        Visual C++ 2.1 is scheduled to be included in the April
        release of the Developer Network Development Library.</font></p>

    <p><font size="2">You wait by the mailbox day after day, but
    still your Visual C++ 2.1 CD doesn't arrive. What's the
    problem? There are several possibilities:</font></p>
    <blockquote>
        <p><font size="2">&#149; <i>You have not activated your
        subscription</i>. Despite rumors to the contrary,
        Microsoft ESP (extra-sensory perception) for Windows is
        not yet bug-free, so you must send in the activation card
        that came in the box (it's cleverly hidden next to the
        MFC hierarchy chart). If you purchased your Visual C++
        2.0 subscription from your local reseller but have not
        activated it, please call (800) 719-5577 or send in your
        subscription activation card. If you lost the activation
        card, call (800) 719-7577 and have your product ID number
        ready.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">&#149; <i>You live outside the United
        States or Canada.</i> In European countries, where you
        can purchase the Microsoft Developer Network, make sure
        that your copy of Visual C++ 2.0 is registered, because
        you should receive a mailing that describes how to
        upgrade to the subscription. If you are in a hurry, you
        can phone the Developer Network Subscription Centre
        direct (see &quot;Right Numbers&quot; in the Columns
        section of this online edition of <i>Developer Network
        News</i>) to upgrade to the Visual C++ subscription. The
        subscription is not yet available outside North America
        and Europe, but a stand-alone version 2.1 should be
        available from your local subsidiary (part number
        048-056-040A).</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">&#149; <i>You bought the
        non-subscription edition.</i> If you live in the U.S. or
        Canada, you can upgrade to the Visual C++ subscription by
        sending in the upgrade card in the box. If you've lost
        the card, call Microsoft at (800) 719-5577.</font></p>
