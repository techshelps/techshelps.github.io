    <p><font size="5"><b>Microsoft Hatches 'Blackbird'</b></font></p>
    <p><font size="3"><b>Tools for building new interactive
    multimedia apps</b></font></p>
    <p><font size="2">May 9, 1995</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Microsoft has outlined new tools to support
    independent content providers (ICPs) for The Microsoft
    Network (MSN), Microsoft's planned online service, including
    a sophisticated design environment for online applications,
    code-named &quot;Blackbird.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">These tools will allow content providers to
    design, manage, and deliver a new generation of interactive
    multimedia applications and services. The tools include the
    Blackbird design environment, tools for creating, updating,
    and managing forums, and a software development kit (SDK)
    containing direct APIs to MSN services. The tools will be
    available to companies that have an established
    independent-content-provider relationship with MSN.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">&quot;With The Microsoft Network tools, we
    think ICPs will be able to create content never before seen
    in the online world, and they will be able to develop that
    content at reasonable production costs,&quot; said Russ
    Siegelman, general manager of the Online Services Group at
    Microsoft. &quot;We feel development of a broad range of
    content and services will attract new online users and expand
    the online market.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Blackbird features a one-button publishing
    environment in which a user can automatically manage dynamic
    content, and a customizable viewer that takes full advantage
    of the capabilities of Windows 95. Content providers can use
    Blackbird to build online publications, consumer-oriented
    applications, business-to-business services, interactive
    advertising, electronic-commerce applications, and even
    interactive games for MSN.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Microsoft is also providing
    forum-management tools that allow content providers to
    control fully their online forums, update information, manage
    user access, handle transactions, and create forums such as
    bulletin boards, chat rooms, and file-download areas. These
    tools include a bulk upload tool and e-forms, and were first
    distributed in March at a conference of forum managers.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Microsoft will also make available
    additional development tools for MSN. The SDK provides access
    to chat, e-mail, and other APIs for MSN. With these APIs,
    developers can create their own client-server applications or
    use their own multimedia development tools for the MSN
    platform. A client-server version of the Microsoft MediaView
    multimedia development tool will also be available for MSN
    ICPs.</font></p>
