    online</b></font></p>

    <p><font size="2">May 9, 1995</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">It was a perfect match. The first time we
    saw The Microsoft Network (MSN), the new online service
    included with Windows 95, we knew it offered an excellent
    opportunity to expand and complement our existing CD-ROM and
    printed publications from the Developer Network.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">MSN is sleek. It is elegant. It is nimble.
    One click from the Windows 95 shell gives you immediate
    access to a whole set of services&#151;chat areas, bulletin
    boards, worldwide e-mail exchange, and, most importantly, a
    rich online-publishing environment&#151;the perfect place, we
    thought, to communicate with developers and to publish
    up-to-date technical information. The Developer Network thus
    became one of the first content providers on MSN&#151;the
    proud owner of the new Developer Network forum.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2"><img src="Image369.gif" width="641"
    height="369"></font></p>
    <p><font size="2"><b>To access our new area on MSN, click the
    Microsoft Developer Network icon located in
    Categories/Computers &amp; Software/Software/Microsoft.
    Double-click the icons in the window to open the titles and
    services listed.</b></font></p>
    <p><font size="3"><b>Building on past online experience</b></font></p>
    <p><font size="2">As most of you know, this is not our first
    foray into the online arena. In addition to our dedicated
    CompuServe forum (GO MSDN) and share on the Microsoft ftp
    server (ftp://ftp.microsoft.com/developr/msdn), we recently
    launched the Developer Network OffRamp on the World Wide Web
    (http://www.microsoft.com, and click on Developer Network
    OffRamp). Now the Developer Network forum on MSN gives us the
    opportunity to expand our online presence and to deliver
    information and news to a larger number of developers.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Over the last few months, we've started
    working with other groups at Microsoft to populate the
    Developer Network forum with useful information and services
    for our members and for other developers. We've defined seven
    major sections, which provide the information listed below.
    (These sections are currently in the prototype stage and
    contain only a few articles.)</font></p>
    <p><font size="2"><b>News.</b> An online version of <i>Microsoft
    Developer Network News</i>. However, this section provides
    much more than a sampling of news, features, and columns from
    the printed version of the newspaper. Posting on MSN allows
    us to bypass the space and scheduling restrictions of
    print-based media, and gives us the opportunity to post
    updates, news, and event notifications on a weekly, daily,
    even hourly basis.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2"><b>Products.</b> Data sheets,
    specifications, demos, and related information on Microsoft
    development products.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2"><b>Solutions.</b> In-depth technical
    information and selected case studies that demonstrate how to
    build solutions with Microsoft tools and technologies.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2"><b>Technology &amp; Strategy.</b> Strategic
    overview of Microsoft client-server and database technologies
    for enterprise-wide application development.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2"><b>Resources.</b> Overview of online
    services, publications, and other resources available to
    developers who write applications for the Windows and Windows
    NT operating systems.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2"><b>Library Sampler.</b> Selections from the
    current issue of the Development Library.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2"><b>Platform Overview.</b> Introduction to
    the Development Platform CD-ROM, and a complete listing of
    operating systems, SDKs, and toolkits on the latest version
    of the Platform.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2"><img src="Image370.gif" width="618"
    height="381"></font></p>
    <p><font size="2"><b>In the Library Sampler area, we post
    selections from the Development Library along with new
    articles and updates. Click a title from the left pane to
    view an article. Click the button(s) in the article to
    download sample code from a bulletin board.</b></font></p>
    <p><font size="2">You can also use the <b>Chat</b> and <b>Member-to-Member</b>
    BBS sections to share information with other developers, <b>Developer
    Kiosk</b> to see an introduction to the Developer Network
    forum, and <b>Feedback</b> to send us your comments and
    suggestions.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3"><b>First the hors d'oeuvres, later the
    entrée</b></font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Please consider this first attempt a
    prototype, and pardon the meager diet currently posted. We
    will be fleshing out and refining the Developer Network forum
    in the coming months.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Before we take the next step, though, we
    need your help: If you have a copy of the Windows 95
    pre-release, please take a look at the Developer Network
    forum and tell us what you think. Are we on the right track?
    Are we giving you the information you need?</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Also, if you're interested in creating
    content for MSN, you may be pleased to learn that a new
    online publishing environment is currently in the works (see
    &quot;Microsoft Hatches 'Blackbird'&quot;).</font></p>
