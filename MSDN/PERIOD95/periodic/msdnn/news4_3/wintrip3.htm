    <p><font size="3"><b>Getting prepared for the 32-bit
    application development trip</b></font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Tammy Steele</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">May 9, 1995</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">The pre-release version of Windows 95 has
    now shipped to Level 2 members of the Developer Network.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">It comes with the merged Win32 Software
    Development Kit (SDK) for developing applications for Windows
    95 and Windows NT. The pre-release Win32 SDK upgrades the
    current Win32 SDK, allowing developers to write to a single
    API and target multiple software and hardware platforms.
    Developers writing to the Win32 API can target Windows NT,
    Win32s, and Windows 95, as well as the Apple Macintosh
    platform (with the Microsoft Visual C++ 2.0 Cross-Development
    Edition for Macintosh).</font></p>
    <p><font size="3"><b>The Windows 95 itinerary</b></font></p>
    <p><font size="2">So, your bags are packed and you're ready
    to go. Because you've been reading about your trip for so
    long, maybe it would be a good idea to review the travel
    plans.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">First stop is beautiful downtown Win32.
    Next you'll visit the lovely OLE mass-transit system, with a
    brief encounter in Long Filename support and a stop at the
    Universal Naming Conventions studio tour. From there you'll
    move on to Simple Messaging API (MAPI) and finish with a spot
    of refreshment at the Windows NT 3.51 Toolbar and Grill.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">As for guide books, let's start with the
    panoramic overview of your trip down Windows 95 Development
    Row (or would that be Chicago Memory Lane?), courtesy of back
    issues of <i>Developer Network News,</i> available in the
    Developer Network Development Library:</font></p>
    <blockquote>
        <p><font size="2">&#149; &quot;Windows 95 controls on
        Windows NT&quot; by Tammy Steele, March/April 1995 (this
        article is also available in this online edition of the
        newspaper under &quot;Features&quot;).</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">&#149; &quot;Getting your app ready for
        Chicago&quot; by Robert Hess, September 1994</font></p>

    <p><font size="2">(Although it's not available on the Library
    CD, members who've kept hard copies of back issues can also
    read &quot;The Win32 story&quot; by Tammy Steele, September
    1993.)</font></p>
    <p><font size="3"><b>Go to the library</b></font></p>
    <p><font size="2">These articles lay the groundwork for the
    development trip. Next, let's get out the binoculars and take
    a closer look at some of the technical article landmarks,
    also courtesy of the Developer Network Development Library:</font></p>

    <p><font size="2">But wait! There's more! In the <i>Microsoft
    Systems Journal</i> section of the Development Library,
    you'll find 19&#151;count 'em&#151;articles on Windows 95.
    The Development Library also contains dozens of additional
    technical articles and newspaper articles to help you with
    your development. Simply search on &quot;Windows 95&quot; or
    &quot;Chicago&quot; and you'll be ready.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">You'll take home more than memories from
    this trip. You'll have a great Win32-based application that
    exploits the capabilities of Windows 95 and Windows NT 3.51,
    and a Windows 95 logo to boot.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Buen viaje!</font></p>
