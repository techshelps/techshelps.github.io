    <p><font size="5"><b>Help Is On the Way</b></font></p>
    <p><font size="3"><b>The new 32-bit Windows Help 4.0</b></font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Scott Henson</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">May 9, 1995</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Excuse me. Have you been Helped?</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">No, we're not talking about trying on some
    new Birkenstocks or ordering a green salad with creamy
    vinaigrette. We're not talking about finding an efficient
    personal assistant. The kind of help we're dishing up can be
    found in the next wave of 32-bit Windows operating systems.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">So how to get up and running with this new
    Help system? Hop into the Helpmobile and let's take a look.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">First, let's talk about release plans for
    the new Windows Help version 4.0 engine and compiler. The
    WinHelp 4.0 engine (the 32-bit executable that displays the
    Help files) will ship with Windows 95 and Windows NT 3.51.
    The new WinHelp 4.0 compiler also bridges both platforms by
    allowing you to create your new WinHelp 4.0 content from
    either 32-bit operating system. Additionally, by the time
    Windows 95 is released to manufacturing, the new WinHelp
    engine will be released with version 1.3 of Win32s for use on
    Windows 3.1. By simply authoring one set of Help content,
    you're ready to ship full-featured Help for all three
    operating systems.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Let's also quickly talk about what you <i>won't</i>
    see. There will not be a WinHelp 4.0 compiler that runs on
    Windows 3.1, nor will WinHelp 4.0 files load on Windows NT
    3.5. That said, let's start by looking at the plethora (I
    just love that word) of new features.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3"><b>Help at first glance</b></font></p>
    <p><font size="2">At first glance you will notice a single
    entry point for Help: the Help Topics dialog box. This dialog
    box has tabs for contents, an index, and the hot new
    full-text search. The Contents tab displays the contents of
    the Help system in a familiar &quot;table-of-contents&quot;
    format. You can actually provide jumps to several Help files
    in a way that is transparent to users. If a user hasn't
    loaded a particular component of the program and its assigned
    Help file, WinHelp automatically drops all references to
    topics in that Help file so the user will never see those
    topics. This is great for updating Help files with
    maintenance releases, or if you have a knowledge base that
    continues to grow.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">WinHelp also has a new Index tab similar in
    appearance to a book index, including second-level entries.
    The real power of the new index is the ability to combine the
    indexes from multiple Help files. In addition, index entries
    can invoke macros, which means there's no more need for dummy
    topics that only run an auto-entry macro.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Unless you add your own tab to the Help
    Topics dialog box, the last tab will be the Full-Text Search
    tab, which, for intermediate and advanced users, is one of
    the handiest features of WinHelp. It enables a user to search
    through every word in the Help file and look for matches. In
    addition to searching for words, WinHelp can search for
    phrases, and can find topics similar to ones the user has
    already found.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3"><b>Beyond the interface</b></font></p>
    <p><font size="2">The initial interface is not the only
    aspect of WinHelp to go under the plastic surgeon's scalpel.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Take a look at the new copying
    capabilities. You can now select text from within the topic,
    copy and paste it into your e-mail, and send off the text.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">WinHelp is now an OLE drag-and-drop source.
    You can drag and drop the selected text to any OLE
    drag-and-drop target (WordPad, for instance). Invite a few
    friends over for a barbecue, and there's your entertainment
    for the evening. If that weren't enough, from WinHelp you can
    now print multiple topics from the Contents tab. You can even
    print a pop-up topic by bringing up the context menu and
    selecting Print Topic.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Users now have the option of choosing
    system colors. One great use for this capability is to allow
    sight-impaired users to have the Help system go into
    high-contrast mode rather than overriding with its own color
    scheme.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3"><b>Two new types of Help</b></font></p>
    <p><font size="2">WinHelp supports two new types of Help:
    context-sensitive and Training Cards. In addition to using
    the F1 key to access context-sensitive Help for an object or
    control in the Windows interface, a user can click the
    &quot;?&quot; button on the toolbar, and then click the
    object or control. The nice thing about context-sensitive
    Help is that the user gets immediate feedback about the item
    he or she clicked.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Training Cards, a set of Help topics in
    secondary windows, have been configured to send and receive
    instructions and information to and from other programs.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Developers can use the WinHelp API to run
    specific Training Cards, depending on which actions a user
    makes in a program. Similarly, the Training Card macro is
    used to inform the program of user actions within a Training
    Card, which the program can act upon in a specified manner.
    This capability is particularly useful in walking a user
    through an actual procedure, displaying a card with a new
    instruction whenever the user performs an instruction
    correctly, and displaying cards that respond to specific user
    mistakes.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3"><b>Help for Help authors</b></font></p>
    <p><font size="2">What about the Help Author?</font></p>
    <blockquote>
        <p><font size="2">&#149; You won't see those annoying
        &quot;out of memory&quot; messages when you compile. The
        new Help compiler is completely Windows-based and 32-bit,
        which gives you extended access to your system's memory.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">&#149; Secondary windows can now have
        button bars just like the main Help window, and you can
        add your own authorable buttons. These are real buttons,
        unlike their SHED graphic counterparts of the past.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">&#149; There is support for bitmaps
        with up to 16 million colors. If the current display
        color depth is lower than 16 million colors, WinHelp
        automatically reduces the color depth as necessary. You
        can also author bitmaps at multiple color depths, and let
        WinHelp determine the color depth capability of the
        monitor and use the appropriate bitmap.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">&#149; You can add animation and video
        files to topics by using the <b>{mci}</b> statement in
        the topic file. WinHelp plays back these files through
        the media control interface (MCI) in Windows. WinHelp
        supports motion-video files in Microsoft Video for
        Windows format.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">&#149; Two new linking macros, <b>KLink</b>
        and <b>ALink</b>, enable you to provide jumps to multiple
        topics based on keywords rather than specific context
        strings. The jumps are resolved at run time, so you can
        have jumps to other Help files that may or may not have
        been installed.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">&#149; There are several new
        compression schemes. Depending on the content of your
        files, you could see up to 10 percent compression of text
        and up to 90 percent for bitmaps (this depends entirely
        on the bitmap). For graphics-intensive Help files, the
        additional graphics compression could make a big
        difference.</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font size="3"><b>New compiling and testing features</b></font></p>
    <p><font size="2">There are also new compiling and testing
    features:</font></p>
    <blockquote>
        <p><font size="2">&#149; Windows-hosted tools for project
        and contents file editing, including a fast new compiler.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">&#149; The ability to launch your Help
        system in different ways, including calling it from
        another program, from the command line, or as a Training
        Card instance.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">&#149; A Help Author command allows you
        to see topic numbers in the title bar, provides easy
        keystroke access to step through the topic IDs
        numerically, and even adds additional commands on the
        context menu to get more information on topics and hot
        spots.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">&#149; A Report command allows the
        generation of a report on various aspects of a Help file.
        For each Help file, you can request reports by topic
        titles, hash numbers, and keywords. You can also request
        a report containing all the ASCII text in the Help file.
        This is great for a quick spell check of your Help files.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">&#149; Easier topic jumping. Just press
        CTRL+SHIFT+J from any topic window (except pop-up
        windows). This works with macros as well.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">&#149; The <b>Test</b> and <b>Compare</b>
        macros aid and help automate the thorough testing of your
        Help files.</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font size="3"><b>More information</b></font></p>
    <p><font size="2">For more material on WinHelp, start by
    diving into the merged Win32 Software Development Kit on the
    Developer Network Development Platform. From the root
    directory, you will find the new Help compiler (HCW.EXE) and
    Help Author's Guide (HCW.HLP) in the
    WIN32SDK\MSTOOLS\BIN\I386 directory.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">For those who would like a jump start into
    the WinHelp 4.0 Help authoring process, you can purchase (I
    promise it's only to cover costs) videotapes from the Windows
    Help Authoring Conference held in January in Redmond,
    Washington. To inquire about how to get these videos, e-mail
    helpvid@microsoft.com. You can also fax your request to (206)
    936-7329, Attn: Windows Help Authoring Video Requests. If all
    else fails, you could send good old postal mail to:</font></p>
