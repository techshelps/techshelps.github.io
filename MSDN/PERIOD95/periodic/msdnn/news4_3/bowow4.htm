    <p><font size="5"><b>Case Study: Business Solution Has
    Pet-Hospital Startup Purring</b></font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Martha Maroney</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">May 9, 1995</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">In the world of small-animal veterinary
    medicine, Dr. Scott Campbell has learned that it's smart to
    think big. Building on the success of his small-animal
    veterinary practice in Portland, Oregon, Campbell has
    developed a rapidly growing collection of pet hospitals in
    Oregon, California, Washington state, and the Chicago area.
    These VetSmart Pet Hospital &amp; Health Centers, which offer
    a full range of veterinary services, are managed entirely
    through a client-server solution based on the Microsoft
    BackOffice product family.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">When Campbell first pursued the VetSmart
    idea in 1993, he opted to establish pet hospitals at a number
    of the nationwide PETsMART superstores. Initially he planned
    to open 60 hospitals, with each eventually employing six
    veterinary doctors and 30 support staff.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">For such an ambitious venture Campbell knew
    he needed a comprehensive software solution, one that would
    effectively automate the systems he had developed at his
    Portland pet hospital over an eight-year period. As Campbell
    envisioned it, the VetSmart solution would have to support
    the quality care, customer convenience, and efficiency that
    had made his Portland facility successful. It would have to
    help implement his goal of an essentially paperless office.
    It also would have to ensure the planned hospitals'
    compliance with a stringent set of medical, legal,
    accounting, and quality-assurance requirements.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">In addition, the VetSmart solution would
    have to fit smoothly into a clinical environment, offering
    familiar interfaces to users ranging from doctors to lab
    technicians to receptionists, and processing information
    directly from such sources as stethoscopes and
    electrocardiogram (ECG) devices. Finally, it would have to
    act as a marketing tool by educating pet owners about the
    importance of vaccinations and other veterinary services, a
    function requiring various media and input/output
    capabilities, including touch-screen, video, bar coding,
    sound, and multimedia.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3"><b>A natural migration to Windows</b></font></p>
    <p><font size="2">After launching the development effort,
    Campbell formed a company called Medical Management
    International (MMI) to manage both development of the
    software and the VetSmart pet hospitals, and enrolled the
    company in the Microsoft Solution Provider program. He was
    joined at MMI by Mark Howard, a FoxPro database expert and
    president of Vancouver, Washington-based Software Blueprints,
    itself among the first members of the Microsoft Solution
    Provider program.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Howard was familiar with Microsoft
    products, having programmed in FoxPro and before that FoxBASE
    for more than a decade. &quot;I had a strong relationship
    with the Microsoft technical support people, starting with
    the formation of my business back in 1983,&quot; Howard
    explained. &quot;Whatever the question, I knew we could count
    on receiving a timely and complete answer.&quot; He decided
    to base the VetSmart solution on FoxPro for Windows and other
    Microsoft tools.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3"><b>FoxPro under pressure</b></font></p>
    <p><font size="2">With the first VetSmart hospitals scheduled
    to open in spring 1994, development proceeded rapidly. To
    create a solution that would eventually total a half-million
    lines of code, a team of 20 to 25 developers and testers
    worked 70-hour weeks. Howard himself put in even longer
    hours. &quot;At times the pressure was so intense it felt
    like an inferno,&quot; he recalled. &quot;When we talked
    about putting out fires, we felt like we really meant
    it.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Howard took advantage of such FoxPro tools
    as Screen Builder, Program Manager, Report Writer, and Query
    Builder. &quot;Along with FoxPro's English-like language,
    these tools enabled us to manipulate things very
    quickly,&quot; he said. One advantage was the FoxPro approach
    to events and methods. &quot;Although you can define fewer
    events and methods than you can in C++, in FoxPro they're
    very generic and extendible, so you can do a lot with
    them.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Although the developers used FoxPro for
    most of their programming, they also added some code using
    OLE and the Microsoft Foundation Class Library (MFC) in the
    Visual C++ development system. Visual C++ provided
    specialized capabilities, including support for an integrated
    ECG device. Using a dynamic-link library (DLL) created with
    Visual C++, the developers were able to speed up the refresh
    of critical screens. The relative ease of using MFC also
    proved handy. &quot;Since I'm not ordinarily a C++
    programmer, I wouldn't have been able to use the language at
    all without MFC,&quot; Howard said.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3"><b>Building atop existing applications with
    OLE</b></font></p>
    <p><font size="2">OLE played a major role as well. &quot;OLE
    helped us build on top of existing applications so we didn't
    have to develop them from scratch&#151;an absolute necessity
    considering our schedule,&quot; Howard pointed out.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Using OLE to export data from Microsoft
    Excel into Microsoft Graph, for example, the developers built
    a sophisticated performance-analysis application. By
    exporting similar data into Word, they constructed a
    peer-review application, and by trading data between Word and
    a specialized vertical product, they incorporated powerful
    quality-control functionality into the solution. Because the
    Visual Basic for Applications programming system was not
    available at the time, the developers implemented these
    communications through dynamic data exchange (DDE).</font></p>
    <p><font size="3"><b>Office with Windows</b></font></p>
    <p><font size="2">For the foundation of the solution, Howard
    selected Windows NT and Windows for Workgroups as operating
    systems. &quot;We wanted the ease of use and administration
    we knew we would find only in a Windows-based approach,&quot;
    Howard explained. &quot;More important, we wanted a system
    that was designed from the ground up to meet the integration
    needs of a major client-server solution, and Windows NT met
    those requirements on the nose.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Microsoft Office Standard Edition provided
    desktop-productivity tools and components of key
    applications, and two new products were added when they
    became available in early 1994: remote mail, for
    interhospital communication, and the messaging application
    programming interface (MAPI), for the electronic-mail
    interface. With remote mail and the remote access service
    (RAS) available through Windows for Workgroups, the
    developers built a powerful set of interhospital
    communications, not only for e-mail but also for remote
    administration and daily backups. MAPI supported a
    programmatic interface to Microsoft Mail&#151;which turned
    out to be a crucial advantage, according to Howard.
    &quot;Thanks to MAPI, I was able to build the communications
    set with minimal coding,&quot; he said.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3"><b>From medical records to inventory</b></font></p>
    <p><font size="2">In March 1994, developers released the
    first version of the VetSmart solution and within six weeks
    installed it in six new VetSmart pet hospitals. Today, the
    solution is running in more than 40 VetSmart facilities.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Known as PetWare, the solution incorporates
    more than 600 screens. On the medical side, it streamlines
    record entry and management, diagnoses and therapeutic
    protocols, vaccination history and results, prescriptions,
    and laboratory record keeping. For each hospital's
    management, it helps track team assignments and staff
    performance. Administratively, PetWare supports revenue
    accounting, invoicing, and inventory management. For
    marketing, it provides educational handouts and videos, which
    are played for clients in the exam rooms.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">The PetWare server workstations run Windows
    NT Server, while its client workstations run the Windows for
    Workgroups operating system. A documentation workstation and
    a helpdesk workstation run Windows NT Workstation. At each
    pet hospital a FoxPro database of more than 100 MB provides
    PetWare's main data engine, which can be accessed by as many
    as 20 people almost continuously. &quot;There's nothing
    faster than FoxPro's Rushmore technology for lookup, which is
    mostly what we do,&quot; Howard said. &quot;Users
    consistently report instantaneous data access.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">RAS, in addition to supporting e-mail,
    provides remote administration of the hospitals' servers and
    local area networks (operating through NetBEUI protocols)
    from the MMI office in Portland. &quot;NetBEUI is
    transparent, reliable, and flexible, and RAS is fantastic for
    the complete level of control it gives us,&quot; Howard said.
    &quot;In particular the Windows NT command prompt gives us
    much-needed control over such tasks as monitoring error logs
    and nightly backup, both critical for meeting the stringent
    redundancy requirements in the veterinary profession.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">The Windows NT scheduler component provides
    additional network administration services by enabling
    administrators to schedule software installation, backups,
    file updates, and other tasks remotely. &quot;With the
    scheduler we save time, money, and headaches by avoiding all
    those hours we might otherwise spend on the phone,&quot;
    Howard noted.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3"><b>Automating remote administration</b></font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Immediate plans for PetWare include
    upgrading all the developer workstations to Windows NT
    Workstation. Once that happens, administrators will use the
    Microsoft Systems Management Server, another component of the
    BackOffice product family, to completely automate remote
    administration.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">In other areas, developers will upgrade the
    central database engine with Visual FoxPro version 3.0. After
    that they may replace the corporate data repository, now in a
    FoxPro database, with SQL Server. Making this possible will
    be the Visual FoxPro 3.0 direct-command capabilities for SQL
    Server, which will enable FoxPro to act as a front end to a
    SQL Server database. &quot;We believe SQL Server can give us
    even greater data integrity and more secure transaction
    rollbacks and central storage,&quot; Howard said.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">According to Howard, a number of major
    pet-food and pharmaceutical companies have expressed interest
    in using VetSmart data for research and new-drug trials.
    &quot;Since these businesses are SQL-oriented, a Microsoft
    SQL Server platform could make our data much easier for them
    to access,&quot; he said.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3"><b>An indispensable role</b></font></p>
    <p><font size="2">According to Campbell, PetWare plays an
    indispensable role at VetSmart. &quot;Without PetWare we
    wouldn't be able to offer the high-quality, consistent, and
    cost-effective care that's required for a venture of this
    scope to succeed,&quot; he said. &quot;We simply couldn't
    have created this business without it.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Current plans call for VetSmart hospitals
    in 120 locations by the end of 1997. As Campbell explained,
    &quot;The continuing expansion of VetSmart is likely to make
    it the most visible veterinary practice in the United States
    and the one by which people judge the whole profession.&quot;
    With PetWare supporting the hospitals' operations, he
    welcomes the increased visibility. &quot;We're adamant about
    raising standards, doing the best we can by pets and their
    people, and helping the profession in general,&quot; he said.
    &quot;Using PetWare, I'm confident we can keep on doing these
    things.&quot;</font></p>
