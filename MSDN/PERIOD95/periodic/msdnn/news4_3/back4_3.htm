    <p><font size="5"><b>Backtalk: A Continuing Dialog on the
    Development Library and Platform</b></font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Melinda Hohlbein</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">May 9, 1995</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Miss me? I'm not out there yakking with you
    all online right now because I had a baby. And you know, a
    total stranger had the nerve to ask me if it hurt. Yeah, it
    hurt. Go pass a kidney stone while undergoing abdominal
    surgery&#151;without anesthesia&#151;and having your
    fingernails pulled out with pliers and then we'll talk. Of
    course, the baby is kind of cute.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">But back to business.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">An individual&#151;with clearly too much
    time on his hands&#151;wrote to us recently and recommended
    that I put more &quot;personality&quot; in my writing. Note
    he didn't mention <i>my </i>personality, just <i>more</i>
    personality. Really? Okay, but I couldn't find a place to put
    unmentionable phrases in any of these sections, so my
    shameless display of character will have to wait until the
    next issue.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Speaking of character, we had some lively
    and wholly unmedicated ones write in these past few months
    demanding that we address their concerns. Read on to find out
    the sordid details. I know you're breathless.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3"><b>Browser: The next generation</b></font></p>
    <p><font size="2">The demands are already rolling in for the
    next generation of the browser software employed by the
    Development Library CD-ROM. We're planning to release it
    sometime later this year. (Is that vague enough?)</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">I asked Bill Shelby&#151;browser team
    developer extraordinaire&#151;to give us some hints about
    what we can expect in the next version of the browser. Here's
    what he said: &quot;We came up with a fix that allows you to
    search and find anything by just thinking at the Find dialog
    box, and we tripled the capacity of the disc, but we
    accidentally formatted the drive with some (not backed up)
    source code when we really needed more disk space for
    something else.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">You see what I have to work with. Thanks to
    all of you who have sent in suggestions about the
    Library&#151;keep 'em coming, please.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3"><b>Get FAQ</b></font></p>

    writes: &quot;You must get asked this all the time, but
    what...&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Abe's question isn't the issue here, but he
    raised a great point. Why don't we have a central location
    for answers to common questions (technical and nontechnical)
    about the Developer Network? Abe, Abe, buddy, it exists. The
    Developer Network frequently asked questions (FAQ) help and
