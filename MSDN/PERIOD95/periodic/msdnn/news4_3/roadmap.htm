    <p><font size="5"><b>Developer Roadmap Provides Sales Info on
    CD</b></font></p>
    <p><font size="2">May 9, 1995</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Microsoft has prepared a comprehensive CD
    catalog of all its products and services for software
    developers. The Microsoft Roadmap to Developer Products and
    Services is now available&#151;at no charge&#151;to Developer
    Network members and nonmembers alike.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">The Roadmap CD contains more than 100 files
    of sales information on Microsoft development tools,
    operating systems, and services for developers, including
    white papers, data sheets, evaluation guides, Q&amp;As,
    strategy papers, technology specifications, and product
    demonstrations. Among the latter are demonstrations of Visual
    C++, Visual Basic, and Fortran POWERstation, as well as the
    Developer Network Development Library and Development
    Platform.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">The Roadmap is intended to provide a
    one-stop, easily searchable source of product and service
    shopping for developers, and does not contain in-depth
    technical information.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">The CD offers a browser and full-text
    search capability. A directory of Microsoft sales and
    product-support telephone numbers is included. Plans call for
    the CD to be updated quarterly.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">It can be ordered by any of the following
    methods:</font></p>
    <blockquote>
        <p><font size="2">&#149; Call the Developer Services
        PhoneFax Server at (206) 635-2222. Order document 170.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">&#149; Access the Developer Roadmap
        order form in the Microsoft Library on CompuServe (GO
        MSLANG).</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">&#149; Print and fax the order form
        accompanying the online version of this article on the
        Internet. Go to the Microsoft Home Page
        (http://www.microsoft.com), and choose the Developer
        Network OffRamp/Developer Network News. Or, on The

        Network/News.</font></p>
