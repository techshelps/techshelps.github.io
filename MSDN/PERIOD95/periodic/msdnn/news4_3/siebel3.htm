    <p><font size="5"><b>Sales-System Designers Sold on Visual
    C++</b></font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Linda Richmond</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">May 9, 1995</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Solution sought: How can a large
    organization track sales opportunities, all the way from
    first contact to final product delivery&#151;especially a
    vendor who deals in a variety of distribution channels,
    languages, and currencies?</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Solution offered: The Siebel Sales
    Information System, created with the Microsoft Visual C++
    development system by Siebel Systems, a young client-server
    software firm in Menlo Park, California.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">&quot;The time it takes to get a software
    product to market is simply everything,&quot; said president
    and CEO Thomas M. Siebel. &quot;Our use of new Microsoft
    development tools enabled us to bring our product to market
    one full year earlier than we would have using any other
    development environment.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Many potential users of the Siebel Sales
    Information System distribute through such diverse channels
    as field sales, telemarketing, or third-party distribution.
    Besides online sales and product information, the product had
    to support multiple languages and currencies concurrently.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">The system employs Microsoft Excel,
    Microsoft Word, and Microsoft Mail, plus Microsoft BackOffice
    networking and systems management software, and works under
    Windows version 3.1, Windows 95, Windows for Workgroups, and
    Windows NT operating systems and in conjunction with
    Microsoft SQL Server.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3"><b>Why Visual C++ was chosen</b></font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Siebel Systems chose Visual C++ as the
    design environment largely because of the Microsoft
    Foundation Class Library (MFC) and the strength of its
    support for the Windows API and OLE.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">MFC is designed to be compatible with the
    naming conventions used for the Windows API. This means that
    the MFC calls are very similar to the Windows API calls, so
    the learning curve is relatively slight. Also, developers can
    mix Windows API code with MFC.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Because using MFC results in a smaller code
    body with fast execution speeds and small executables,
    developers find that it allows them to write, test, and debug
    far less code. &quot;We want to be first in the marketplace
    with the best possible product,&quot; said Bill Edwards,
    Siebel's vice president of engineering. &quot;The fact that
    we're already in Windows makes us extremely cutting edge.
    Visual C++ with its MFC and OLE support helped us get
    there.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Another benefit Siebel's development team
    saw is the multithreaded preemptive multitasking support
    provided by Visual C++ with MFC, allowing more connections by
    users.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Edwards said his group also admired the
    Visual C++ integrated development environment (IDE) that
    allows them to build, edit, browse, and debug in the same
    development environment.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">&quot;The IDE and Project Manager remove a
    lot of the frustrations a developer typically went through in
    the past,&quot; explained Edwards. &quot;One real help for us
    was the ClassWizard feature, which allows us to view and edit
    a class easily, while preserving any manual changes that were
    made. This is a big advantage over typical 4GL tools.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">The 10-person Siebel development team
    particularly liked the new, faster incremental linker, which
    speeds up development time&#151;especially with large
    applications&#151;by relinking only the edited code.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3"><b>OLE support enhances product's features</b></font></p>
    <p><font size="2">&quot;Each Siebel client has different
    needs,&quot; said Pat House, vice president of marketing,
    &quot;so our product has to be versatile enough to meet those
    needs.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">&quot;The OLE support offered by Visual C++
    gives us a very configurable and flexible product to take to
    our customers. We're getting a great response to the Siebel
    Sales Information System because of its inherent flexibility,
    thanks to Visual C++. The sales user can work in our
    application, yet seamlessly access other integrated
    productivity tools.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">OLE support and automation enabled Siebel
    to enhance its new product by incorporating other Microsoft
    products, such as Microsoft Excel and Word, into one package.
    OLE saved Siebel from having to write new code for de facto
    market standards to provide word processing, spreadsheet,
    report writer, and online documentation accessing
    capabilities.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Because OLE support broadens an
    application's feature menu, Siebel easily incorporated these
    features into its application. And through OLE, applications
    interact in a more efficient way. MFC provides support for
    OLE technology, making object linking and embedding easy to
    implement. MFC consolidates lower-level OLE programming into
    higher-level C++ class APIs.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3"><b>An easy jaunt to 32 bits</b></font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Siebel developed its Sales Information
    System as a 16-bit application, but also designed it for
    32-bit Windows 95 interface standards with OLE capabilities.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Through MFC, Siebel preserved the code for
    use with future technology enhancements. By using MFC-based
    code, Siebel's development team was able to port its product
    quickly to Windows NT as a native 32-bit application simply
    by recompiling it. The application immediately ran on Windows
    95. Siebel credits the preemptive multitasking ability of
    Windows NT with fostering a 10 to 50 percent performance
    improvement in the product, depending on the task.</font></p>
