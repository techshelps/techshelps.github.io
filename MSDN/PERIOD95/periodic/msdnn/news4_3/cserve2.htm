    <p><font size="5"><b>CompuServe Adds Value to Your Apps</b></font></p>
    <p><font size="2">May 9, 1995</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">In an age of application suites, groupware,
    and software bundling, what can increase the connectivity and
    data-acquisition capability of smaller applications?</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">One answer is to include application
    extensions in an extensive online environment such as
    CompuServe. Although the Developer Network has long had a
    presence on CompuServe, many developers may not have
    considered adding connectivity to CompuServe to enhance their
    applications. An online service can add value to most
    applications in numerous ways, such as the ability to obtain
    stock quotes for a financial application or to gather news
    stories for a personal information manager.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">CompuServe offers two simple ways to add
    this connectivity to your applications without having to
    write an online interface from scratch.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">The first is the CompuServe Communications
    Toolbox (CCT), a set of tools utilizing CompuServe's Host
    Micro Interface (HMI) that allows developers to build micro
    applications for connecting to the CompuServe Information
    Service (CIS). Although the Toolbox's primary function is to
    enable micro applications to establish HMI sessions with CIS
    through the connect functionality of CCT, it can also be used
    simply to access any host on the CompuServe network.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">The second is the CompuServe Multimedia
    Publisher Partnership Program, which allows developers of
    multimedia CD-ROM products to add value to content by
    integrating their CD-ROM with access to the CIS.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3"><b>CompuServe Communications Toolbox</b></font></p>
    <p><font size="2">By utilizing the CCT, a developer can
    interact with CompuServe in a defined, predictable manner.
    The underlying HMI protocol the Toolbox uses presents
    application protocols to all CompuServe host applications,
    such as forums or e-mail.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">This protocol uses a structured data
    format, with an error-checking transport layer, to present
    the micro application with information that can be handled
    directly from within your existing user interface. This
    interface control flexibility means that you don't have to
    redesign the look and feel of your project to accommodate
    this new functionality. The CCT also provides the necessary
    low-level interaction for an application, so that everything
    from memory allocation and serial communications to data
    validation can be accomplished directly with a call to the
    Toolbox.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Many performance and compatibility
    requirements were incorporated in the design of the CCT. The
    Toolbox itself is fully ANSI-compatible, C++ callable, and
    compiled in various combinations of environments, compilers,
    and memory models.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Wherever possible, dialog boxes give a
    standard user interface to the Toolbox. Functions and dialog
    boxes are provided for obtaining serial communications
    settings, which consist of hardware parameters and a modem
    database to select parameters, as well as status boxes for
    displaying messages sent from the Toolbox.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">These dialog boxes work in conjunction with
    CompuServe's predefined settings file format for common file
    access among multiple CompuServe applications. This file is
    used by all CompuServe applications to store the
    communications parameters that allow them to connect to
    CompuServe. If a function is platform-specific, the supported
    platform is listed in the declaration of the function.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Using the <b>SendMessage</b> function
    allows multitasking environments, such as Windows, a native
    way to interact with the Toolbox. In environments such as
    MS-DOS, the <b>SendMessage</b> function provides a single
    interface for the many functions in which the Toolbox must
    interact with the application.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">The Toolbox also allows multiple
    applications to access it simultaneously. In the Windows
    environment, this means that all applications using the
    Toolbox can share a single dynamic-link library (DLL) without
    chance of interference. (In environments other than Windows,
    this may not be a requirement of the application.)</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Because the library can be shared at run
    time in some environments (for example, Windows), a numeric
    naming scheme for the Toolbox is used that allows CompuServe
    to guarantee compatibility between new releases of the
    library. If at any point the libraries become incompatible
    with the previous version, the numeric portion of the
    filename will change (for example, CCT110 might supersede
    CCT100).</font></p>
    <p><font size="3"><b>Hot links for multimedia</b></font></p>
    <p><font size="2">The new CompuServe Multimedia Publisher
    Partnership Program lets multimedia developers add various
    capabilities to their applications without increasing
    development time. The program permits inclusion of hypertext
    documents that link to various CIS locations.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">It also allows users to perform such
    actions as electronic registration and transaction
    processing, and even to use CompuServe as a vehicle to
    communicate with their company for support. This gives the
    normally static medium of CD-ROM a new kick. The links can be
    used for something as simple as a weather report or for
    something more intensive, such as a downloadable patch or
    update area.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">You can even use these hypertext links to
    Internet services through CompuServe. As part of this
    program, you can also license customized versions of other
    CompuServe software products, such as WinCIM or MacCIM, to
    include on your CD-ROM. (WinCIM is an application that serves
    as a graphical front end to CompuServe. WinCIM provides icons
    that let users jump easily and quickly into the
    developer-related areas of the Microsoft Connection area on
    CompuServe.)</font></p>
    <p><font size="3"><b>Further information</b></font></p>
    <p><font size="2">The CCT and CompuServe Multimedia Publisher
    Partnership Program are both available for developers on the
    Windows 3.<i>x</i>, Windows for Workgroups 3.<i>x</i>,
    MS-DOS, GEOS, and Macintosh platforms. Support for Win32
    development is planned this summer. For information about
    these or other CompuServe developer programs, contact:</font></p>
