    <p><font size="5"><b>Can Johnny Come Out to AutoPlay?</b></font></p>
    <p><font size="3"><b>Windows 95 executes your application off
    a CD-ROM</b></font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Robert Hess</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">May 9, 1995</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">OK, picture this. You are sitting at your
    computer and suddenly get the itch to play a game. You have
    the latest CD-ROM version of &lt;your favorite game&gt;, and
    you push the disc into your CD-ROM drive. What is the next
    thing you want to do?</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Simple. Play the game. What steps are
    necessary to do this? Not so simple. Depending on exactly how
    the CD-ROM and its application were designed, you may face
    such instructions as:</font></p>
    <blockquote>
        <p><font size="2">1. Insert the CD into your CD-ROM
        drive.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">2. With Windows running, from Program
        Manager, select the File menu, and then the Run command.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">3. In the Run dialog box, either type
        the full path of the application to run
        (d:\game\full\game.exe, assuming that your CD-ROM drive
        is the D drive; enter the appropriate drive letter if
        your CD-ROM drive is located elsewhere) or click the
        Browse button and navigate your way to the GAME.EXE
        application.</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font size="2">Since one of the primary goals of Windows
    95 is &quot;Make it easy, not just easier,&quot; this is
    obviously an aspect of the system that could vastly improve.
    To make this &quot;easy&quot; you want the game to start
    automatically when you insert the CD. On Windows 95, this is
    exactly what can happen.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">A new feature, AutoPlay, allows Windows 95
    to automatically start your application off a CD-ROM as soon
    as the disc is inserted into the drive. It makes playing a
    CD-ROM&#150;based game on Windows 95 as easy as playing a
    game on a standard cartridge-based game system.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3"><b>Implementing AutoPlay support</b></font></p>
    <p><font size="2">If you are developing an application to be
    distributed on CD-ROM, you should seriously consider adding
    AutoPlay support to your disc. It doesn't require any
    programming knowledge or changes to your application, and it
    is completely backward compatible with any system on which
    your CD-ROM currently runs.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">All you need do to implement AutoPlay on
    your CD title is add a file named AUTORUN.INF to the root of
    your CD-ROM drive. When the CD is inserted into the drive,
    the system automatically looks for this file and follows the
    instructions in it.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">The format of AUTORUN.INF is similar to a
    standard .INF or .INI file, with a section name (enclosed in
    square brackets) followed by keywords and values on
    subsequent lines. A minimum AUTORUN.INF file would look like:</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Courier New">[autorun]</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Courier New">open = filename.exe</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">In this example, <b>autorun</b> is the
    required section name; <b>open</b> is the keyword the system
    will seek to determine what action to take when the CD is
    inserted; and <i>filename.exe</i> is the application that
    will be started.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">A fully configured AUTORUN.INF file might
    look like:</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Courier New">[autorun]</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Courier New">open = filename.exe
    /switch1 /switch2</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Courier New">icon = filename.exe, 1</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Courier New">shell\configure =
    &amp;Configure</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Courier New">shell\configure\command
    = setup.exe /config</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Courier New">shell\install =
    &amp;Install</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Courier New">shell\install\command =
    setup.exe</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Courier New">shell\readme = &amp;Read
    Me</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Courier New">shell\readme\command =
    notepad </font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Courier New">help\readme.txt</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Courier New">shell\help = &amp;Help</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Courier New">shell\help\command =
    help\helpfile.hlp</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">In addition to automatically launching <i>filename.exe</i>,
    the above example will add two command-line parameters, <i>/switch1</i>
    and <i>/switch2</i>, when the application is run. The actual
    command-line parameters to use, of course, depend on what the
    application being launched accepts. When the drive is viewed
    in the Explorer (a Windows 95 navigational tool that replaces
    Program Manager and helps you locate files and information),
    the second icon in the executable's resource will be used in
    place of the normal CD-ROM icon (icon references are
    zero-based). If you would rather access the icon by its ID,
    simply use the negative ID value.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">When the user clicks the icon with the
    right mouse button, four new items can appear&#151;Configure,
    Install, Read Me, and Help&#151;in addition to the normal
    context menu items. The user clicks the menu item to run the
    associated command. These menu items are used for
    illustration only, and are not intended as a recommendation
    of menu items you should add for your application. Please
    refer to the <i>Windows User Interface Design Guide</i> for
    Windows 95 to determine the best menu items to add for your
    application.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3"><b>Suppressing AutoPlay</b></font></p>
    <p><font size="2">For those times when the user doesn't want
    to use AutoPlay when inserting an AutoPlay-enabled CD-ROM, it
    can easily be suppressed by holding down the SHIFT key while
    inserting the CD.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3"><b>AutoPlay style guidelines</b></font></p>
    <p><font size="2">While there isn't yet much in the way of
    style guidelines on implementing AutoPlay, here are some
    general rules of thumb to consider:</font></p>
    <blockquote>
        <p><font size="2">&#149; Whatever you do, do it quickly,
        then stand back and let the user drive. Promptly give the
        user input on his or her wishes, whether it's to run the
        application, access some data, or do an about-face and
        exit.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">&#149; Use a minimum of hard-disk
        resources; run completely off the CD if at all possible.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">&#149; If there is a performance
        benefit in loading some data onto the hard drive, let the
        user select this option.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">&#149; If data is moved to the hard
        drive, have it removed upon exiting.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">&#149; If the application can be fully
        installed to the hard drive, provide this as an option to
        the user. But provide the option to fully remove it from
        the hard drive as well.</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font size="3"><b>Further information</b></font></p>
    <p><font size="2">A very simple application illustrating how
    an AutoPlay-enabled application might be
    implemented&#151;&quot;Building AutoPlay-Enabled CD-ROM
    Titles and Games&quot; by Alex St. John and Jeff
    Camp&#151;can be found in the Technical Articles section of
    the April release of the Developer Network Development
    Library. It takes a very simple application and, rather than
    running it directly when the CD is inserted, runs a
    'launcher' application that quickly allows the user either to
    launch the application or exit.</font></p>
