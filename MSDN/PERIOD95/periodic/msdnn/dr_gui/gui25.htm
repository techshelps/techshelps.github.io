a question? Dr. GUI's busy operating schedule won't allow her to

<p><font color="#000000" size="2" face="verdana,arial,helvetica">It's
a strange world. One day you put your faith in some guy who calls
himself a doctor (but he really isn't). You can handle this. I
mean, what's a little white lie between friends. Then, the next
day, you find out that not only isn't the doctor a real doctor,
but he isn't even a man! You wonder: Has my hero had one of those
operations that people talk of in hushed voices? Have I been
hornswoggled? Is hornswoggled a word? (Yes, it is.) </font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="2" face="verdana,arial,helvetica">Well,
there's no need to panic. The answer's really very simple. Those
of you who are fans of the BBC television show &quot;Dr.
Who&quot; are aware of an interesting anomaly that occurs every
so often: The doctor regenerates into a new form. Usually this
happens when the good doctor finds himself in a situation where,
were he a normal human being (and not a time lord), he would die.
Time lords don't die. They regenerate. Similarly, Dr. GUI didn't
move on to do something more interesting and profitable&#151;he
regenerated. Now he's a she and, like her previous incarnation,
she's not a real doctor. She does, however, golf on Wednesdays
whenever possible.</font></p>
