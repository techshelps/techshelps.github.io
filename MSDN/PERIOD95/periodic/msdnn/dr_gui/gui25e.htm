<h2><font size="2" face="verdana,arial,helvetica">Dear Dr. GUI:</font></h2>

<p><font size="2" face="verdana,arial,helvetica">We are currently
developing various client-server applications using Visual Basic
3.0. In the client development, we would like to improve the look
and feel by including the new look for options as appears in
Microsoft Excel 5.0 and Word 6.0. This new look appears like the
tabs of a folder. On the same window, the user can select a tab,
and a new set of options appears in a frame in the same window. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="verdana,arial,helvetica">The question I have is: </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="verdana,arial,helvetica">1. Is there a custom
control that is an enhancement on the existing frame control
currently available to provide this new look? </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="verdana,arial,helvetica">2. If not, is there a
custom control planned for the next release of Visual Basic? </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="verdana,arial,helvetica">Regards<br>
Dan O'Riordan<br>
Jean Michel Becar </font></p>

<h2><font size="2" face="verdana,arial,helvetica">Dr. GUI replies:</font></h2>

<p><font size="2" face="verdana,arial,helvetica">Actually, that was two
questions, but my investments are doing well today and I am
feeling overly generous right now, so I'll answer both. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="verdana,arial,helvetica">It sounds like you want
to include a property sheet in your applications. The good news
is that there are already a variety of custom controls that
provide this look. One in particular is called Yet Another Tab
Control (YATC.VBX), and it is available in the Development
Library. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="verdana,arial,helvetica">As you may know, Visual
Basic 4.0 (due out this fall) supports OLE Controls, and you will
find a tab OLE Control called TABS.OCX on CompuServe. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="verdana,arial,helvetica">I guess you two will
have to share the T-shirt.</font></p>
