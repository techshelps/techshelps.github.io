<h2><font size="2" face="verdana,arial,helvetica">Dear Dr. GUI:</font></h2>

<p><font size="2" face="verdana,arial,helvetica">I have been reading your
articles for a couple of years. However, I did not need to write
Windows-based applications using MFC until recently. The worst
thing is that I need to learn how to write Windows-based
applications using MFC in a short time. I have been reading <i>Inside
Visual C++</i> from Microsoft Press. It seems to me that there
are millions of WM_ messages and class member functions. With
some of them, it is obvious what they will do. However, I have
not figured out a way to find out what may be available to use in
different situations. For someone who knows the basics of how
Windows works, the structure of MFC classes, and object-oriented
programming, what are the best resources to learn about
programming for Windows using MFC? </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="verdana,arial,helvetica">I would try to memorize
all the MFC classes and their member functions and software
development kit APIs, if only my memory did not get lost, like my
Windows-based applications. I am a Developer Network Level 2
member, and I have purchased all the MFC Windows programming
materials that I know of. Now it is time to see my GUI doctor for
help. Maybe you can prescribe some medicines to fix my memory
problem. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="verdana,arial,helvetica">My second question is
easy. VLIST, the virtual list box sample in the Microsoft
Development Library, is written in C using the SDK. Is there an
equivalent example using MFC? </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="verdana,arial,helvetica">Getting a free T-shirt
is nice, but I would rather have Dr. GUI answer my questions. Why
don't we make a deal? If you answer my questions, you save a
T-shirt. Ha ha! </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="verdana,arial,helvetica">W. Wong </font></p>

<h2><font size="2" face="verdana,arial,helvetica">Dr. GUI replies:</font></h2>

<p><font size="2" face="verdana,arial,helvetica">Some medicines are hard
to take. The syrups taste bad. The pills are big, and if they
don't get stuck in your throat, they upset your stomach. My
prescription for you is going to be a hard pill to swallow: Read
the documentation. The best tutorial for learning how to use the
Microsoft Foundation Class Library (MFC) is the Scribble tutorial
in the Visual C++ manual. Following along with the creation of
the Scribble sample application will get you on the road to
recovery in less than two days' time. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="verdana,arial,helvetica">Once you have done the
tutorial, there is no need to memorize all the application
programming interface (API) functions and classes. You can press
f1 to get Help or Books Online while running Visual C++. Even
better, leave the Microsoft Development Library running, so that
it's just an alt+tab away with answers to your questions. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="verdana,arial,helvetica">In most cases, MFC is a
loose wrapper around the Win32 API. If you know Win32, you should
have little difficulty transitioning to MFC. The biggest
difference between an MFC application and most Windows-based
applications in C is in the document/view architecture and in the
handling of menus. The Scribble tutorial covers these issues very
well. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="verdana,arial,helvetica">You are definitely on
the right track reading<i> Inside Visual C++</i> and the
Development Library. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="verdana,arial,helvetica">Regarding an MFC version
of VLIST, I'll quote my college physics textbook: &quot;That is
left as an exercise for the reader.&quot; Seriously, we don't
currently have plans to make an MFC version of the VLIST sample.
The new hierarchical control introduced by Windows 95 replaces
much of the need for an MFC version of VLIST. For more
information, check out the wonderful,
soon-to-be-published-by-Microsoft-Press book on Windows 95 by
Nancy Cluts, which contains every sample on the Development
Library CD in C, C++, MFC, Small Talk, SNOBOL, and Swahili.</font></p>
