<p><font size="2" face="verdana,arial,helvetica">From the desk of Dr. GUI
</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="verdana,arial,helvetica">I had the privilege to
meet many of you in the member lounge at the SD '94 conference
held in Washington, D.C. during the first week of October. I will
never forget you folks. How could I? The first character I met
was James. James' conference badge indicated his title as
&quot;Psych.&quot; We talked at length about old technology. When
he left he told me to simply put an &quot;o&quot; on the end of
his title. Sounds good to me, James. Then there was Peter. Peter
is a real doctor at the National Institutes of Health. He became
disenchanted with medicine during his internship and turned to
kinetic modeling. Sounds a bit like me (although I was never a
real doctor and I have never done kinetic modeling!). His
favorite disease? Ornithosis, a disease spread by pigeon
droppings. I think that he made a wise move out of medicine,
don't you? And what about Rusty? A FoxPro nut whose business card
bills him as a ski instructor! What was he doing at SD '94? If
you ever go to Whitetail, just look for some guy carrying a
laptop on the ski lift. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="verdana,arial,helvetica">I had fun. I hope all of
you did too. I still owe many of you e-mail with follow-ups, so
hang in there. Your questions may appear in this column in the
future. </font></p>
