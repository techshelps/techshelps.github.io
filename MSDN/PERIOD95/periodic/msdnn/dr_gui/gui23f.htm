<h2><font size="2" face="verdana,arial,helvetica">Dear Dr. GUI:</font></h2>

<p><font size="2" face="verdana,arial,helvetica">PSS ID Number Q105541
discusses the availability of full-text search of help
(hypertext) files for Visual Basic documentation. My application
involves the use of a Help file for programming standards for a
large shop of RPG/400 programmers using a Windows interface to
the AS/400 development environment. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="verdana,arial,helvetica">Please share the names
and availability of the utilities that Microsoft uses to generate
the .IND (index) files for the Help module, and a snapshot of any
special codes required with the .RTF draft of the Help. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="verdana,arial,helvetica">Since programmers and
anyone else will approach a topic differently, the full-text
search capacity is the answer to our &quot;where is it indexed
now?&quot; dilemma. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="verdana,arial,helvetica">R. Patrick Mallory </font></p>

<h2><font size="2" face="verdana,arial,helvetica">Dr. GUI replies:</font></h2>

<p><font size="2" face="verdana,arial,helvetica">Catchy title, isn't it?
And it really is true. Deadlines just drive me up the wall.
Patrick, if you can figure out this heading, let me know and I
will send you a certificate for a free espresso next time you are
at Microsoft. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="verdana,arial,helvetica">The .IND files are
generated by Multimedia Viewer 1.0, which has been replaced with
the Multimedia Viewer 2.0 retail product and the MediaView
developer's product. You will find MediaView on the Developer
Network Development Platform. The April 1995 issue of the
Development Library will include an article and code for
AutoDuck, which does what you are suggesting and more. This
unsupported tool will take source code from many places and
automatically compile it into a full-text-search multimedia title
similar to the Development Library CD. The sample source
documents used in the demo code include SQL Server scripts, Basic
(Visual Basic and Visual Basic for Applications), batch and
command files, and MS Mail files. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="verdana,arial,helvetica">There are no special
codes required for the .IND files, but you must be careful with
your browse sequence. If the browse sequence contains group
references, they must be declared in the project file. For
example: </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="verdana,arial,helvetica">Admin:00003<br>
User:00003<br>
Dev:0004 </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="verdana,arial,helvetica">would require three
declarations in the project file and would result in three books
appearing in the Search dialog box.</font></p>
