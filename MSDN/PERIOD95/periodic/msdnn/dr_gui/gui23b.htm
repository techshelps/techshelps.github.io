Windows NT3.5 Auto Logon</font>

<p><font size="2" face="verdana,arial,helvetica">Have you ever bought a
really cool, expensive gadget to do something that you could have
done with a 25-cent gadget? But you used the cool, expensive
gadget because it was new and, hey, you didn't know about the
25-cent one? Well, that's what about three thousand of you wrote
to tell me. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="verdana,arial,helvetica">Specifically, I gave a
series of detailed steps to disable auto logon in Windows NT when
another, easier solution was to hold down the shift key while you
click the Logoff button. Now, don't all write to me asking for
shirts, because the first one who sent this clever solution to me
is the one who got the shirt. This is his letter: </font></p>

<h2><font size="2" face="verdana,arial,helvetica">Dear Dr. GUI:</font></h2>

<p><font size="2" face="verdana,arial,helvetica">I couldn't help but
notice the Dr. GUI question about setting Windows NT auto logon
when you've forgotten to give yourself administrative privileges.
The same thing happened to me last month; luckily I didn't have
to follow all the steps you listed. There appears to be a back
door&#151;if you hold down the shift key while logging off, it
brings up the logon dialog box instead of doing an auto logon. I
never found this documented anywhere, and it may be just a
Windows NT 3.5 thing since I haven't tried it with Windows NT
3.1. But it's a lot easier! </font></p>
