<h2><font size="2" face="verdana,arial,helvetica">Dear Dr. GUI:</font></h2>

<p><font size="2" face="verdana,arial,helvetica">I am just itching to
start work on BackOffice development, but I have a couple of
questions. When will the tools necessary to develop good
BackOffice applications be available on MSDN? What is the plan
for the BackOffice SDK? </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="verdana,arial,helvetica">A BackOffice developer
wannabe </font></p>

<h2><font size="2" face="verdana,arial,helvetica">Dr. GUI replies:</font></h2>

<p><font size="2" face="verdana,arial,helvetica">An itch, eh? Have you
tried a good moisturizer or some baby powder? How about some of
that Gold Bond Medicated Cream for that itchy, itchy rash? Well,
not being a real doctor, I'm not sure that I can help with the
itch, so an answer to your two questions will have to suffice. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="verdana,arial,helvetica">If by tools you mean
products such as Visual Basic and Visual C++, those are not
available from the Developer Network. However, your question is
timely (unlike my office hours!) because the Developer Network
has just announced the availability of Level 3. This new level
features the BackOffice Test Platform, which will include all the
BackOffice server components you've come to know and
love&#151;SQL Server, Systems Management Server, Windows NT
Server, SNA Server, and Mail (or Microsoft Exchange) Server. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="verdana,arial,helvetica">In other relevant news,
my nursing staff informs me that the BackOffice SDK was shipped
to Level 2 members in late August with Windows 95 and the Win32
SDK. Whew! That was a lot of info to impart. Now I have a
headache. I'm going to take two aspirin and call myself in the
morning. </font></p>
