<h2><font size="2" face="verdana,arial,helvetica">Dear Dr. GUI:</font></h2>

<p><font size="2" face="verdana,arial,helvetica">Can time slices be
preempted on Windows NT? In other words, if a higher-priority
thread becomes ready, will the lower-priority thread be preempted
within a time slice, or after the time slice? Also, do you need
to raise the thread's priority to real-time critical to do that?
Can the user change how long a time slice is? Any other
information on Windows NT and real time would be helpful. </font></p>

your consultation at a conference </font></p>

<h2><font size="2" face="verdana,arial,helvetica">Dr. GUI replies:</font></h2>

<p><font size="2" face="verdana,arial,helvetica">This is a common
question. However, before I answer it, I need to make the
appropriate disclaimer. All of what I am about to say is subject
to change. You should design your product in such a way that you
can easily flow with the tide. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="verdana,arial,helvetica">Okay, let's talk about
the current situation. When a higher-priority thread becomes
ready to run, the current thread is preempted. Time slices under
Windows NT do not vary in length, except when a thread's priority
is temporarily boosted to prevent priority inversion or
starvation. There is a lot of information about multithreading on
the Microsoft Development Library CD. Jeffrey M. Richter deals
with it in his book <i>Advanced Windows NT</i>, while the
Developer Network's Ruediger Asche has written seven articles on
the topic for the Development Library. Also, keep your eyes open
for Development Library content dealing with Windows NT interrupt
response time and latency. We are acquiring more on this topic. </font></p>
