Files?</font>

<h2><font size="2" face="verdana,arial,helvetica">Dear Dr. GUI:</font></h2>

<p><font size="2" face="verdana,arial,helvetica">I realize my question is
not about the graphical interface, but I will ask it anyway. I
have an application for Windows NT that has a need to know who is
accessing particular files (I hope to then inform the individuals
to get off, but that is a different issue). What would be the
best approach to accomplish this? I figure it should be able to
be done similarly to the way File Manager has the Open By button
on the File/Properties option. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="verdana,arial,helvetica">Thank you,<br>
Rick Kellough<br>
Severna Park, Maryland </font></p>

<h2><font size="2" face="verdana,arial,helvetica">Dr. GUI replies:</font></h2>

<p><font size="2" face="verdana,arial,helvetica">Dr. GUI will answer
non-GUI questions. You just won't get any fun humor to go along
with the answer. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="verdana,arial,helvetica">File Manager goes
through the security layer. Because Windows NT has built-in
security, it is possible to both monitor and control access to
objects, including files, in a Windows NT Server application.
(You should take a look at the excellent series of articles on
security written by Ruediger Asche in the Microsoft Development
Library.) </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="verdana,arial,helvetica">Security works on a
multitude of levels, and, while File Manager goes through
security in the network layer, it is also possible to assign
auditing and security information to individual files on an NTFS
partition. The one thing you CANNOT do using security, however,
is to dynamically assign actions to be taken as soon as a
particular file is accessed. If you need to do that, you will
have to write a kernel-mode device driver that sits on top of the
file system driver and looks at the incoming
Open/Close/Read/Write calls before the &quot;real&quot; file
system driver sees it. </font></p>
