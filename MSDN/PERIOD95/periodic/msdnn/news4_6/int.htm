    <p><font size="5"><b>Windows NT 3.51 Has International Flair
    (and Fonts)</b></font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Lori Hoerth</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">September 1, 1995</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Windows NT 3.51 added support for the
    PowerPC hardware platform as well as a number of other
    features, including some very important international
    functionality. Combined with the functionality that already
    existed in Windows NT 3.5, this new international
    functionality gives users the ability to run localized
    applications on the English product&#151;for example, the
    Greek version of Microsoft Excel on the U.S. version of
    Windows NT.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Windows NT 3.51 provides four main new
    features important to international customers:</font></p>
    <p><font size="2"><b>Locale-sensitive fonts:</b> When the
    language and country are set in the International application
    in Control Panel, all fonts&#151;including console fonts,
    system fonts, and application fonts&#151;are reset to match
    the newly set locale. This allows an English-language system
    to run the Russian version of Windows 3.<i>x</i> applications
    and display all characters correctly when the locale is set
    to Russian.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2"><b>Keyboard switching application:</b>
    Microsoft now ships, as part of every version of Windows NT
    3.51, an application that allows for quick switches of the
    systemwide active keyboard layout between a primary and a
    secondary layout<i>. </i>The keyboard switching application
    can be activated by running KBDSEL.EXE, as shown in Figure 1.</font></p>

    <p><font size="2"><b>Figure 1.</b></font></p>
    <p><font size="2"><b>Large content application fonts:</b> The
    Arial, Times New Roman, and Courier New fonts that ship with
    Windows NT 3.51 are now multicharacter set fonts. These fonts
    contain glyphs for all European languages (including Greek,
    Turkish, and English). These same fonts ship as part of the
    multilingual support on Windows 95. They give users of
    Windows NT 3.51 more choices of fonts they can use, while
    still being able to see multiple scripts within the Windows
    NT shell (that is, File Manager), as shown in Figure 2.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2"><img src="Image382.gif" width="467"
    height="314"></font></p>
    <p><font size="2"><b>Figure 2.</b></font></p>
    <p><font size="2"><b>&quot;Tagged font&quot; mapping:</b>
    Windows NT 3.51 has added font mappings to enable document
    compatibility with existing Greek, Central European, and
    Eastern European documents that have used tagged font face
    names in the localized Windows 3.<i>x</i> environment. For
    example, an existing Microsoft Word document that was created
    on the Greek version of Windows 3.1, using the Greek version
    of Word 6.0, contains Greek text that was created using a
    font named Arial Greek. This document is displayable on a
    Windows NT system, because Windows NT maps Arial Greek to the
    Greek portion of the multicharacter set font named Arial,
    thus being able to display Arial Greek using the Arial font
    that contains Greek glyphs.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">The next release of Windows NT, a shell
    update planned for beta release this fall, will contain all
    of the new multilingual functionality in Windows 95, as well
    as a number of enhancements to allow simpler creation of
    multilingual Unicode applications. A subsequent version of
    Windows NT, codenamed &quot;Cairo,&quot; will increase the
    number of international- and language-based features in
    Windows NT by adding content indexing and language-based
    queries.</font></p>
