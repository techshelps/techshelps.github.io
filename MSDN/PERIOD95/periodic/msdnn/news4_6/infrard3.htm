    <p><font size="5"><b>Wireless Communications for Windows 95</b></font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Mark Williams</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">November 1, 1995</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">The PC connectivity world today is mostly
    wired, with the cable type dictating the application. A link
    over a parallel cable means printing, while a link over a
    serial cable serves a modem. Right now, a user consciously
    needs to start a connection over the cable that matches the
    application. Starting a connection is a hassle that many
    potential computer users just won't put up with.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">As time goes on, wireless communications
    are going to play an increasingly important role in
    computers, particularly for mobile users. As more wireless PC
    connectivity hardware and software become available,
    applications will provide new connectivity features.
    Applications will initiate connectivity on an as-needed
    basis, and a user will not even need to know the connection
    type in order to use it.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Because of its low cost and simple
    implementation, the first widely available wireless
    connectivity medium for PCs is infrared (IR). The engineering
    requirements are straightforward, and the component cost is
    less than $5 per device. Computer system and peripheral
    makers are already integrating infrared devices with
    computers and printers.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3"><b>Microsoft releases IR-related products</b></font></p>
    <p><font size="2">A Microsoft development team that focuses
    on mobile computing issues has just released its first
    products: the Infrared (IR) Communications for Windows 95
    device driver, and the IR Communications for Windows 95
    Device Driver Kit (DDK), which was developed with
    Hewlett-Packard. The driver is also part of the DDK.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Software developers can get the IR
    Communications device driver from the Windows Driver Library
    (WDL) and can install the driver on computers with IR ports
    to add IR capability to Windows 95. Communicating
    applications that use serial and parallel cable links can
    then be tested over the new IR link, which can operate at
    speeds up to 115.2 kilobits per second (kbps).</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Independent hardware vendors (IHVs) and
    original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) can get the IR
    Communications for Windows 95 DDK by contacting their
    Microsoft OEM sales representative. IHVs and OEMs can use the
    sample IR driver source code as a starting point to build IR
    drivers that operate with their IR-capable devices. Examples
    of such IR-capable devices are IR ports built into computer
    platforms, IR adapters that plug into serial and/or parallel
    ports built into computer platforms, LAN-access points,
    remote keyboards, printers, cellular and land-line phones,
    digital cameras, pagers, home entertainment center equipment,
    and kitchen appliances.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Based on feedback from computer
    manufacturers, Microsoft predicts that the majority of new
    portable PC systems will ship with built-in IR ports that are
    compatible with Windows 95. For systems without IR built in,
    Microsoft is working with IHVs that make IR adapters that
    plug into Windows 95-based computer serial ports and provide
    IR capability.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Companies that have not thought of
    themselves as makers of computer peripherals, such as
    manufacturers of kitchen appliances, home entertainment
    centers, and cameras, will likely build IR into their devices
    and become potential Windows 95 IHVs.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">The Infrared Data Association (IrDA) has
    already developed infrared communications standards that are
    accepted by the computer, communications, home entertainment,
    and semiconductor industries. (See &quot;The IrDA and Its
    Standards,&quot; below, for a description of the standards.)
    As long as the makers of these devices strive to comply with
    the IrDA standards, all these different types of IR devices
    will be able to communicate with each other and with
    computers running the IR Communications for Windows 95 device
    driver. In the rest of this article, the term <i>IrDA-compliant
    </i>will be used to refer to all these types of IR devices.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3"><b>Microsoft and IrDA</b></font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Microsoft has been an executive member of
    IrDA since its founding and promotes the IrDA effort to
    standardize infrared communications protocols across the
    industry. Microsoft's infrared products are designed to
    comply with the IrDA specifications. This ensures
    interoperability between IR-capable computers running Windows
    95 and all other devices that support the IrDA
    specifications.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">If you are an independent software vendor
    (ISV) writing applications for IR-capable computers running
    Windows 95, IR drivers built with the IR Communications for
    Windows 95 DDK enable you to use standard Win32
    communications APIs to transfer data between IrDA-compliant
    devices. Many existing applications that communicate over
    serial and/or parallel cables using these APIs will
    communicate over IrDA-compliant IR links without any
    reprogramming.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Microsoft's future IR products will also be
    designed to comply with the evolving IrDA standards, which
    will take advantage of the dynamic, ad-hoc nature of the
    media and hardware advances (such as fast IR data exchange at
    speeds up to 4.0 mbps).</font></p>
    <p><font size="3"><b>Scenarios with IrDA-capable devices</b></font></p>
    <p><font size="2">People will be able to use their computers
    in new ways when IR communications are added to Windows 95
    and IrDA-compliant devices abound. Here is a tale that
    illustrates some of these.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2"><b><i>In the workplace and on business
    trips.</i></b> Most workers will have an IR-capable desktop
    computer and an IR-capable portable computer. The portable is
    either &quot;docked&quot; to the desktop or carried with the
    worker as she roams between office buildings and labs.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">To prepare for a meeting, the portable
    owner downloads the departmental project schedule information
    from a LAN database to the desktop, adds some late-breaking
    information that is only on her desktop PC, and then squirts
    a filtered set of schedule information to the portable using
    the IR link.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">When she arrives at the meeting in a nearby
    building, all the attendees have IR-capable laptops loaded
    with their department's part of the schedule. During the
    beginning of the meeting, each worker uses the laptop to
    check schedule facts, take notes, revise the dependencies in
    their schedules, and squirt schedule facts to each other as
    needed.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">During the break, workers with access to an
    IR-capable LAN access point, which will be available in most
    meeting rooms, can use laptops to send and receive e-mail
    messages relevant to the meeting.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">After the break, the attendees collaborate
    on a new schedule by using IR-capable conferencing software
    on their portables. When a realistic schedule is hammered
    out, one worker with the agreed-upon schedule on her portable
    leaves immediately for the airport to fly to a board meeting
    to present the schedule.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">She uses the laptop to continue exchanging
    e-mail messages in the airport and hotel by using an
    IR-capable public phone. While in transit, she receives
    detailed messages about the upcoming board meeting on her
    IR-capable pager and organizes the messages by squirting them
    into the IR-capable personal information manager (PIM)
    application on her laptop.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">In a hotel room, she uses the notebook to
    add the latest schedule information to an electronic slide
    presentation. In the hotel business service center, she uses
    the IR-capable presentation graphics software to squirt the
    slide images to an IR-capable laser printer, producing
    handouts for the meeting.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">At the board meeting, she displays the
    electronic slides to an audience by squirting them one at a
    time from the notebook computer to a high-speed IR-capable
    large screen video projector (some slides have digital video
    and audio clips that demonstrate the physical processes
    underlying the schedule dependencies she is presenting).</font></p>
    <p><font size="2"><b><i>At home or as tourists</i></b><b>.</b>
    After the board meeting, she takes her family's IR-capable
    digital camera and one of the family's IR-capable handheld
    PCs out of her luggage and heads for the sprawling
    combination super mall/amusement park.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">She doesn't have much time, so she
    immediately goes to an IR-capable information kiosk and
    downloads a user interface onto her handheld PC through the
    IR port. She uses the interface to navigate symbolically
    through the acres of attractions and to query the information
    kiosk for squirts of detailed information about some of the
    attractions.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">When she locates an attraction her kids are
    interested in, she walks there and takes some snapshots. When
    she gets back to the hotel, she squirts the best of the
    snapshots from her IR-capable digital camera to the
    IR-capable laptop. She uses the hotel business center to send
    an e-mail message home that asks her son to pick her up at
    the airport, with the digital snapshots as attachments.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Meanwhile, her son and a friend are
    attending a lecture at the local college campus. They use
    their handhelds to download the class handouts and the next
    homework assignment from the professor's IR-capable portable
    computer. They collaborate on the assignment during the
    lecture, and on the way out they squirt the completed
    assignment back onto the professor's computer.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">In the off-campus CyberCafe, they start
    going over the lecture notes they downloaded and then surf
    the Internet, using the cafe's IR access point, looking for
    information that will invalidate what they have just been
    told by their professor.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3"><b>Getting into IR</b></font></p>
    <p><font size="2">OK, so maybe the average person wouldn't
    have such a computer-filled day. However, all the uses
    described here will become possible. And Microsoft has plans
    to develop extensions to Windows for other wireless media in
    addition to IR. Can you imagine other scenarios, especially
    when other forms of wireless communication, such as radio
    frequency (RF) or cellular data, are integrated with
    computers?</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Here are some basic suggestions for getting
    started with the low-cost IR media that is available today:</font></p>
    <blockquote>
        <p><font size="2">&#149; Purchase a couple of IR-capable
        devices designed to be IrDA-compliant.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">&#149; Start experimenting with the
        Microsoft IrDA-compliant IR Communications for Windows 95
        DDK.</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font size="3"><b>Purchasing IR-capable devices</b></font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Current infrared devices designed to be
    IrDA-compliant operate over a minimum range of one meter
    between transmitter and receiver, and within a 30-degree
    angled cone. The current IrDA specification is optimized for
    point-to-point links between two or more devices. Keeping the
    cone angle narrow minimizes problems associated with
    interference and &quot;hidden transmitters.&quot; The first
    revision of the IrDA specification provides for up to 115.2
    kbps serial infrared links. Several notebook computers
    already include built-in IR ports with these characteristics.
    These computers include DEC HiNote Ultra, Gateway 2000
    Liberty, HP Omnibook, IBM ThinkPad, Midwest Micro Elite, and
    Texas Instruments 5000.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">IR adapters that add IR capability to
    Windows-based computers by plugging into a serial port are
    available for as little as US$35 from numerous peripheral
    manufacturers. See below (&quot;IR Adapter
    Manufacturers&quot;) for the names and addresses of the
    manufacturers of adapters that have been tested using the
    Microsoft IR driver.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Printer manufacturers are also supporting
    IR communications. New printer models, such as the
    Hewlett-Packard LaserJet 5MP, feature an IR port in addition
    to the usual serial and parallel interfaces. These printers
    can communicate wirelessly with portable PCs and other
    infrared devices.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3"><b>Experimenting with the IR communications
    products</b></font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Once you have a couple of IR devices that
    are designed to meet the IrDA specifications, you can use the
    IR Communications for Windows 95 device driver to start
    exchanging data between applications using the IR devices. To
    work with the IR Communications driver, applications must use
    the Win32 communications APIs.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">IHVs and OEMs can use the sample C-language
    source code in the IR Communications for Windows 95 DDK to
    develop an IR device driver for new IR-capable devices. The
    DDK documentation pinpoints the few lines of code you will
    have to change in the sample IR driver source code to
    implement your own low-level driver. The IR Communications
    DDK is available from your Microsoft OEM sales
    representative.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">The IR Communications for Windows 95 SDK
    will provide a set of APIs and protocols for IR links that go
    beyond the Win32 communications APIs. These include:</font></p>
    <blockquote>
        <p><font size="2">&#149; IR Sockets APIs, which enable
        application developers to quickly port existing Windows
        Sockets applications to use IR links.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">&#149; File Transfer APIs, which enable
        application developers to use files as units of transfer
        over IR links.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">&#149; Object Exchange protocol, which
        enables developers to transfer small units of information
        (objects) such as business cards, address book entries,
        or sales transaction records over IR links and keep the
        objects on different computers in synchronization with
        each other.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">&#149; IrLAN protocol, which enables
        applications to access information on networks of many
        different protocols and addressing schemes through an IR
        port.</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font size="2">Looking ahead, the SDK Beta is scheduled to
    be available on an upcoming release of the Microsoft
    Development Platform. The final version of the SDK is slated
    for release in the second quarter of 1996.</font></p>
