    <p><a name="_Toc333732454"><font size="5"><b>The Windows 95
    Graphics Architecture</b></font></a></p>
    <p><font size="2">November 1, 1995</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">The Windows 95 operating system includes an
    extensible graphics architecture designed to deliver high
    levels of performance in bitmap graphics, 3-D graphics, and
    digital video playback. Developers have a choice of APIs, all
    of which exploit hardware acceleration. Microsoft has unified
    the display device driver interface so that manufacturers of
    graphics hardware accelerators need only provide a single,
    simple-to-install display driver to accelerate the suite of
    graphics APIs for the Windows operating system.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Although each graphics API targets a
    particular class of application or area of need, synergy
    among the technologies enables developers to use as much or
    as little of the technologies as they need, and to switch
    between them fluidly.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Which API developers select is determined
    by the requirements of their applications:</font></p>
    <blockquote>
        <p><font size="2">&#149; <b>Productivity application
        graphics.</b> Applications that require assistance in
        drawing general-purpose 2-D graphics primitives and fonts
        use graphics device interface (GDI) functions. GDI now
        includes the device-independent bitmap (DIB) engine,
        which provides device-independent raster graphics
        operations. WinG functionality is now built into the DIB
        engine as the <b>CreateDIBSection</b> function.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">&#149; <b>Digital video playback.</b>
        Applications designed to play video use the<i> </i>Video
        for Windows API. Now fully integrated into Windows 95,
        Video for Windows uses DirectVideo to exploit hardware
        acceleration and improve video playback.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">&#149; <b>Bitmap graphics.</b> System
        components and applications such as games that require
        bitmaps to be blasted to the screen as quickly as
        possible use the Microsoft DirectDraw API, a
        general-purpose composition engine for raster graphics.
        (See &quot;Programming for the Windows 95 SDK,&quot; <i>Developer
        Network News</i>, July/August 1995.)<i> </i>DirectDraw
        exploits the capabilities of today's high-powered 2-D
        graphics accelerators to deliver frame rates that are
        faster than those possible with either the WinG API or
        the <b>CreateDIBSection</b> function.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">&#149; <b>Consumer 3-D graphics.</b>
        Developers creating applications such as games (which
        require real-time, fully interactive 3-D graphics) use
        Reality Lab, a comprehensive, real-time 3-D rendering
        library designed for consumer platforms. See the news
        article &quot;Microsoft Demonstrates High-Performance
        Engine and Graphics Accelerator Card for Games on Windows
        95&quot; in the <i>For Developers Only</i> section of the
        World Wide Web (http://www.microsoft.com.devnews) and The
        Microsoft Network (go devnetnews). Developers creating or
        porting 3-D applications and games that require the
        highest degrees of control, flexibility, and performance
        can use the Microsoft Direct3D API to directly render 3-D
        graphics and exploit the capabilities of new 3-D hardware
        accelerators. Reality Lab achieves its hardware
        acceleration via Direct3D.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">&#149; <b>Professional 3-D graphics.</b>
        Developers creating high-end CAD, engineering, or 3-D
        modeling applications use OpenGL to deliver the high
        levels of accuracy required by such applications.</font></p>
