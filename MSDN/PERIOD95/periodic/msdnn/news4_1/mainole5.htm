    <p><font size="5"><b>Industrial Strength OLE: Using
    Microsoft's Object Technology to Build Business Solutions</b></font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Charlie Kindel<br>
    Program Manager, Developer Relations Group</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">OLE Industry Solutions is the term
    Microsoft uses to describe its efforts on behalf of a series
    of industry-specific initiatives to help groups of software
    vendors, solution providers, and customers in varied
    industries and vertical markets develop and market OLE-based
    standards.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">There is no formal process involved in OLE
    Industry Solutions, but each initiative shares the same
    goal&#151;to gain widespread adoption of OLE-based standards
    that solve business problems. These standards can be built on
    top of existing Microsoft-defined interfaces, or they can be
    entirely new interfaces designed to meet specific business
    needs. In either case, the interfaces are specified using the
    rules set forth by the OLE Component Object Model.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3"><b>The evolution of OLE</b></font></p>
    <p><font size="2">In 1991 Microsoft released OLE 1.0, the
    first widely adopted specification for developing
    compound-document applications. A compound document is one
    that contains multiple data types, such as text, graphics,
    and video.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">This was followed in early 1993 by the
    release of OLE 2.0, which provided a much richer
    compound-document model as well as OLE Automation (which
    permits applications to expose command sets that operate
    within and across applications), OLE Drag and Drop (which
    allows objects to be dragged from one application and dropped
    into another), and generic services (which are applicable
    across almost any problem domain).</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">At the core of OLE 2.0 is the Component
    Object Model (COM), a specification that allows developers to
    design interfaces that enable interaction among components.
    In fact, OLE 2.0 is simply a set of COM interfaces designed
    by Microsoft.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3"><b>OLE interfaces</b></font></p>
    <p><font size="2">The interfaces defined in the OLE 2.0
    specification can be generally categorized as follows:</font></p>
    <blockquote>
        <p><font size="2"><b>&#149;</b> <b>OLE generic services.</b>
        These interfaces are truly generic in nature and can be
        used in almost any problem domain. Examples include the
        uniform data transfer interfaces (<b>IDataObject </b>and <b>IAdviseSink</b>),
        memory management interfaces (<b>IMalloc</b>), and
        storage interfaces (<b>IStorage</b> and <b>IStream</b>).</font></p>
        <p><font size="2"><b>&#149;</b> <b>OLE Documents.</b> The
        OLE 2.0 specification contains about a dozen interfaces
        that deal specifically with compound documents. These
        interfaces typically have names starting with <b>IOle</b>;
        for example, <b>IOleObject</b>, <b>IOleWindow</b>, <b>IOleInPlaceSite</b>,
        and so on.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2"><b>&#149;</b> <b>OLE Automation.</b>
        The OLE 2.0 specification defines a set of six interfaces
        that together make up OLE Automation: <b>IDispatch</b>, <b>ITypeInfo</b>,
        <b>ITypeLib</b>, <b>IEnumVARIANT</b>, <b>ICreateTypeInfo</b>,
        and <b>ICreateTypeLib</b>.</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font size="2">Microsoft followed up OLE 2.0 by releasing
    in October 1994 the OLE Controls specification, which defines
    the COM interfaces used by OLE Controls (for example, <b>IOleControl</b>).
    The OLE Controls specification also defined some new
    &quot;generic&quot; interfaces that are used by OLE Controls
    but are useful in other contexts as well. These include <b>IConnectionPoint</b>
    and <b>IConnectionPointContainer</b>.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Microsoft will continue to expand OLE by
    defining additional COM interfaces. For example, the current
    OLE 2.0 specification for compound documents does not specify
    interfaces that would allow embeddings to span multiple
    pages. Microsoft intends to address this shortcoming in the
    not-too-distant future by defining new COM interfaces.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3"><b>Finding &quot;safe&quot; ground for
    standards</b></font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Anybody can extend OLE by defining COM
    interfaces; in fact, many independent software vendors (ISVs)
    have defined their own COM interfaces for use within their
    applications. The procedure for defining and using new COM
    interfaces is fully documented in the OLE 2.0 Software
    Development Kit, which is available in the Developer Network
    Development Library.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">The difficult part is getting other
    companies to use the new interfaces. To understand why, look
    at the computer game market. Imagine that an enterprising
    software company, XYZ, designs a set of COM interfaces that
    define the interactions between arbitrary &quot;game
    boards&quot; and &quot;game pieces&quot; so that users can
    build their own games.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">How does XYZ get other game software
    companies to write game boards and game pieces? The software
    game industry is pretty competitive, and it's not at all
    clear that any two companies are willing to cooperate. In
    addition, XYZ may have missed a design point important to
    another class of game. What is needed is a neutral party that
    can provide a safe meeting place and allow these companies to
    get together to develop industry standards. Microsoft hopes
    that its OLE Industry Solutions can serve as a way to bring
    all those concerned together to agree on standards.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3"><b>What is an &quot;industry&quot;?</b></font></p>
    <p><font size="2">The term &quot;industry&quot; is used here
    to describe any community of software vendors, solution
    providers, or customers concerned with a common set of
    business problems. Some of these communities are defined by
    the vendors who develop products to solve specific, or
    &quot;vertical,&quot; problems. Examples of vertical markets
    include:</font></p>
    <blockquote>
        <p><font size="2">&#149; The market data industry. This
        is the community of companies within the capital markets
        sector of the financial services industry that produce
        and consume market data. For example, firms such as
        Reuters sell market data that is delivered, via software,
        in real time to brokerage houses, banks, and individual
        investors.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">&#149; The engineering design industry.
        This industry includes companies such as Intergraph,
        Autodesk, and Cadance, which sell 3-D computer-aided
        design (3-D CAD) modeling and other technical
        applications.</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font size="2">Other communities, such as insurance
    companies and retail bankers, are defined not by their
    solution vendors but by their customers. Currently a group of
    life insurance ISVs is working on an OLE-based standard to
    reduce manual processes and provide interapplication
    communication for the life insurance sales and marketing
    desktop. (See &quot;OLE for Life Insurance Aims at
    Integration.&quot;)</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">A group of leading suppliers to the retail
    banking industry, known as the Banking Solutions Vendor
    Council, has developed an API standard for accessing
    banking-specific devices from Windows-based applications.
    This group is now investigating the encapsulation of this
    specification in standard OLE interfaces.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3"><b>Microsoft's role</b></font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Each industry and vertical market has
    different needs, politics, and problems. In some industries
    an existing standards body is interested in defining
    standards based on OLE. In this case Microsoft will provide
    technical information and marketing support to that standards
    body. An example of this is the work going on in one of the
    special-interest groups within the healthcare industry's HL7
    standards body. HL7 is a standards-setting organization for
    healthcare information systems. (See &quot;OLE industry
    solutions listings&quot; in the &quot;Additional
    Information&quot; section at the end of this article.)</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">In other industries no standards group
    exists, but there are highly motivated vendors and customers
    interested in forming such a body. In this case Microsoft
    would work to provide meeting facilities on &quot;neutral
    turf&quot; to get all the interested parties together. The
    Open Market Data Council for Windows, which defined the
    WOSA/XRT standard, is an example of this kind of approach.
    (See &quot;OLE for Real-Time Market Data resources&quot; in
    the &quot;Additional Information&quot; section at the end of
    this article.)</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">In the engineering industry, several
    companies that are early adopters of OLE technology are
    taking the initiative to define a set of COM interfaces for
    3-D CAD and other engineering applications. These companies
    are willing to put this specification in the public domain in
    the hope that the power of such a standard will be so
    compelling that other vendors in the industry will adopt them
    as well. Microsoft will hold design reviews of this
    technology, allowing all companies interested to provide
    input into the design. Microsoft will help these vendors to
    publish this extension to OLE, to hold developer conferences,
    and to distribute sample code and documentation widely.</font></p>

    Information&quot; (below) show which OLE Industry Solutions
    currently exist, their status, and where to get more
    information. If you are involved in an industry or vertical
    market not represented here, and you are interested in

    <p><font size="3"><b>OLE for Real-Time Market Data (WOSA/XRT)
    resources</b></font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Windows Open Services Architecture (WOSA)
    is a set of technologies for streamlining access to services
    and data on the Windows platform. WOSA/XRT, or WOSA
    Extensions for Real-Time Market Data, is just one of many
    components that fall under the WOSA umbrella.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">The WOSA/XRT standard is based on OLE. The
    standard was defined by the Open Market Data Council for
    Windows (OMDC), an organization of more than 75 independent
    software vendors, solution providers, data vendors, and
    customers from the capital markets sector of the financial
    services industry. WOSA/XRT is currently the only WOSA
    standard based completely on OLE.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">WOSA/XRT was the first of the OLE Industry
    Solutions and thus serves as a model for other OLE Industry
    Solutions. However, WOSA/XRT is also different from all other
    OLE Industry Solutions because it is the only such solution
    that is part of WOSA.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3"><b>WOSA/XRT technical resources</b></font></p>
    <p><font size="2">In February 1994, the OMDC released version
    1.0 of the WOSA/XRT Design Specification. In March 1994,
    Microsoft held a developers' conference and made available a
    set of WOSA/XRT technical articles and sample code. In
    October, version 1.01 of the WOSA/XRT Specification was
    released, and articles and samples were updated to reflect
    the new specification. The specification, articles, and
    samples are available in the January 1995 release of the
    Developer Network Development Library. Below are brief
    descriptions of the articles and samples.</font></p>

    <p><font size="2">&quot;XRTXL5: Real-Time Extensions for
    Microsoft Excel.&quot; This article provides detailed
    information on how to use a Microsoft Excel 5.0 add-in module
    from the perspective of end users as well as developers using
    Visual Basic for Applications. Microsoft has also developed
    an AddIn sample that enhances the ability of Microsoft Excel
    to interact with WOSA/XRT data objects. While the Microsoft
    Excel 5.0 OLE support works fine with WOSA/XRT data objects,
    AddIn provides for additional performance, robustness, and
    ease of use.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">The following technical articles in the
    Development Library, although generalized to OLE, were
    originally written to help WOSA/XRT developers:
    &quot;Implementing OLE Automation Collections,&quot;
    &quot;Local vs. InProc Objects in OLE,&quot; and &quot;OLE
    Component Design Issues.&quot; Please note that any article
    related to OLE is also relevant to WOSA/XRT.</font></p>
