    <p><font size="5"><b>Are We Meeting Your Needs?</b></font></p>
    <p><font size="3"><b>The Developer Network wants to hear from
    you. Really.</b></font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Nigel Thompson<br>
    Technical Writer, Developer Network Technology Group</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">This is a plea for feedback. We here at the
    Developer Network hole ourselves up in our offices day after
    day, researching, writing, editing, rewriting, re-editing
    articles. But in the midst of this frenzied activity, it's
    important for us not to lose sight of what you&#151;our
    readership&#151;want and need.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">We'd like to do everything. But, frankly,
    we can't. There are currently six technical writers in the
    Developer Network (not counting Dr. GUI, because he mostly
    just sharpens scalpels and samples medicinal brandy). These
    courageous half-dozen scribblers arrive at work each day to
    confront hundreds of function calls in Windows, hundreds of
    calls in OLE, hundreds of member functions in the Microsoft
    Foundation Class Library, and hundreds of data structures. On
    top of that, several versions of Windows are either shipping
    or under development.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Given this vast sea of potential subject
    matter (with more being added all the time), what should we
    write about? In the beginning this was actually an easy
    decision. We simply picked the most common questions logged
    by our Product Support Services group. We tried not only to
    answer the questions but also to show how Windows works
    internally, and thus hopefully give readers a better
    understanding of the problems. Because most questions
    concerned the user interface (and how to get it to look the
    way you want), one of our writers spent many months writing
    exclusively on this topic.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">As the Developer Network matured (or at
    least got out of diapers), things changed a bit. The common
    questions ran out, Windows NT shipped, and Windows 95
    (Chicago in a former life) development went full-speed ahead.
    So our writing team could for the first time explain
    operating system features and how to use them <i>before</i> a
    product shipped. Some of us moved to developing under Windows
    NT and wrote about that experience. One writer spent months
    inside the Windows NT source code (and its developers'
    offices) researching a series of articles on how memory is
    managed in Windows NT and what it means for developers. This
    was a radical departure from our earlier style, where we were
    trying to play catch-up with Windows-based programming
    problems.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Through all this, our team tended to focus
    on trying to produce well-researched, comprehensive technical
    articles. We chose this approach because it interests us, and
    also because we hope these articles serve our audience best.
    On the other side of the coin, it takes us a lot of
    work&#151;and time&#151;to produce each article.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3"><b>Your input is requested</b></font></p>
    <p><font size="2">The question is: Is it worth it to you,
    dear reader? For example, do you feel that you're getting
    what you want from our technical articles? Are they worth all
    the time we spend researching them, or would you prefer that
    we shift our focus and crank out lots of sample applications
    more in the style of the Windows Software Development Kit
    (SDK)&#151;lots of code and &quot;neat&quot; features but
    little or no text to accompany them?</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">And really that's why we are running this
    article. We want to hear from you&#151;seriously. We know
    that you are a busy person, and that your computer is way too
    old and too slow. And that the fax machine is constantly on
    the fritz, and that you love e-mail like a poke in the eye
    with a sharp stick. All that aside, we still want to know
    what you think. As they say in all elections: &quot;Your vote
    counts.&quot; So here are a few questions that we'd like you
    to answer. Feel free to make up your own questions if you
    don't like ours.</font></p>
    <blockquote>
        <p><font size="2">1. What areas would you like to see
        covered?</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">2. Is it helpful to include
        documentation for the functions and structures used?</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">3. Is it helpful to provide an
        &quot;overview&quot; article and then a follow-up article
        that goes into more detail?</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">4. Would you prefer to have samples
        that are more &quot;functional&quot; (the trade-off being
        that the sample would be larger, so determining how to do
        some simple thing would take a bit longer)?</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">5. What areas have already been covered
        well enough (and we should therefore quit writing about
        them)?</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">6. Is it useful to see articles on beta
        systems even if you don't have the system or the SDK?</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">7. We have a lot of C++ articles now.
        As a C programmer, do they still provide what you want?</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">8. Do you need to know more about OLE?</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">9. Do you understand the merits of the
        different Windows platforms and what it takes to support
        them?</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">10. Anything else you can think of.</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font size="2">We really would like to hear from you.
    We're all having fun here, experimenting and writing
    articles, but unless you benefit from our efforts what's the
