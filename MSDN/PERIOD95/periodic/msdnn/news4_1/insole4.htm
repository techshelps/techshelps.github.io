    <p><font size="5"><b>OLE for Life Insurance Aims at
    Integration</b></font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Joe Long<br>
    Technical Evangelist, Developer Relations Group</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">The insurance industry can be divided into
    three main categories: life, health, and property and
    casualty. In the property and casualty industry, a number of
    vendors provide solutions that completely automate the
    agency. Life insurance, however, has no true counterpart to
    these systems, so life insurance firms must purchase
    solutions from multiple vendors, and then pay the vendors or
    consultants to integrate the applications.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">This usually means modifying the
    applications to share information using a flat file transfer.
    This &quot;one off&quot; consulting is expensive, so life
    insurance companies typically don't buy a lot of software,
    nor do they upgrade existing software much. Integration is
    also minimal&#151;each application typically has its own
    database and data entry screens. It is unusual, without
    manual intervention, to have changes in one database
    reflected in another.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">OLE for Life Insurance is designed to be a
    first step toward integrating these systems. OLE for Life
    Insurance is being created by an industry group called
    Solutions for Life Insurance Enterprise Computing (SLIEC),
    which consists of Microsoft, Andersen Consulting, FDP, E-Z
    Data, Lincoln National, and Sterling Wentworth.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">OLE for Life Insurance is a protocol for an
    OLE control. Like WOSA/XRT (see<i> </i>&quot;OLE for
    Real-Time Market Data Resources&quot;), OLE for Life
    Insurance defines no new interfaces. Instead, it relies on
    OLE Automation, uniform data transfer, and OLE events.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">It works by providing an OLE interface
    (using OLE Automation collections) to a common logical
    database to store &quot;common&quot; information. This
    information initially pertains to clients or customers; for
    example, addresses, telephone numbers, or risks such as
    skydiving, race-car driving, smoking, and so on.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">A typical application that is written to
    use OLE for Life Insurance will use OLE Automation to get
    access to this common data. The OLE control keeps a pointer
    to the object in the running object table, which is a list of
    globally available objects, so that each application that
    accesses data uses the same object.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">This enables the object to
    &quot;watch&quot; what information is being accessed,
    modified, or deleted. Each application that is using the OLE
    control is notified of any change to the data. Using this
    allows applications to obtain all important information
    pertinent to a particular client, such as whether a different
    application is currently working on that client's record. In
    other words, by using the running object table,
    interapplication communication becomes an integral part of
    the architecture.</font></p>
