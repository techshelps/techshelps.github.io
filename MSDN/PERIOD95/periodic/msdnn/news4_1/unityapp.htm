    <p><font size="5"><b>Rx for Healthcare Info Management Pains</b></font></p>
    <p><font size="3"><b>Windows NT Server and Microsoft SQL
    Server help provide the cure</b></font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Sherri Wender<br>
    Marketing Consultant</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">As is the case with most healthcare
    providers, efficiency and productivity are increasingly
    important to the United Kingdom's National Health Service
    (NHS). Following major reform in 1991, the previously
    centralized national health program is now structured so that
    each hospital runs as a self-managed provider, competing with
    neighboring hospitals for contracts to deliver health
    services.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">This means that each institution's income
    depends on bidding for contracts successfully. Because the
    requirements for contracts may change from year to year,
    hospitals now must be able to meet purchasers' changing needs
    flexibly and rapidly. This makes it hard for hospitals to
    predict their long-term role, size, and information
    requirements.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">To be successful in this new environment,
    managers and clinicians must have rapid access to information
    upon which to base both operational management and strategy.
    Effective information management becomes crucial.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3"><b>New system needed</b></font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Until the recent reforms, regional health
    authorities procured and implemented information systems for
    hospitals. These systems were designed primarily to meet
    central rather than local needs. Ease of use was not a
    priority.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">These systems, designed primarily for data
    collection, in general resided on minicomputers or mainframes
    and ran a variety of unintegrated software packages.
    Accessing or analyzing information and generating reports,
    particularly in a timely manner, was very difficult.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">With the advent of health-service reforms,
    an increasing number of services and organizations needed to
    gain access to common information, and the lack of database
    connectivity between these systems created huge problems.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">The absence of a comprehensive system for
    handling all patient-related information, including
    diagnosis, treatment, and finances, resulted in higher
    healthcare costs and a lack of information needed to support
    management decisions effectively.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">In response to this problem, West London
    NHS Healthcare Trust was selected as a national pilot site
    for the development of a new breed of information system.</font><font
    color="#FF00FF" size="2"> </font><font size="2">This new
    system was designed to serve as the model for information
    delivery for the National Health Service patient information
    system.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">The system had to be easy to maintain,
    scalable, flexible, secure, and user-friendly. Nurses,
    doctors, and administrators needed to be able to capture and
    have access to complete, accurate, up-to-date information
    about a patient. All clinicians needed access to records to
    help audit their areas of responsibility.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Mike Morgan, director of application
    development for the West London NHS Trust and a former
    practicing physician, was chosen to lead a three-person
    development team that was tasked with meeting these ambitious
    objectives.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3"><b>Visualizing a solution</b></font></p>
    <p><font size="2">The ability to take advantage of reusable
    components in development to save time and money was
    particularly important to Morgan. After evaluating the
    alternatives, he decided that a solution using various
    Microsoft tools and server products would provide better
    functionality, closer integration, and more cost benefits
    than the alternatives.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">The new system was developed with the
    Microsoft Visual C++ development system and the Visual Basic
    programming system. It runs the Windows for Workgroups
    operating system on the front end and the Windows NT Server
    network operating system and Microsoft SQL Server on the back
    end. The smaller installations use the Microsoft Access
    database management system.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">The development team's positive experience
    with the use of Visual Basic in modeling the new system
    persuaded it to use Visual Basic as a key part of actual
    system development. &quot;We learned quickly we had
    underestimated the power of Visual Basic. We thought it was
    only a prototyping tool, a toy. We were wrong!&quot; Morgan
    said. &quot;Both the speed of developing the application with
    Visual Basic and the speed of the application itself
    impressed us. We immediately saw what a strong complement
    Visual Basic is to Visual C++, so we used both.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Morgan's team developed the core tools,
    such as dockable button arrays, dockable forms, and custom
    data entry VBXes, in Visual C++ and then reused those tools
    in Visual Basic. &quot;We used Visual C++ to develop our own
    VBXes, optimizing for speed, and then Visual Basic easily
    integrated the functionality written in the VBX,&quot;
    explained Morgan. &quot;Using the reusable, prebuilt code in
    the Microsoft Foundation Class Library, or MFC, definitely
    shortened the development process for us.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">In addition to taking advantage of MFC,
    Morgan's team made extensive use of open database
    connectivity (ODBC) and OLE object technology. &quot;The
    built-in ODBC support was important to us,&quot; Morgan said.
    &quot;OLE object technology was also a significant part of
    our development efforts. For example, we were impressed with
    the PivotTable dynamic views functionality in Microsoft Excel
    and wanted to emulate that in our reporting system. We
    started to design the same functionality and then realized
    that with OLE object technology in Visual Basic we could just
    embed the PivotTable. We were able to add a tremendous amount
    of functionality without having to redevelop.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Morgan's developers also wanted to make all
    the windows include ToolTips and wanted resizable windows. So
    they bought off-the-shelf VBXes and added that functionality
    in Visual Basic in a day. &quot;We also created a
    &#145;specialist' integrating functionality so it is easy to
    reshape and remold the application without having to
    recompile,&quot; he added.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3"><b>Technical info and server products ease
    integration</b></font></p>
    <p><font size="2">The Microsoft Developer Network played an
    important part in the process of creating the new system by
    providing the developers with technical information and
    resources&#151;such as source-code examples and articles
    about developing software under Windows NT in its Development
    Library, and software development kits (SDKs) via its
    Development Platform. In addition, the developers benefited
    from the support of the Microsoft Public Sector team in the
    United Kingdom.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Windows NT Server and Microsoft SQL Server,
    both part of Microsoft BackOffice, also eased the development
    process. Explained Morgan, &quot;We wanted to get to where we
    could manage all of our resources in an integrated fashion
    from the desktops throughout the whole system. We don't view
    networking as separate. The benefits of an integrated desktop
    and file-server operating system rapidly became
    apparent.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">After looking at the cost/benefit of
    Microsoft SQL Server and comparing it to other solutions,
    Morgan said his team realized that it could get better
    performance and save money with a dual Pentium AS running
    Windows NT Server and Microsoft SQL Server.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">&quot;One of the pluses of Windows NT
    Server is that APIs are the same for both client and server.
    Additionally, because of the nature of medical records, total
    security is critical&#151;Windows NT Server gives us a
    reliable, secure foundation,&quot; Morgan pointed out.
    &quot;Using Microsoft SQL Server Programmer's Toolkit, we
    found it easy to integrate SQL Server with other data and
    systems. Windows NT Server and Microsoft SQL Server can scale
    to as many or as few PCs as desired, which eliminates the
    need to have a total hardware change.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font size="3"><b>Voilà, Unity</b></font></p>
    <p><font size="2">In January 1994, at a development cost of
    only £200,000, Unity, as the new system is called, was
    completed.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">The system, which has undergone extensive
    pilot testing, integrates information from the wide number of
    data sources. When fully installed it will run with 4 servers
    and more than 100 client PCs; each server manages from 1 to 2
    gigabytes of data.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">&quot;Without the flexibility of a product
    like Unity, it would not be possible to develop healthcare
    information systems capable of responding at the same rate of
    change as we're experiencing with healthcare reform. The key
    to Unity is the rapidity with which you can change
    information,&quot; pointed out Laurence Pearce, manager of
    information strategy and development for the West London NHS
    Trust.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Unity contains two main programs: a toolkit
    and the information desktop. The toolkit maps the information
    requirements of an organization into an object-oriented
    model, providing direct benefits to end users. Rather than
    mapping information requirements directly to database
    structures, the toolkit builds up a reference of where
    elements of information may be accessed. This allows Unity to
    integrate data from a large number of platforms and enables
    users to query across multiple platforms transparently.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Once the object model and security issues
    have been established, the toolkit builds a template that
    configures the information desktop that each user sees. This
    information desktop is dynamic and self-building so that when
    new information is added to the system, it can automatically
    be made available to end users.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">The transition from one database to another
    is seamless to the user. Because all types of information,
    including multimedia, are handled in an identical manner, the
    user sees only one consistent view of the organization's
    information. The system is designed for easy setup and
    maintenance, since the front end is automatically created for
    each user based upon the defined data objects and the user's
    access rights within the system's flexible configuration. It
    is also easy to extend and modify&#151;any number of new data
    sources can be added to the system, which are then
    automatically available to users.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Users can easily customize their desktops
    to display information that is relevant to them. Custom
    address books, toolbars, and drag-and-drop reporting make it
    easy even for novices to use.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3"><b>Bucking traditional systems</b></font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Morgan views a flexible approach as
    dramatically different from the traditional systems approach.
    &quot;Previously you would sit with the user and work through
    what the system needed to do. You'd get specifications, and
    then a year later you'd have a system that was no longer what
    was needed. You couldn't keep up to date. Now it's
    easy.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">In addition to providing a flexible, secure
    environment, Unity has reduced costs and improved efficiency
    and quality. At the pilot site, the elimination of
    overlapping administrative costs has saved £200,000
    annually, a figure that is expected to rise to £300,000 by
    the third year.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Users find the system easy to learn and
    use, which reduces training costs. Quality-of-care
    improvements will lead to a better service at lower cost.
    According to a recent study, if the savings estimated at the
    pilot site were replicated across the NHS, the total amount
    saved could be as much as £100 million in as little as five
    years.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">This approach to handling information in an
    object-oriented fashion has created interest within a number
    of other industries that face similar problems in data
    integration and management. In response to this demand,
    Morgan has independently taken Unity forward as a commercial
    product. Through his company, Open Mind Design Ltd., he
    intends to make the solution available to solution providers
    and end users in a large number of industries.</font></p>
