    <p><font size="5"><b>Desktop Developers Get Client-Server
    Boost</b></font></p>
    <p><font size="3"><b>Workstation System offers same
    functionality and tools as SQL Server </b></font></p>
    <p><font size="2">The recently released Microsoft SQL Server
    Workstation System version 4.21 is designed to make it easier
    for Windows desktop developers to take advantage of the
    rapidly growing client-server marketplace.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">The SQL Server Workstation System combines
    the Microsoft SQL Server client-server database management
    system with the SQL Server Programmer's Toolkit. The system
    offers the same functionality, tools, and performance as the
    multiuser version of SQL Server and is intended to deliver
    the tools needed to build sophisticated, high-performance
    client-server systems, including ones compatible with
    Microsoft BackOffice. &quot;We've tried to make it attractive
    to first-time client-server developers by including both
    engine and development tools in a single, low-cost
    package,&quot; said Daniel Small, a product manager in the
    Microsoft business systems division.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">The Workstation System runs on Windows NT
    Workstation and Windows NT Server platforms. It is licensed
    for a single user&#151;in a development or full production
    environment&#151;and permits up to 15 simultaneous network
    database connections.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3"><b>Advanced programmability features</b></font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Developers experienced with desktop
    databases can now take advantage of SQL Server's advanced
    programmability features, such as triggers and stored
    procedures. For example, the extended stored procedure (XP)
    &quot;opens&quot; the engine's architecture and makes SQL
    Server a more flexible development platform. XPs are
    user-defined functions written as Windows NT dynamic-link
    library (DLL) routines. They allow custom functions to be
    added to the server&#151;functions that behave as though they
    are native.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">The power of extended procedures can be
    seen with <b>xp_sendmail</b>, an extended function included
    with the Workstation System that sends messages to an e-mail
    recipient when a change in the database occurs. It's useful
    for developing just-in-time inventory systems or other
    work-flow applications.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">The SQL Server Workstation System gives
    developers access to the full range of capabilities of the
    BackOffice client-server architecture. BackOffice includes a
    set of server-based applications that provide an integrated
    platform for business computing. The server-based
    applications include SQL Server, Microsoft SNA Server,
    Microsoft Systems Management Server, and Microsoft Mail
    Server. By supporting industry-standard interfaces such as
    DB-Library and open database connectivity (ODBC), developers
    can build applications for a wide range of platforms,
    including Windows NT, Windows, MS-DOS, OS/2, and the
    Macintosh. In addition, C, C++, and Visual Basic languages
    are supported.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">The Workstation System also comes with the
    Open Data Services (ODS) programmable gateway, which enables
    developers to create server-based gateways to host data
    sources, audit and security systems, and other sophisticated
    server-based applications.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3"><b>An upsizing platform for developers</b></font></p>
    <p><font size="2">The SQL Server Workstation System supports
    all of Microsoft's professional development tools, including
    Microsoft Access, FoxPro, Visual Basic, and Visual C++.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">SQL Server can be used with the Microsoft
    Access Upsizing Tools (available in the January Development
    Library) to develop applications that migrate easily from the
    desktop to the enterprise when multiprocessor performance,
    security, or transaction integrity is needed.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">One result of Microsoft's extensive
    database management system kernel re-engineering effort is
    that SQL Server&#151;including the Workstation
    System&#151;&quot;is able to deliver a level of performance
    available previously only from mainframe-class computers, at
    a fraction of the cost,&quot; Small said.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3"><b>Support for a broad range of networks</b></font></p>
    <p><font size="2">The SQL Server Workstation System features
    a network-independent design with integrated support for all
    popular local area network (LAN) environments. Support for
    Microsoft Windows NT and LAN Manager, Novell NetWare, IBM LAN
    Server, Digital Pathworks, Banyan VINES, and AppleTalk, and
    for TCP/IP-based networks using native protocols (TCP/IP,
    IPX/SPX, DECnet, ADSP, NetBEUI, and named pipes), is also
    provided.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">SQL Server supports all these protocols
    simultaneously, allowing you to deploy solutions in
    heterogeneous LAN environments common in today's large
    corporations without requiring multiple network protocols at
    the client.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Together with BackOffice components, the
    Workstation System can also serve as a useful platform for
    value-added resellers (VARs) seeking a platform on which to
    build their next generation of turnkey solutions. Its
    relatively low cost and full functionality make it widely
    applicable for networked and stand-alone applications, such
    as remote or branch office automation systems.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">SQL Server works with hundreds of leading
    tools and applications. More than 200 independent software
    vendors offer applications and industry-specific solutions
    based on Microsoft SQL Server, and more than 1200 Microsoft
    Solution Providers worldwide offer in-depth consulting,
    training, systems integration, and technical support. All of
    these products and services support the new Workstation
    System.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">The SQL Server Workstation System has an
    estimated retail price of US$499. Customers who already own
    the earlier SQL Server Desktop System can upgrade for around
    US$149. See your Microsoft reseller for additional
    information.</font></p>
