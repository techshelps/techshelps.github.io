    <p><font size="5"><b>Developer Network OffRamp Debuts on
    Internet</b></font></p>
    <p><font size="3"><b>Aim is to provide a greater quantity of
    timely information</b></font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Andrew Himes<br>
    Group Manager, Developer Network </font></p>
    <p><font size="2">The folks who bring you the <i>Developer
    Network News</i>, the Development Library, and the
    Development Platform have inaugurated a new information
    service on the World Wide Web (a graphical
    information-browsing system on the Internet): the <b>Developer
    Network OffRamp</b>.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">We've been working on this plan for some
    time now. Developers have been telling us that they want more
    timely information from Microsoft, and they want us to make
    full use of the capabilities of the Internet for
    communicating and publishing. Our response is the OffRamp,
    your place to get via the Web the most up-to-date news and
    technical strategy information from Microsoft.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2"><img src="Image353.gif" width="565"
    height="582"></font></p>
    <p><font size="2"><i></i></font>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><font size="2"><i>You can access the Developer Network
    OffRamp via Microsoft's World Wide Web server at
    http://www.microsoft.com. Once on the Microsoft Home Page,
    click the Developer Network OffRamp button.</i></font></p>
    <p><font size="2"></font>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><font size="2">The OffRamp includes three major areas:</font></p>
    <blockquote>
        <p><font size="2">&#149; <i>Developer Network News</i>,
        an online version of our newspaper, updated weekly. (See <i>Taking
        the </i>Developer Network News<i> Online</i>.)</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">&#149; <i>Fast Track</i>, a source of
        technical and strategic information, updated every two
        weeks.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">&#149; Developer Network membership
        information.</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font size="3"><b>Timeliness and flexibility on the
    Internet</b></font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Publishing on the Internet provides us with
    several major benefits compared to print- or CD-based
    publishing. For one thing, we don't have the same space
    constraints. The paper edition of our newspaper that you are
    now reading is limited to 16 pages, and it's a challenge each
    month for us to fit the most essential and interesting
    articles into the newspaper. We invariably are forced to cut
    or postpone printing several articles. On the Web, however,
    we are limited only by disk space (which is relatively cheap)
    and the work it takes to make quantities of information
    easily usable and navigable.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Timeliness is an important factor in
    publishing, and the Web will help us get the right
    information to you in a much shorter period of time. Our
    publishing schedules for the Development Library on CD (every
    three months) and the <i>Developer Network News</i> on paper
    (every two months) are lengthy by comparison with our
    publishing schedule for the Web.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">We continually update material on the
    OffRamp and add new content, so you can be sure that whatever
    is there is timely and appropriate. Each item is dated, so
    you know exactly when we added it to the OffRamp. In
    addition, all of the most important new material on the
    OffRamp is also included in the next available release of the
    Development Library on CD.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">To obtain the Development Library, sign up
    for a Level 1 membership in the Developer Network. A one-year
    subscription to Level 1 costs US$195 ($275 CAN), which buys
    you four quarterly releases of the Library CD-ROM, chock full
    of technical information, plus six issues of the <i>Developer
    Network News</i>.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">A Level 2 membership delivers all the
    benefits of Level 1, plus four quarterly releases of the
    Development Platform, which contains Microsoft API-level
    software development and device driver kits and the currently
    released versions (both U.S. and international) of the
    Windows and Windows NT Workstation operating systems for
    development and testing purposes. A one-year Level 2
    membership costs US$495 ($695 CAN).</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">To join the Developer Network, call (800)
    759-5474. Outside the United States and Canada, call the
    local Microsoft subsidiary.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2"><i>Andrew Himes shares his lunch with a

    getting bigger by the minute.</i></font></p>
    <p><font size="5"><b>Additional Information</b></font></p>
    <p><font size="3"><b>Developer Network information</b></font></p>
    <p><font size="2">The Developer Network information area on
    the OffRamp provides up-to-date membership news and is
    designed to answer questions such as the following:</font></p>
    <blockquote>
        <p><font size="2">&#149; How do I join the Developer
        Network?</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">&#149; What content will be added to
        the next release of the Development Library?</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">&#149; What new operating systems or
        toolkits will appear on the next Development Platform
        release?</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">&#149; How do I change the membership
        options I've selected?</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">&#149; What are the licensing
        restrictions for the Development Library and Development
        Platform?</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font size="3"><b>Taking the </b><b><i>Developer Network
    News</i></b><b> online</b></font></p>
    <p><font size="2">The Developer Network's Web-based newspaper
    contains all the content of the paper-based version, plus a
    lot more. You can see all the news articles, columns, and
    features from past printed versions (including the most
    recent one), and in the &quot;Extra&quot; section you can
    also see new content added each week, news stories, features,
    and new technical columns, even before they appear in the
    printed newspaper.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3"><b>Developer Network Fast Track</b></font></p>
    <p><font size="2">The Fast Track area contains technical and
    strategic information, including selected technical
    specifications, white papers, backgrounders, conference
    papers, selected samples and tools, information about
    developer tools and products from Microsoft, and the
    Microsoft Developer Knowledge Base.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2"><i>Note: The Fast Track area is only a
    sampling of the much larger universe of content on the
    Development Library CD.</i></font></p>
