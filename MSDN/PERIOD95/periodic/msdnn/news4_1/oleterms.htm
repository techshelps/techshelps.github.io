    <p><font size="5"><b>Survey Gives Snapshot of How OLE Is
    Being Applied</b></font></p>
    <p><font size="3"><b>Hundreds of commercial OLE products now
    shipping</b></font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Dave Seres<br>
    Developer Relations Senior Project Manager</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">In a recent survey conducted by the
    Microsoft Developer Relations Group (DRG), vendors identified
    315 commercial OLE products, many of them already 32-bit
    applications, as shipping by the end of 1994. These
    applications are supplied by more than 250 different software
    vendors. (Since the survey was conducted, vendors have
    identified an additional 118 products that have support for
    OLE, bringing the total to 433.) Every major software vendor,
    including Lotus, Borland, and WordPerfect, is committed to
    shipping OLE-enabled products.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">This survey indicates that support for OLE
    is growing and that end users expect advanced OLE services in
    their applications. More than one-third of these applications
    support the full range of OLE services, including OLE Visual
    Editing, OLE Drag and Drop, and OLE Automation, as both a
    container and a server.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">As an enabling technology for component
    software, OLE breaks down the barriers between software
    applications supplied by different vendors, allowing users to
    work in a single, integrated workspace. Customized OLE
    components can be bought commercially and plugged into other
    OLE-enabled applications, extending packaged applications to
    fit more specialized needs.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">OLE is available today on Windows, Windows
    NT, and the Apple Macintosh, and will soon be on UNIX and
    other platforms.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3"><b>OLE used in corporate applications</b></font></p>
    <p><font size="2">To date, more than 70,000 developers have
    acquired the Microsoft OLE Software Development Kit (SDK),
    making it clear that leading industry and corporate
    application developers are creating OLE-enabled applications.
    Major corporations, such as Reuters, Bankers Trust, and
    Deloitte &amp; Touche, are developing enterprise-wide
    OLE-based applications.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">OLE is being applied across the entire
    software spectrum on both the desktop and server.
    Applications include databases, financial tools, presentation
    graphics, engineering design, multimedia, communications,
    workgroup systems, personal productivity products, systems
    management, and manufacturing.</font></p>

    <p><font size="3"><b>OLE definitions</b></font></p>
    <p><font size="2">The following terms are used to identify
    specific OLE features supported by applications shown in
    these statistics:</font></p>
    <p><font size="2"><b>Linking container</b> means that the
    application can contain linked objects from documents created
    using other applications.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2"><b>Linking server</b><i> </i>means that the
    application can create objects that can be linked into other
    applications.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2"><b>Embedding container</b> means that the
    application can contain embedded objects created using other
    applications.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2"><b>Embedding server</b> means that the
    application can create objects that can be embedded within
    other applications.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2"><b>Visual Editing</b> means that
    applications supporting Visual Editing are able to edit
    embedded objects directly within the document, without
    opening a different application window.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2"><b>Automation: An application can drive
    other applications </b>means that the application includes a
    programming language, a scripting language, or a macro
    language that can be used to control other applications that
    can be driven through OLE Automation.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2"><b>Automation: An application is driven by
    other applications </b>means that the application makes its
    services available to automation controllers by exposing its
    commands and properties. In this way, other applications can
    drive the processing of the application.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2"><b>Drag and Drop: Drop target</b> means
    that objects can be dragged out of other applications and
    dropped directly within the application.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2"><b>Drag and Drop: Drag source</b> means
    that objects within the application can be dragged out of the
    application and dropped into other applications.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2"><i>Dave Seres is a senior product manager
    and leads the OLE marketing team in the Developer Relations
    Group. He's been involved with OLE for nearly three years and
    earlier worked with the development team.</i></font></p>
