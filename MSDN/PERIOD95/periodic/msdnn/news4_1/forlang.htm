    <p><font size="5"><b>International Language Glossaries Now in
    the Development Library</b></font></p>
    <p><font size="2">If you're looking for just the right word
    in a non-English language to describe a product feature or
    procedure, the Developer Network Development Library has a
    helpful resource for you.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">To promote the use of common terminology in
    the international developer and localization communities,
    Microsoft is making its international language glossaries
    available in the Development Library. The January release
    will contain glossaries of released products in German,
    French, Spanish, Brazilian Portuguese, Italian, Dutch,
    Danish, Swedish, Norwegian, Finnish, Russian, Czech,
    Hungarian, Polish, Turkish, and Greek. The plan is to add
    three Far Eastern languages in the spring.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Not all product glossaries are available in
    all languages, but you will find most major Microsoft
    products represented in this collection. The glossary
    collection will be updated with each release of the Library.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Microsoft is making this terminology
    available for individual use of specific terms in software
    development and localization. A separate license must be
    obtained from Microsoft for any other use. If you have questions about the glossary collection, please write to Ursula Schwalbach, Terminologist,  International Quality Assurance Department, One Microsoft Way, 3/2, Redmond, WA 98052, or call (425) 936-1526.</font></p>
