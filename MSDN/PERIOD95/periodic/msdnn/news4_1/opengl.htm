    <p><font size="5"><b>OpenGL: Windows NT Gets 3-D Graphics
    Library</b></font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Dale Rogerson<br>
    Technical Writer, Developer Network Technology Group</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Until recently, fast, high-quality, 3-D
    graphics like those produced for the movie <i>Jurassic Park</i>
    could only be built on an expensive platform such as Silicon
    Graphics' IRIS workstation. This meant that the quality of
    graphical animation that could be produced on less expensive,
    Windows-based PCs suffered greatly by comparison.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">However, Windows NT version 3.5 and the
    Win32 API now include OpenGL, a 3-D graphics library that
    will someday enable every PC to be a high-end,
    three-dimensional graphics platform.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">The inclusion of OpenGL with Windows NT
    opens up a number of possibilities for the developer
    community. One result will be a huge expansion in the number
    of programmers who have the opportunity to develop 3-D
    applications or to enhance their applications by adding 3-D
    graphics. Also, more high-end graphics applications will be
    ported to the PC. In addition, OpenGL will eventually be
    added to Windows 95, which will dramatically increase the
    installed base of OpenGL users, further encouraging
    development of OpenGL applications for a greatly expanded
    market.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">(For a preview of OpenGL, take a look at
    the new OpenGL screen savers included with Windows NT version
    3.5: 3-D Flying Objects and 3-D Pipes.)</font></p>
    <p><font size="3"><b>Okay, so what is OpenGL?</b></font></p>
    <p><font size="2">OpenGL is a very portable software
    interface for rendering 3-D graphics. It includes
    approximately 120 commands to draw graphics primitives such
    as points, lines, and polygons. However, unlike the Windows
    GDI (graphics device interface), OpenGL primitives are drawn
    in three dimensions. OpenGL also includes support for
    shading, texture mapping, anti-aliasing, lighting, and
    animation. Commands for producing and manipulating
    higher-level 3-D objects, such as cubes, pyramids, spheres,
    and the Boeing 777, are not included but can be built from
    the existing primitives.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">OpenGL does not manage windows, read input,
    or write files. Windows NT, Windows, or some other operating
    system does the job of managing the windows. An application
    gives OpenGL a piece of a window or bitmap on which to
    render.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Silicon Graphics Inc. (commonly known as
    SGI) originally developed GL, a 3-D graphics language, for
    its 3-D graphics machine, the IRIS. The process of porting it
    to another system proved extremely difficult, however. So SGI
    decided to change GL to make it easier to port to different
    hardware, operating systems, and windowing systems. The
    result was OpenGL.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">While SGI still maintains IRIS GL, all new
    work and enhancements are being made to OpenGL. The
    enhancements and changes to OpenGL are decided by the
    Architecture Review Board (ARB), whose founding members are
    Digital Equipment Corporation, IBM, Intel, Microsoft, and
    SGI.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3"><b>Benefits for graphics workstation users</b></font></p>
    <p><font size="2">OpenGL runs best on high-end 3-D graphics
    workstations, such as the SGI boxes used for <i>Jurassic Park</i>.
    Of course, OpenGL running on a Pentium PC with an enhanced
    VGA card isn't going to come close to the performance of the
    same application running on an SGI Crimson box. However, the
    Crimson box will set you back close to $50,000.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">So if you don't have $50,000 to drop, the
    addition of OpenGL to Windows NT provides a number of
    benefits. For the graphics workstation community, it is
    low-cost, scalable, and portable. It means that Windows NT
    can now serve as a low-cost platform for developing and
    running high-end graphics applications, including CAD/CAM
    (computer-aided design/computer-aided manufacturing), and
    thus can replace more expensive graphics workstations. This
    means a standard Pentium-based PC can become the basis for a
    graphics workstation.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Windows NT runs on small, portable laptops
    and large, multiple-processor file servers. You can easily
    try out 3-D applications or application development on your
    existing desktop computer and upgrade when you need the extra
    power. It also runs on the 386, 486, Pentium, MIPS, Alpha
    AXP, and PowerPC processors.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">In addition, Windows NT can easily run
    standard Windows-based applications. The same system that
    runs your advanced graphics applications can run word
    processors, spreadsheets, and other applications for Windows.
    No need for multiple computers, expensive proprietary
    applications, or troublesome emulators.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3"><b>And for developers</b></font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Including OpenGL in Windows NT provides a
    number of benefits for developers:</font></p>
    <blockquote>
        <p><font size="2">&#149; Windows NT now provides a way to
        add 3-D effects to applications. You won't need to buy a
        third-party library, because OpenGL is included with the
        system. Applications that traditionally haven't used 3-D
        graphics can now include 3-D graphics enhancements.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">&#149; OpenGL simplifies development of
        3-D applications. The number of 3-D drawing and rendering
        applications should increase, because programmers no
        longer have to develop their own 3-D graphics libraries.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">&#149; It creates the potential for
        new, exciting 3-D games for Windows. Instead of having to
        look down on the game board, you can now view the action
        from the edge of the board.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">&#149; It provides a standard 3-D
        graphics library for the Windows environment.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">&#149; It sets a standard that hardware
        manufacturers can use to create high-performance video
        cards. Graphics card manufacturers can improve OpenGL
        performance by performing many OpenGL operations in
        hardware. In the near future, real-time 3-D graphics will
        be available on the desktop for a reasonable price.</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font size="2">&quot;Making OpenGL available across our
    operating system platforms will move 3-D from the esoteric to
    the mainstream,&quot; said Gilman Wong of Microsoft's OpenGL
    development team. &quot;What I mean by that statement is that
    3-D is mostly used in very specific markets, such as games,
    CAD, maybe high-end graphics design, and the occasional
    business chart. Providing an industry-proven API like OpenGL
    will greatly reduce the engineering effort of incorporating
    3-D. This in turn will hopefully stimulate and foster its use
    in a greater variety of applications.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font size="3"><b>Portability</b></font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Due to the ease of porting an OpenGL
    program from one system to another, it shouldn't take long
    for OpenGL applications originally developed for SGI, DEC, or
    IBM systems to appear running under Windows NT.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Win32 applications can run with only a
    recompile on a variety of platforms, including those with one
    or more Intel, MIPS, Alpha, or PowerPC processors, and OpenGL
    applications written for Windows will inherit the built-in
    portability of the Win32 API.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">When OpenGL is ported to Windows 95, it
    will dramatically increase the installed base of OpenGL
    users. Companies currently developing applications for the
    high-end graphics workstation market will suddenly have a
    much larger possible market for their products. It will also
    be easier to sell a software package that doesn't require a
    special dedicated computer system, reducing the expense
    considerably.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3"><b>Hardware manufacturers are making
    enhancements, too</b></font></p>
    <p><font size="2">To improve the performance of OpenGL on the
    PC platform, several video card manufacturers are developing
    cards and drivers that implement many OpenGL commands in
    hardware instead of software.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">While a properly written OpenGL program
    will be able to run on a system with or without a hardware
    accelerator, OpenGL was designed with hardware accelerators
    in mind. The hardware accelerator will give the program
    better performance and possibly more capabilities.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">The performance of these cards varies
    depending on how much you pay. They vary in price from
    several hundred to tens of thousands of dollars. It will soon
    be possible to get the performance of an SGI Crimson on your
    desktop at a fraction of the price.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3"><b>Moving from GDI to OpenGL</b></font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Incorporating OpenGL is not as simple as
    just extending GDI to perform 3-D drawing: GDI users are
    going to find little that is familiar with OpenGL. For
    example, drawing a line with OpenGL is completely different
    from drawing a line with GDI. In fact, OpenGL uses a
    rendering context and only indirectly uses a device context.
    Current brushes, colors, fonts, and other objects selected
    into the device context have no effect on OpenGL rendering.
    Even the GDI mapping modes have no effect on OpenGL.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Still, though their GDI expertise is not
    directly applicable to an OpenGL world, GDI experts should be
    happy that a proven industry-standard graphics interface was
    chosen. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2">GDI mavens won't have much trouble learning
    the basics of OpenGL. In many cases, OpenGL and GDI differ
    more in syntax than in paradigm. The hard part for a
    converted GDI programmer is going to be learning 3-D graphics
    programming. OpenGL is a library for rendering 3-D images; it
    is not designed to hide developers from the intricacies of
    3-D programming. A beginning OpenGL 3-D graphics programmer
    should read a 3-D textbook before getting too involved with
    OpenGL. In addition, several books have already been written
    about OpenGL. (See &quot;OpenGL resources&quot; in the
    &quot;Additional Information&quot; section at the end of this
    article.)</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Program managers can also rejoice. They can
    add 3-D graphics to their programs by hiring OpenGL
    programmers. These OpenGL programmers need to know little or
    nothing about Windows, because once the display context is
    set up there is no additional GDI work needed.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3"><b>Moving toward 3-D Windows</b></font></p>
    <p><font size="2">The addition of OpenGL makes the Windows NT
    platform more attractive to scientific and technical computer
    users. It shouldn't be long before desktop applications start
    taking advantage of the rendering capabilities of OpenGL.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">The Developer Network Development Library
    is your best place to get started learning about and using
    OpenGL. The <i>OpenGL Programmer's Reference</i> appears in
    the January release of the Development Library as part of the
    product documentation for the Win32 Software Development Kit.
    In addition, you'll find various technical articles about
    OpenGL under Technical Articles/Windows (32-bit)/GDI in the
    Development Library.</font></p>
