    <p><font size="5"><b>The Reasons for the New Windows 95 Ship
    Date</b></font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Recently Microsoft announced that retail
    availability for the Windows 95 operating system will
    probably be delayed until August 1995. The main reason for
    this delay is the need to ensure hardware and software
    compatibility with the millions of existing Windows
    installations. There are no significant architectural issues
    that have caused the delay, according to Brad Silverberg,
    Microsoft senior vice president.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Concurrent with the scheduled shipment of
    Windows 95, Beta 3, to technical evaluators in March, the
    Microsoft Developer Network will ship Beta 3 with the
    associated software development kits (SDKs) and device driver
    kits (DDKs) to all Level 2 members. (Note: You will need a
    32-bit compiler to develop applications for Windows 95.) </font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Microsoft is disappointed about the delay
    and understands that this may impact your planning. The
    company extended an apology to Windows 95 software
    developers, stating that it was committed to keeping all
    developers informed of its progress on Windows 95.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Below are answers to some questions about
    the status of Windows 95.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2"><b>Q. What are the main reasons for the
    delay?</b></font></p>
    <p><font size="2">A. Feedback from our second round of beta
    testing has been extremely positive, but it also showed that
    we needed a little more time to get the product right. The
    biggest hurdle we still face is achieving compatibility with
    the huge combination of software and hardware on the market
    today. The challenge of providing innovation, ease of use,
    speed, and compatibility with more than 60 million machines
    and tens of thousands of programs is something that has never
    been encountered before.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">This has delayed us a bit, but we have also
    come up with some innovative ways to achieve our goals. To
    ensure that we meet our quality goals for Windows 95, we are
    undertaking huge beta and internal testing efforts. We are
    working with third-party testing houses. We are taking our
    testers and developers to homes and to small, medium, and
    large businesses to run through real-life installations and
    to record the data.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">The next major milestone for Windows 95 is
    called M8, or Beta 3. We expect to release Beta 3 in March
    1995.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">In the final development phase after M8, we
    will incorporate feedback from Beta 3 users. The final
    release to manufacturing of Windows 95 is planned for June
    1995. This will mean that Windows 95 will be available in
    retail channels in August.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2"><b>Q. When did you find out about the
    delay?</b></font></p>
    <p><font size="2">A. The M7 beta (Beta 2) was released in the
    COMDEX time frame. Since then, we have been accumulating the
    test results from this beta. With this data, we recently
    started working on a revised schedule that was approved by
    Bill Gates.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2"><b>Q. I hear installation is a problem. Is
    this true?</b></font></p>
    <p><font size="2">A. The biggest hurdle we face is ensuring
    compatibility. That said, installation is an area that is
    still improving, too. We want to make installation a simple,
    foolproof operation to users with a wide range of hardware
    and with wide-ranging experience levels.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2"><b>Q. This is the second announced delay
    for Windows 95. Why aren't you better at predicting the ship
    dates?</b></font></p>
    <p><font size="2">A. Predicting the ship date for a project
    the size of Windows 95 is extremely difficult. This is the
    first time we've done a major upgrade to Windows with such a
    huge installed base of customers and gigantic array of
    hardware and software configurations. The compatibility and
    installation goals are challenging, to say the least.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2"><b>Q. What makes you sure you will make
    this new date?</b></font></p>
    <p><font size="2">A. We have had the opportunity to analyze
    the feedback from our second beta, and given that the product
    is further along in the development process, we have solid
    information with which to revise our schedule.</font></p>
