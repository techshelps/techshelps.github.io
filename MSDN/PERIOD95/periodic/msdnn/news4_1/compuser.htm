    <p><font size="5"><b>'Round the World with CompuServe</b></font></p>
    <p><font size="3"><b>Service provides lots of online
    developer resources</b></font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Darrell Craig<br>
    Developer Network Product Manager</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Software developers compete in an industry
    that is sometimes biased toward North America and the English
    language.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Luckily, online services provide a
    mechanism for transcending linguistic barriers&#151;a
    developer with a modem and the appropriate communications
    software has access not only to information available to
    North American developers, but also to valuable localized
    information, country-specific information, and local support.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">For those who have not tapped into this
    virtual community of online software developers, this article
    should provide a starting point for exploring some of the
    developer-related services available on the CompuServe
    Information Service (CIS). Online veterans may discover some
    new areas to investigate.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3"><b>Forums galore</b></font></p>
    <p><font size="2">CompuServe is available in more than 120
    countries. It is the oldest and largest online service, and
    it has more than 800 computer and software vendor forums,
    plus well-established developer-related forums.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">International software developers will find
    local-language and content-based services in Argentina,
    Australia, Chile, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Hungary,
    Israel, Italy, Japan, Mexico, New Zealand, Netherlands, South
    Africa, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan, and
    the United Kingdom.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Microsoft sponsors the following
    local-language forums: MS Benelux, MS Central Europe, MS
    Central Europe Systems, MS France, MS Italy, MS Spain/Latin
    America, and MS Sweden.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3"><b>The benefits of participating</b></font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Developers benefit in many ways by
    participating in these forums. By using the forums to
    exchange messages, developers can share programming tips and
    tricks, offer support to others, communicate directly with
    Microsoft staff, and even conduct business from time to time.
    The MS Central Europe forum (GO MSCE) has both active message
    threads and continuously updated libraries of downloadable
    files.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">For example, on a recent day 13 files were
    uploaded to the MS Tricks and Tips library section in the MS
    Central Europe forum. Other categories include Multimedia and
    a busy Shareware and Freeware library (which includes a
    popular file with 900 icons for Windows 3.<i>x</i>). All
    German-speaking developers, regardless of location, may want
    to peruse this section. The MS France forum (GO MSFR) has
    particularly active message threads on development issues
    related to the Windows SDK, Win32 SDK, and Microsoft
    Foundation Class Library (MFC). The MS France forum also
    includes valuable files such as the French edition of
    VBRUN300.DLL (search for file- name VBR300.ZIP).</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Another great source of information for
    international developers is the Windows SDK Extensions forum
    (GO WINEXT), with libraries dedicated to the Far East SDK and
    the Arabic/Hebrew SDK.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">For example, the Far East SDK library
    includes a wealth of resources, including Microsoft Far East
    TrueType Font Files version 1.0, an updated version of
    WIN87EM.DLL that ships with Windows 3.1J, the August 1994
    version of the People's Republic of China (PRC) glossary, and
    more.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">CompuServe also has many product-specific
    forums. The FoxPro forums (GO FOXFORUM and GO FOXUSER) are
    among the best examples of what can be done online for the
    software developer. The libraries of both these forums
    contain lots of timely, valuable information for developers.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">A recent random peek in the FOXFORUM
    library section on Windows platform development reveals a job
    listing for a two-month contract in Germany, a public domain
    integrated browser, and a utility allowing users to preview
    and print font samples based on installed fonts in Windows
    3.1. Other product-related forums of relevance to developers
    can be found by typing GO MSDEVPROD.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">The Microsoft Developer Network delivers a
    customized version of WinCIM, an application that serves as a
    graphical front end to CompuServe, in its Development
    Library. WinCIM provides icons that let you jump easily and
    quickly into the developer-related areas of the Microsoft
    Connection area on CompuServe. WinCIM is currently available
    in English, French, and German versions; the Spanish-language
    version is scheduled for release in late 1994.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">The Development Library also includes
    information on joining the CompuServe Information Service.
    For more information on CompuServe within the United States,
    call (800) 524-3388 and ask for representative 230. Outside
    the United States, call (+1) (614) 529-1340 and ask for
    representative 230.</font></p>
