    <p><font size="5"><b>New UI Features for Development Library</b></font></p>
    <p><font size="3"><b>Streamlined data preparation process
    means richer content</b></font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Mike Colee</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">July 13, 1995</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">With the July release of the Microsoft
    Development Library, the hard-chargin' Developer Network
    development team unveils a new version of our Development
    Library browsing technology.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">InfoViewer version 2.5&#151;produced in
    collaboration with Microsoft's Visual C++ and the operating
    systems groups&#151;removes many of the obstacles that have
    hampered our efforts to deliver richer information in a more
    timely way.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3"><b>New UI features</b></font></p>
    <p><font size="2">We've freshened up the user interface in
    InfoViewer 2.5, based on feedback from subscribers as well as
    from the folks within Microsoft who assisted in the design of
    InfoViewer. The new UI features include:</font></p>
    <blockquote>
        <p><font size="2">&#149; An updated contents pane tree
        control UI that conforms more closely to the Windows 95
        standard.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">&#149; A topic toolbar that has been
        moved to the top of the topic pane to conform more
        closely to the standards established for Visual C++
        embedded toolbars.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">&#149; An ability to hide the embedded
        topic pane toolbar and the topic nonscrolling region.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">&#149; Support for pop-ups. Pop-up
        topics containing term definitions should show up in the
        July Development Library in the new Win32 docs. Look for
        more widespread use of pop-up topics in future releases.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2"><img src="Image374.gif" width="570"
        height="548"></font></p>
        <p><font size="2"><b>Pop-up topics will start popping up
        in the July Development Library.</b></font></p>
        <p><font size="2">&#149; Easier-to-use bookmarks. Setting
        bookmarks now requires only two mouse clicks.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">&#149; New toolbar buttons for defining
        subsets, choosing subsets, and navigating bookmark and
        search result lists.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">&#149; Support for &quot;See Also&quot;
        topics. A drop-down menu button on the embedded topic
        window toolbar will provide a list of topics related to
        the currently viewed topic. See Also topics will provide
        extremely valuable cross-reference and related topic
        links in much of our reference documentation. We don't
        expect to acquire documents that use this feature for the
        July release, but in future releases we expect to receive
        documentation that makes extensive use of it.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">&#149; Support for SHED graphics means
        those cool class-hierarchy bitmaps in the Microsoft
        Foundation Class Library (MFC) documentation will now be
        &quot;hot,&quot; containing links to the appropriate
        class overview description. (Again, we may not receive
        documents that use this feature in time for the July
        Library release.)</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">&#149; Expanded automatic hot-linking
        capabilities. Users can now highlight a word and press </font><font
        size="1">F1</font><font size="2">, which will cause the
        keyword index to come up with the selected word entered.
        This allows a quick lookup of keywords that could not be
        automatically hot linked because they are too generic
        (for example, OPEN).</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font size="3"><b>WYSIWYG copying and more</b></font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Because InfoViewer 2.5 is built on a new
    release of the MediaView libraries, we have implemented copy
    as RTF. On a copy operation, you'll now get formatted text
    and graphics in the form of an RTF stream suitable for
    pasting into Word for Windows. At the same time, unformatted
    text is placed onto the Clipboard for use by programming
    editors or applications that handle only unformatted text.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Other less-visible improvements in
    InfoViewer are double-byte character set (DBCS) enabling and
    something we call topic-centricity. Topic-centricity is
    designed to give documentation authors more control over the
    structure of the table of contents&#151;for example, the
    ability to place a topic in more than one place.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2"><img src="Image375.gif" width="418"
    height="327"></font></p>
    <p><font size="2"><b>InfoViewer 2.5 offers Library users new
    options for showing and hiding toolbars, topic titles, and
    title tips, and for configuring pop-up and hot-link colors.</b></font></p>
    <p><font size="3"><b>Why these changes? A little background</b></font></p>
    <p><font size="2">The release of InfoViewer 2.5 comes a year
    after the delivery of version 2.0 of the Development Library
    browser. Our goal then was to update the Library's core
    viewing/browsing technology by building on a new Microsoft
    layout and search technology called MediaView. We also
    improved the UI by implementing many of the features and
    improvements our subscribers had requested.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">But still problems persisted. For example,
    after looking long and hard at our process for bringing
    content from the authors to the CD, we found that documents
    often required an inordinate amount of preparation. Sometimes
    information had to be ignored or removed from the documents,
    because either our production process or our browser couldn't
    utilize it.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">For example, the Help file versions of some
    documentation contain a richer set of hot links and
    cross-reference information than their equivalents in the
    Library. (An example of this is See Also information.)</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Much of the information we deliver in the
    Library is also distributed in different forms by various
    Microsoft groups. For example, the Visual C++ group
    distributes documentation for the MFC library, C run-time
    library, and C/C++ language in both printed and electronic
    form with its products. Ditto for the systems programming
    documentation.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3"><b>Less pain, more gain</b></font></p>
    <p><font size="2">It may seem that placing this documentation
    on the Development Library CD would be easy. Unfortunately
    this isn't always the case. Because most of the documents we
    receive have been prepared for distribution through Help
    files or a printed medium, formatting, hot links, and related
    topic information must be translated into a form that is
    useful for the Development Library browser. Parts of this
    process can be very labor intensive.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">As a result of the joint effort by the
    Developer Network, the Visual C++, and the operating systems
    teams, we will now receive documentation from two of
    Microsoft's largest documentation-producing groups that has
    already been prepared for use with InfoViewer 2.5. This means
    not only a dramatic reduction in our document preparation
    work but also the delivery of richer and higher-quality
    development information in a more timely manner.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3"><b>Looking to the future</b></font></p>
    <p><font size="2">We are not resting on our laurels. As you
    read this article, we are working on continuing to improve
    the usability of the Development Library. As always, your
    suggestions for the Library are needed and welcome.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2"><i>Mike Colee, a Developer Network design
    engineer, worked on the new InfoViewer version 2.5. He would
    no doubt be a world-class cyclist were it not for his
    devotion to the Development Library UI.</i></font></p>
