    <p><font size="5"><b>Subscribers to See Visual C++ 2.2 in
    July</b></font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Jonathan Kagle</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">July 13, 1995</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">In late July, Microsoft Visual C++
    subscribers are scheduled to receive a new subscription
    release. Visual C++ version 2.2 provides extra support for
    developers who want to take advantage of the new features of
    Windows NT 3.51 and the upcoming Windows 95 release.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">The new release includes updated
    functionality in the 32-bit version of the Microsoft
    Foundation Class Library (MFC), the Windows NT 3.51 Step-Up
    Kit, new Win32 Software Development Kit headers and libraries
    shipped for the Windows NT 3.51 release, and numerous bug
    fixes.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3"><b>New features for Windows 95 and Windows
    NT 3.51 development</b></font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Visual C++ 2.2 contains up-to-date header
    files, import libraries, and Win32 API documentation for
    writing Windows NT- and Windows 95-compatible applications.
    (There are no longer separate headers for Windows NT and
    Windows 95.)</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Visual C++ 2.2 also includes MFC version
    3.2, with classes for OLE and database programming. The
    following new features have been added to MFC in the 32-bit
    product:</font></p>
    <blockquote>
        <p><font size="2">&#149; Updated MFC classes to work with
        the new common controls recently released in Windows NT
        3.51 (and soon available in Windows 95 and a future
        version of Win32s).</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">&#149; Support for the new Windows
        common controls in USRDLL projects.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">&#149; Improved and updated common
        control documentation.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">&#149; New MFC sample applications
        covering topics such as OLE, AVI, and screen savers.
        There's also source code for the Windows 95 WordPad
        applet.</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font size="2">In addition, MFC and C run-time library
    dynamic-link libraries (DLLs) have been tuned to reduce
    swapping in low-memory conditions.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3"><b>Windows NT Workstation 3.51 Step-Up Kit</b></font></p>
    <p><font size="2">This release also includes an upgrade from
    Windows NT 3.5 to 3.51 for Intel <i>x</i>86 or compatible
    machines. Windows NT 3.51 includes support for the new common
    controls, making development for Windows 95 easier.
    (Developer Network Level 2 subscribers already have this
    version.) The upgrade kit requires Windows NT Workstation
    version 3.5.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3"><b>Other new features</b></font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Many other items are included in this
    subscription release:</font></p>
    <blockquote>
        <p><font size="2">&#149; The OLE Control Developer's Kit,
        which includes the ability to use the new MFC common
        control classes in your OLE Controls</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">&#149; Visual C++ 1.52b, which fixes
        several bugs</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">&#149; Win32s 1.25a, which includes
        many bug fixes, removes the 128K stack limitation, and
        enhances internationalization support as well as
        compatibility for Novell NetWare and Stacker</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">&#149; Selected presentations, white
        papers, and source code from the first annual MFC
        conference</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font size="3"><b>Availability</b></font></p>
    <p><font size="2">The Visual C++ subscription provides
    multiple-platform support for Microsoft Windows 95, Microsoft
    Windows NT running on Intel platforms, and Windows 3.1 with
    Win32s. Subscriptions are now available in the United States,
    Canada, and Western Europe. Elsewhere, the CD will be
    available as a stand-alone upgrade through local Microsoft
    subsidiaries.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Versions of Visual C++ 2.0 remain available
    for Apple Macintosh 68K platforms, Digital Equipment
    Corporation's Alpha platform, and the MIPS platform.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2"><i>Jonathan Kagle is a product manager for
    Visual C++ and Microsoft Test. He vehemently denies that he
    is being bundled with Windows 95.</i></font></p>
    <p><font size="5"><b>Where's My Visual C++ 2.2 CD?</b></font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Well, there are several possibilities:</font></p>
    <blockquote>
        <p><font size="2">&#149; <i>It's still July.</i> It takes
        a while to ship out all those CDs!</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">&#149; <i>You haven't activated your
        subscription.</i> Many people who bought the Visual C++
        subscription have still not sent in their activation
        cards (which are cleverly hidden next to the MFC
        hierarchy chart). If you lost it, call (800) 719-5577 and
        have your product ID number ready.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">&#149; <i>You live outside the United
        States, Canada, or Western Europe.</i> We're working hard
        to make the subscription available everywhere, but in
        other countries this CD is available as a stand-alone
        upgrade through your local subsidiary.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">&#149; <i>You bought the
        nonsubscription edition.</i> If you live in the U.S. or
        Canada, you can upgrade to the Visual C++ subscription by
        sending in the upgrade card in the box. If you've lost
        the card, call (800) 719-5577 to place your order. In
        Western Europe, contact your local Microsoft subsidiary.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">&#149; <i>Something else went wrong.</i>
        Call (800) 719-5577 or contact your local subsidiary with
        your product ID number to get problems worked out.</font></p>
