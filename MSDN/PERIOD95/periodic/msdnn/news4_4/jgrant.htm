    <p><font size="5"><b>The Shape of Platforms to Come</b></font></p>
    <p><font size="3"><b>Developer Network trims number of CDs in
    U.S., Canada</b></font></p>
    <p><font size="2">John Rae-Grant</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">July 13, 1995</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Here's how rumors start: First, we at the
    Developer Network decide &quot;Hey, let's ask subscribers
    what they think about the Developer Network.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Then we have to decide what to ask and how
    to ask it. (Don't laugh, this isn't as easy as it sounds.)
    Once we've made that hurdle, we prepare to solicit your
    feedback. We hold focus groups. We send out surveys. We knock
    on doors. We keep our eyes open for two-yolk eggs and
    strangely shaped clouds.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Then, like wildfire, the whispers&#151;soon
    to transmogrify into a thunderous roar&#151;start.
    &quot;Pssst, the Developer Network is going to be, gulp, <i>changing.</i>&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Uncertainty and suspicion ensue. I guess
    that's natural. After all, change can be, well, unsettling.
    The current situation may have its little problems and
    hiccups, but at least you kind of know what to expect. We
    here at the Developer Network are in the same boat when it
    comes to change. We know that while our current offerings
    don't satisfy all your needs and sometimes engender
    complaints, they do work for a large number of subscribers.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">But we are also faced with the reality that
    we have to change. How else can we keep you up-to-date? It
    was a huge change when we made the Development Platform
    available through our Level 2 membership. It was a major step
    when we started publishing <i>Developer Network News </i>and
    technical information on the World Wide Web (and now The
    Microsoft Network). It was change when we started dedicating
    more attention to Visual Basic and OLE.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Does that mean everybody is happy with our
    changes? Probably not. Does that mean we don't make mistakes?
    Probably not. Does that mean we should stop trying to improve
    our program? Definitely not. If we didn't change, we'd still
    be selling copies of Microsoft QuickBasic and Typing Tutor
    door-to-door.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Still, you have a perfect right to be
    thinking, &quot;Now they're gonna remove everything I care
    about from the Development Platform and leave only that
    stupid checkbook sample! Then they're gonna make me pay
    through the nose each week for each individual bit.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Well, I'm here to tell you, &quot;Not
    so.&quot; (Oh, I forgot to introduce myself. I'm John
    Rae-Grant. How are ya?)</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">We are going to tune Level 2. The reason is
    pretty simple. It's TOO BIG! Many of you told us not only do
    you<i> not</i> want many of the platform contents, but also
    that you think we are holding back on good stuff because it's
    TOO BIG!</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">One Level 2 member thoughtfully shared his
    pain with us in this way: &quot;I'm just not getting the use
    I thought I would out of the Finnish version of Windows NT
    3.5 ever since that CAD/CAM numerical process control project
    for Santa's Workshop fell through.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Our Development Platform is in danger of
    gravitational collapse due to sheer volume. So, we plan to
    remove some less popular stuff from CDs that Level 2 members <i>in
    the United States and Canada </i>automatically receive each
    quarter. (In other countries, local subsidiaries will decide
    whether and how to implement any changes.)</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">By separating out the international
    versions of the operating systems (12 CDs) and the device
    driver kits (3 CDs), we can trim the number of Platform CDs
    from the current 19 to about 4.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">This change won't be fully implemented
    until the October release because we couldn't get our act
    together to save all these discs in July. You'll notice,
    however, that the July Platform contains three separate
    packs:</font></p>
    <blockquote>
        <p><font size="2">&#149; <b>U.S. pack</b>&#151;U.S.
        versions of Windows and Windows NT Workstation operating
        systems (retail and debug, when available), resource
        kits, software development kits (SDKs), and the Setup
        program.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">&#149; <b>International pack</b>&#151;International
        versions of Windows and Windows NT Workstation operating
        systems, SDKs, and SDK extensions.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">&#149; <b>DDK pack</b>&#151;U.S. and
        international versions of device driver kits (DDKs) and
        DDK extensions.</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font size="2">Does this mean you can no longer get the
    Finnish version of Windows NT 3.5 if you want? No. We are
    making everything we removed available through optional
    add-on programs. This means you'll have to let us know if you
    want to keep receiving anything that we've removed from the
    basic Level 2 package. Within a month or so after you receive
    the July release, we'll be sending out a card explaining how
    to &quot;qualify&quot; yourself for the International and/or
    DDK pack.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">As the new &quot;muckamuck&quot; around
    here, my goal is a program as responsive and successful as
    possible, so please keep that feedback coming. We really are
    listening.</font></p>
