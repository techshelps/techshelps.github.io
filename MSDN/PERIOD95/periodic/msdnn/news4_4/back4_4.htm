    <p><font size="5"><b>Backtalk: A Continuing Dialog on the
    Development Library and Platform</b></font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Melinda Hohlbein</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">July 13, 1995</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">You are the master of all that you survey.
    Now go eat your vegetables, pay those bills on time, clean
    out that closet, and call your mother.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">You get the gist here. Now, having to
    remember tons of rules and things wouldn't be so bad if they
    weren't always changing. I expect any day now for the
    American Foundation for the Revelation of Shocking Food
    Truths to announce that we should be using expressed
    dandelion oil for cooking because it is the lowest in
    saturated fat.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Now truth be told, software development is
    no different. You've got your OLE, your ODBC, your RDBMS,
    your SPAM, your...(well, you get the point). These pesky
    technologies are always changing and sometimes even getting
    more cool. AND you've got to stay on top of it all to COMPETE
    SUCCESSFULLY in the programming business.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">That's where we come in. When you develop
    for Windows, there's really only one rule to remember:
    &quot;Do unto others&quot;&#151;no, wait a minute. It's
    &quot;Never let 'em see you sweat&quot;&#151;no, that's not
    quite right either. Ah, yes, THE Golden Rule to know is,
    &quot;Belong to the Microsoft Developer Network.&quot; We'll
    try to see to it that you have what you need to write your
    basic, stunning application. We can even help with all that
    confusing legal mumbo-jumbo such as codum ad libem, codum ad
    nauseam, and codum chock full o' bugae.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">There is one more eensy teensy tiny little
    rule you need to abide by, which is, of course, SEND US YOUR
    FEEDBACK. We need your feedback to help us accomplish
    monumental things, such as increasing the effectiveness of
    lawn fertilizer. We also rely on your comments (the more
    candid the better) to help us drive the Developer Network
    program, so don't sit on your ideas, eh? Now, without further
    adieu, here's the Developer Network member Q &amp; A, which
    is the primary purpose of this column (well, it's also an
    integral part of my raison d'être).</font></p>
    <p><font size="3"><b>Splitting hairs and CD-ROMs</b></font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Ernest Amarath of a city that shall remain
    nameless faxed us and said he didn't want to be politically
    incorrect, but were we completely deaf to customers' concerns
    about receiving too many CD-ROMs with Level 2 membership.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">This happens to be a MAJOR change, and
    believe me when I say that it took us none too few cycles to
    figure out how to implement it without causing members
    unbearable pain. We have prevailed. For a detailed discussion
    of what we're doing to slash and not burn as many CDs as we
    currently do, let your fingers do the walking to the article &quot;The
    Shape of Platforms to Come,&quot; MSDN_JRGRANT3 where our
    new BUM (business unit manager, that is), John Rae-Grant,
    weighs in with a column about our plans.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Note to Ernie: Not deaf, my boy, just
    careful. We know you guys would flay us if we botched the
    job.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3"><b>Development Library browser gets a new
    name and another face-lift</b></font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Eat your heart out, Liz. By the time you
    read this, your July Development Library may have
    arrived&#151;and it's going to make your socks roll up and
    down. It's got an updated browser, renamed InfoViewer
    (version 2.5 for those of you at home playing the Microsoft
    version number game along with us). Here are a few of the
    cool things you can expect to see:</font></p>
    <blockquote>
        <p><font size="2">&#149; Copy text as RTF (including
        graphics&#151;YES!)</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">&#149; Pop-up menus</font><font
        size="2" face="Symbol">¾</font><font size="2">a
        right-mouse-click away</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">&#149; Microsoft Office standards (Find
        is now Query, and so on)</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font size="2">Also, be sure to pop in to Dr. GUI's
    Espresso Stand for a cup of 'feine and the latest on the
    Development Library.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3"><b>Tea for two and T for early renewal too</b></font></p>
    <p><font size="2">One Rami Rasanen of Fort Lauderdale,
    Florida, wrote and asked us what the delay was regarding his
    T-shirt. He renewed his Developer Network membership early,
    and by gosh we should have sent him the Dr. GUI T-shirt as
    promised. He also threatened to stay &quot;buck naked&quot;
    in protest until the T-shirt arrives.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Frankly, Rami, we don't really want to know
    about your dressing habits, okay? And sorry about the delay,
    eh? As it turns out, so many of you renewed early that the
    T-shirt inventory dried up a little quicker than we expected
    and so caught us with our pants down, that is, shirts off. We
    have since finished the new design and produced several
    truckloads of these awesome shirts, so we won't be running
    out of inventory any time before the Federal budget is
    balanced.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3"><b>Windows 95 updated shipment</b></font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Jason S. Short of Orlando, Florida, wrote
    and asked when the latest build of Windows 95 would ship to
    Developer Network Level 2 members. He also threw in some
    colorful metaphors that I'll leave to your imagination.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">There's no need for ugliness. The Windows
    95 shipment was set to go out in June.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Thanks for tuning in to Backtalk this
    issue; now I believe your mother is expecting a call. Don't
    be shy. Send us your comments, suggestions, whines, and
    moans.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2"><i>Melinda Hohlbein relies on you to fill
    her head with crazy notions and wild ideas for improving the
    Developer Network. Don't disappoint her&#151;she has a large,
    cranky Doberman.</i></font></p>
