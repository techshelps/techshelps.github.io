    <p><font size="5"><b>Development Library Viewing Engine
    Merged into Visual Tools Development Environment</b></font></p>
    <p><font size="2">J. Keith Bankston and Peter Lancaster</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">September 12, 1995</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">During the last year, the Developer Network
    and the Visual C++ group have collaborated to merge the
    features of the Development Library's viewing engine<b> </b>into
    the Microsoft Developer Studio, the Visual C++ 4.0 new
    development environment.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">The result is called InfoViewer 3.0, which
    is the Development Library's current InfoViewer engine fully
    merged into the Developer Studio. (See &quot;New UI Features
    for Development Library&quot; by Mike Colee, <i>Developer
    Network News</i>, July/August 1995.)</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">The purpose of this joint effort was to
    create a single viewing technology so users could share
    information between the Development Library, Developer
    Studio, and other products using InfoViewer. Because many
    people employ both products, it didn't make sense that
    incompatibilities between the two viewing technologies denied
    people programming in Visual C++ easy access to information
    in the Development Library.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Users of the Development Library alone will
    continue to get InfoViewer on the CD. If, however, they
    install any of several new Microsoft development tools that
    use Developer Studio, including Visual C++ 4.0, Fortran
    PowerStation 4.0, or Microsoft Visual Test 4.0, they will get
    the combined advantage of both the Developer Studio and the
    Development Library.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">The additional features in the Developer
    Studio include dockable windows, customizable toolbars, and a
    Microsoft Office-like interface.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3"><b>The advantages of integration</b></font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Developer Studio with the InfoViewer
    component is the common design environment of Visual C++ 4.0,
    Fortran PowerStation 4.0, and Visual Test 4.0. The result of
    this work is integrated information and development systems
    with a single common interface.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">What are some of the advantages of this
    integration? First of all, you can use the InfoViewer
    component of Developer Studio to open Books Online or the
    Development Library from Visual C++ 4.0, Visual Test 4.0, or
    Fortran PowerStation 4.0. For all of these products, the user
    interface and functionality for online documentation are the
    same. If you are programming with a development tool such as
    Fortran PowerStation 4.0, for example, you can press F1 on a
    keyword in a source file and get information on that keyword
    contained in the Development Library if you want.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">There are also other new features for Books
    Online users that come with InfoViewer, such as glossary
    pop-ups, See Also drop-downs, and, within the Developer
    Studio, drag-and-drop copy and search integration.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">If you are working in any Developer
    Studio-based product, you'll also be able to open information
    titles from other Microsoft products, such as TechNet and
    Visual Basic 4.0, that use InfoViewer as a viewing engine for
    their documentation. F1 can search these titles for
    information on a keyword as well.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3"><b>Finding it in the Development Library</b></font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Developers who subscribe to the Developer
    Network can now take advantage of this integration. The
    Development Library serves as a one-stop source for all
    Microsoft online product documentation for developer-related
    products. You can now use the Development Library in place of
    the individual documentation for Visual C++, Fortran, and
    Visual Test, plus have access to the documentation for
    software development kits (SDKs) and device driver kits
    (DDKs), technical articles, online books and periodicals, and
    Knowledge Base articles in the Library. On top of that (here
    comes the plug!), the Development Library is updated
    quarterly and contains the most recent documentation for
    these products.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Check it out. We've received lots of
    requests for this integration. We hope you'll like it. As
    always, we expect to hear from you about any problems.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2"><i>J. Keith Bankston is a program manager
    and longtime slacker in the Development Library technology
    group. He worked himself into a frenzy to deliver InfoViewer
    2.5 and InfoViewer 3.0. Peter Lancaster is a program manager
    for Visual C++. He worked on InfoViewer and is interested in
    every letter in the alphabet, and he white-water kayaks with
    Developer Network writer Dale Rogerson.</i></font></p>
