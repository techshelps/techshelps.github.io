    <p><font size="5"><b>Developer Network Now Offers BackOffice
    Test Platform</b></font></p>
    <p><font size="2">September 12, 1995</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">The Microsoft Developer Network (MSDN) has
    inaugurated a Level 3 membership that will provide developers
    with all the server components of the Microsoft BackOffice
    family for developing and testing BackOffice applications.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Specifically, Level 3 members will receive
    the BackOffice Test Platform, a set of CDs with the latest
    released versions of all five components of BackOffice
    version 1.5: Windows NT Server, Microsoft SQL Server,
    Microsoft SNA Server, Microsoft Systems Management Server,
    and Microsoft Mail Server. In addition, Level 3 members will
    receive the Microsoft Exchange Server Beta 2 and the
    BackOffice Software Development Kit (SDK). (After this, the
    BackOffice SDK with be shipped as part of the Development
    Platform.)</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">The BackOffice Test Platform will be
    available as a special five-connection-limit version of
    BackOffice, designed to provide an easy-to-administer
    licensing model for developers.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">In addition, an annual Level 3 membership
    includes four regular quarterly updates for the year, plus
    special &quot;off-cycle&quot; premium shipments of important
    BackOffice releases, such as Microsoft Exchange and the
    server version of &quot;Cairo,&quot; the next version of
    Windows NT.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">&quot;With Level 3 we're extending the MSDN
    model to client-server development using BackOffice,&quot;
    explained MSDN business unit manager John Rae-Grant, as he
    tried to concentrate on playing a particularly challenging
    six-diamond bid during an international bridge tournament in
    Milan, Italy. &quot;The idea is to put the most up-to-date
    technology in the hands of the widest array of BackOffice
    application developers.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Level 3 members also get all the benefits
    of a Level 2 membership, which includes quarterly releases of
    the Development Platform and the Development Library and six
    issues of this rag per year.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Level 3 members in the United States and
    Canada also receive four phone support incidents, which
    provide one-on-one help for their development needs. Two
    support incidents are provided for the SDKs, DDKs, and
    operating systems that are part of the Development Platform;
    the other two are provided for BackOffice setup and
    installation support issues. Please note that
    &quot;mission-critical&quot; support and &quot;quick
    fixes&quot; are not included with Level 3 membership, but are
    available through the Microsoft Support Network.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3"><b>Moving to client-server development</b></font></p>
    <p><font size="2">&quot;With Level 2, MSDN has provided
    developers client-server technology via Microsoft's SDKs and
    end-user operating systems,&quot; MSDN group product manager
    Keith Szot noted. &quot;Now with Level 3, MSDN is trying to
    provide greater focus on client-server development by also
    delivering the back-end platform technology for testing and
    development.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">All BackOffice server components share the
    same Win32 API and OLE component software technology. In
    addition, the same Win32 API is used on both the client and
    server ends. This means that developers don't have to learn
    two sets of APIs to develop an application.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">&quot;With Level 2, we tried to make it as
    easy as possible for Windows developers to get a wide range
    of systems technology from one source,&quot; explained
    Development Platform program manager Steve Molstad as he
    rushed out of a Redmond 7-Eleven clutching a Big Gulp®.
    &quot;Now we are trying to extend that approach to developing
    and testing server-side apps. Hopefully, with Level 3,
    developers won't have to worry about keeping up with the
    latest BackOffice components. They'll be assured of getting
    them in a timely way with the quarterly releases of the Test
    Platform.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font size="3"><b>Providing BackOffice technical articles
    and samples</b></font></p>
    <p><font size="2">In its quest to provide developers with
    real-world, useful information and guidance, along with the
    BackOffice components, MSDN has unleashed some of its best
    development talent on BackOffice. Those infamous MSDN
    development technology writers Dennis Crain and Nigel
    Thompson have created a fictitious company called NADTEC,
    using only shipping versions or publicly available beta
    versions of Microsoft products. &quot;NADTEC is about two
    guys trying to make heads-or-tails of BackOffice and letting
    the world benefit from their explorations and
    solutions,&quot; Crain explained.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">MSDN subscribers can interact with NADTEC
    through the Internet and direct dial-up phone lines. In
    effect, they can use NADTEC's experience to observe and learn
    from the process of setting up and using a BackOffice
    environment. They can also see how to develop for the
    Internet, use e-mail gateways, and configure BackOffice
    servers.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Thompson and Crain are using their NADTEC
    experience to write technical articles and sample code that
    address and solve common issues faced by BackOffice
    developers. &quot;We hope to provide a great demonstration of
    what a small company can do to develop tools and content for
    the Internet,&quot; Thompson said.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">To see what NADTEC has on the Internet, go
    to http://www.nadtec.com.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3"><b>Level 3 pricing and licensing</b></font></p>
    <p><font size="2">The licensing scheme for the BackOffice
    Test Platform shipped through Level 3 is different from the
    full BackOffice package. It is limited to five connections to
    the products on the BackOffice Test Platform at any one time.
    This licensing scheme is designed to provide developers with
    an easy-to-administer, cost-effective way to develop and test
    BackOffice applications. Development teams do not need to
    purchase any additional client licenses to connect to the
    Test Platform.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Level 3 will be available in September,
    approximately two weeks after the release of Microsoft
    BackOffice 1.5. MSDN is offering special introductory pricing
    to encourage early enrollment in the new Level 3 program.
    Until December 15, 1995, a one-year subscription costs
    US$1195 ($1675 CAN). A Level 2 upgrade to Level 3 is US$995
    ($1395 CAN).</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">After December 15, 1995, the cost of Level
    3 will be US$1495 ($2095 CAN), and a Level 2 upgrade will be
    US$1195 ($1675 CAN). Taxes, shipping, and handling charges
    will be additional.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">MSDN expects to roll out Level 3 on a
    worldwide basis in September. For more information on Level 3
    in the United States and Canada, please call (800) 759-5474.
    Outside the U.S. and Canada, please contact your local MSDN
    program.</font></p>
