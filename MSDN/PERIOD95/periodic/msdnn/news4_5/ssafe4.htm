    <p><font size="5"><b>Visual SourceSafe 4.0 Protects Precious
    Code</b></font></p>
    <p><font size="2">David Streams</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">September 12, 1995</font></p>
    <p><font size="3"><b>New version features integration with
    Visual Basic 4.0 and Visual C++ 4.0</b></font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Code is a precious resource. To protect it,
    developers need to safeguard files against unauthorized
    changes and unexpected failures with some system of version
    control. These systems can vary from gentlemanly agreements
    about commenting on changes and storing old versions to
    sophisticated software systems that track changes and
    histories automatically.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Most of these source control systems work
    well for individual source files. However, almost all <i>fail
    to establish relationships between files</i>. This can pose
    quite a problem in the Windows-based environment, where a
    single application may consist of multiple executable files
    and dynamic-link libraries built of many different source
    files that, in turn, may be reused among many other
    applications. Today it is as important to manage the
    relationships between source files as it is to protect the
    contents of the source files themselves.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">New features in Visual SourceSafe 4.0
    include integration with the Visual Basic 4.0 and Visual C++
    4.0 development environments, a new Windows 95 Explorer look
    and feel to the user interface, and updated menus and icons.
    Visual SourceSafe 4.0 also offers more flexibility with long
    filename support, customizable columns, drag-and-drop file
    sharing, accelerator keys, and tab dialog boxes for easy
    customization.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Visual SourceSafe works with any type of
    file, including text or binary. Visual SourceSafe is a
    multiplatform development tool, supporting Windows 95,
    Windows 3.1, Windows NT, MS-DOS, and Macintosh platforms.
    Visual SourceSafe for UNIX is also available from Mainsoft
    Corporation.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">To understand the benefits of
    project-oriented source control, simply compare it to a
    file-oriented system. A standard version control system (such
    as the UNIX utility RCS) is essentially a collection of tools
    that operate on individual files, controlling file access and
    updates and comparing previous versions. To operate on a
    group of files, you write a batch file or specify wildcards
    on the command line.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Visual SourceSafe stores files in a central
    database on the network, rather than in ordinary MS-DOS
    directories. Projects viewed through Visual SourceSafe
    contain all your source files and histories organized into
    project hierarchies.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">When you retrieve a file, Visual SourceSafe
    marks the file as checked out to you in its database, then
    allows you to make changes to the file on your computer. When
    you check the file back in, Visual SourceSafe updates its
    database and changes the file's access privilege on your
    computer back to read-only.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">So how is this any different from
    file-oriented source control?</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">With each change, the Visual SourceSafe
    database records and tracks project information not available
    to file-oriented systems. Each time a file is added,
    modified, shared, moved, or deleted from a project, Visual
    SourceSafe updates both the file <i>and</i> the project's
    history. You can use project history to:</font></p>
    <blockquote>
        <p><font size="2">&#149; View the status of all files in
        a specific project and all subordinate projects prior to
        building.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">&#149; Zoom in on a specific file
        change that might have caused a bug in a build on a
        certain date.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">&#149; Recreate any previous version of
        an entire application.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">&#149; Maintain source files that are
        shared among many different applications.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">&#149; Determine which projects are
        affected by changing a file that is shared among many
        different applications.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">&#149; Manage client-specific versions
        of a general application.</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font size="2">Attempting these tasks with file-oriented
    systems can be incredibly burdensome and frustrating for
    software developers. Visual SourceSafe project-oriented
    version control is designed to make all of these tasks more
    straightforward.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3"><b>Pricing and availability</b></font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Visual SourceSafe is scheduled for
    availability in October. It will be released in English,
    German, French, Italian, Spanish, and Japanese versions. The
    estimated retail price of the full stand-alone version is
    US$499. Users of SourceSafe version 3.1 can upgrade for an
    estimated retail price of US$99.95. In the United States and
    Canada, contact your local reseller. Outside North America,
    contact your local Microsoft subsidiary.</font></p>
