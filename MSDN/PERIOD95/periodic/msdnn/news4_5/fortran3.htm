    <p><font size="5"><b>Fortran PowerStation 4.0 Targets Code
    Migration and Reuse</b></font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Sunil Alagade</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">September 12, 1995</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Microsoft's development system for Intel is
    designed to allow developers to more easily migrate and reuse
    Fortran code developed on platforms such as IBM mainframes,
    DEC minicomputers, and UNIX workstations to Intel-based PCs
    running Windows 95 or Windows NT Workstation 3.51.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Fortran PowerStation 4.0&#151;scheduled to
    be available in late October&#151;also has extensive support
    for mixed-language programming with the Visual C++ 4.0
    development system, and enables developers to build 32-bit
    Windows-based applications by combining legacy Fortran code
    with C/C++ modules. In addition, it can interoperate with
    other Microsoft development tools such as the Visual Basic
    programming system and Office for Windows 95.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Fortran PowerStation 4.0 ships with
    Microsoft Developer Studio, an integrated development
    environment (IDE) that includes the editor, debugger,
    browser, profiler, project manager, and books online. This is
    the same IDE available in Visual C++ 4.0.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">In addition, it can interoperate with other
    Microsoft development tools such as the Visual Basic
    programming system and Office for Windows 95.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Fortran PowerStation 4.0 fully supports
    Fortran 90, the new ANSI/ISO approved language standard.
    Fortran 90 includes support for the earlier Fortran 77
    standard and facilitates portability because it standardizes
    many common extensions to Fortran 77.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Both the Standard and Professional Editions
    of Fortran PowerStation 4.0 include the 32-bit Fortran
    compiler and Microsoft Developer Studio. The Professional
    Edition is available for an estimated retail price of US$799.
    Licensed users of previous versions as well as Visual C++ 4.0
    and Visual Basic 4.0 qualify for a version upgrade price of
    US$499. The Standard Edition is available for an estimated
    retail price of US$599 (upgrade price US$299). Reseller
    prices may vary.</font></p>
