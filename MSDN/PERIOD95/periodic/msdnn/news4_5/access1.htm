    <p><font size="5"><b>Introducing Microsoft Access for Windows
    95</b></font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Michael Risse</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">September 12, 1995</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Whether you use Microsoft Access alone or
    with any of the Microsoft &quot;visual tools,&quot; such as
    the Visual Basic 4.0 programming system, the Visual FoxPro
    3.0 database management system, or the Visual C++ 4.0
    development system, the Microsoft Access for Windows 95
    relational database management system is designed to speed
    development of your database solutions.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Microsoft Access 95 is 32-bit,
    multithreaded, adheres to the Windows 95 interface
    conventions, and takes advantage of many new Windows 95
    features. This means that running Microsoft Access 95
    requires either the Windows 95 or Windows NT Workstation 3.51
    operating system.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">This article will focus on five areas that
    are important to Microsoft Access and visual tool developers.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3"><b>Microsoft Jet 3.0 database engine</b></font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Microsoft Jet 3.0, the database engine at
    the heart of Microsoft Access 95, will also ship in Visual
    Basic 4.0, Microsoft Excel 95, and Microsoft Visual C++ 4.0.
    Because Microsoft Access has a complete set of database
    creation, design, and optimization tools for Jet, developers
    can use Microsoft Access to build databases for the other
    tools that ship Jet. Developers can also use Microsoft Access
    for ad-hoc report, form, and query creation against databases
    used in Visual Basic, Visual C++, and Microsoft Excel
    applications.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">The Jet database engine currently provides
    referential integrity, inner and outer joins,
    high-performance queries, and an object interface, known as
    data access objects (DAOs), to all Jet functionality.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Microsoft Access 95 adds DAO methods and
    properties for new Jet features and enhances the existing
    set&#151;for example, <b>GetRows</b> (which retrieves rows
    into an array) and additional security methods. Jet 3.0 is
    also speedier&#151;thanks to the new 32-bit infrastructure
    for Jet and open database connectivity (ODBC) data&#151;and
    has better support for multiuser scenarios. For example,
    Microsoft Access no longer places all inserts at the end of
    the database, so there are fewer &quot;lock outs&quot; for
    users inserting data.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">For building Jet databases, Microsoft
    Access currently provides graphical table design and
    relationship windows. Microsoft Access 95 adds the following
    wizards to help design, construct, and optimize Jet
    databases:</font></p>
    <blockquote>
        <p><font size="2">&#149; An Import/Export Wizard that
        lets you choose data types, indexes, and which columns to
        import.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">&#149; A Table Analyzer Wizard to
        decipher flat-file data and create a set of related
        tables with the original data but in a Jet-optimized
        format.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">&#149; A Performance Analyzer Wizard to
        recommend index, data type, and relationship changes for
        faster performance.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">&#149; A Database Wizard with 20
        prebuilt databases that include tables, queries, reports,
        and forms.</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font size="2">No matter which tool you are
    using&#151;Microsoft Access 95, Visual C++, Visual Basic, or
    Microsoft Excel&#151;these wizards for Jet are designed to
    make your database creation and data importation much easier.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3"><b>Data replication in Microsoft Access</b></font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Replication support in Microsoft Access 95
    is &quot;multimaster,&quot; which means that data changes can
    occur at multiple sites. This makes Microsoft Access 95
    replication an appropriate tool for load balancing a network
    database; providing information to occasionally connected
    users such as &quot;road warriors&quot; who dial in from the
    field; and distributing application updates. To keep
    databases in sync with a minimum of network traffic,
    Microsoft Access replicates changes on a row-by-row basis.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Setting up replication in Microsoft Access
    95 is straightforward: create a replicable database (the
    &quot;design master&quot;) and then create copies
    (&quot;replicas&quot;) of the design master. After changes
    have been made to any of the databases, synchronize the data
    changes (made in the replicas and design master) or design
    changes (made to the design master only) between the replicas
    and design master.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">A Conflict Wizard in Microsoft Access
    handles conflicting changes, and advanced replication schemas
    can be created with the Replication Manager in the Microsoft
    Access Developer Toolkit for Windows 95.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Although replication functionality is
    provided by Jet, only Microsoft Access and Visual Basic
    provide the DAO interfaces for replication. Therefore,
    developers using Visual C++ or Microsoft Excel will need one
    of these products to obtain replication functionality.
    Furthermore, only Microsoft Access supports Windows 95
    Briefcase replication, where a Jet database is made
    replicable by dragging and dropping it in the Briefcase.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3"><b>Microsoft Access gains Visual Basic for
    Applications</b></font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Like Microsoft Excel and Microsoft Project,
    Microsoft Access 95 now has Visual Basic for Applications.
    This gives developers the ability to share code and expertise
    across multiple products.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Visual Basic for Applications provides an
    integrated development environment (IDE) with many new
    features:</font></p>
    <blockquote>
        <p><font size="2">&#149; The editor has a line
        continuation character, color-coded syntax, multipane
        code viewing, and optional line-by-line syntax checking.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">&#149; Debugging tools include
        breakpoints, watch variables, an &quot;immediate&quot;
        window, and a calls window to trace open procedures.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">&#149; The object browser enables
        developers to view the object models of OLE Automation
        servers and OLE Controls. New WITH...END WITH and FOR
        EACH...NEXT constructs and advanced parameter support
        make object handling and property setting easier.</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font size="2">Visual Basic for Applications is a superset
    of Access Basic, so all Access Basic keywords, constructs,
    and functions are supported in Visual Basic for Applications.
    (Note that even though all Access Basic syntax is supported
    in Visual Basic for Applications, there are some minor
    changes you may need to make when moving code to 32-bit
    Windows.)</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">The addition of Visual Basic for
    Applications is beneficial not only for Microsoft Access
    developers but also for those with expertise in Visual Basic
    for applications from other products, and for developers
    using Visual Basic who want to share code with Microsoft
    Access.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3"><b>Enhanced OLE support for developers</b></font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Developers using any of the Microsoft
    visual tools that support Windows 95 will be able to use
    32-bit OLE Controls and OLE Automation to assemble custom
    solutions quickly from off-the-shelf applications and
    components.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Microsoft Access 2.0 was an OLE Automation
    controller&#151;that is, it could control OLE Automation
    servers with commands such as:</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Courier New">Word6.Insert 'Hello'
    'control MS Word</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Courier New">Excel5.Recalc 'control
    MS Excel</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Now, Microsoft Access 95 exposes its
    functionality to other OLE Automation controllers so that
    Microsoft Excel, Microsoft Project, Visual Basic, Visual
    FoxPro, and other OLE Automation controllers can automate
    Microsoft Access with commands such as:</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Courier New">Access7.CreateTable 'New
    Issues'</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">This means that now DAOs and all of
    Microsoft Access are accessible to programmers from outside
    the Microsoft Access development environment. In the past
    DAOs were accessible only from Access Basic (that is, inside
    Microsoft Access). Benefits of this new OLE support include
    the ability to create and print Microsoft Access reports from
    Visual Basic and Microsoft Excel.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Microsoft Access 2.0 was also an early
    supporter of OLE Controls, the software component model that
    is best described as an &quot;enhanced&quot; Visual Basic
    control (VBX). OLE Controls help developers build solutions
    with prepackaged, ready-to-use components. Examples of OLE
    Controls include calendar (included in Microsoft Access 95),
    multimedia, telephony, graphing, communications, and online
    controls.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Support for OLE Controls enables developers
    to build (in Visual C++ or Visual Basic) or acquire a library
    of software components that extend the visual tools line with
    new functionality.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3"><b>For developers using Microsoft Access</b></font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Although developers can use Microsoft
    Access to bring database-specific functionality to other
    Microsoft development tools and applications, many developers
    create powerful database solutions using only Microsoft
    Access. This section covers a few new features designed to
    support these developers. These features include enhancements
    to the forms design environment, and tools for managing and
    distributing database solutions.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">With forms design, the key is to enable
    developers to let users &quot;live in forms,&quot; since most
    users prefer the form interface to the less intuitive data
    table. Therefore, Microsoft Access developers can now create
    multiple instances of the same form, change control types on
    the fly (without losing code or properties), and get
    automatic mapping of table data types to form controls (for
    example, a Boolean field becomes an option button).</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Forms are also more intuitive with Filter
    By Form, where every form becomes a query that a user can
    fill in to search for like data, controls tips, multiselect
    list boxes, and custom right-mouse-click menu options.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3"><b>Migrating to Microsoft Access 95</b></font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Finally, a few thoughts about migrating to
    Microsoft Access 95. It is possible to run existing databases
    &quot;as is&quot; in Microsoft Access 95 so they can be
    shared with Microsoft Access 2.0 users. However, changes <i>cannot
    </i>be made to the version 2.0 file format in Microsoft
    Access 95.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Another option is to convert Microsoft
    Access 2.0 databases to the Microsoft Access 95 file format
    to take advantage of the new features, new Jet engine, and so
    on. In this case, Microsoft Access 2.0 users cannot access or
    attach to data stored in the Microsoft Access 95 file format.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">A compromise between leaving the database
    as is and converting to the new format is the Application
    Splitter Wizard, which splits databases into two pieces: the
    data tables, which reside on a network, and the application
    components (forms, reports, and so on), which reside locally.
    That way, both Microsoft Access 95 and Microsoft Access 2.0
    users can access the data while running different versions of
    Microsoft Access on their desktop PCs.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3"><b>Pricing and availability</b></font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Microsoft Access 95 (which is version 7.0,
    to be consistent with the other Microsoft Office 95
    applications) is scheduled for availability by the end of
    November. Major European language versions will be released
    within 45 days of the U.S. version. Microsoft Access 95 will
    be sold both as part of the Microsoft Office, Professional
    Edition and as a stand-alone database product.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">The estimated retail price of stand-alone
    Microsoft Access 95 will be US$339. There will also be an
    introductory upgrade price of US$109 through December 31,
    1995. After that an upgrade will cost US$129.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Microsoft Office 95, Professional Edition
    will have an estimated retail price of US$599. It will be
    available at the same time as Windows 95 (it includes a
    coupon for Microsoft Access 95). Until December 31, 1995, a
    version upgrade will cost US$309 and a competitive upgrade
    US$349. After that the upgrade will cost US$399.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">In the U.S. and Canada, contact your local
    reseller. Outside North America, contact a reseller or your
    local Microsoft subsidiary. More information on the products
    can also be found on The Microsoft Network at MSN: Go
    Accessdev, or on the World Wide Web at

    <p><font size="2"><i>Michael Risse is the lead product
    manager for Microsoft Access and has shipped three versions
    of Visual Basic and one of Microsoft Office. He is trying to
    reacquaint his fly rod with the rivers of Montana.</i></font></p>
    <p><font size="5"><b>Microsoft Access Developer Toolkit for
    Windows 95</b></font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Microsoft is also providing tools for
    distributing and managing Microsoft Access solutions in the
    Microsoft Access Developer Toolkit (ADT) for Windows 95, one
    of the hundreds of Microsoft Access support tools that
    includes books, add-on tools, publications, and conferences.

    distributing solutions to non-Microsoft Access users, an
    improved Setup Wizard, two-volume Visual Basic for
    Applications reference, additional OLE Controls, and the
    Replication Manager for advanced replication schemas and
    support for replication drop boxes.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">The Access Developer Toolkit for Windows 95
    is scheduled for availability in November, with an estimated
    retail price of US$499. Registered ADT 2.0 owners in North
    America qualify for a US$100 rebate. (A coupon will be in the
