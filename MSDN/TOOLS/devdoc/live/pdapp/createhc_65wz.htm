<h3><a name="_tools_setting_the_left_and_right_indents"></a>Setting the Left and Right Indents</h3>
<p>
When Windows Help displays its window, it automatically creates left and right margins and wraps text to fit within these margins. The margins are positioned slightly within the left and right edges of the window to prevent text in the topic from being clipped by the window.</p>
<p>
You can override these margins by setting the left and right indents for a paragraph. The <b>\li</b> and <b>\ri</b> statements set an indent to a position relative to the corresponding left and right margins. For example, the following paragraph is indented 1 inch (1440 twips) from the left margin:</p>
<pre><code>\li1440
This paragraph is indented 1 inch.
\par \pard
This paragraph is not indented.
 </code></pre>
<p>
Once indents are set, they apply to all subsequent paragraphs up to the next <b>\pard</b> statement. Note that the <b>\pard</b> statement must follow the <b>\par</b> statement that ends the paragraph to be indented.</p>
<p>
You can set an indent for the first line in a paragraph by using the <b>\fi</b> statement. This allows you to create paragraphs with hanging indents. It is also useful for creating two-column lists.</p>
