<h1><a name="_tools_video_capture"></a>Video Capture</h1>
<p>
The Video Capture tool (VIDCAP.EXE or VIDCAP32.EXE) enables you to capture video sequences and images from your capture board. You can capture sequences and images from a VCR, videodisc player, or video camera. </p>
<p>
Video Capture provides two modes for capturing video sequences: 
<ul>
<li>
Real-time capture</li>
<li>
Step-frame capture</li>
</ul>
<p>
<i>Real-time capture</i> processes a video sequence and audio as the events occur naturally, or as the video source plays without interruption. <i>Step-frame capture</i> pauses the video source as it collects each frame (image) of data. If audio is also selected, this capture mode rewinds the media in the video source and collects audio data as the video source plays a second time.</p>
<h4>Real-Time Capture</h4>
<p>
A video source for real-time capture (such as a video camera or videodisc) provides an uninterrupted stream of information to the capture hardware. The capture hardware copies each frame of the video sequence (and each portion of audio) and transfers it to the hard disk before the next frame of data enters the capture hardware. A video frame contains one image of the video sequence. </p>
<p>
Real-time capture demands a fast computer and hard disk. The computer must process and store each incoming video frame before the next frame is received in the capture board. If the system lags during capture, frames of video data are dropped (lost). </p>
<h4>Step-Frame Capture</h4>
<p>
Step-frame capture collects video frames from a video sequence in a series of steps. In step-frame capture, frames are captured one at a time, generally from a paused video device. You can perform step-frame capture manually, advancing the video source using the controls on the video device. Video Capture also provides automatic step-frame capture for video devices that support the Media Control Interface (MCI). With this method, Video Capture issues frame-advance commands to the source device and captures the sequence frame-by-frame. When Video Capture finishes capturing the current frame, it advances the video source to the next capture point. </p>
<p>
Step-frame capture provides an alternative for systems that cannot process a video sequence in real time. Because the system can fully process a video frame before contending with the next frame, you can use larger frame sizes and color formats, and you can optionally compress the video sequence during capture. When a step-frame capture is complete, you can capture the audio segment associated with the video frames by playing the source video a second time. </p>
