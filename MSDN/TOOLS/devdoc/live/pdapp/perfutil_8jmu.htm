<p>
WPerf is another performance monitor that presents data a little differently than Performance Monitor. </p>

Double-click on the window to display the <b>Select</b> menu. The dialog box that appears allows you to select the counters whose information is to be displayed. Two of these counters are not available through Performance Monitor, because they are supported only by certain RISC machines: 1st Level TB Fills/Sec and 2nd Level TB Fills/Sec. The TB is the page translation buffer in the processor, which is used to translate virtual addresses to physical addresses. On some RISC machines, resolving TB misses is a software operation and its high frequency reduces system performance.</p>
