<h1><a name="_tools_using_pview"></a>Using PView</h1>
<p>
The PView process viewer lets you examine and modify many characteristics of processes and threads running on your Windows NT system. </p>
<p>
PView can help you answer questions like these:
<ul>
<li>
What are the process identifiers (PID) of the running processes?</li>
<li>
How much memory does the program allocate at various points in its execution, and how much memory is being paged out?</li>
<li>
Which processes and threads are using the most CPU time?</li>
<li>
How does the program run at different system priorities?</li>
<li>
What happens if a thread or process stops responding to DDE, OLE, or pipe I/O?</li>
<li>
What percentage of time is being spent running API calls?</li>
</ul>
<p>
<b>Warning</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;PView lets you modify the status of processes running on your system. As a result, by using PView, you can stop processes and potentially halt the entire system. Make sure that you have saved edited files before running PView. </p>
<p>
PView95 provides some of the same features for processes and threads running on your Windows 95 system.</p>
