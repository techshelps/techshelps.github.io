<h1><a name="_tools_comparing_files_using_windiff"></a>Comparing Files Using WINDIFF</h1>
<p>
To compare files and display the results graphically, use WINDIFF.EXE. The following line shows WINDIFF command-line syntax:</p>
<p>
<b>windiff</b> [<i>path1]</i> [<i>path2]</i></p>
<p>
where <i>path1</i> and <i>path2</i> indicate the files to be compared. WINDIFF uses the following rules to determine what is to be compared:
<ul>
<li>
If you invoke WINDIFF without specifying <i>path1</i> or <i>path2</i>, you can click <b>Compare Files</b> or <b>Compare Directories</b> from the <b>File</b> menu to specify the files to compare. </li>
<li>
If you invoke WINDIFF with a filename for <i>path1</i>, but nothing for <i>path2</i>, WINDIFF compares the file with a file of the same name in the current directory.</li>
<li>
If you invoke WINDIFF with a directory name for <i>path1</i>, but nothing for <i>path2</i>, WINDIFF compares the files in the specified directory with the files in the current directory.</li>
<li>
If you invoke WINDIFF specifying files for <i>path1</i> and <i>path2</i>, WINDIFF compares the two files.</li>
<li>
If you invoke WINDIFF specifying directories for <i>path1</i> and <i>path2</i>, WINDIFF compares the files in those directories.</li>
</ul>
<p>
The results are initially displayed in outline mode. WINDIFF lists the files that were compared and indicates whether they are identical or whether one file is newer than the other. To view the differences in expanded mode, select the file from the display and click the <b>Expand</b> button. The parts that are common to both files are displayed on a white background. The parts that belong to the file listed on the left are displayed on a red background. The parts that belong to the file listed on the right are displayed on a yellow background. To return to outline mode, click the <b>Outline</b> button. </p>
