<p>
Process Walker (PWALK.EXE) provides a complete listing of the memory usage of a particular process. It displays the process' entire user-mode address space, as well as which DLLs are loaded and where the code, data, and stack are located. This tool is extremely useful for tracking down memory leaks and examining memory usage.</p>
<p>
Each line in the list produced by PWALK contains the following: 
<ul>
<li>
Address</li>
<li>
State (committed, reserved, or free)</li>
<li>
Protection (read-only, read-write, or none)</li>
<li>
Size</li>
<li>
Base Address</li>
<li>
Object</li>
<li>
Section</li>
<li>
Name</li>
</ul>
<p>
You can sort the list by address, state, protection, size, or base address.</p>
<p>
Double-click on any line that displays committed memory to view the contents of the memory. Click <b>Process statistics</b> from the <b>View</b> menu to obtain additional process statistics such as the total committed, reserved, and free memory. Click <b>System statistics</b> from the <b>View</b> menu to obtain system statistics such as physical memory, pagefile, and disk space. </p>
