<p>
You'll often find it useful to edit an entire group of controls. You can drag, cut, copy, paste, align, and size a group of controls.</p>
<p>
First, enlarge the <b>OK</b> button by selecting it and then dragging one of its corner handles with the mouse. Now select all three buttons by dragging open a rectangle with the mouse. To drag a rectangle open, place the mouse pointer beside a control, then press and hold the left mouse button, and drag the mouse. In this way you can select all the controls that are within or partially within the rectangle boundaries.</p>
<p>
Another way to select several controls at a time is to hold down the SHIFT key and click on each control. This is useful for making a group out of a number of scattered controls. You can also toggle the selection state of each control without affecting other controls by clicking on that control while holding down the SHIFT key.</p>
