<p>
You've now designed one dialog, but your application may need many. You can work on more than one dialog at a time in the Dialog Editor.</p>
<p>
Your first dialog was automatically started for you when you selected <b>New</b> from the <b>File</b> menu. To begin work on a second dialog, click <b>New</b> <b>Dialog</b> from the <b>Edit</b> menu. Your first dialog still exists within the editor. Click <b>Select</b> <b>Dialog</b> from the <b>Edit</b> menu to switch between the dialogs.</p>
<p>
You can create as many dialogs as you need for your application. Each dialog is automatically numbered in sequence (100, 200, and so on). To restore a dialog to the state it was in before you selected it for editing, click <b>Restore</b> <b>Dialog</b>. This allows you to abandon your most recent changes. </p>
<p>
To continue creating more dialogs for your application, click <b>New</b> <b>Dialog</b>. When you are finished creating the new dialog, you can save it with your other dialogs by choosing the same base file name. This is how you keep all the dialogs together for your application. The Dialog Editor uses the same group of files to keep track of all dialogs that you save together. See the following section for a description of the files the Dialog Editor writes when it saves a group of dialogs.</p>
<p>
You can save each dialog you create separately. But if you save them together, the Dialog Editor can avoid conflicts when it assigns ID values, and it can also alert you to conflicts when you choose symbolic names and IDs. Also, for each dialog you save separately, you must place three include statements in your project source code. For the typical application, this might amount to about 100 include statements. When you save an application's dialogs together, however, you need only three include statements for your entire project.</p>
<p>
<b>Note</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;If you click <b>New</b> from the <b>File</b> menu and then save with the same base file name as you did before, your previously-saved dialogs are overwritten.</p>
