<h1><a name="_tools_adding_a_control"></a>Adding a Control</h1>
<p>
The toolbox on the right side of the screen contains icons of the mouse pointer and all supplied controls. The mouse pointer, when pressed, indicates that no control has been selected. You can place any of the other controls in a dialog, and you can also create and include your own custom controls.</p>
<h5><img src="../../images/wedge.gif" border=0>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To add a control to the dialog</h5>
<ol>
<li>
In the Toolbox, click one of the control icons.</li>
<li>
Click in the dialog.</li>
</ol>
<p>
You can use the mouse to resize a control with its resize handle. You can move a control with the cursor keys when it is selected or by dragging it with the mouse.</p>
<p>
When a control is selected or created, the properties bar displays information about it. The <b>Symbol</b> edit field replaces the <b>Dlg</b>. <b>Sym</b>. edit field, and the <b>Text</b> edit field replaces the <b>Caption</b> edit field. The numeric control ID edit field appears for controls just as for dialogs.</p>
<p>
You can associate a symbolic name with the control's ID by typing the name in the <b>Symbol</b> edit field. The Dialog Editor assigns each new control in a dialog an ID number. It assigns these numbers sequentially, beginning with the number following the dialog ID. Even if you assigned it a zero-terminated string and deleted the integer ID.</p>
