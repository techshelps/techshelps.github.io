<h3><a name="_tools_project_file_sections"></a>Project File Sections</h3>
<p>
Every project file consists of one or more sections. Each section has a section name, enclosed in brackets (<b>[]</b>), that defines the purpose and format of statements and options in the section. Following are the sections used in project files:</p>
<table cellspacing=4 cols=2>
<tr valign=top>
<th align=left width=21%>Section</th>
<th align=left width=79%>Description</th>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=21%>[ALIAS]</td>
<td width=79%>Assigns one or more context strings to the same topic. </td>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=21%>[BAGGAGE]</td>
<td width=79%>Lists files that are to be placed within the help file (which contains its own file system). </td>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=21%>[BITMAPS]</td>
<td width=79%>Specifies bitmap files. This section is not required if the project file lists a path for bitmap files by using the <b>BMROOT</b> or <b>ROOT</b> option.</td>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=21%>[BUILDTAGS]</td>
<td width=79%>Specifies valid build tags. </td>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=21%>[CONFIG]</td>
<td width=79%>Specifies help macros that define nonstandard menus and buttons used in the help file. This section is required if the help file uses any of these features. </td>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=21%>[CONFIG:<i>x</i>]</td>
<td width=79%>Contains one or more macros that Windows Help runs when opening the corresponding window, <i>x</i>.</td>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=21%>[FILES]</td>
<td width=79%>Specifies topic files to be included in the build. This section is required.</td>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=21%>[MAP]</td>
<td width=79%>Associates topic identifiers with context numbers. </td>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=21%>[MACROS]</td>
<td width=79%>Associates macros with keywords.</td>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=21%>[OPTIONS]</td>
<td width=79%>Specifies options that control the build process. If this section is used, it should be the first section listed in the project file, so that the options will apply during the entire build process.</td>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=21%>[WINDOWS</td>
<td width=79%>Defines the characteristics of the primary Help window and the secondary-window types used in the help file. This section is required if the help file uses secondary windows. </td>
</tr>

<p>
Every project file requires a [FILES] section. This section names the topic files. Most project files also have an [OPTIONS] section that specifies how to build the help file. A very useful option in the [OPTIONS] section is the <b>COMPRESS</b> option, which specifies whether the help file should be compressed or uncompressed. Compressing a help file reduces its size considerably and saves valuable disk space. For more information, see the Help Author's Guide (HCW.HLP) included with the Help Workshop.</p>
<p>
The following example creates a compressed help file from two topic files, MAIN.RTF and MENUS.RTF:</p>
<pre><code>[OPTIONS]
COMPRESS=TRUE

[FILES]
MAIN.RTF
MENUS.RTF
 </code></pre>
<p>&nbsp;</p></body>
