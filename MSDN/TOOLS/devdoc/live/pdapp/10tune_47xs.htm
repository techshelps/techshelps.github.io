<p>
Looking at the CAP output files can be tedious if you have a large program with hundreds or thousands of functions. The CapView utility (CAPVIEW.EXE) provides a great visual alternative. This utility is available in the Platform SDK.</p>
<p>
The following figures show some of the data from running the repaired Solitaire as it is displayed by CapView: </p>

<p>
Each box in the CapView tree represents a line in the SOL.CAP file. If you zoom out you see the overview, and if you zoom in you can see the details of each line.</p>
<p>
The first figure in the box is the number of calls made to that routine. </p>
<p>
The rightmost number in the next line of figures is the time spent in the function itself, expressed in microseconds. The left number is the <i>attributed time</i>. This is the time spent in the function, expressed as a percentage of the time in the function plus the time in the functions it calls. The middle figure is time in the function as a percentage of time in the entire program. </p>
<p>
In the last line, the rightmost number is the attributed time. The middle number is the attributed time in this function as a percentage of time in the program. And the leftmost number is the time in this function as a percentage of attributed time in the calling function.</p>
<p>
The list view of CapView is illustrated following. The attributed columns are shown, but the function-only columns are also available. </p>
