<h2><a name="_tools_priority"></a>Priority</h2>
<p>
The Priority buttons let you change the base priority of the process highlighted in the Process Selection box. This priority determines the activity of all threads of the selected process.</p>
<p>
The priorities used are as follows:</p>
<table cellspacing=4 cols=2>
<tr valign=top>
<th align=left width=22%>Priority</th>
<th align=left width=78%>Description</th>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=22%>Very High</td>
<td width=78%>Maximum priority. CPU time is split between this and other Very High priority processes. Lower priority processes will execute only when all Very High priority processes are blocked. </td>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=22%>Normal</td>
<td width=78%>The standard-priority group, also known as "foreground." Most applications run with normal priority.</td>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=22%>Idle</td>
<td width=78%>The lowest-priority group, also known as "background." Processes with this priority will execute only when the system has no higher-priority processes that need CPU time. Screen savers run at this priority.</td>
</tr>
