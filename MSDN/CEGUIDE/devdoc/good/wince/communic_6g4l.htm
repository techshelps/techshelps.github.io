<A NAME="_remote_access_service"></A>Remote Access Service</H2>

<P>RAS is a software-based multiprotocol router that is used to connect a remote device, known as a RAS client, to a host desktop computer, known as an RAS server. RAS applications are usually executed on the client device and connect to the server using PPP/SLIP. </P>

<P>Windows CE provides support for an RAS client. While most of the standard Win32 RAS functions are supported, only one point-to-point connection at a time is allowed. The connection can be a wired serial connection or a dial-up modem connection.</P>

<P>Entries in the RAS phone book contain the information necessary to establish an RAS connection. Windows CE stores these entries in the registry. The RAS phone book information includes:

<UL>
	<LI>The phone number to dial, along with country code and area code</LI>

	<LI>The IP addresses to use while the connection is active</LI>

	<LI>The network protocols</LI>

	<LI>The type of device being used to make the connection</LI>
</UL>

<P>Windows CE-based applications running under emulation that use RAS can either link to Coredll.lib to resolve the RAS API entry points, which is the proper method for device builds, or use the NT RAS API set, that is, link to NT Rasapi32.lib. The NT Remote Access Service needs to be installed on the desktop computer with at least one port configured for dial out. A modem is also required to use RAS.</P>
