<A NAME="_gly_cabinet_file"></A><B>cabinet file</B></DT>

<DD>A self-contained file with a .cab extension used for application installation and setup. In a cabinet file, multiple files are compressed into one file. They are commonly found on Microsoft software distribution disks.</DD>

<DT>

<A NAME="_gly_cache"></A><B>cache</B></DT>

<DD>A special memory subsystem in which frequently used data values are duplicated for quick access. A memory cache stores the contents of frequently accessed RAM locations and the addresses where this data is stored. When the processor references an address in memory, the cache checks to see whether it holds that address. If it does hold the address, the data is returned to the processor; if it does not hold the address, a regular memory access occurs. A cache is useful when RAM accesses are slow compared with the microprocessor speed, because cache memory is always faster than main RAM memory.</DD>

<DT>

<A NAME="_gly_callback_function"></A><B>callback function</B></DT>

By definition, the CPU is the chip that functions as the "brain" of a computer. In some instances, however, the term encompasses both the processor and the computer's memory or, even more broadly, the main computer console, as opposed to peripheral equipment.</DD>

<DT>
