<DT>

<A NAME="_gly_device"></A><B>device</B></DT>

<DD><B>1.</B> A generic term for a computer subsystem. Printers, serial ports, and disk drives are often referred to as devices; such subsystems frequently require their own controlling software, called device drivers. <B>2.</B> A hardware feature that can — or must — be part of the target platform. For example, a built-in device could be a low-battery notification LED, while a PC Card modem is an installable device.</DD>

<DT>

<A NAME="_gly_device_context"></A><B>device context</B></DT>

<DD>A GDI structure containing information that governs the display of text and graphics on a particular output device. A device context stores, retrieves, and modifies the attributes of graphic objects and specifies graphic modes. The graphic objects stored in a device context include a pen for line drawing, a brush for painting and filling, a font for text output, a bitmap for copying or scrolling, a palette for defining the available colors, and a region for clipping.</DD>

<DT>

<DD>An array of bits that can only be used with a particular display or printer.</DD>

<DT>

<A NAME="_gly_device_driver"></A><B>device driver</B></DT>

<DD>Software that provides control over hardware devices. Device drivers are treated like applications. In the Windows CE environment, they are simply user-level dynamic-link libraries.</DD>

<DT>

<A NAME="_gly_device_driver_interface"></A><B>device driver interface (DDI)</B></DT>

<DD><B>1.</B> The interface between applications and the device drivers. <B>2.</B> A set of functions implemented in the model device driver and called by the Graphics, Windowing, and Events Subsystem (GWES).</DD>

<DT>

<A NAME="_gly_device_driver_kit"></A><B>device driver kit (DDK)</B></DT>

<DD>A set of tools and libraries that enable programmers to write Windows-based software used to run hardware devices such as printers.</DD>

<DT>

<A NAME="_gly_device_driver_test_kit"></A><B>device driver test kit (DDTK)</B></DT>

<DD>A set of tools and libraries that enable you to test the porting of your device drivers to the Windows CE operating system.</DD>

<DT>

<A NAME="_gly_device_independent_bitmap"></A><B>device-independent bitmap (DIB)</B></DT>

<DD>An array of bits combined with several structures that specify the width and height of the bitmap image (in pixels), the color format of the device where the image was created, and the resolution of the device used to create that image. A DIB generally has its own color table, and can therefore be displayed on a variety of devices.</DD>

<DT>

<A NAME="_gly_device_manager"></A><B>device manager</B></DT>

<DD>A program, included on all Windows CE-based platforms, that manages installable device drivers. The device manager handles loading and unloading installable device drivers, identifying the correct driver for plug-and-play devices, managing running device drivers, and notifying installable device drivers of power-up and power-down events.</DD>

<DT>

<A NAME="_gly_direct_memory_access"></A><B>direct memory access (DMA)</B></DT>

<DD>Memory access that does not involve the microprocessor and is frequently used for data transfer directly between memory and an "intelligent" peripheral device, such as a disk drive.</DD>

<A NAME="_gly_dll"></A><B>DLL</B></DT>

<DD><I>See </I><B>dynamic-link library</B>.</DD>

<DT>

<A NAME="_gly_drag_and_drop"></A><B>drag-and-drop</B></DT>

<DD>A technique for moving or copying data between applications, between windows within an application, or within a single window in an application.

<DT>

<A NAME="_gly_drop_down_menu"></A><B>drop-down menu</B></DT>

<DD>A menu that drops from the menu bar when requested and remains open without further action until the user closes it or chooses a menu item.</DD>

<DT>

<A NAME="_gly_dummy_file_filter"></A><B>dummy file filter</B></DT>

<DD>A means for transferring files of nonstandard or possibly unknown extensions for which no translation is necessary. Passing the file through the dummy filter keeps the <B>No Convertor Selected </B>dialog box from being issued to the user.</DD>

<DT>

<A NAME="_gly_dynamic_data_exchange"></A><B>dynamic data exchange (DDE)</B></DT>

<DD>An interprocess communication method that allows two or more programs running simultaneously to exchange data and commands.</DD>

<DT>

<A NAME="_gly_dynamic_host_configuration_protocol"></A><B>Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)</B></DT>

<DD>A Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) that enables a network connected to the Internet to automatically assign a temporary Internet protocol (IP) address to a host when the host connects to the network.</DD>

<DT>

<A NAME="_gly_dynamic_link_library"></A><B>dynamic-link library (DLL)</B></DT>
