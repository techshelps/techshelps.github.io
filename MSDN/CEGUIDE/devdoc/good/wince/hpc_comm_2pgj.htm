<P>As mentioned earlier, the right combination of hardware and software is essential for you to accomplish communication and connectivity tasks. The communication applications that are bundled with the H/PC reside in ROM. They are described in the following list:

<UL>
	<LI>Remote Networking, which combines the functionality of two Windows-based applications 
<UL>
	<LI>Windows CE uses dial-up networking for connecting to a Remote Access Service (RAS) server. Unlike Dial-Up Networking on Windows-based desktop platforms, Remote Networking allows the H/PC to be a dial-up client, but not a server. The H/PC supports connections to RAS servers using Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) with TCP/IP as the underlying network protocol.</LI>

	<LI>Windows CE uses direct cable connection (DCC) for establishing a direct serial connection between the H/PC client and a Windows-based desktop computer host. Direct cable connection allows the client to share the resources of the host computer. DCC uses PPP to establish a data-link-level connection to run network protocols and transport layer protocols. You can determine the state of the DCC connection by using the RAS API set.</LI>
</UL>
</LI>

	<LI>Terminal
<P>The Windows CE Terminal application uses a serial cable or modem connection to connect the H/PC with a desktop computer to transfer files or act as a remote terminal. You can also use Terminal to connect to a remote Bulletin Board System (BBS). Although Terminal does not support file transfer protocols, you can use it to cut and paste information from a BBS.

<P>You can use Terminal to configure modems and set up dialing properties. It also allows the following terminal emulation:

<UL>
	<LI>Generic TTY</LI>

	<LI>VT-100/ANSI</LI>

	<LI>PC Link</LI>
</UL>

<P>In addition to the bundled applications, some manufactures may include software that allows the user to connect a modem to the device's serial port.
