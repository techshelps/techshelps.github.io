<A NAME="_gly_edit_control"></A><B>edit control</B></DT>

<DD>A rectangular window in which a user can enter and edit text from the keyboard. An edit control is also referred to as a text box.</DD>

<DT>

<A NAME="_gly_embedded"></A><B>embedded</B></DT>

<DD>Software code or commands built into their carriers. For example, application programs insert embedded printing commands into a document to control printing and formatting. Low-level assembly is embedded in higher-level languages, such as C, to provide more capabilities or better efficiency.</DD>

<DT>

<A NAME="_gly_embedded_developers_kit"></A><B>Embedded Developers Kit (EDK)</B></DT>

<DD>A set of tools and libraries for creating a custom Windows CE embedded operating systems. The EDK is part of the Windows CE Embedded Toolkit for Visual C++ 5.0.</DD>

<DT>

<A NAME="_gly_environment_variable"></A><B>environment variable</B></DT>

<DD>An element of the operating system environment, such as a path, a directory name, or a configuration string. Environment variables are typically set within batch files.</DD>

<DT>

<A NAME="_gly_ethernet"></A><B>Ethernet</B></DT>

<DD>A widely used LAN developed by Xerox, Digital, and Intel. Ethernet networks connect up to 1,024 nodes at 10 megabits per second over twisted pair, coax, and optical fiber. </DD>

<DT>

<A NAME="_gly_event"></A><B>event</B></DT>

<DD>An event is an occurrence that triggers a notification. Windows CE supports timer and system events.</DD>

<DT>

<A NAME="_gly_event_driven_operating_system"></A><B>event-driven operating system</B></DT>

<DD>An operating system that constantly evaluates and responds to sets of events, such as key presses or mouse movements.</DD>

<DT>

<A NAME="_gly_event_object"></A><B>event object</B></DT>

<DD>A synchronization object that enables one thread to notify another that an event has occurred. Event objects are useful when a thread needs to know when to perform its task. For example, a thread that copies data to an archive needs to be notified when new data is available. By using an event object to notify the copying thread of the availability of new data, the thread can perform its task as soon as possible.</DD>

<DT>

<A NAME="_gly_exception_handling"></A><B>exception handling</B></DT>

<DD>The process of dealing with exceptions, or errors, as they arise during program execution. Exceptions occur when a program executes abnormally due to conditions outside the program's control. Windows CE does not support C++ exception handling.</DD>

<DT>

<A NAME="_execute_in_place_xip_"></A><B>execute in place (XIP)</B></DT>

<DD>The process of executing code directly from read-only memory (ROM), rather than loading it from random access memory (RAM) first. Executing the code in place, instead of copying the code into RAM for execution, saves system resources. Applications in other file systems, such as PC Cards, cannot be executed in this way.</DD>

<DT>

<A NAME="_exit_button"></A><B>Exit button</B></DT>

<DD>A hardware navigation control that functions as the esc key on a keyboard.</DD>

<DT>

<A NAME="_gly_extension_key"></A><B>extension key</B></DT>

<DD>An entry in the registry, corresponding to the extension of a given file, that specifies which file filter will handle conversions for that file type.</DD>
