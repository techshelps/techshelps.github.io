<P>Each field in the DTP control displays a portion of the time information that the control stores internally. The user can select a field to set the keyboard focus, and then provide keyboard input to change the time information represented by that field. The DTP control automatically updates internal time information based on the user's input. Input types recognized by the control as valid are described in the following table. </P>

<TABLE cols=2>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=48%>Arrow keys</TD>
<TD width=52%>The control accepts arrow keys to navigate the fields in the control and change values. The user can press the LEFT ARROW key or RIGHT ARROW key to move in that direction through the control. If the user attempts to move past the last field in a specified direction, the keyboard focus moves to the field on the opposite side of the control. The UP ARROW and DOWN ARROW keys change values in the current field incrementally.</TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=48%>END and HOME Keys</TD>
<TD width=52%>The control accepts the VK_END and VK_HOME virtual keys to change the value within the current field to its upper and lower limits, respectively.</TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=48%>Numbers</TD>
<TD width=52%>The control accepts numeric input in two-character segments. If the value typed by the user is invalid, such as setting the month to 14, the control rejects it and resets the display to the previous value. </TD>
