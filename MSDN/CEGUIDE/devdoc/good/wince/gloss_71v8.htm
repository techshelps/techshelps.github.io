<A NAME="_gly_tab_control"></A><B>tab control</B></DT>

<DD>A control that is analogous to a set of dividers in a notebook or labels in a file cabinet. A tab control is used in a property sheet to provide a way for a user to move from one property page to another.</DD>

<DT>

<A NAME="_gly_tapi"></A><B>TAPI</B></DT>

<DD><I>See </I><B>Telephony Application Programming Interface</B>.</DD>

<DT>

<A NAME="_gly_target_platform"></A><B>target platform</B></DT>

<DD>The system for which Windows CE is being adapted. </DD>

<DT>

<A NAME="_gly_tcp_ip"></A><B>TCP/IP</B></DT>

<DD><I>See </I><B>Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol</B>.</DD>

<DT>

<A NAME="_gly_telephony"></A><B>telephony</B></DT>

<DD>Telephone technology; the conversion of sound into electrical signals, its transmission to another location, and its reconversion to sound, with or without the use of connecting wires.</DD>

<DT>

<A NAME="_gly_telephony_application_programming_interface"></A><B>Telephony Application Programming Interface (TAPI)</B></DT>

<DD>A set of functions in the Win32 API that lets a computer communicate directly with telephone systems. Windows CE supports TAPI version 1.5. It provides the basic functions, structures, and messages for establishing outgoing calls and controlling modems from a Windows CE-based device.</DD>

<DT>

<A NAME="_gly_telephony_service_provider_interface"></A><B>Telephony Service Provider Interface (TSPI)</B></DT>

<DD>The Windows CE TSPI defines the external interface of a service provider to be implemented by vendors of telephony equipment. A telephony service provider accesses vendor-specific equipment through a standard device driver interface. Installing a service provider allows Windows CE-based applications that use elements of telephony to access the corresponding telephony equipment.</DD>

<DT>

<A NAME="_gly_text"></A><B>TEXT</B></DT>

<DD>A Win32 macro that exists so that code can be compiled either as American National Standards Institute (ANSI) text or as Unicode. For Windows CE, which supports only Unicode, the macro forces the compiler to convert ANSI characters to Unicode characters. For example, passing the ANSI string "Hello Windows CE!'' through the <B>TEXT</B> macro converts all characters in the string to 16-bit wide characters.</DD>

<DT>

<A NAME="_gly_thread"></A><B>thread</B></DT>

<DD>A process that is part of a larger process or program. A thread can execute any part of an application's code, including code that is currently being executed by another thread. All threads share the virtual address space, global variables, and operating-system resources of their respective processes.</DD>

<DT>

<A NAME="_gly_thread_identifier"></A><B>thread identifier</B></DT>

<DD>The unique identifier associated with a specific thread. Note that thread identification numbers are reused; they identify a thread only for the lifetime of that thread.</DD>

<DT>

<A NAME="_thread_local_storage_tls_"></A><B>thread local storage (TLS)</B></DT>

<DD>A Win32 mechanism that allows multiple threads of a process to store data that is unique for each thread. For example, a spreadsheet application can create a new instance of the same thread each time the user opens a new spreadsheet. A dynamic-link library that provides the functions for various spreadsheet operations can use thread local storage to save information about the current state of each spreadsheet. </DD>

<DT>

<A NAME="_gly_thread_synchronization"></A><B>thread synchronization</B></DT>

<DD>The method used to coordinate the execution of two or more threads. There are two states in synchronization, signaled and non-signaled. Threads can either modify the state of the synchronization object or wait for the object to reach a signaled state.</DD>

<DT>

<A NAME="_gly_time_out_value"></A><B>time-out value</B></DT>

<DD>A specified time interval used by a timer. Each time the time-out value elapses, Windows CE sends a WM_TIMER message to the window associated with the timer.</DD>

<DT>

<A NAME="_gly_timer"></A><B>timer </B></DT>

<DD>An internal routine that causes the system to send a WM_TIMER message whenever a specified interval elapses.</DD>

<DT>

<A NAME="_gly_tlb"></A><B>TLB </B></DT>

<DD><I>See </I><B>Translation Look-aside Buffer</B>.</DD>

<DT>

<A NAME="_gly_tls"></A><B>TLS </B></DT>

<DD><I>See </I><B>thread local storage</B>.</DD>

<DT>

<A NAME="_gly_toolbar"></A><B>toolbar</B></DT>

<DD>A row, column, or block of on-screen buttons or icons. When these buttons or icons are depressed, macros or certain functions of the application are activated.</DD>

<DT>

<A NAME="_gly_tool_tip"></A><B>ToolTip</B></DT>
</DL>



<P>A small rectangular pop-up window that displays a brief description of a command bar button's purpose.</P>



<DL>
<DT>

<A NAME="_gly_top_level_window"></A><B>top-level window</B></DT>

<DD>A window that has no parent window.</DD>

<DT>

<A NAME="_gly_topmost_window"></A><B>topmost window</B></DT>

<DD>A window with the WS_EX_TOPMOST style. A topmost window overlaps all other non-topmost windows.</DD>

<DT>

<A NAME="_gly_touchpad"></A><B>touchpad</B></DT>

<DD>An input device that functions like a mouse to control cursor movements.</DD>

<DT>

<A NAME="_gly_touch_panel"></A><B>touch panel</B></DT>

<DD><I>See </I><B>touch screen</B>.</DD>

<DT>

<A NAME="_gly_touch_screen"></A><B>touch screen</B></DT>

<DD>A computer screen designed to recognize the location of a touch on its surface. For example, by touching the screen the user can make a selection. Touch screens often serve in place of a mouse or other pointing device.</DD>

<DT>

<A NAME="_gly_trackbar"></A><B>trackbar</B></DT>

<DD>A common control, also known as a slider control, that consists of a bar with tick marks on it and a slider, also known as a thumb. When a user drags the slider or clicks on either side of it, the slider moves in the appropriate direction, tick by tick.</DD>

<DT>

<A NAME="_gly_translation_look-aside_buffer"></A><B>Translation Look-aside Buffer (TLB)</B></DT>
</DL>



<P>A table used in a virtual memory system, which lists the physical address page number associated with each virtual address page number. A TLB is used in conjunction with a cache whose tags are based on virtual addresses. The virtual address is presented simultaneously to the TLB and to the cache so that cache access and virtual-to-physical address translation can occur simultaneously.</P>



<DL>
<DT>

<A NAME="_gly_transmission_control_protocol_internet_protocol"></A><B>Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP)</B></DT>

<DD>Transport and address protocols; TCP is used to establish a connection for data transmission, and IP defines the method for sending the data in packets. TCP/IP is the fundamental basis of the Internet.</DD>

<DT>

<A NAME="_gly_transport_functions"></A><B>transport functions</B></DT>

<DD>A set of functions, exported by a mail transport service dynamic-link library, that are used to transfer mail messages from one location to another.</DD>

<DT>

<A NAME="_gly_treeview_control"></A><B>tree view control</B></DT>

<DD>A hierarchical display of labeled items. The top item in the hierarchy is called the root. If an item has other items below it in the hierarchy, it is also referred to as a parent. Items subordinate to parents are called children. Child items, when displayed, are indented below their parent item. The hierarchy may be expanded or collapsed at any level to display or hide child items.</DD>
