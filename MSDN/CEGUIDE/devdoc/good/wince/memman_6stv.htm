<P>A Handheld PC (H/PC) application must run in the portion of RAM memory not used for storage memory. Because available memory depends on what applications and data are installed on the device, you cannot predict the amount of memory available for an application. A 350 KB application may seem small by desktop computer standards, but it is large for an H/PC. For maximum portability, applications must be small enough to run on 2 MB devices.</P>

<P>To use available memory efficiently, you must decide what functions are absolutely necessary to the users of your application. Consider reducing or eliminating features that do not meet this criteria. Follow the suggestions in this chapter to write memory-efficient applications for an H/PC.</P>
