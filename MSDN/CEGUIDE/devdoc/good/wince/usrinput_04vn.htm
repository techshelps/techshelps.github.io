<P>Windows CE includes two kinds of messages for keyboard events: keystroke messages, which generally control a windows behavior, and character messages, which determine the text that is displayed in the window. </P>

<P>Windows CE generates a keystroke message whenever the user presses or releases a key. When the user presses a key, the system generates either a WM_KEYDOWN or WM_SYSKEYDOWN message. If the user holds a key down long enough to start the keyboard's automatic repeat feature, the system will generate repeated WM_KEYDOWN or WM_SYSKEYDOWN messages. When the user releases a key, a WM_KEYUP or WM_SYSKEYUP message is generated.</P>

<P>System keystroke messages are generated when the user types a key in combination with the ALT key or when the user types a key and the focus is NULL. If the focus is NULL, the keyboard event is delivered to the active window. These messages have the WM_SYS prefix in the message name. </P>

<P>Windows CE does not automatically generate character messages. An application's message loop calls <B>TranslateMessage</B> to generate character messages. <B>TranslateMessage</B> translates the keyboard message into the appropriate character message. Not all keystroke messages generate character messages.</P>

<P>Windows CE includes four character messages: WM_CHAR, WM_SYSCHAR, WM_DEADCHAR and WM_SYSDEADCHAR. The WM_CHAR message contains the character and flags that provide other information. Applications that display characters that the user types from a keyboard process the WM_CHAR message.</P>

<P>Some non-English keyboards provide keys that enable the user to add diacritic marks to characters produced by subsequent keystrokes. In these cases, the system generates a WM_DEADCHAR message when the diacritic key is pressed. When the user presses a subsequent key, Windows CE generates a single WM_CHAR message if the diacritic and character can be combined, or two WM_CHAR messages if they cannot be combined. Applications typically do not process WM_DEADCHAR messages.</P>

<P>The system generates corresponding WM_SYSCHAR and WM_SYSDEADCHAR messages if the keystroke is a WM_SYSKEY style message. Applications usually do not process these messages.</P>
