<DT>

<A NAME="_gly_internet_control_message_protocol"></A><B>Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP)</B></DT>

<DD>A network-layer Internet protocol that provides error correction and other information relevant to Internet Protocol (IP) packet processing, such as testing whether a particular computer is connected to the Internet ("pinging"), by sending a packet to its IP address and waiting for a response. For example, it can let the IP software on one machine inform another machine about an unreachable destination. <I>See </I><B>ping</B>.</DD>

<DT>

<A NAME="_gly_internet_information_server"></A><B>Internet Information Server (IIS)</B></DT>

<DD>A Web server integrated into a Windows NT server.</DD>

<DT>

<A NAME="_gly_internet_protocol"></A><B>Internet Protocol (IP)</B></DT>

<DD>Provides the protocol for connecting hosts over a network, breaking messages into packets, addressing the packets, routing them from the sender to the destination network, and reassembling the packets into the original message at the destination. IP corresponds to the network layer in the International Organization for Standardization Open Systems Interconnection (ISO/OSI) model.</DD>

<DT>

<A NAME="_gly_internet_protocol_address"></A><B>Internet Protocol (IP) address</B></DT>

<DD>A 32-bit (4-byte) binary number that uniquely identifies a host computer connected to the Internet to other Internet hosts, for the purposes of communication through the transfer of packets. An IP address is expressed in "dotted quad" format, consisting of the decimal values of its four bytes, separated with periods; for example, 127.0.0.1. The first one, two, or three bytes of the IP address, assigned by InterNIC Registration Services, identify the network the host is connected to; the remaining bits identify the host itself.</DD>

<DT>

<A NAME="_gly_interrupt"></A><B>interrupt</B></DT>

<DD>A request for attention from the processor. When the processor receives an interrupt, it suspends its current operations, saves the status of its work, and transfers control to a special routine known as an interrupt handler, which contains the instructions for dealing with the particular situation that caused the interrupt. Interrupts can be generated by various hardware devices to request service or report problems, or by the processor itself in response to program errors or requests for operating-system services. Interrupts are the processor's way of communicating with the other elements that make up a computer system. A hierarchy of interrupt priorities determines which interrupt request will be handled first if more than one request is made. A program can temporarily disable some interrupts if it needs the full attention of the processor to complete a particular task.<I> </I></DD>

<DT>

<A NAME="_interrupt_identifier_interrupt_id_"></A><B>interrupt identifier (interrupt ID)</B></DT>
</DL>



<P>A unique value used by the kernel to identify the device that raised the interrupt and that requires more processing. The kernel then uses the interrupt ID to indicate whether all handling is complete, or whether to launch an interrupt service thread that handles further processing by the device driver.</P>



<DL>
<DT>

<A NAME="_gly_interrupt_priority"></A><B>interrupt priority</B></DT>

<DD>One of three thread priority groups. Interrupt priority is reserved for operating system threads.</DD>

<DT>

<A NAME="_gly_interrupt_request_line"></A><B>interrupt request line (IRQ)</B></DT>

<DD>A hardware line over which a device, such as an input/output port, keyboard, or disk drive, can send interrupt requests to the central processing unit (CPU). Interrupt request lines are built into the computer's internal hardware and are assigned different levels of priority so that the CPU can determine the sources and relative importance of incoming service requests.</DD>

<DT>

<A NAME="_gly_interrupt_service_routine"></A><B>interrupt service routine (ISR)</B></DT>

<DD>A small subroutine that resides in the OEM Adaptation Layer. The ISR executes in kernel mode and has direct access to the hardware registers. Its sole job is to determine what interrupt ID to return to the interrupt support handler. Essentially, ISRs map physical interrupts onto logical interrupts.</DD>

<DT>

<A NAME="_gly_interrupt_service_thread"></A><B>interrupt service thread (IST)</B></DT>

<DD>A thread created by a device driver to wait on an event.</DD>

<DT>

<A NAME="_gly_interrupt_support_handler"></A><B>interrupt support handler</B></DT>
</DL>



<P>A routine that registers a driver so that it can handle a particular interrupt and unregister it later. It also enables communication between the interrupt service routine, interrupt service thread, and subroutines within the OEM Adaptation Layer (OAL).</P>
