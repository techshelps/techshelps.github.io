<P>To write an application for Windows CE, you must assemble and use a set of development tools based on one of the programming languages that Windows CE supports. This tool set is your development system. Your language choices are Visual C++, Visual Basic, or Visual J++. If you choose to program in C++, you must then decide which of the C++ toolkits is appropriate for your application. Finally, you can choose to use any of the specialized tools that are supported by Windows CE: Component Object Model (COM), Microsoft Foundation Classes (MFC), Active Template Libraries (ATL), and National Language Support (NLS). These can aid you in writing your application.</P>
