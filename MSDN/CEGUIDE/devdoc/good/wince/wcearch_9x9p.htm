<A NAME="_summary_of_the_windows_ce_operating_system"></A>Summary of the Windows CE Operating System</H1>

<P>The following section outlines the major features of Windows CE. The features mentioned are discussed in more detail throughout the chapter.</P>

<P><B>Kernel</B></P>

<P>The Kernel — the core of the operating system — provides system services for managing threads, memory, and resources. It includes:

<UL>
	<LI>Preemptive, priority-based thread scheduling based on the Win32 process and thread model. Priority inversion is prevented with a system of priority inheritance that dynamically adjusts thread priorities.</LI>

	<LI>Predictable thread synchronization mechanisms, including wait objects. Examples of these mechanisms are named mutexes, critical sections, and named and unnamed event objects.</LI>

	<LI>Efficient memory management based on dynamic-link libraries (DLLs), which link user applications at run-time. </LI>

	<LI>A flat, virtual address space, with 32 MB of memory reserved for each process. Process memory is protected by altering page protections.</LI>

	<LI>On-demand paging for both read-only memory (ROM) and random access memory (RAM).</LI>

	<LI>Heap size that is limited only by available memory.</LI>

	<LI>Control of interrupt handling. You can map interrupt requests (IRQs) to hardware interrupts and implement your own interrupt service routines and interrupt service threads.</LI>

	<LI>Extensive debugging support, such as including just-in-time debugging.</LI>
</UL>

<P><B>Persistent Storage</B></P>

<P>The file system supports persistent storage of information. It includes:

<UL>
	<LI>Support for FAT file systems with up to nine FAT volumes.</LI>

	<LI>Transactioned file handling to protect against data loss.</LI>

	<LI>Demand paging for devices that support paging.</LI>

	<LI>FAT file system mirroring to allow preservation of the file system if power is lost or cold reset is needed.</LI>

	<LI>Installable block device drivers.</LI>
</UL>

<P><B>Communications Interface</B></P>

<P>The communications interface supports a wide range of technologies. It includes:

<UL>
	<LI>Support for serial communications, including infrared links.</LI>

	<LI>Support for Internet client applications, including Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) and File Transfer Protocol (FTP) protocols.</LI>

	<LI>A Common Internet File System (CIFS) redirector for access to remote file systems by means of the Internet.</LI>

	<LI>A subset of Windows Sockets (Winsock) version 1.1, plus support for Secure Sockets.</LI>

	<LI>A Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) transport layer configurable for wireless networking.</LI>

	<LI>An Infrared Data Association (IrDA) transport layer for robust infrared communication.</LI>

	<LI>Both Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) and Serial Line Internet Protocol (SLIP) for serial-link networking.</LI>

	<LI>Support for local area networking through the network driver interface specification (NDIS).</LI>

	<LI>Support for managing phone connections with the Telephony API (TAPI).</LI>

	<LI>A Remote Access Services (RAS) client for connections to remote file systems by modem.</LI>
</UL>

<P><B>Graphics, Windowing, and Events Subsystem (GWES)</B></P>

<P>The GWES module supports the graphics and windowing functionality needed to display text and images and to receive user input. It includes:

<UL>
	<LI>Support for a broad range of window styles, including overlapping windows.</LI>

	<LI>A large selection of customizable controls.</LI>

	<LI>Support for keyboard and stylus input. </LI>

	<LI>A command bar combining the functionality of a toolbar and a menu bar.</LI>

	<LI>An <B>Out of Memory</B> dialog box that requests user action when the system is low on memory.</LI>

	<LI>Full UNICODE support.</LI>

	<LI>A multiplatform graphics device interface (GDI) that supports the following features:
<UL>
	<LI>Both color and grayscale displays, with color depths of up to 32 bits per pixel.</LI>

	<LI>Palette management.</LI>

	<LI>TrueType and raster fonts.</LI>

	<LI>Printer, memory, and display device contexts (DCs).</LI>

	<LI>Advanced shape drawing and bit block transfer capabilities.</LI>
