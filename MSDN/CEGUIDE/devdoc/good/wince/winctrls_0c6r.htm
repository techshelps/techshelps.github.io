<A NAME="_combo_box_styles"></A>Combo Box Styles</H2>

<P>Because of limited screen space, Windows CE-based devices use either the CBS_DROPDOWN or CBS_DROPDOWNLIST style rather than the CBS_SIMPLE style that is popular on Windows-based desktop platforms. In the CBS_SIMPLE style, the list box is always visible and the current selection is displayed in the edit control. In the the CBS_DROPDOWN or CBS_DROPDOWNLIST styles, the list box is not displayed until the user selects an icon next to the edit control, which conserves space on the screen. The difference between the two styles is that the CBS_DROPDOWNLIST style has a static text field that always displays the current selection instead of having an edit control.</P>

<P>Window CE does not support owner-drawn combo boxes.</P>

<P><B>Note</B>  If you specify the CBS_EX_CONSTSTRINGDATA style when the application inserts a string into the list part of a combo box, the combo box stores the pointer passed to it by the application rather than copying the string. This saves RAM resources when you have a large table of strings in ROM that you want to insert into a combo box.</P>

<P>All combo boxes in Windows CE have the LBS_HASSTRINGS style by default.</P>

<P>Combo box styles supported by Windows CE are described in the following table.</P>

<TABLE cols=2>

</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
