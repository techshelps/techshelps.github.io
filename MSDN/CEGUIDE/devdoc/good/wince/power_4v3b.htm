<P>Resuming computer operation from the on state's idle mode or the suspend state does not alter computer memory or change application settings. In contrast, rebooting or resetting the computer does alter memory and affect program operation. The differences between these transitions are described in the following table. </P>

<TABLE cols=2>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TH align=left width=23%>Transition</TH>
<TH align=left width=77%>Description</TH>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=23%>Wake-up, <BR>
or resume</TD>
<TD width=77%>Transitions from the suspend state to the on state's full-speed mode. Wake-up does not change memory or application settings.</TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=23%>Cold boot, <BR>
or cold reset</TD>
<TD width=77%>Resets the device completely. All applications are terminated, the working memory is cleared, and the object store is cleared.</TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=23%>Power-on reset</TD>
<TD width=77%>Transitions from the dead state to the on state. Power-on reset has the same consequences as a cold boot.</TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=23%>Warm boot, <BR>
or warm reset</TD>
<TD width=77%>Terminates all applications and clears working memory. The object store integrity is maintained.</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE><BR>

<P>The cold boot and power-on reset transitions occur when power is first applied to the computer, or when all power is removed from the computer and then reapplied after one minute. Unless the computer uses nonvolatile memory, the user will have to load or reload applications after a power-on reset. Object store data is lost after a cold boot.</P>

<P>A warm boot occurs when the user presses the reset button on the computer. This button is placed in a pin-hole recess or under the battery cover to protect it from accidental activation. Users perform a warm boot only when the computer has stopped responding or has become unstable. A warm boot stops applications that are running and clears the memory used for application execution. Memory used for the object store and file system is preserved. </P>
