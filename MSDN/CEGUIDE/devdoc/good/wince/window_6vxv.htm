<P>Windows CE includes several system-defined windows classes. Because Windows CE registers these classes, you do not need to; you can immediately create windows with them. </P>

<P>The simplest group of these built-in classes are the controls. Controls provide simple display and user interaction. You generally create controls as child windows of a more complicated window.</P>

<P>Dialog boxes are windows that manage a number of controls. You create them with a template that specifies which controls are to be included in the dialog box. The dialog box then manages the user interaction between the controls and the rest of the program.</P>

<P>Message boxes are highly specialized dialog boxes. They generally have minimal text and a few buttons. Because the system handles the details of creating and interacting with the dialog box, message boxes are easy to use.</P>
