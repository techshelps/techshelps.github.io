<A NAME="_user_input_ch"></A>User Input</H1>

<P>User input is the means by which a user communicates with an interactive device, such as a Windows CE-based device. An original equipment manufacturer (OEM) can configure Windows CE to meet the user input requirements of a variety of different hardware platforms. Windows CE supports keyboard, mouse, and stylus input devices.</P>

<P>Different Windows CE-based platforms support different combinations of input devices. For example, some platforms, such as the Palm-size PC, support a touch screen, rather than a keyboard, for text entry. Other platforms may include handwriting recognition software in place of, or in addition to, a keyboard. Keep your target platform in mind when you design an application. </P>
