<A NAME="_rebar_styles"></A>Rebar Styles</H2>

<P>Rebar styles supported by Windows CE are described in the following table.</P>

<TABLE cols=2>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TH align=left width=36%>Style </TH>
<TH align=left width=64%>Description</TH>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=36%>CCS_VERT</TD>
<TD width=64%>Causes the control to appear vertically at the left side of the parent window.</TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=36%>RBS_AUTOSIZE</TD>
<TD width=64%>Specifies that the layout of a band will automatically change when the size or position of its control changes. When the layout changes, the control sends<B> </B>an RBN_AUTOSIZE notification. </TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=36%>RBS_BANDBORDERS</TD>
<TD width=64%>Displays narrow lines to separate adjacent bands. </TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=36%>RBS_FIXEDORDER</TD>
<TD width=64%>Displays multiple bands in the same order at all times. A user can move bands to different rows, but the band order is static. </TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=36%>RBS_SMARTLABELS</TD>
<TD width=64%>Displays the icon for a band that has one only when the band is minimized. If a band has a text label, the label is displayed only when the band is in its restored state or in its maximized state.</TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=36%>RBS_VARHEIGHT</TD>
<TD width=64%>Displays a band at the minimum required height, when possible. Without this style, the command bands control displays all bands at the same height, using the height of the tallest visible band to determine the height of other bands. </TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=36%>RBS_VERTICALGRIPPER</TD>
<TD width=64%>Displays the size grip vertically, instead of horizontally, in a vertical command bands control. This style is ignored for command bands controls that do not have the CCS_VERT style. </TD>
</TR>
</TABLE><BR>

<P><B>Note</B>  Windows CE is the only Windows-based platform that supports the RBS_SMARTLABELS style for rebar controls.</P>

<P>Windows CE also supports a rebar band style, called RBBS_NOGRIPPER. When you assign this style to a band in a rebar, the band does not have a gripper. This style applies to individual bands, not to the entire rebar.</P>
