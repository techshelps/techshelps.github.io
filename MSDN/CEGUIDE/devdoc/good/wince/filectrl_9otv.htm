<A NAME="_image_lists"></A>Image Lists</H1>

<P>An image list is a collection of images that are all the same size. You can create the images in a single wide bitmap or as individual bitmaps that you add to the list one at a time. Image lists manage images, but they do not display the images directly. They can be used independently or in conjunction with list view and tree view controls. </P>

<P>There are two types of image lists, nonmasked and masked. A nonmasked image list consists of a color bitmap that contains one or more images. A masked image list consists of two bitmaps of equal size. The first is a color bitmap that contains the images, and the second is a monochrome bitmap that contains a series of masks—one for each image in the first bitmap.</P>

<P>Windows CE draws a nonmasked image by simply copying it into the target device context, and drawing it over the existing background color of the device context. Windows CE draws a masked image by combining its bits with the bits of the mask, typically producing transparent areas in the bitmap where the background color of the target device context shows through. </P>

<P><B>Note</B>  Most Windows CE-based platforms do not support cursors, except for the wait cursor, which resembles a spinning hourglass. Therefore, image lists cannot contain cursors.</P>
