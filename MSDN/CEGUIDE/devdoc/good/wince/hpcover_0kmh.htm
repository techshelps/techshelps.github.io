<A NAME="_clipboard_api"></A>Clipboard API</H2>

<P>The clipboard is the standard Windows method of transferring data between a source and a destination. Clipboard operations are copy, cut, and paste. Because all applications have access to the clipboard, a user can easily transfer data within a single application or between applications. </P>

<P>In most cases, your H/PC application will use the clipboard the same way that it is used by Windows-based desktop platforms. However, the clipboard API does not support clipboard viewers and private clipboard formats, and it provides clipboard functions that are not available to its desktop counterpart, such as <B>GetClipboardDataAlloc</B>. This function is similar to the <B>GetClipboardData</B> function, except that the memory for the data is allocated and owned by the calling process, rather than by the clipboard. The <B>GetClipboardDataAlloc</B> function can save you from making an extra memory allocation when clipboard data is transferred across processes.</P>
