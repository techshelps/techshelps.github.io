<DD><I>See </I><B>Random Access Memory</B>.</DD>

<DT>

<A NAME="_gly_random_access_memory"></A><B>Random Access Memory</B></DT>

<DD>Semiconductor-based memory that can be read and written by the CPU or other hardware devices.</DD>

<DT>

<A NAME="_gly_rapi"></A><B>RAPI</B></DT>

<DD><I>See </I><B>Remote Application Programming Interface</B>.</DD>

<DT>

<A NAME="_gly_raster_font"></A><B>raster font</B></DT>

<DD>A font in which each glyph (character or symbol) is of a particular size and style, designed for a specific resolution of device and described as a unique bitmap. There are seven system raster fonts available in several sizes stored in the Windows CE read-only memory (ROM). The built-in fonts are built into the Windows CE operating system. Raster fonts are also known as bitmap fonts and non-scalable fonts.</DD>

<DT>

<A NAME="_gly_raw_infrared"></A><B>raw infrared (raw IR)</B></DT>

<DD>A method of receiving data through an infrared transceiver. Raw IR treats the IR transceiver like a serial cable and does not process data in any way. The application is responsible for handling collision detection and other potential problems.</DD>

<DT>

<A NAME="_gly_read_only_memory"></A><B>read-only memory (ROM)</B></DT>

<DD>Any semiconductor circuit serving as a memory that contains instructions or data that can be read but not modified, regardless of whether it was placed there by a manufacturer or by a programming process.</DD>

<DT>

<A NAME="_gly_rebar_control"></A><B>rebar control</B></DT>

<DD>A rebar control acts as a container for child windows. A rebar control contains one or more bands. Each band can contain one child window, which can be a toolbar or any other control.</DD>

<DT>

<A NAME="_gly_record"></A><B>record</B></DT>

<DD>A data structure that is a collection of elements, each with its own name and type. The elements of a record represent different types of information and are accessed by name. A record can be accessed as a collective unit of elements, or the elements can be accessed individually. A collection of records is a database. A Windows CE database consists of an arbitrary number of records, where each record consists of one or more properties<I>.</I> Each of the records in a specific database typically contain a similar set of properties. A Windows CE database should not be confused with a full-fledged relational database. It is simply a general-purpose, flexible, structured collection of data.</DD>

<DT>

<A NAME="_gly_rectangle"></A><B>rectangle</B></DT>

<DD>A function that draws a rectangular image.</DD>

<DT>

<A NAME="_gly_reentrant_code"></A><B>reentrant code</B></DT>

<DD>Code written so that it can be shared by several programs or threads within a single process simultaneously. When code is reentrant, one thread can safely interrupt the execution of another thread, execute its own code, and then return control to the first thread in such a way that the first thread does not fail or behave in an unexpected way.</DD>

<DT>

<A NAME="_gly_region"></A><B>region</B></DT>

<DD>A rectangle, polygon, ellipse, or a combination of two or more of these shapes used by Windows-based applications to define a part of the client area to be painted, inverted, filled with output, framed, or used for hit testing. </DD>

<DT>

<A NAME="_gly_registered_notification"></A><B>registered notification</B></DT>

<DD>The state of a user notification from the time <B>CeSetUserNotification</B> is called until the time the user is notified.</DD>

<DT>

<A NAME="_gly_registry"></A><B>registry</B></DT>

<DD>A central hierarchical database used to store information necessary to configure the system for applications and hardware devices. The registry contains information — such as the applications installed on the computer and the types of documents each can create, property sheet settings for folders and application icons, what hardware exists on the system, and which ports are being used — which the operating system continually references during operation.</DD>

<DT>

<A NAME="_remote_access_server_ras_"></A><B>remote access server (RAS)</B></DT>

<DD>A Windows NT feature by which a single serial connection provides a remote workstation with host connectivity, NT file services, or Novell file and printing services (NWLink). Windows CE supports the standard Win32 RAS functions; however it allows only one connection at a time. RAS functions can be implemented for direct serial connections or dial-up modem connections.</DD>

<DT>

<A NAME="_gly_remote_application_programming_interface"></A><B>Remote Application Programming Interface (RAPI)</B></DT>

<DD>Enables applications running on a desktop computer — the RAPI client — the ability to make function calls on a Windows CE-based device — the RAPI server. RAPI runs over Winsock and TCP/IP.</DD>

<DT>

<A NAME="_gly_resource"></A><B>resource</B></DT>

<DD>Binary data the resource compiler or programmer adds to an application's executable file. Windows resources include icons, cursors, menus, dialog boxes, bitmaps, fonts, keyboard accelerator tables, message table entries, string table entries, version data, and user-defined data.</DD>

<DT>

<A NAME="_gly_rich_ink"></A><B>Rich Ink</B></DT>

<DD>The underlying technology that enables a user to write and draw on a touch-sensitive screen with a stylus.</DD>

<DT>

<A NAME="_gly_rocker_switch"></A><B>rocker switch</B></DT>

<DD>A hardware navigation control designed to perform spatial navigation, much like the up arrow key and the down arrow key. </DD>

<DT>

<A NAME="_gly_rom"></A><B>ROM</B></DT>

<DD><I>See </I><B>read-only memory</B>.</DD>

<DT>

<A NAME="_gly_rom_image"></A><B>ROM image</B></DT>

<DD>Files and binaries as they appear in physical memory as defined by the binary image builder (.bib) file.</DD>

<DT>

<A NAME="_gly_router"></A><B>router</B></DT>

<DD>An intermediary device on a communications network that expedites message delivery. On a single network linking many computers through a mesh of possible connections, a router receives transmitted messages and forwards them to their correct destinations over the most efficient available route. On an interconnected set of local area networks using the same communications protocols, a router serves the somewhat different function of acting as a link between these local area networks, enabling messages to be sent from one network to another.</DD>
