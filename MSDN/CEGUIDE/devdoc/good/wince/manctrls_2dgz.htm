<P>Windows CE supports messages that allow you to customize the look and behavior of toolbars and toolbar buttons. </P>

<P>You can create transparent toolbars by specifying the TBSTYLE_FLAT or TBSTYLE_TRANSPARENT styles. If you give a toolbar the TBSTYLE_FLAT style, the toolbar displays its buttons, but the toolbar itself is transparent. If you give a toolbar the TBSTYLE_TRANSPARENT style, the client area shows through the buttons as well as through the underlying toolbar.</P>

<P>You can use image lists to customize the way a toolbar displays buttons in various states. You can set and retrieve image lists for toolbar buttons by using the TB_GETIMAGELIST and TB_SETIMAGELIST messages for buttons in their default unpressed state, and the TB_GETDISABLEDIMAGELIST and TB_SETDISABLEDIMAGELIST messages for buttons in their disabled state. You load images into a toolbar's image list by using the TB_LOADIMAGES message. </P>

<P>Windows CE supports a toolbar button style called a drop-down button. When a user taps a button that has the TBSTYLE_DROPDOWN style, the toolbar sends the TBN_DROPDOWN notification to its parent window. The parent window usually responds by displaying a pop-up menu or list box under the drop-down button. </P>

<P><B>Note</B>  In Windows CE, the <B>TBNOTIFY</B> structure has been renamed <B>NMTOOLBAR</B> to conform to standard naming conventions, but the two structures are identical.</P>

<P>Because toolbars in Windows CE support the custom draw service, you have flexibility to customize a toolbar's appearance. If a toolbar provides this service, it sends the new NM_CUSTOMDRAW notification at specific times during drawing operations. The <I>lParam </I>of the NM_CUSTOMDRAW notification is a pointer to an <B>NMCUSTOMDRAW</B> structure, which contains the information necessary to draw the customized toolbar.  For information on the custom draw service, see <A HREF="ctrls_27sj.htm">Overview of Controls</A>. </P>
