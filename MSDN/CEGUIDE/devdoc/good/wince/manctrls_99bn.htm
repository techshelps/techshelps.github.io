<P>A rebar control, which has one or more bands, is a container for child windows. Each band can contain one child window, which can be a toolbar or any other control. Each band can have its own bitmap, which is displayed as a background for the toolbar on that band. A user can resize or reposition a band by dragging its <I>gripper bar</I>. If a band has a text label next to its gripper bar, a user can maximize the band and restore it to its previous size by tapping the label with the stylus.</P>

<P><B>Windows CE rebar</B></P>

<P>Like other common controls, a rebar control sends WM_NOTIFY messages to its parent window. A rebar control also forwards to its parent window all messages it receives from the child windows assigned to its bands. </P>

<P>You create a rebar control by specifying REBARCLASSNAME in the <I>lpClassName</I> parameter to the <B>CreateWindowEx</B> function. This class is registered when the common control dynamic-link library (DLL) is loaded. You can use the <B>InitCommonControlsEx</B> function to ensure that this DLL is loaded. To register the rebar control class using the <B>InitCommonControlsEx</B> function, specify the ICC_COOL_CLASSES flag as the <B>dwICC</B> member of the <B>INITCOMMONCONTROLSEX</B> structure you pass in the <I>lpInitCtrls</I> parameter.</P>

<P>Rebar controls support the Windows CE custom draw service, which makes it easy to customize a rebar control's appearance.  For more information, see <A HREF="ctrls_27sj.htm">Overview of Controls</A>. </P>
