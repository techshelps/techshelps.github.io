<P>In addition to receiving user input, a user interface provides feedback to the user by displaying messages. Messages are communications to the user that are displayed on the screen. They either inform the user of the system's activities or status, or they prompt the user to complete some action. To be effective, messages should be clear, concise, and understandable to the user. To assist you in creating effective messages, use the following guidelines when writing message text:

<UL>
	<LI>Write using active voice, which is easier to understand than passive voice.</LI>

	<LI>Always state the problem, cause, and solution in your message text, no matter how obvious the solution may be.</LI>

	<LI>Place important information at the beginning of your text. It is easier to remember than items placed in the middle.</LI>

	<LI>Keep messages brief and simple, with sentences that target a fifth-grade reading level. This will ensure your message is communicated effectively to users of varying verbal abilities. </LI>

	<LI>Avoid using unnecessary technical terminology in your messages. Most users do not enjoy searching through reference material in order to translate a message. </LI>

	<LI>Avoid blaming the user for errors. Threatening remarks that blame the user for problems can heighten anxiety and increase the chance of more errors.</LI>

	<LI>Avoid patronizing or condescending messages. They are annoying and often offensive.</LI>

	<LI>Avoid relying on default system-supplied messages, because they are often cryptic and can be frustrating to the user.</LI>
</UL>

<P>You can also include an identification number in your message text in order to identify the message for support purposes. If you include an identification number, place it at the end of the message text and not in the title bar or at the beginning of the text where it may curtail the user's ability to quickly read the message.</P>
