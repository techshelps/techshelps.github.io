<A NAME="_overview_of_the_windows_ce_operating_system"></A>Overview of the Windows CE Operating System</H1>

<P>Microsoft® Windows® CE is a compact, highly efficient, multiplatform operating system. It is not a reduced version of Microsoft® Windows® 95, but was designed from the ground up as a multithreaded, fully preemptive, multitasking operating system for platforms with limited resources. Its modular design allows it to be customized for products ranging from consumer electronic devices to specialized industrial controllers. </P>

<P><B>General Features of Windows CE</B>

<UL>
	<LI>Provides you with a modular operating system that you can customize for specific products. The basic core of the operating system requires less than 200 KB of ROM. </LI>

	<LI>Provides interrupt delivery, prioritizing, and servicing.</LI>

	<LI>Runs on a wide variety of platforms.</LI>

	<LI>Supports more than 1,000 of the most frequently used Microsoft® Win32® functions, along with familiar development models and tools.</LI>
