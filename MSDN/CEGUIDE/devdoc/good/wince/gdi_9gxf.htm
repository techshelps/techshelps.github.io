<A NAME="_text_and_fonts"></A>Text and Fonts</H1>

<P>In Windows CE, a font is a collection of glyphs that share a common design. A font is characterized by its typeface, style, and size. </P>

<P>A font's typeface determines the specific characteristics of the glyphs such as the relative width of the thick and thin strokes used in any specified character. The style determines a font's weight and slant. Font weights can range from thin to black. Slants can be roman (upright) and italic. The size of a font is the distance from the bottom of a lowercase "g" to the top of an adjacent uppercase "M," measured in points. A point is approximately 1/72 of an inch. </P>

<P>In Windows CE, fonts are grouped into families which share common stoke width characteristics. Fonts within a family are distinguished by size and style. The font families are described in the following table. </P>
