<P>A push button, also known as a command button, is a small, rectangular control that a user can turn on or off by tapping it with the stylus. A push button has a raised appearance in its default, or off, state and a depressed appearance when it is turned on. Windows CE supports owner-drawn push buttons, which are discussed later in this chapter.</P>

<P>When the user clicks a push button, it receives the keyboard focus from Windows CE, which sends the button's parent window a WM_COMMAND message containing the BN_CLICKED notification code. In response, the dialog box closes and carries out the operation indicated by the button.</P>
