<A NAME="_kernel"></A>Kernel</H1>

<P>The Windows CE kernel contains the core operating system functionality that must be present on all Windows CE-based platforms. It includes support for memory management, process management, exception handling, multitasking, and multithreading.</P>

<P>The Windows CE kernel borrows much of what is best from Windows-based desktop platforms. For example, all Windows CE-based applications run in a fully preemptive, multitasking environment, in protected memory spaces. Windows CE supports native Unicode strings, allowing you to internationalize applications.</P>

<P>Unlike the kernels found on Windows-based desktop platforms, the Windows CE kernel uses DLLs to maximize available memory. The DLLs are written as reentrant code, which allows applications to simultaneously share common routines. This approach minimizes the amount of memory-resident code required to execute applications. </P>
