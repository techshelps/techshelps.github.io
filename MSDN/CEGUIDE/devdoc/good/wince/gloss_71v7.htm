<A NAME="_gly_scan_code"></A><B>scan code</B></DT>

<DD>A code number transmitted to a computer whenever a key is pressed or released. Each key on the keyboard has a unique scan code. This code is not the same as the ASCII code for the letter, number, or symbol shown on the key; it is a special identifier for the key itself and is always the same for a particular key. When a key is pressed, the scan code is transmitted to the computer, where a portion of the read-only memory basic input/output system (ROM BIOS) dedicated to the keyboard translates the scan code into its ASCII equivalent. Because a single key can generate more than one character (lowercase "a" and uppercase "A," for example), the ROM BIOS also keeps track of the status of keys that change the keyboard state, such as the SHIFT key, and takes them into account when translating a scan code.</DD>

<DD>An object whose handle can be specified in one of the wait functions to coordinate the execution of multiple threads. A synchronization object will be a member of one of the synchronization classes. Synchronization classes are used when access to a resource must be controlled to ensure integrity of the resource. The state of a synchronization object is either signaled, which can allow the wait function to return, or nonsignaled, which can prevent the function from returning. More than one process can have a handle of the same synchronization object, making interprocess synchronization possible.

The timing is achieved by the sharing of a single clock. Each end of the transmission synchronizes itself with the use of clocks and information sent along with the transmitted data. Characters are spaced by time, not by start and stop bits. <B>3.</B> A function call that blocks execution of a process until it returns. <I>Compare</I> <B>asynchronous operation</B>.</DD>
