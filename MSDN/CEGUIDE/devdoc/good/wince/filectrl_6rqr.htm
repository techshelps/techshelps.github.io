<P>A list view control that has the LVS_EDITLABELS window style enables a user to edit item labels in place. The user begins editing by clicking the label of an item that has the focus. An application can begin editing automatically by using the LVM_EDITLABEL message. The list view control notifies the parent window when editing begins and when it is canceled or completed. When editing is completed, the parent window is responsible for updating the item's label, if appropriate. </P>

<P>When label editing begins, a list view control sends its parent window an LVN_BEGINLABELEDIT notification message. You can process this message to allow selective editing of specific labels; returning a nonzero value prevents label editing. </P>

<P>When label editing is canceled or completed, a list view control sends its parent window an LVN_ENDLABELEDIT notification message. The parent window is responsible for updating the item's label if it keeps the new label. </P>

<P>During label editing, you can get the handle to the edit control used for label editing by using the LVM_GETEDITCONTROL message. To limit the amount of text a user can type, you can send the edit control an EM_LIMITTEXT message. You can even subclass the edit control to intercept and discard invalid characters.</P>
