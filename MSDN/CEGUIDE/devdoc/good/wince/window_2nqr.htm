<A NAME="_window_styles"></A>Window Styles</H1>

<P>Window styles are attributes that are controlled by specific window style flags. There are also extended window styles that have their own set of flags. For this discussion, "window style" refers to the basic window styles, as well as the extended window styles. However, when you write code, you must distinguish between the two. The basic window styles have a prefix of WS_*; the extended styles have a prefix of WS_EX_*.</P>

<P>Most window styles are set when you create a window. There are a few, however, which are sometimes useful to change while a program is running. Use the <B>SetWindowLong</B> function to change a window style. </P>

<P>General window styles supported by Windows CE are described in the following table.</P>

<TABLE cols=2>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TH align=left width=43%>Style </TH>
<TH align=left width=57%>Meaning </TH>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=43%>WS_CHILD</TD>
<TD width=57%>Specifies a child window. This should not be changed after the window is created.</TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=43%>WS_POPUP</TD>
<TD width=57%>Specifies a pop-up window. This style should not be changed after the window is created.</TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=43%>WS_VISIBLE</TD>
<TD width=57%>Specifies a window that is initially visible. This style can be turned on and off to change window visibility. </TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=43%>WS_DISABLED</TD>
<TD width=57%>Specifies a window that is initially disabled. A disabled window cannot receive input from the user.</TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=43%>WS_CLIPCHILDREN</TD>
<TD width=57%>Excludes the area occupied by child windows when drawing occurs within the parent window. This style is used on the parent window. Windows CE windows always have the WS_CLIPCHILDREN style. </TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=43%>WS_CLIPSIBLINGS</TD>
<TD width=57%>Excludes the area occupied by sibling windows that are above a window. </TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=43%>WS_GROUP</TD>
<TD width=57%>Specifies the first control of a group of controls. This style is used primarily when creating dialog boxes. The group consists of this first control and all controls defined after it, up to the next control for which the WS_GROUP style is specified. Because the first control in each group often has the WS_TABSTOP style, a user can move from group to group. </TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=43%>WS_TABSTOP</TD>
<TD width=57%>Specifies a control that can receive the keyboard focus when the user presses the TAB key. This style is used primarily when creating controls in a dialog box. Pressing the TAB key changes the keyboard focus to the next control with the WS_TABSTOP style. </TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=43%>WS_EX_NOACTIVATE</TD>
<TD width=57%>Specifies that a window cannot be activated. If a child window has this style, tapping it does not cause its top-level parent to activate. Although a window that has this style will still receive stylus events, neither it nor its child windows can get the focus.</TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=43%>WS_EX_NODRAG</TD>
<TD width=57%>Specifies a stationary window that cannot be dragged by its title bar.</TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=43%>WS_EX_NOANIMATION</TD>
<TD width=57%>Prevents a window from showing animated exploding and imploding rectangles and from having a button on the taskbar.</TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=43%>WS_EX_TOPMOST</TD>
<TD width=57%>Creates a window that will be placed and remain above all non-topmost windows. To add or remove this style, use the <B>SetWindowPos</B> function. </TD>
</TR>
</TABLE><BR>

<P><B>Note</B>  Windows-based desktop platforms do not support the WS_EX_NODRAG, WS_EX_NOACTIVATE, and WS_EX_NOANIMATION styles. These styles are only available in Windows CE. </P>
