<P>The most central feature of GWES is the window. In Windows CE-based platforms with traditional graphical displays, the window is the rectangular area of the screen where an application displays output and receives input from the user. However, all applications need windows in order to receive messages from the operating system, even those created for devices that lack graphical displays. </P>

<P>When you create a window, Windows CE creates a message queue for the window. The operating system translates the information it receives from the user into messages which it places into the message queue of the active window. The application processes most of these messages, and passes the rest back to Windows CE for processing. </P>

<P>Windows CE does not send applications any messages dealing with the nonclient area of the window. A window's nonclient area is the area of the window where an application is not allowed to draw, such as the title bar and scroll bars. The window manager controls the nonclient area.</P>

<P>Windows CE does not support the <B>Maximize</B> and <B>Minimize</B> buttons. A user can send the window to the back of the Z order by tapping the window's button on the taskbar. The user restores the window by tapping its taskbar button again.</P>

<P>The taskbar is always visible on Windows CE. You cannot hide the taskbar or use the full screen to display a window.</P>
