<A NAME="_synchronizing_data"></A>Synchronizing Data</H1>

<P>A computer user with a Windows CE-based device and a desktop computer may need to ensure that data is the same, or <I>synchronized</I>, on both. For example, when a user updates information in a personal information manager (PIM) application, that information needs to be synchronized with Schedule+ data on the desktop computer.</P>

<P>Windows CE Services provides interfaces that simplify the synchronization process. Because it takes care of many common services, such as connectivity, conflict resolution, and detection of changes and deletions, you need to develop only the code for your specific data. </P>

<P>You use the synchronization interfaces of Windows CE Services to develop a client and a server. The ActiveSync Service Provider, known as the client, has two parts, one that resides on the Windows CE-based device and another that resides on the desktop computer. The ActiveSync Service Manager, known as the server, is the synchronization engine built into Windows CE Services on the desktop computer. Together, the server and the client make up ActiveSync. Once ActiveSync is installed and the required registry entries have been made, user-defined data is automatically synchronized between the device and the desktop computer. </P>

<P>For a sample application that implements ActiveSync for a stock portfolio, see the Stockpor program in the SDK.<B> </B> </P>

<P>When discussing synchronization, the <I>store</I> is a database that holds the data to be synchronized. An <I>object</I> is a logical unit of data in the store, for example, an appointment. An <I>object type</I> is a name for a particular group of objects, for example, "appointment." A <I>folder</I> is a logical container for an object type, for example, all appointments in Schedule+.</P>
