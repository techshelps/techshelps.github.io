<P>Because Windows CE is a Win32-based operating system, you may be able to re-use code developed for Windows-based desktop platforms with little modification. Though porting existing code can be quicker and easier than writing it from scratch, keep the following differences between Windows CE and desktop platforms in mind:

<UL>
	<LI>Hardware design and function. For example, limited memory will influence how you manipulate graphics.</LI>

	<LI>User interface. The conventional desktop computer model of a user interface that features a keyboard, mouse, and screen may not be appropriate for a Windows CE-based platform.</LI>

	<LI>Win32 API and related development tools. Windows CE supports a subset of what is available for desktop platforms. </LI>

	<LI>Extensions to the Win32 API. Some unique features of Windows CE may have no Win32 counterparts, for example, the Notification API. Other Windows CE features may replace comparable Win32 functionality, for example, the Command Bar API.</LI>
