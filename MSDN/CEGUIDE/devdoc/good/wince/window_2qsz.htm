<P>An <I>overlapped window</I> is a top-level window that is meant to serve as an application's main window. It can also have a command bar, task bars, and scroll bars. An overlapped window used as a main window typically includes all of these components. An application creates an overlapped window by specifying the WS_OVERLAPPED or WS_OVERLAPPEDWINDOW style in the <B>CreateWindowEx</B> function.</P>

<P>Because many Windows CE-based devices have small screens, you should use the full screen for your primary window. To accommodate different screen sizes, use either the dimensions returned by the <B>GetSystemMetrics</B> function to define the size of your primary window or specify CW_USEDEFAULT in the <I>nWidth</I> and <I>nHeight</I> parameters that you send to <B>CreateWindow</B> or <B>CreateWindowEx</B>.</P>

<P>The qualities of an application window depend on the platform for which it was designed. For Windows CE-based platforms that support graphical user interfaces, a typical application window may include a command bar, a client area, and a vertical scroll bar. </P>

<P>The <I>command bar</I> is a Windows CE toolbar that can contain menus, controls, and separators. An application's command bar typically contains a menu bar as well as a <B>Close</B> (<B>X</B>) button, a <B>Help</B> (<B>?</B>) button, and an <B>OK</B> button. Windows CE does not support the <B>Maximize</B> or <B>Minimize</B> buttons found in Windows-based desktop platforms.</P>

<P>Items on the menu bar represent the main categories of commands. Choosing an item on the menu bar typically opens a pop-up menu whose items correspond to the tasks within a specified category. By choosing a command, the user directs the application to carry out a task. In Windows CE, menu bars are always contained within command bars; Windows CE does not support stand-alone menu bars.</P>

<P><B>Note</B>  In Windows CE, the command bar is considered part of the client area. </P>

<P>A <I>pop-up window</I> is a special type of overlapped window used for dialog boxes, message boxes, and other temporary windows that appear outside an application's main window. Title bars are optional for pop-up windows; otherwise, pop-up windows are the same as overlapped windows of the WS_OVERLAPPED style.</P>

<P>You create a pop-up window by specifying the WS_POPUP style in <B>CreateWindowEx</B>. To include a title bar, specify the WS_CAPTION style.</P>
