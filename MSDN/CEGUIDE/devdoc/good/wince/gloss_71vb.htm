<A NAME="_gly_wait_function"></A><B>wait function </B></DT>

<DD>Allows a thread to block its own execution. Wait functions do not return until the specified criteria have been met. The type of wait function determines the set of criteria used. When a wait function is called, it checks whether the wait criteria have been met. If the criteria have not been met, the calling thread enters an efficient wait state, consuming very little processor time while waiting for the criteria to be met. Windows CE supports only single object wait functions.</DD>

<P>A rectangular area on the screen where an application displays output and receives user input.

Therefore, all Windows CE-based applications— even those that lack a visual interface—need to create and manage windows. </P>
