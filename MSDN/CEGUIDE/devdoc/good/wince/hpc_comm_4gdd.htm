<P>The Handheld PC (H/PC) is an extension of your desktop computer and allows you to access your critical data when you are away from your desk. By connecting the two computers, you can transfer data from one to the other. otherYou can also perform tasks on the H/PC remotely. For example, you can debug applications or edit the H/PC's registry from your desktop computer. And, by connecting your H/PC to communication devices, such as modems and pagers, you can send and receive e-mail and faxes, and browse the Internet.</P>
