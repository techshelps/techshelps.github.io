<DD>Priority inversion is a situation in which higher priority thread A spawns lower-priority thread B to access a shared resource that is already in use by lower-priority thread C with greater priority than thread B, blocking higher-priority thread A.

<DT>

<A NAME="_gly_public_key_encryption"></A><B>public-key encryption</B></DT>

<DD>An asymmetric scheme that uses a pair of keys for encryption: The public key encrypts data, and a corresponding secret key decrypts it.

<DT>

<A NAME="_gly_push_button"></A><B>push button</B></DT>
