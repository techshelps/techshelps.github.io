<P>The desktop emulation tool included with Windows CE allows you to write and debug an H/PC application on any computer running Windows NT. With emulation, you can test and debug your application without downloading your software to a device. You can even use emulation to write a Windows CE-based application without having a device. Though you can determine a great deal about the functionality and appearance of your application with emulation, once your application is running correctly in the emulation environment, you must download it to a target device for final testing and evaluation. In addition to testing for defects and reliability, testing for usability is critical, because most Windows CE-based platforms have a small desktop area that can present access problems.</P>
