<A NAME="_inbox"></A>Inbox</H1>

<P>The Windows CE Inbox application provides users with access to electronic mail by means of Simple Mail Transport Protocol (SMTP) and Post Office Protocol 3 (POP3). Inbox works with any Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) network, including the Internet.</P>

<P>Inbox is a Windows CE-based companion to a Microsoft Exchange client running on the user's desktop computer. It is an integral part of the personal information management (PIM) software that comes bundled with some Windows CE-based devices, such as an H/PC.</P>

<P>Inbox has an open application programming interface. The mail interface enables any application to send and receive mail messages mediated through Inbox. When a specified type of message is received, Inbox can automatically launch an application and pass it the message. You can take advantage of this open application programming interface (API) to write additional mail transport and storage applications. </P>

<P><B>Note</B>  Windows CE does not support the Microsoft Messaging API (MAPI) standard. Messaging applications must use the mail interface described in this chapter.</P>

<P>Writing a mail application involves:

<UL>
	<LI>Maintaining a local message heap to work with a message.</LI>

	<LI>Working with the <B>MailMsg </B>and<B> MailAtt</B> structures to manipulate a message and its attachment.</LI>

	<LI>Working with the message store to store, retrieve, and query messages.</LI>
</UL>

<P>Before we discuss how to work with mail messages, you should be familiar with some of the basic mail message elements, including message heap, message store, messages, and message attachments.</P>
