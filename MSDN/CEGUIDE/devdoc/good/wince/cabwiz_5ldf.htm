<P>Windows CE uses a cabinet file to install an application on a Windows CE-based device. A cabinet (.cab) file is composed of multiple files that have been compressed into one. Compressing all files into one has three main benefits: it ensures that all the files for your application are present, it prevents a partial installation, and it allows installation from several sources, such as a desktop computer or Web site.</P>

<P>You use CAB Wizard to generate a .cab file for your application. The Windows CE Application Manager uses that .cab file to install the application. The Application Manager also removes an application from the Windows CE-based device. This chapter describes the methods and tools involved in these processes, and it includes a checklist for troubleshooting application installations.</P>

<P>This chapter also describes how to manage applications by registering desktop file filters, synchronizing services, adding custom menu items, and accessing partnership settings.</P>
