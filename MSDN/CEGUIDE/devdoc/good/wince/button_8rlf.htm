<A NAME="_button_states"></A>Button States</H2>

<P>A button's state can be characterized by its focus state, push state, and check state. The focus state applies to a check box, radio button, or push button. A button receives the keyboard focus when the user selects it and loses the focus when the user selects another control. Only one control can have the keyboard focus at a time. </P>

<P>The push state applies to a push button, check box, radio button, or three-state check box, but does not apply to other buttons. The push state of a button can be either pushed or not pushed. When a push button is pushed, the button is drawn as a sunken button. When it is not pushed, it is drawn as a raised button. When a check box, radio button, or three-state check box is pushed, the background of the button appears dimmed. When it is not pushed, the background of the button does not appear dimmed.</P>

<P>The check state applies to a check box, radio button, or three-state check box, but does not apply to other buttons. The state can be checked, unchecked, or indeterminate; the latter state applies only to three-state check boxes. A check box is checked when it contains a check mark, and is unchecked when it does not. A radio button is checked when it contains a black dot and it is unchecked when it does not. A three-state check box is checked when it contains a check mark, unchecked when it does not, and indeterminate when it contains a box that appears dimmed. Windows CE changes the check state of an automatic button, but the application must change the check state of a button that is not automatic. </P>
