<P>As discussed in the previous section, the operating system displays a <B>System Out of Memory</B> dialog box in some low-memory scenarios. This dialog box informs the user that memory is critically low on the H/PC and prompts the user either to close applications or to increase the amount of RAM allocated to program memory. This dialog box is a special, <I>system modal</I> dialog box that freezes the rest of the system. When it is invoked, socket connections stop functioning and other threads stop running.</P>

<P>After the <B>System Out of Memory</B> dialog box closes, any applications selected by the user are shut down just as if the <B>Close</B> button was clicked. Applications have eight seconds to close. If more memory is requested after four seconds have passed and memory is still critically low, the dialog box reappears. </P>

<P><B>Note</B>  The success of an approach that sends the WM_CLOSE messages when memory is low depends on the ability of an application to shut down in response while allocating little additional memory in the process. If your application requires a significant amount of memory to shutdown, try caching the needed memory. For example, you could hide a <B>Do You Want to Save Your Document</B> dialog box, and then make it visible if you need to close the application unexpectedly.</P>
