<h1><a name="_sna_tpsetup_appc"></a>TPSETUP</h1>
<p>
TPSETUP is a program that simplifies the setting of registry or environment variables needed by autostarted invokable TPs. Without an interface like that provided by TPSETUP, configuring of such variables can be complicated and error-prone. Therefore, it is recommended that you use code like TPSETUP in installation programs for autostarted invokable TPs.</p>
<h4>Operation</h4>
<p>
INSTALL.C, the source code for TPSETUP, can be compiled to work in either the Microsoft® Windows NT® and Microsoft® Windows® 95 environments or in the Windows version 3.<i>x</i> environment. TPSETUP has been constructed so that the program responds correctly in each environment.</p>
<p>
For clients running Windows NT, it is recommended that autostarted invokable TPs be written as Windows NT services. To create the installation program for such TPs, study the code in INSTALL.C. For example, use the <b>CreateService</b> function or similar code when installing a TP that will run as a service under Windows NT. (For important information about how services work under Windows NT, see the documentation for Windows NT and for Win32®.)</p>
