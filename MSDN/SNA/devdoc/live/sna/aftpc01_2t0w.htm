<p>
The connection object represents an object-oriented approach to AFTP. An AFTP connection object represents a connection (not necessarily active) to a partner computer. Many of the AFTP API calls require an AFTP connection object as input. When the program has finished using AFTP API calls, it should destroy the connection object.

<a href="aftpc02_2nao.htm"><b>aftp_create</b></a></dt>
<dd>
Creates an AFTP connection object and assigns a unique identifier to it. The connection object is accessed by its connection identifier. The connection object is never automatically destroyed. This allows you to connect to an AFTP server once or reconnect numerous times using the same AFTP connection object.</dd>
<dt>
<a href="aftpc02_26pc.htm"><b>aftp_destroy</b></a></dt>
<dd>
Destroys the AFTP connection object and recovers all resources associated with it. When an AFTP connection object has been destroyed, that object must not be used again. If you need a connection object again, create another one.
