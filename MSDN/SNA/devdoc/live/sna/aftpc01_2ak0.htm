<p>
In the AFTP API, directories represent the structures used to divide a file system into multiple portions. An AFTP directory can contain one or more files. Directories are organized in a hierarchical structure. The topmost node in the directory structure is called the root.</p>
<p>
The AFTP API allows you to designate a directory as the current directory. The primary advantage of setting a current directory is that when you are working with files in this directory, it is not necessary to include the full directory specification in AFTP API functions.</p>
