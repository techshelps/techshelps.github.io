<p>
This section describes variables that provide file names, constants, and product information</p>
<h4>File Names and Initialization Constants</h4>

<h4>Product Information</h4>
<p>
This section contains all the information about a single component. There should be a section of this form for each of the options supported by this script.</p>
<table cellspacing=4 cols=2>
<tr valign=top>
<th align=left width=29%>Variable name</th>
<th align=left width=71%>Description</th>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=29%><i>FullInfName</i></td>
<td width=71%>The full path to this setup script (.INF file) after installation.</td>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=29%><i>NetRulesClass</i></td>
<td width=71%>The class to which this product belongs for bindings determination by the NCPA.</td>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=29%><i>ProductDepends</i></td>
<td width=71%>This variable holds the dependencies of this product. This value is only used in the creation of the product service key.</td>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=29%><i>ProductDll</i></td>
<td width=71%>The dynamic-link library that should be linked to by the control APIs for this component. This variable is only necessary for link services and should be given a null value for all other cases.</td>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=29%><i>ProductExclusive</i></td>
<td width=71%>This variable dictates the behavior of multiple attempts at installing this component. It can hold one of three values:<ul>
<li>
FALSE: This product is not exclusive and can be installed as many times as the user chooses.</li>
<li>
TRUE: This product is exclusive and can only be installed once.</li>
<li>
NOTIFY: This product is exclusive, and the user should be informed of this fact. SNA Server Setup displays a message to inform the user.</li>
</ul>
</td>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=29%><i>ProductExtraParams</i></td>
<td width=71%>This variable holds the entries for the <b>ExtraParameters</b> subkey of the product service key. It is recommended that any modifications to the value of this parameter be done in the body of the setup script with the rest of the assignments. This line serves as the initialization for this variable.</td>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=29%><i>ProductFullName</i></td>
<td width=71%>The actual value used to represent this product in the registry. It is a combination of the product name and version, separated by an underscore.</td>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=29%><i>ProductImagePath</i></td>

<td width=71%>The name of this product. This name is used in conjunction with the version to provide the full name of the registry entry for this product.</td>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=29%><i>ProductParams</i></td>
<td width=71%>This variable holds the entries for the <b>Parameters</b> subkey of the product service key. It is recommended that any modifications to the value of this parameter be done in the body of the setup script with the rest of the assignments. This line should not be deleted since it serves to initialize this variable.</td>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=29%><i>ProductRegBase</i></td>
<td width=71%>The specific location for this product's registry entry under the <b>SOFTWARE </b>registry key. This variable should not be changed since all the SNA Server components should reside under <b>SOFTWARE\Microsoft</b> in the registry.</td>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=29%><i>ProductServicePrefix</i></td>
<td width=71%>A prefix that is used to algorithmically decide the service name for this component. Service names for SNA Server are limited to no more than eight characters. Since SNA Server Setup attaches a single-character suffix based on the index, this prefix should be no longer than seven characters.</td>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=29%><i>ProductType</i></td>
<td width=71%>An internal representation of the type of component this option belongs to. Currently, this variable can take on the values of Link and Driver.<p>
<b>Note </b>This value is currently unused in the SNA Server scripts; however, it should still be set since its usage will be implemented in the future.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
