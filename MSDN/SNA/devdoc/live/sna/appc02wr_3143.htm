<p>
The following table offers some guidelines for choosing between basic and mapped conversations for your TPs. For definitions of basic and mapped conversations, see <a href="appc02wr_7krn.htm">Fundamental Terms for TPs and LUs</a>.</p>
<table cellspacing=4 cols=3>

</td>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=17%>Sending and receiving method</td>
<td width=41%>Before a TP can begin a send operation, it must convert data records into logical records. The TP does this by adding a 2-byte prefix that indicates the length of the record. A TP can send several logical records at one time.<p>
When a partner TP receives logical records, it must reconstruct them into usable data records. For more information, see <a href="appc02wr_7lur.htm">Logical Records Used in Basic Conversations</a>.</p>
<p>
</p>
</td>
<td width=42%>A TP sends data one record at a time. Neither the sending TP nor the receiving TP needs to convert data records between different forms.</td>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=17%>Abnormal termination</td>
<td width=41%>In the <a href="appc05a_4ndv.htm"><b>DEALLOCATE</b></a> verb, a TP can indicate whether an error or ABEND (abnormal program termination) was caused by a TP or by a program using the TP.</td>
<td width=42%>A TP can indicate an error or ABEND, but cannot tell whether a problem was caused by a TP or by a program using a TP.</td>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=17%></td>
<td width=41%>A TP can indicate whether an ABEND was caused by a timeout or by a critical error.<p>
</p>
</td>
<td width=42%>A TP cannot indicate the cause of an ABEND.</td>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=17%>Error logging</td>
<td width=41%>For an error or ABEND, a TP can send an error message, in the form of a general data stream (GDS) error log variable, to the local log and to the partner LU.</td>
<td width=42%>For an error or ABEND, a TP cannot send an error message to the local log or to the partner LU.</td>
