<h2><a name="_sna_open_call_dev"></a>OPEN Call</h2>
<p>
The <b>OPEN</b> call has no parameters. It grants access to the driver from a particular process. The driver ensures that only one <b>OPEN</b> is accepted by the link at any one time. When <b>OPEN</b> is processed, the driver attempts to reserve access to hardware resources such as interrupt vectors; the <b>OPEN</b> is rejected if this fails.</p>
<p>
After a successful <b>OPEN</b> request, the driver expects to receive the following IOCTL commands:</p>
<p class=indent1>
<b>SET_EVENT_HANDLE</b></p>
<p class=indent1>
<b>SET_INTERFACE_RECORD</b></p>
<p class=indent1>
<b>SET_LINK_CHARACTERISTICS</b></p>
<p>
Of these, the first two can be performed in any order, but both should be issued before calling <b>SET_LINK_CHARACTERISTICS</b>.</p>
<p>
When these three calls have been successfully performed by the SNALink, the driver is ready for information transfer.</p>
