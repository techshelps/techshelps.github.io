<p>
The <b>WinCPICIsBlocking</b> function determines if a task is executing while waiting for a previous blocking call to finish.</p>
<p>
<b>BOOL WINAPI WinCPICIsBlocking(</b><i>void</i><b>);</b></p>
<h4>Return Values</h4>
<p>
The return value specifies the outcome of the function. If the value is not zero, there is an outstanding blocking call awaiting completion. A value of zero indicates the absence of an outstanding blocking call.</p>
<h4>Remarks</h4>
<p>
This call does not infer any information about a particular conversation; it is only intended to provide help to an application written to use the CM_BLOCKING characteristic of <a href="cpic03_5uoz.htm"><b>Set_Processing_Mode</b></a>. <b>WinCPICIsBlocking</b> serves the same purpose as<b> InSendMessage</b> in the Microsoft® Windows® API. Applications targeted at Windows version 3.<i>x</i> that support multiple conversations must specify CM_NONBLOCKING in <b>Set_Processing_Mode</b> so they can support multiple outstanding operations simultaneously. Applications are still limited to one outstanding operation per conversation in all environments.</p>
<p>
Although a call issued on a blocking function appears to an application as though it blocks, the Windows CPI-C DLL has to relinquish the processor to allow other applications to run. This means that it is possible for the application that issued the blocking call to be re-entered, depending on the message(s) it receives. In this instance, <b>WinCPICIsBlocking</b> can be used to determine whether the application task currently has been re-entered while waiting for an outstanding blocking call to finish. Note that Windows CPI-C prohibits more than one outstanding blocking call per thread.</p>
