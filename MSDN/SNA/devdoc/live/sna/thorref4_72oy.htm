Use the <b>Status</b> property to see what changes are pending for records modified during batch updating. You can also use the <b>Status</b> property to view the status of records that fail during bulk operations such as when you call the <b>Resync</b>, <b>UpdateBatch</b>, or <b>CancelBatch</b> methods on a recordset object, or set the <b>Filter</b> property on a recordset object to an array of bookmarks. With this property, you can determine how a given record failed and resolve it accordingly.</p>
