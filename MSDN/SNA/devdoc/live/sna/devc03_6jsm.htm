<p>
For a connection to a host computer using a leased SDLC line, the SNALink receives an SNRM when the end-to-end connection is established. The SNALink responds with a UA and informs the local node that the connection is ready for data transfer. This is done with the <a href="devc04_977a.htm"><b>Request-Open-Station</b></a> message with the Rcv-Set-Mode flag set.</p>
<p>
The node then opens the STATION LPI connection with the <a href="devc04_3ut2.htm"><b>Open(STATION)</b></a> message. If the SNALink has an available control block, it responds with an <b>Open(STATION) OK Response</b>. This is followed by a <a href="devc04_8vcm.htm"><b>Station-Contacted</b></a> message.</p>
<p>
A channel connection is treated the same way as a leased secondary SDLC connection. Each channel connection is associated with a channel subaddress in the range 0x00 to 0xFF. The SNA Server node will send the channel link service an <a href="devc04_4qeu.htm"><b>Open(LINK) Request</b></a> for each configured channel connection when the connection is activated. The link service should expect to receive multiple <b>Open(LINK) Requests</b>, one for each supported subchannel address. </p>
<p>
Note that the <b>Request-Open-Station</b> message flows on the LINK LPI connection, whereas the <b>Station-Contacted</b> message flows on the STATION LPI connection.</p>
<p>
The message flow for a leased line is shown in the following figure.</p>
