<h1><a name="_sna_receive_immediate_appc"></a>RECEIVE_IMMEDIATE</h1>
<p>
The <b>RECEIVE_IMMEDIATE</b> verb receives any data currently available from the partner TP. If no data is available, the local TP does not wait. To avoid blocking the conversation, the Microsoft® Windows NT®, Microsoft® Windows® 95, and Windows version 3.<i>x</i> systems can issue <a href="appc05b_19er.htm"><b>RECEIVE_AND_WAIT</b></a> in conjunction with <a href="appc06_66sj.htm"><b>WinAsyncAPPC</b></a>. For OS/2 systems, use <a href="appc05b_92oz.htm"><b>RECEIVE_AND_POST</b></a>.</p>
<p>
The following structure describes the verb control block used by the <b>RECEIVE_IMMEDIATE</b> verb.</p>
<pre><code>struct receive_immediate {

<h4>Members</h4>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>opcode</b></dt>
<dd>
Supplied parameter. Specifies the verb operation code, AP_B_RECEIVE_IMMEDIATE.</dd>
<dt>
<b>opext</b></dt>
<dd>
Supplied parameter. Specifies the verb operation extension, AP_BASIC_CONVERSATION.</dd>
<dt>
<b>primary_rc</b></dt>
<dd>
Returned parameter. Specifies the primary return code set by APPC at the completion of the verb. The valid return codes vary depending on the APPC verb issued. See Return Codes for valid error codes for this verb.</dd>
<dt>
<b>secondary_rc</b></dt>
<dd>
Returned parameter. Specifies the secondary return code set by APPC at the completion of the verb. The valid return codes vary depending on the APPC verb issued. See Return Codes for valid error codes for this verb.</dd>
<dt>
<b>tp_id</b></dt>
<dd>
Supplied parameter. Identifies the local TP. The value of this parameter is returned by <a href="appc04_0fs3.htm"><b>TP_STARTED</b></a> in the invoking TP or by <a href="appc05b_0m77.htm"><b>RECEIVE_ALLOCATE</b></a> in the invoked TP.</dd>
<dt>
<b>conv_id</b></dt>
<dd>
Supplied parameter. Provides the conversation identifier. The value of this parameter is returned by <a href="appc05a_1ckj.htm"><b>ALLOCATE</b></a> in the invoking TP or by <b>RECEIVE_ALLOCATE</b> in the invoked TP.</dd>
<dt>
<b>what_rcvd</b></dt>
<dd>
Returned parameter. Contains information received with the incoming data:
<ul>
<li>
ap_confirm_deallocate indicates that the partner TP has issued <a href="appc05a_4ndv.htm"><b>DEALLOCATE</b></a> with <b>dealloc_type</b> set to AP_SYNC_LEVEL, and the conversation's synchronization level, established by <b>ALLOCATE</b>, is AP_CONFIRM_SYNC_LEVEL. Upon receiving this value, the local TP normally issues <a href="appc05a_53z7.htm"><b>CONFIRMED</b></a>.</li>
<li>
ap_confirm_send indicates that the partner TP has issued <a href="appc05b_9aar.htm"><b>PREPARE_TO_RECEIVE</b></a> with <b>ptr_type</b> set to AP_SYNC_LEVEL, and the conversation's synchronization level, established by <b>ALLOCATE</b>, is AP_CONFIRM_SYNC_LEVEL. Upon receiving this value, the local TP normally issues <b>CONFIRMED</b>, and begins to send data.</li>
<li>
ap_confirm_what_received indicates that the partner TP has issued <a href="appc05a_4i1v.htm"><b>CONFIRM</b></a>. Upon receiving this value, the local TP normally issues <b>CONFIRMED</b>.</li>
<li>
ap_data is returned for basic conversations by <b>RECEIVE_IMMEDIATE</b> if <b>fill</b> is set to AP_BUFFER. The local TP received data until <b>max_len</b> or end of data was reached. For more information, see "<b>RECEIVE_IMMEDIATE</b> End of Data" at the end of this topic.</li>
<li>
AP_DATA_COMPLETE indicates, for <b>RECEIVE_IMMEDIATE</b> with <b>fill</b> set to AP_LL in basic conversations, that the local TP has received a complete logical record or the end of a logical record.<p>
Upon receiving this value, the local TP normally reissues <b>RECEIVE_IMMEDIATE </b>or issues another receive verb. If the partner TP has sent more data, the local TP begins to receive a new unit of data.
<p>
Otherwise, the local TP examines status information if <b>primary_rc</b> contains ap_ok and <b>what_rcvd</b> contains any of these values:
<p>
AP_SEND
<p>
AP_CONFIRM_SEND
<p>
AP_CONFIRM_DEALLOCATE
<p>
AP_CONFIRM_WHAT_RECEIVED
<p>
See the description of the value in Return Codes in this topic for the next action the local TP normally takes.
<p>
If <b>primary_rc</b> contains ap_dealloc_normal, the conversation has been deallocated in response to <a href="appc05a_4ndv.htm"><b>DEALLOCATE</b></a> issued by the partner TP.
</li>
<li>
ap_data_incomplete indicates for <b>RECEIVE_IMMEDIATE</b> in mapped conversations that the local TP has received an incomplete data record. The <b>max_len</b> parameter specified a value less than the length of the data record (or less than the remainder of the data record if this is not the first receive verb to read the record).<p>
For <b>RECEIVE_IMMEDIATE</b> with <b>fill</b> set to AP_LL in basic conversations, this value indicates that the local TP has received an incomplete logical record.
<p>
Upon receiving this value, the local TP normally reissues <b>RECEIVE_IMMEDIATE </b>(or issues another receive verb) to receive the next part of the record.
</li>
<li>
ap_none indicates that the TP did not receive data or conversation status indicators.</li>
<li>
ap_send indicates, for the partner TP, the conversation has entered RECEIVE state. For the local TP, the conversation is now in SEND state. Upon receiving this value, the local TP normally uses <a href="appc05b_7wbn.htm"><b>SEND_DATA</b></a><b> </b>to begin sending data.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dt>
<b>rtn_status</b></dt>
<dd>
Supplied parameter. Indicates whether both data and conversation status indicators should be returned within one API call.
<p>
Use AP_NO to specify that indicators should be returned individually on separate invocations of the verb.

<p>
Use AP_YES to specify that indicators should be returned together, provided both are available. Both can be returned when:

<ul>
<li>
The receive buffer is large enough to hold all of the data that precedes the status indicator.</li>
<li>
The <b>fill</b> parameter specifies either BUFFER or LL, and the data is the last logical record before the status indicator.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dt>
<b>fill</b></dt>
<dd>
Supplied parameter. Specifies the manner in which the local TP receives data. It is used only for <b>RECEIVE_IMMEDIATE</b>.
<p>
Use AP_BUFFER to indicate that the local TP receives data until the number of bytes specified by <b>max_len</b> is reached or until end of data. Data is received without regard for the logical-record format.

<p>
Use AP_LL to indicate that data is received in logical-record format. The data received can be a complete logical record, a <b>max_len</b> byte portion of a logical record, or the end of a logical record.
</dd>
<dt>
<b>rts_rcvd</b></dt>
<dd>
Returned parameter. Contains the request-to-send indicator. Possible values are:
<ul>
<li>
ap_yes indicates that the partner TP has issued <a href="appc05b_54kj.htm"><b>REQUEST_TO_SEND</b></a>, which requests that the local TP change the conversation to RECEIVE state.</li>
<li>
ap_no indicates that the partner TP has not issued <b>REQUEST_TO_SEND</b>.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dt>
<b>max_len</b></dt>
<dd>
Supplied parameter. Indicates the maximum number of bytes of data the local TP can receive. The range is from 0 through 65535.
<p>
For the Windows NT and Windows 95 operating systems and the Windows graphical environment, this value must not exceed the length of the buffer to contain the received data.

<p>
For the OS/2 operating system, the offset of <b>dptr</b> plus the value of <b>max_len</b> must not exceed the size of the data segment. 

<p>
By issuing <b>RECEIVE_IMMEDIATE</b> with <b>max_len</b> set to zero, the local TP can determine whether the partner TP has data to send, seeks confirmation, or has changed the conversation state.
</dd>
<dt>
<b>dlen</b></dt>
<dd>
Returned parameter. Provides the number of bytes of data received. Data is stored in a buffer specified by <b>dptr</b>. A length of zero indicates that no data was received.</dd>
<dt>
<b>dptr</b></dt>
<dd>
Supplied parameter. Address of the buffer to contain the data received by the local TP.
<p>
For the Windows NT and Windows 95 operating systems and the Windows graphical environment, the data buffer can reside in a static data area or in a globally allocated area. The data buffer must fit entirely within this area.

<p>
For the OS/2 operating system, the data buffer must reside on an unnamed, shared segment, which is allocated by the function <b>DosAllocSeg</b> with <b>Flags</b> equal to 1. The data buffer must fit entirely on the data segment.

</dl>
</dd>
<dt>
ap_comm_subsystem_abended</dt>
<dd>
Primary return code; indicates one of the following conditions:

</ul>

<p>
The system administrator should examine the error log to determine the reason for the ABEND.
</dd>
<dt>
ap_comm_subsystem_not_loaded</dt>
<dd>
Primary return code; a required component could not be loaded or has terminated while processing the verb. Thus, communication could not take place. Contact the system administrator for corrective action.
<p>
When this return code is used with <a href="appc05a_1ckj.htm"><b>ALLOCATE</b></a>, it can indicate that no communications subsystem could be found to support the local LU. (For example, the local LU alias specified with <a href="appc04_0fs3.htm"><b>TP_STARTED</b></a> is incorrect or has not been configured.) Note that if <b>lu_alias</b> or <b>mode_name</b> is fewer than eight characters, you must ensure that these fields are filled with spaces to the right. This error is returned if these parameters are not filled with spaces, since there is no node available that can satisfy the <b>ALLOCATE</b> request.

<p>
When <b>ALLOCATE</b> produces this return code for an SNA Server Client system configured with multiple nodes, there are two secondary return codes as follows:

<dl>
<dt>
0x<small>f0000001</small></dt>
<dd>
Secondary return code; no nodes have been started.</dd>
<dt>
0x<small>f0000002</small></dt>
<dd>
Secondary return code; at least one node has been started, but the local LU (when <b>TP_STARTED</b> is issued) is not configured on any active nodes. The problem could be either of the following:
<table cellspacing=4 cols=1>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=100%><font face="Symbol">·</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The node with the local LU is not started.</td>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=100%><font face="Symbol">·</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The local LU is not configured.</td>
</tr>
</table><br>

</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dt>
ap_conv_failure_no_retry</dt>
<dd>
Primary return code; the conversation was terminated because of a permanent condition, such as a session protocol error. The system administrator should examine the system error log to determine the cause of the error. Do not retry the conversation until the error has been corrected.</dd>
<dt>
ap_conv_failure_retry</dt>
<dd>
Primary return code; the conversation was terminated because of a temporary error. Restart the TP to see if the problem occurs again. If it does, the system administrator should examine the error log to determine the cause of the error.</dd>
<dt>
ap_conversation_type_mixed</dt>
<dd>
Primary return code; the TP has issued both basic and mapped conversation verbs. Only one type can be issued in a single conversation.</dd>
<dt>

<dt>
ap_prog_error_purging</dt>
<dd>
Primary return code; while in RECEIVE, PENDING, PENDING_POST (Windows NT, Windows 95, and OS/2 only), CONFIRM, CONFIRM_SEND, or CONFIRM_DEALLOCATE state, the partner TP issued <b>SEND_ERROR</b> with <b>err_type</b> set to AP_PROG. Data sent but not yet received is purged.</dd>
<dt>
ap_prog_error_trunc</dt>
<dd>
Primary return code; in SEND state, after sending an incomplete logical record, the partner TP issued <b>SEND_ERROR</b> with <b>err_type</b> set to AP_PROG. The local TP may have received the first part of the logical record through a receive verb.</dd>
<dt>
ap_stack_too_small</dt>
<dd>
Primary return code; the stack size of the application is too small to execute the verb. Increase the stack size of your application.</dd>
<dt>
ap_conv_busy</dt>
<dd>
Primary return code; there can only be one outstanding conversation verb at a time on any conversation. This can occur if the local TP has multiple threads, and more than one thread is issuing APPC calls using the same <b>conv_id</b>.</dd>

<dd>
Primary return code; while in SEND state, the partner TP (or partner LU) issued <b>SEND_ERROR</b> with <b>err_type</b> set to AP_SVC. Data was not truncated.</dd>
<dt>
ap_svc_error_purging</dt>
<dd>
Primary return code; the partner TP (or partner LU) issued <b>SEND_ERROR</b> with <b>err_type</b> set to AP_SVC while in RECEIVE, PENDING_POST (Windows NT, Windows 95, and OS/2 only), CONFIRM, CONFIRM_SEND, or CONFIRM_DEALLOCATE state. Data sent to the partner TP may have been purged.</dd>

ap_svc_error_trunc</dt>
<dd>
Primary return code; in SEND state, after sending an incomplete logical record, the partner TP (or partner LU) issued <b>SEND_ERROR</b>. The local TP may have received the first part of the logical record.
</dd>
</dl>
<h4>Remarks</h4>
<p>
The local TP receives data through the following process:
<ol>
<li>
The local TP issues a receive verb until it finishes receiving a complete unit of data. The data received can be:<ul>
<li>
One logical record.</li>
<li>
A buffer of data received independent of its logical-record format.</li>
</ul>
<p>
The local TP may need to issue the receive verb several times in order to receive a complete unit of data. After a complete unit of data has been received, the local TP can manipulate it.
<p>
The receive verbs are <a href="appc05b_92oz.htm"><b>RECEIVE_AND_POST</b></a> (Windows NT, Windows 95, and OS/2 operating systems), <a href="appc05b_19er.htm"><b>RECEIVE_AND_WAIT</b></a>, and <b>RECEIVE_IMMEDIATE</b>.
</li>
<li>
The local TP issues the receive verb again. This has one of the following effects:<ul>
<li>
If the partner TP has sent more data, the local TP begins to receive a new unit of data.</li>
<li>
If the partner TP has finished sending data or is waiting for confirmation, status information (available through <b>what_rcvd</b>) indicates the next action the local TP normally takes.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>
The conversation must be in RECEIVE state when the TP issues this verb.</p>
<p>
The new state is determined by <b>primary_rc</b>. If <b>primary_rc</b> is ap_ok, the new state is determined by <b>what_rcvd</b>.</p>
<p>
The following table details the state changes when the <b>primary_rc</b> is ap_ok.</p>

<h4>RECEIVE IMMEDIATE End of Data</h4>
<p>
In basic conversations, if the local TP issues <b>RECEIVE_IMMEDIATE</b> and sets <b>fill</b> to AP_BUFFER, the receipt of the data ends when <b>max_len</b> or the end of the data is reached. The end of the data is indicated by either:
<ul>
<li>
A <b>primary_rc</b> parameter with a value other than ap_ok (for example, ap_dealloc_normal).</li>
<li>
A <b>what_rcvd</b> parameter with one of the following values:<p class=indent1>
AP_SEND</p>
<p class=indent1>
AP_CONFIRM_SEND</p>
<p class=indent1>
AP_CONFIRM_DEALLOCATE</p>
<p class=indent1>
AP_CONFIRM_WHAT_RECEIVED</p>
<p class=indent1>
AP_DATA_CONFIRM_SEND</p>
<p class=indent1>
AP_DATA_CONFIRM_DEALLOCATE</p>
<p class=indent1>
AP_DATA_CONFIRM</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
To determine if the end of the data has been reached, the local TP reissues <b>RECEIVE_IMMEDIATE</b>. If the new <b>primary_rc</b> parameter contains ap_ok and <b>what_rcvd</b> contains AP_DATA, the end of the data has not been reached. If, however, the end of the data has been reached, <b>primary_rc</b> or <b>what_rcvd</b> will indicate the cause of the end of the data.</p>
