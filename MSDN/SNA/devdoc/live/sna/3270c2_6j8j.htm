<p>
This section describes important information for emulator vendors who are writing for the Microsoft® MS-DOS® operating system.</p>
<p>
For simple emulators that will run as the sole application in a system, much of the following information is unnecessary — the only consideration for vendors of this type of emulator is support for task switching, described in the following topic. However, for emulators that will support background operation it is vital that the facilities provided by the DMOD are used to ensure that this functions correctly.</p>
