<p>
An application using TS profile 4 can request the session to be recovered by sending <b>Status-Control(RQR)</b>; the local node presents this to the host as an RQR request. Note that, if the application has received a critical <a href="3270c4_7wxc.htm"><b>Status-Acknowledge(Nack-2)</b></a>, this option cannot be taken because the local node will send a <a href="3270c4_31tc.htm"><b>Close(PLU) Request</b></a> immediately following the <b>Status-Acknowledge(Nack-2)</b> to the application, and the PLU connection will no longer be valid. The RQR message requests the host to reset the session by sending a CLEAR request (see the following figure).</p>
<p>
The receipt of CLEAR causes the application to reset its session state to that following the BIND (that is, the <b>Open(PLU)</b>).</p>
<p>
Another way for the application to deal with error conditions is to ask for an UNBIND by sending <b>Status-Control(RSHUTD)</b> (see <a href="3270c3_9ofk.htm">Application-Initiated Termination</a>). Note that this may not require the host to supply a new BIND, depending on the host configuration. A new SSCP request may be required (such as LOGON).</p>
<p>
In the following illustration, the application requests recovery by issuing <b>Status-Control(RQR)</b>; the host sends CLEAR, and the application must reset its session to state that it was in following the BIND (<b>Open(PLU)</b>). In this case, this means that the application is now between brackets and awaiting SDT.</p>
