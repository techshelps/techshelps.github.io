<p>
The ACME Setup tools used to install SNA Server and SNA Server Client binaries are table-driven using an STF text file and an SNAFILE.INF. You may be using a different installation tool for your application.</p>
<p>
Along with an installation and setup procedure, you should also supply an uninstall option to remove the SNA Server Client binaries and restore Microsoft® MS-DOS® and Windows configuration files back to their original condition. </p>
<p>
The general installation process for the SNA Server Client binaries is outlined below.</p>
<h5><img src="../../images/wedge.gif" border=0>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To install the SNA Server Client binaries in 16-bit Windows environments</h5>
<ol>
<li>
Verify that this system supports SNA Server. The installation tool should check for supported versions of the operating system and network operating system, adequate disk space, and any other requirements.</li>
<li>
Copy files to target directories on the user's system. Note that all the SNA Server Client DLLs must be installed in the Windows system directory on the user's system, not in the directory where the user has selected to install the SNA Server Client. Copying all the DLLs to the Windows system directory makes it simple to ensure that there is only a single copy of a given DLL on the user's system.<p>
The installation procedure must also check version resources for executable files and DLLs to avoid overwriting a newer copy already in the target directory with an older version from the distribution medium. All the .EXE files must be copied into a directory specified in the [Wnap] WBinPATH location, to facilitate version checking when the user upgrades these files.
</li>
<li>
Define file locations and other parameters necessary to modify MS-DOS, the network operating system, and other configuration files. Based on these parameters, modify and update AUTOEXEC.BAT, LANMAN.INI, and other required configuration files, saving copies of the original files.</li>
<li>
Update the WIN.INI file, creating a [Wnap] section. Add the necessary entries within this section, saving a copy of the original file.</li>
<li>
If necessary, modify SYSTEM.INI and save a copy of the original file.</li>
</ol>
