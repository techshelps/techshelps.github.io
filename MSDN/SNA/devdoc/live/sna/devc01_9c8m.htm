<h2><a name="_sna_making_connections_dev"></a>Making Connections</h2>
<p>
Before messages can flow across connections, the connections must be established, or opened. This is necessary because a service does not initially know the LPI address of the service with which it wishes to communicate; indeed, there may not even be a suitable service for it to communicate with.</p>
<p>
When a local node wishes to communicate with an SNALink, it attempts to open a connection by sending an <b>Open(LINK)</b> request to the SNALink. This message will have LPI values already set up by the Base, which the SNALink should save for referencing the connection in the future.</p>
<p>
The DLC interface does not permit the SNALink to issue an Open request.</p>
