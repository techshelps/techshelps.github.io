<p>
The concept of a TP "running as a service" or "running as an application" is distinct from a service TP or an application TP. Service TP and application TP are SNA terms that describe how a TP is used: either as a supportive service program for other CPI-C programs, or directly by a user, as an application. For detailed information about Windows NT-based services, see the documentation for Windows NT and the Microsoft® Platform Software Development Kit (SDK).</p>
<p>
To write an autostarted TP so it will run under Windows NT as a service and also run in a nonqueued way, write a multithreaded program with an <a href="cpic03_70df.htm"><b>Accept_Conversation</b></a> always outstanding. See <a href="cpic02_43s3.htm">Invokable TPs</a>.</p>
<p>
To run an autostarted TP as an application under Windows NT or Windows 95, make sure the TPSTART program is always started before the TP. See <a href="cpicappb_97z7.htm">Sample CPI-C TPs in the SDK</a>. </p>
