<h2><a name="_sna_paths_and_dmods_3270"></a>Paths and DMODs</h2>
<p>
Dynamic access modules (DMODs) are responsible for the communication between localities. When the DMODs in two localities can successfully pass messages between them, a path is said to exist between the two localities. A path must exist between two localities before a connection can exist between partners in those localities.</p>
<p>
SNA Server establishes a path using an appropriate method for the network operating system in use. For example, with Microsoft® LAN Manager, a named pipe is used; with NetWare, an SPX connection is used. When the two localities are on the same PC, a local pipe is used; this is implemented using shared buffers to increase performance, but is used by the application in exactly the same way as communication with a remote locality.</p>
<p>
The DMOD provides communication between dynamic localities and provides guaranteed in-order delivery of messages flowing over paths between localities. If the DMOD loses its path to another locality, it informs the Base.</p>
<p>
The following figure illustrates the paths and connections between an SNA Server local node and two 3270 emulation programs. Program A has two connections to the local node (one for each of two sessions); program B has one connection to the local node.</p>
