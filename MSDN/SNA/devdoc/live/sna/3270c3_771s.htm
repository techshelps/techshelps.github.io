<h3><a name="_sna_sscp_session_status_3270"></a>SSCP Session Status</h3>
<p>
While the SSCP connection is open, the local node reports the initial state and any subsequent changes of state of the SSCP session to the application using <a href="3270c4_7v8w.htm"><b>Status-Session</b></a><b> </b>messages. There are four distinct <b>Status-Session</b> status codes that can occur for the SSCP connection:
<ul>
<li>
No-Session: The SSCP session between the SNA Server LU and the host SSCP is not active because the SNA Server PU and/or LU is not activated. The <b>Status-Session</b> carries a qualifying status code to indicate why the SSCP session is inactive. The application cannot use the SSCP connection to send data to the host SSCP. The qualifiers are:<p class=indent1>
PU-INACTIVE: ACTPU has not been received or DACTPU has been received.</p>
<p class=indent1>
PU-ACTIVE: ACTPU(COLD) has been received from the SSCP.</p>
<p class=indent1>
PU-REACTIVATED: ACTPU(COLD) has been received while the PU was active (the application is not informed if ACTPU(ERP) is received while the PU is active).</p>
<p class=indent1>
LU-INACTIVE: ACTLU has not been received, or DACTLU has been received.</p>
</li>
<li>
Link-Error: The SSCP session between the SNA Server LU and the host SSCP is not active, due to a DLC link error. The <b>Status-Session</b> carries a qualifying status code that gives the error code reported by DLC. The application cannot use the SSCP connection to send data to the host SSCP.<p>
Note that this session state is reported when the local node is informed that the locality containing the SNA Server SDLC link service has been lost due to a path failure; the qualifier 0x0D is used. The link service will close the link when it is informed of the path error so the application can treat this as an outage.
</li>
<li>
LU-Active: The SSCP session is active due to the receipt of ACTLU. The application can use the SSCP connection to send data to the host SSCP.</li>
<li>
LU-Reactivated: The SSCP session has been reactivated due to the receipt of an ACTLU from the host SSCP. The SSCP connection is still active, but data may have been lost.</li>
</ul>
