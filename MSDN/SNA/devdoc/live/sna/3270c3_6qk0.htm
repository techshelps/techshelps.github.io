<h3><a name="_sna_critical_failure_3270"></a>Critical Failure</h3>
<p>
When an application makes a protocol error in sending data, the local node rejects the data using a <a href="3270c4_7wxc.htm"><b>Status-Acknowledge(Nack-2)</b></a> with a sense code indicating the reason for failure. This message has a critical failure flag that indicates whether the local node has marked the session as unrecoverable. The sense codes are listed in <a href="3270c5_4hv4.htm">FMI Status, Error, and Sense Codes</a>.</p>
<p>
If the error is noncritical, the application can proceed as if the message that caused the error had not been sent. If the error is critical, then the local node issues a <a href="3270c4_31tc.htm"><b>Close(PLU) Request</b></a> to the application (providing that the PLU connection is open), which means that the application cannot communicate on the PLU-SLU session until an UNBIND–BIND sequence is received from the host. The local node also sends a TERM-SELF request to the host to elicit an UNBIND; therefore, the application does not need to issue a LOGOFF request on the SSCP session.</p>
