<h3><a name="_sna_sync_point_knows_transaction_names_appc"></a>Sync Point Knows Transaction Names</h3>
<p>
A Sync Point implementation that knows the names of all the transactions that can be supported (for example, through configuration of the gateway) may accept incoming Sync Point conversations by issuing a <a href="appc05b_0m77.htm"><b>RECEIVE_ALLOCATE</b></a> verb specifying the name of the transaction and indicating that it is willing to accept Sync Point conversations.</p>
<p>
The <b>RECEIVE_ALLOCATE</b> verb was modified to allow a TP to specify that it can accept Sync Point conversations by adding a new <b>syncpoint_rqd</b> field to the VCB. When this field is set to AP_YES it indicates that the transaction program can accept Sync Point conversations from SNA Server. When this field is set to AP_NO (the default), it indicates that Sync Point conversations are not supported.</p>
