<h1><a name="_sna_resetting_lua_lus_lua"></a>Resetting LUA LUs</h1>
<p>
Microsoft® SNA Server provides a facility for resetting LUA LUs or forcing off LUA applications, which is useful if an application has become deadlocked or is looping.</p>
<p>
The NetView command <b>deactivate-oldlu</b> can also be used to reset an LUA LU. These facilities interact with the LUA application as described in the following paragraphs.</p>
<p>
When an LUA LU is reset through SNA Server or by using the <b>deactivate-oldlu</b> command, SNA Server sends an UNBIND message to the application (as though the host had issued it).</p>
<p>
The UNBIND message sent to the application is 0x32 0x0E, indicating a recoverable LU failure, and is returned to the application on a subsequent <a href="luac03_7dwh.htm"><b>RUI_READ</b></a>. The LU session is terminated, but the SSCP session remains active (that is, the LU is returned to the same state as if <a href="luac03_37z5.htm"><b>RUI_INIT</b></a> has just completed).</p>
