<td width=27%><a href="appcapc_9hpf.htm">APPC Send and Receive TPs</a></td>
<td width=73%>Simple APPC send and receive TPs that illustrate the use of asynchronous verb completion. This sample located in the SENDRECV subdirectory implements simple bulk data sending and receiving TPs (SENDTP and RECVTP). This sample is located in the \SDK\SAMPLES\APPC subdirectory on the CD-ROM.</td>

<tr valign=top>
<td width=27%><a href="appcapc_6xyb.htm">Multithreaded Send and Receive TPs</a></td>
<td width=73%>More advanced APPC send and receive TPs that illustrate the use of multiple threads and multiple conversations per thread. This sample is located in the \SDK\SAMPLES\MSENDRCV subdirectory on the CD-ROM.</td>

<td width=27%><a href="appcapc_2gv7.htm">TPSETUP</a></td>
<td width=73%>Sample installation program, demonstrating an interface that assists in the configuring of autostarted invokable TPs. This sample is located in the \SAMPLES\SDK\TPSETUP subdirectory on the CD-ROM.<p>

<tr valign=top>
<td width=27%><a href="appcapc_3ftv.htm">TPSTART</a></td>
<td width=73%>A program required for the automatic startup of invokable TPs that run as applications under Microsoft® Windows NT®. TPSTART is not required if the TP has been written as a Windows NT service. TPSTART is also unnecessary under Windows 95. TPSTART is installed by SNA Server Setup in the SYSTEM subdirectory of the SNA Server root directory. This sample is located in the \SDK\SAMPLES\TPSTART subdirectory on the CD-ROM.</td>
