<h1><a name="_sna_mc_deallocate_appc"></a>MC_DEALLOCATE</h1>
<p>
The <b>MC_DEALLOCATE</b> verb deallocates a conversation between two TPs.</p>
<p>
For the Microsoft® Windows® version 3<i>.x</i> system, it is recommended that you use <a href="appc06_66sj.htm"><b>WinAsyncAPPC</b></a> function rather than the blocking version of this call.</p>
<p>
The following structure describes the verb control block used by the <b>MC_DEALLOCATE</b> verb.</p>
<pre><code>struct mc_deallocate {
    unsigned short   opcode;
    unsigned char    opext;
    unsigned char    reserv2;
    unsigned short   primary_rc;
    unsigned long    secondary_rc;
    unsigned char    tp_id[8];
    unsigned long    conv_id;
    unsigned char    reserv3;
    unsigned char    dealloc_type;
    unsigned char    reserv4[2];
    unsigned char    reserv5[4];
    void             (WINAPI *callback)();
    void             *correlator;
    unsigned char    reserv6[4];
};
 </code></pre>
<h4>Members</h4>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>opcode</b></dt>
<dd>
Supplied parameter. Specifies the verb operation code, AP_M_DEALLOCATE.</dd>
<dt>
<b>opext</b></dt>
<dd>
Supplied parameter. Specifies the verb operation extension, AP_MAPPED_CONVERSATION.</dd>
<dt>
<b>primary_rc</b></dt>
<dd>
Returned parameter. Specifies the primary return code set by APPC at the completion of the verb. The valid return codes vary depending on the APPC verb issued. See Return Codes for valid error codes for this verb.</dd>
<dt>
<b>secondary_rc</b></dt>
<dd>
Returned parameter. Specifies the secondary return code set by APPC at the completion of the verb. The valid return codes vary depending on the APPC verb issued. See Return Codes for valid error codes for this verb.</dd>
<dt>
<b>tp_id</b></dt>
<dd>
Supplied parameter. Identifies the local TP. The value of this parameter was returned by <a href="appc04_0fs3.htm"><b>TP_STARTED</b></a><b> </b>in the invoking TP or by <a href="appc05b_0m77.htm"><b>RECEIVE_ALLOCATE</b></a> in the invoked TP.</dd>
<dt>
<b>conv_id</b></dt>
<dd>
Supplied parameter. Identifies the conversation established between the two TPs. The value of this parameter is returned by <a href="appc05a_38f7.htm"><b>MC_ALLOCATE</b></a> in the invoking TP or by <b>RECEIVE_ALLOCATE</b> in the invoked TP.</dd>
<dt>
<b>dealloc_type</b></dt>
<dd>
Supplied parameter. Specifies how to perform the deallocation.
<p>
For <b>MC_DEALLOCATE</b>, use AP_ABEND to deallocate the conversation abnormally. If the conversation is in SEND state when the local TP issues <b>MC_DEALLOCATE</b>, APPC sends the contents of the local LU's send buffer to the partner TP before deallocating the conversation. If the conversation is in RECEIVE or PENDING_POST state, APPC purges any incoming data before deallocating the conversation.

<p>
A TP should specify AP_ABEND when it encounters an error preventing the successful completion of a transaction.

<p>
AP_FLUSH sends the contents of the local LU's send buffer to the partner TP before deallocating the conversation. This value is allowed only if the conversation is in SEND state.

<p>
AP_SYNC_LEVEL uses the conversation's synchronization level (established by <a href="appc05a_38f7.htm"><b>MC_ALLOCATE</b></a>) to determine how to deallocate the conversation. This value is allowed only if the conversation is in SEND state.

<p>
If the synchronization level of the conversation is AP_NONE, APPC sends the contents of the local LU's send buffer to the partner TP before deallocating the conversation.

<p>
If the synchronization level is AP_CONFIRM_SYNC_LEVEL, APPC sends the contents of the local LU's send buffer and a confirmation request to the partner TP. Upon receiving confirmation from the partner TP, APPC deallocates the conversation. If, however, the partner TP reports an error, the conversation remains allocated.
</dd>
<dt>
<b>callback</b></dt>
<dd>
Supplied parameter. Only present if the AP_EXTD_VCB bit is set in the <b>opext</b> member indicating support for Sync Point. This parameter is the address of a user-supplied callback function. If this field is NULL, no notification will be provided.
<p>
The prototype of the callback routine is as follows:

<p>
<b>void WINAPI callback_proc(</b><br>
<b>    struct appc_hdr</b> *<i>vcb</i><b>,</b><br>
<b>    unsigned char</b> <i>tp_id[8]</i><b>,</b><br>
<b>    unsigned long</b> <i>conv_id</i><b>,</b><br>
<b>    unsigned short</b> <i>type</i><b>,</b><br>
<b>    void</b> *<i>correlator</i><br>
<b>   );</b>

<p>
The callback procedure can take any name, since the address of the procedure is passed to the APPC DLL. The parameters passed to the function are as follows:

<dl>
<dt>
<i>vcb</i></dt>
<dd>
A pointer to the <b>MC_DEALLOCATE</b> verb control block that caused the conversation to be deallocated.</dd>
<dt>
<i>tp_id</i></dt>
<dd>
The TP identifier of the TP that owned the deallocated conversation.</dd>
<dt>
<i>conv_id</i></dt>
<dd>
The conversation identifier of the deallocated conversation.</dd>
<dt>
<i>type</i></dt>
<dd>
The type of the message flow that caused the callback to be invoked. Possible values are:
<table cellspacing=4 cols=1>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=100%>AP_DATA_FLOW</td>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=100%>Normal data flow on the session.</td>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=100%>AP_UNBIND</td>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=100%>The session was unbound normally.</td>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=100%>AP_FAILURE</td>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=100%>The session terminated due to an outage.</td>
</tr>
</table><br>

</dd>
<dt>
<i>correlator</i></dt>
<dd>
This value is the <b>correlator</b> specified on the <b>MC_DEALLOCATE</b> verb.
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dt>
<b>correlator</b></dt>
<dd>
Supplied parameter. Only present if the AP_EXTD_VCB bit is set in the <b>opext</b> member indicating support for the Sync Point API. This correlator field allows the TP to specify a value it can use to correlate a call to the callback function with, for example, its own internal data structures. This value is returned to the TP as one of the parameters of the callback routine when it is invoked.

<p>
Before deallocating the conversation, this verb performs the equivalent of one of the following:
<ul>
<li>
<a href="appc05a_0axv.htm"><b>MC_FLUSH</b></a>, by sending the contents of the local LU's send buffer to the partner LU (and TP).</li>
<li>
<a href="appc05a_0b8j.htm"><b>MC_CONFIRM</b></a>, by sending the contents of the local LU's send buffer and a confirmation request to the partner TP.</li>
</ul>
<p>
After this verb has successfully executed, the conversation identifier is no longer valid.</p>
<p>
LU 6.2 Sync Point can use an optimization of the message flows known as implied forget. When the protocol specifies that a FORGET PS header is required, the next data flow on the session implies that a FORGET has been received. In the normal situation, the TP is aware of the next data flow when data is received or sent on one of its Sync Point conversations.</p>
<p>
However, it is possible that the last message to flow is caused by the conversation being deallocated. In this case, the TP is unaware when the next data flow on the session occurs. In order to provide the TP with this notification, the <b>MC_DEALLOCATE</b> verb is modified to allow the TP to register a callback function which will be called:
<ul>
<li>
On the first normal flow transmission (request or response) over the session used by the conversation.</li>
<li>
If the session is unbound before any other data flows.</li>
<li>
If the session is terminated abnormally due to a DLC outage.</li>
</ul>
<p>
The <b>MC_DEALLOCATE</b> verb also contains a correlator field member that is returned as one of the parameters when the callback function is invoked. The application can use this parameter in any way (for example, as a pointer to a control block within the application).</p>
<p>
The TP can use the <i>type</i> parameter passed to the callback function to determine whether the message flow indicates an implied forget has been received.</p>
<p>
Note that the <b>MC_DEALLOCATE</b> verb will probably complete before the callback routine is called. The conversation is considered to be in RESET state and no further verbs can be issued using the conversation identifier. If the application issues a <a href="appc04_8k0z.htm"><b>TP_ENDED</b></a> verb before the next data flow on the session, the callback routine will not be invoked.</p>
<p>
SNA Server allows TPs to deallocate conversations immediately after sending data by specifying the <b>type</b> parameter on <a href="appc05b_8iub.htm"><b>MC_SEND_DATA</b></a> as AP_SEND_DATA_DEALLOC_*. However, the <b>MC_SEND_DATA</b> verbs do not contain the implied forget callback function. TPs wishing to receive implied forget notification must issue <b>MC_DEALLOCATE</b> explicitly.</p>
