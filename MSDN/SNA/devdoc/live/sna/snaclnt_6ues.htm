<p>
The ACME Setup tools used for installing the SNA Server and SNA Server Client binaries are table-driven using an STF text file and an SNAFILE.INF. You may be using a different installation tool for your application. </p>
<p>
Along with an installation and setup procedure, you should also supply an uninstall option to remove the SNA Server Client binaries and restore Windows NT or Windows 95 registry entries back to their original condition.</p>
<p>
The general installation process for the SNA Server Client binaries is outlined below.</p>
<h5><img src="../../images/wedge.gif" border=0>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To install the SNA Server Client binaries in 32-bit Windows environments</h5>
<ol>
<li>
Verify that this system supports SNA Server. The installation tool should check for supported versions of the operating system and network operating system, adequate disk space, and any other requirements.</li>
<li>
Copy files to target directories on the user's system. All of the SNA Server Client binaries are normally installed in the SNA system directory on Windows NT (typically C:\SNA\SYSTEM) and Windows 95 (typically C:\SNA95\SYSTEM). Note that the SNA Server Client DLLs should be installed in the system directory of Windows 95 (typically C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM) on the user's system, not in the directory where the user has selected to install the SNA Server Client. The MFC, MSVC, and OLE run-time DLLs should be copied to an MFC40 subdirectory below this directory. This MFC40 subdirectory should be created if it does not exist. Copying all the DLLs to the Windows system directory on Windows 95 and the SNA system directory on Windows NT makes it easy to ensure that there is only a single copy of a given DLL on the user's system. </li>
<li>
The installation procedure must also check version resources for executable files and DLLs to avoid overwriting a newer copy already in the target directory with an older version from the distribution medium. All the SNA Server Client .EXE files must be copied into the system directory to facilitate version checking when the user upgrades these files. The local binaries needed for your product would normally be copied to the subdirectory selected by the user during the installation process.</li>
<li>
Define file locations and other parameters necessary to modify Windows NT or Windows 95, the network transport protocol, and other configuration files and registry entries. Based on these parameters, modify and update the registry and other required configuration files, saving copies of the original files.</li>
</ol>
