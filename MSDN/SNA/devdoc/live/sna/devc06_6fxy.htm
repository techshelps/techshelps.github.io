<h3><a name="_sna_installation_control_section_dev"></a>Installation Control Section</h3>
<p>
This section contains the code that copies and removes files for the scripts.</p>
<h4>Install Section</h4>
<p>
In the case of an installation, this section reads in the file list to be copied and copies it, depending on the values of the appropriate variables (see the initialization section.) The script copies files into the SYSTEM and SYSTEM\HWSETUP subdirectories. You can add files to the file list by calling the same function that the script calls.</p>
<p>
In the case of a removal, the script reads in the same list of files that it used for the copy and creates a list of file names in the global variable <i>_FileRemoveList</i>. Each of the file names in this list is specified by its full path. SNA Server Setup then tries to remove all the files on this list. This layer of abstraction is necessary because the SRL file cannot be deleted while a handle to it remains open.</p>
<h4>File List Section</h4>
<p>
This section specifies the file list for each of the options supported by this setup script. Options may or may not have a section for files to be copied into the SYSTEM and SYSTEM\HWSETUP subdirectories. If a section listing files exists, those files will be added to the copy list as needed. The three main files for each script (.INF, .SRL, and .HLP) should be placed under the SYSTEM\HWSETUP subdirectory and invoked by all the SNA options in this script.</p>
<p>
In the case where more than one SNA option exists, the script uses version numbers to determine whether or not the files should be recopied. If the version numbers are the same, the files are not recopied.</p>
