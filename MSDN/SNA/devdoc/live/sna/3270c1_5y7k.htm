<h2><a name="_sna_the_role_of_the_base_3270"></a>The Role of the Base</h2>
<p>
The Base is a part of each SNA Server component, such as the local 2.1 node or a link service, that provides the operating environment for the core functions of that component. It passes messages between components and provides functions common to all components, such as diagnostic tracing.</p>
<p>
This document is concerned with the DL-BASE, which is the type of Base used by SNA Server 3270 emulation programs. The SNA Server DL-BASE<code> </code>supports a single SNA Server component or a single user application and has entry points for initialization, sending messages, receiving messages, and termination.</p>
