<p>
SNA Server version 4.0 provides an enhanced method for installing integrated link services that allows for remote setup and administration of new link services, as well as support for setup and configuration using a command-line tool. This feature is based on the link service provider supplying a setup, and configuration DLL exporting a specific list of functions. A developer must follow certain standards for using this SNA link service configuration DLL and set various keys and values as registry settings to be used by SNA Server for link service configuration.</p>
<p>
In order to support vendors using the new setup and configuration features, SNA Server 4.0 includes the source code for a sample generic SDLC link service configuration DLL (linkcfg). Also included for use by developers is the source code to a library of utility functions (lnktools) that are commonly useful when implementing the linkcfg DLL. This sample code and the documentation that follows can be used as a guideline for vendors developing similar link service configuration DLLs for their hardware. This sample source code is located on the SNA Server CD-ROM in the \SDK\SAMPLES\LINKSERV\GENERIC subdirectory. Sample include files, C++ files, resource files, makefiles, and project files are included for use with Microsoft® Visual C++® version 4.2 and later.</p>
