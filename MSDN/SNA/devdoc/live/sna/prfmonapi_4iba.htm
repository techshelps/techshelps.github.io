<h1><a name="_sna_adaptercounter_dev"></a>ADAPTERCOUNTER</h1>
<p>
The <b>ADAPTERCOUNTER</b> structure represents an individual SNA Perfmon event that can be monitored, such as the total bytes transmitted. All of the data needed to display a single Perfmon event is stored in this structure.</p>
<pre><code>typedef struct adaptercounter
{
    ULONG count;
    ULONG type;
    LONG scale;
} ADAPTERCOUNTER;
 </code></pre>
<h4>Members</h4>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>count</b></dt>
<dd>
The count for a specific Perfmon event since startup of the link service. Each time a Perfmon event takes place, the count is incremented accordingly, based on the type of event being counted. This count is maintained by the link service. </dd>
<dt>
<b>type</b></dt>
<dd>
The event type that is being monitored with this <b>ADAPTERCOUNTER</b>. The <b>type</b> member instructs Perfmon whether the <b>count</b> member represents a numeric counter such as number of connection failures, a rate such as throughput in bytes transferred per second, or a percentage. For suitable values see Platform SDK documentation of <b>PERF_COUNTER_*</b> (for example, <b>PERF_COUNTER_COUNTER</b> or <b>PERF_COUNTER_RAWCOUNT</b>).</dd>
<dt>
<b>scale</b></dt>
<dd>
The default scale to be used by the Perfmon application when displaying this event. The <b>count</b> member is scaled by 10<b>scale</b> such that a <b>scale</b> of -1 multiplies <b>count</b> by 0.1.
</dd>
