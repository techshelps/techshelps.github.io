<h1><a name="_sna_csv_extensions_for_the_windows_environment_appc"></a>CSV Extensions for the Windows Environment</h1>
<p>
This section describes API extensions to the Windows Common Service Verb (CSV) API . The extensions described in this section have been designed for all implementations and versions of the Microsoft® Windows® graphical environment, version 3.0 and later. They provide support for maximum Windows programming compatibility and optimum application performance in both 16-bit and 32-bit operating environments.</p>
<p>
Windows CSV allows multithreaded Windows-based processes. Multithreading is the running of several processes in rapid sequence within a single program. A process contains one or more threads of execution. The 16-bit Windows environment is not multithreaded. In this instance, a task corresponds to a process with a single thread. All references to threads in this document refer to actual threads in multithreaded Windows environments.</p>
<p>
For each extension, this section provides a definition of the function, syntax, returns, and remarks for using the function. </p>
