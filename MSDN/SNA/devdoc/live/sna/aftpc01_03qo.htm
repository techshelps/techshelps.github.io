<p>
If a file to be transferred has a special file structure based on record format and record length, AFTP may limit your ability to transfer that file.</p>
<p>
If you want to send the file to a system that supports the record format and record length of the file, use the <a href="aftpc02_0cc0.htm"><b>aftp_set_record_format</b></a><b> </b>and <a href="aftpc02_1a7k.htm"><b>aftp_set_record_length</b></a> functions first to ensure the file is correctly transferred.</p>
<p>
If you send the file to a system that does not maintain the record format and length, you may lose critical information and be unable to restore it when the file is copied back to the client.</p>
<p>
<b>Note</b>  You might be able to use an archiving tool to convert the special file into a format that can be transferred to other platforms. When the file is to be used again on the original platform, use the archiving tool to restore the file to its original format.</p>
