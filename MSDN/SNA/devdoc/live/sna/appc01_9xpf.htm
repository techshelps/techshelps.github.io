<h2><a name="_sna_windows_appc_asynchronous_support_appc"></a>Windows APPC Asynchronous Support</h2>
<p>
A program that issues a call and does not regain control until the call completes cannot perform any other operations. This type of operation, referred to as blocking, is not suited to a server application designed to handle multiple requests from many clients. Asynchronous call completion returns the initial call immediately so the application can continue with other processes. </p>
<p>
Microsoft® SNA Server uses the <b>RegisterWindowsMessage</b> function for asynchronous support. With "WinAsyncAPPC" as the input string, an application passes a window handle by which it can be notified of verb completion. The application then issues the verb. When the verb completes, a message is posted to the window handle that was passed, notifying the application that the verb is complete.</p>
<p>
With the exception of asynchronous <a href="appc05b_19er.htm"><b>RECEIVE_AND_WAIT</b></a> , <a href="appc05a_5qlf.htm"><b>MC_RECEIVE_AND_WAIT</b></a>, <a href="appc05b_92oz.htm"><b>RECEIVE_AND_POST</b></a>, and <a href="appc05a_3jvn.htm"><b>MC_RECEIVE_AND_POST</b></a>, which can issue certain other verbs while pending, a conversation can have only one incomplete operation at any time.</p>
