<h3><a name="_sna_sscp_session_characteristics_3270"></a>SSCP Session Characteristics</h3>
<p>
For SNA type 2.1 nodes, the SSCP session uses FM (function management) profile 0 and TS (transmission service) profile 1. This combination of profiles gives the following session characteristics:
<ul>
<li>
The primary and secondary half-sessions both use immediate request mode.</li>
<li>
The primary and secondary half-sessions both use immediate response mode.</li>
<li>
Only definite-response single RU chains are allowed.</li>
<li>
The maximum RU size is limited to 256 bytes.</li>
<li>
DFC RUs are not supported.</li>
<li>
Pacing is not supported.</li>
<li>
Identifiers are used (rather than sequence numbers) on the normal flows.</li>
</ul>
<p>
This implies that the SSCP connection has the following characteristics:
<ul>
<li>
All <a href="3270c4_4eeo.htm"><b>Data</b></a> messages have the ACKRQD (acknowledgment required) field set.</li>
<li>
All <b>Data</b> messages have the BCI (begin chain indicator) and ECI (end chain indicator) application flags set.</li>
<li>
<a href="3270c4_6prk.htm"><b>Status-Control</b></a><b> </b>messages do not flow on the connection.</li>
<li>
<a href="3270c4_7v8w.htm"><b>Status-Session</b></a> messages from the local node to the application only report changes in the activation state of the session.</li>
<li>
The chaining, bracket, confirmation, and recovery protocols (described in <a href="3270c3_6n74.htm">The PLU Connection</a>) do not apply.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Using the SSCP connection, the application can send and receive <b>Data</b> messages corresponding to FMD NS (function management data network services) (session services) requests and FMD data requests. Examples of FMD NS (session services) requests are:
<ul>
<li>
INIT-SELF: Requests from the secondary to the host SSCP requesting that the SSCP assist in the initiation of a session to the host PLU, effectively requesting a BIND (see <a href="3270c3_41gw.htm">Opening the PLU Connection</a>).</li>
<li>
TERM-SELF: Requests from the secondary to the host SSCP requesting that the PLU-SLU session be terminated with an UNBIND (see <a href="3270c3_8qr4.htm">Closing the PLU Connection</a>).</li>
<li>
Character-coded requests: Requests such as logon, logoff, or test commands from the secondary display, or a logon prompt from the host application.</li>
<li>
NOTIFY: Requests used by the secondary to notify the host SSCP that a device is available after a BIND was rejected with sense code 0x0845; for example, where a device emulator supports logical power-off.</li>
</ul>
<p>
The local node sends a NOTIFY request to the SSCP on behalf of the LU whenever the application's SSCP connection state changes while the LU is active. A NOTIFY (vector key 0x0C with byte 5 set to 0x03), which can act as secondary LU, is sent in the following cases:
<ul>
<li>
When an <a href="3270c4_4jcg.htm"><b>Open(SSCP) Request</b></a> is received when the LU is already active.</li>
<li>
When an ACTLU request is accepted when the SSCP connection is already opened.</li>
</ul>
<p>
A NOTIFY (vector key 0x0C with byte 5 set to 0x01), which cannot currently act as secondary LU, is sent in the following cases:
<ul>
<li>
When an ACTLU is received when the SSCP connection is not open.</li>
<li>
When a <a href="3270c4_9re8.htm"><b>Close(SSCP) Request</b></a> is received when the PLU session is not bound.</li>
<li>
When an UNBIND request is received when the SSCP connection is not open.</li>
<li>
In addition, the long response including the NOTIFY vector is used to ACTLU requests.</li>
</ul>
<p>
These NOTIFY messages can be used by the host in conjunction with the negative response 0x0845 that the local node gives to a BIND received when the SSCP connection is not open (see <a href="3270c3_41gw.htm">Opening the PLU Connection</a>).</p>
