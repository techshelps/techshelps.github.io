<h1><a name="_sna_about_the_aftp_guide_aftp"></a>About The AFTP Guide</h1>
<p>
The Advanced Program-to-Program Communications (APPC) Application Suite provides application programming interfaces (APIs) to its APPC File Transfer Protocol (AFTP) functions. This guide provides the information you will need to write an application program to implement AFTP client functions. It is written for application programmers, and assumes that you are familiar with writing C-language applications. Although the APPC Application Suite API is based on APPC and the Common Programming Interface for Communications (CPI-C), you do not need to know these concepts to successfully write applications based on this API.</p>
