<h2><a name="_sna_user_alerts_3270"></a>3270 User Alerts</h2>
<p>
An SNA Server 3270 emulation program can send 3270 user alerts to the local node on the SSCP connection. This allows the local node to route each alert to the appropriate host for the 3270 session on which it was sent.</p>
<p>
To send a 3270 user alert, the application should send it as a <a href="3270c4_4eeo.htm"><b>Data</b></a> message on the SSCP connection. The local node will recognize it as a 3270 user alert if both of the following are true:
<ul>
<li>
The FMHI (function management header indicator) bit in the application flag 1 byte is set.</li>
<li>
The first three bytes of the data are 0x41038D, indicating an NMVT (Network Management Vector Transport).</li>
</ul>
<p>
The local node sends the alert to the appropriate host for the 3270 session on which it was received. If a relative time subvector is present (0x42) with increment type 0xEF (sequence), then the local node will set the sequence number in each message (starting at 1 from power-up and incrementing by 1 for each message sent). Comm Server allows sequence number values up to 2^16. Apart from this, the local node does not alter the contents of the alert.</p>
<p>
Note that there can be some delay before the application receives a response to the alert; the response is sent on the SSCP connection in the same way as other data on this connection. The application must not send further data on the SSCP connection (including further alerts) until it has received a response to this alert.</p>
