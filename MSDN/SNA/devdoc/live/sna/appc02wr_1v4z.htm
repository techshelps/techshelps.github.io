<h2><a name="_sna_starting_local_sync_point_tps_appc"></a>Starting Local Sync Point TPs</h2>
<p>
Local TPs are created by issuing the <a href="appc04_0fs3.htm"><b>TP_STARTED</b></a> verb to SNA Server. The <b>TP_STARTED</b> verb has been modified by adding the new VCB member <b>syncpoint_rqd</b> to allow a TP to specify that it requires Sync Point services.</p>
<p>
By setting <b>syncpoint_rqd</b> to AP_YES, a TP indicates that it requires Sync Point services from SNA Server. A value of AP_NO (the default) indicates that Sync Point services are not required. </p>
<p>
Since this member cannot be incorporated within the existing <b>TP_STARTED</b> VCB, the TP must use a larger VCB structure. To indicate that the VCB is longer than usual, the <b>opext</b> member of the VCB must be combined using <b>OR</b> with the value AP_EXTD_VCB before calling APPC.</p>
<p>
If the TP is started on a server running SNA Server software earlier than version 3.0 with the <b>opext</b> member of the VCB set for Sync Point support, the <b>TP_STARTED</b> verb will fail with a primary return code of AP_INVALID_OPCODE.</p>
<p>
Conversations started by TPs requiring Sync Point support will be routed only by the SNA Server software running on the same machine. They will not be routed to other LAN-attached servers.</p>
