<h1><a name="_sna_a_sample_lua_communication_sequence_lua"></a>A Sample LUA Communication Sequence</h1>
<p>
This section illustrates how RUI and SLI verbs are used for an LUA communication sequence. The two figures illustrate the LUA verbs used to start a session, to exchange data, and to end the session, as well as the SNA messages sent and received. The arrows indicate the direction in which SNA messages flow.</p>
<h4>Communication Sequence Using RUI Verbs</h4>

<p>
In the example shown here, the application performs the following tasks:
<ul>
<li>
Issues an <a href="luac03_37z5.htm"><b>RUI_INIT</b></a> verb to establish the SSCP session. (<b>RUI_INIT</b> does not complete until the LUA application has received an ACTLU message from the host and sent a positive response; however, these messages are handled by SNA Server and are not exposed to the LUA application.)</li>
<li>
Sends an INITSELF message to the SSCP to request a BIND and reads the response.</li>
<li>
Reads a BIND message from the host and writes the response. This establishes the LU session.</li>
<li>
Reads an SDT message from the host, which indicates that initialization is complete and data transfer can begin.</li>
<li>
Sends a chain of data consisting of three RUs (the last indicates that a definite response is required) and reads the response.</li>
<li>
Reads a chain of data consisting of three RUs and writes the response.</li>
<li>
Reads an UNBIND message from the host and writes the response. This terminates the LU session.</li>
<li>
Issues <a href="luac03_2c69.htm"><b>RUI_TERM</b></a> to terminate the SSCP session. (SNA Server sends a NOTIFY message to the host and waits for a positive response; however, these messages are handled by SNA Server and are not exposed to the LUA application.)</li>
</ul>
<h4>Communication Sequence Using SLI Verbs</h4>
<p>
<img src="images/lua1c.gif" border=0></p>
<p>
In the example shown here, the application performs the following tasks:
<ul>
<li>
Issues an <a href="luac04_7bxd.htm"><b>SLI_OPEN</b></a> verb to establish the SSCP session.</li>
<li>
Sends an INITSELF message to the SSCP to request a BIND and reads the response.</li>
<li>
Reads a BIND message from the host and writes the response. This establishes the LU session.</li>
<li>
Reads an SDT message from the host, which indicates that initialization is complete and data transfer can begin.<p>
<b>Note  </b>INITSELF, BIND, and SDT messages are handled by SNA Server if the application is using SLI. The <b>SLI_OPEN</b> does not return until SNA Server has sent an SDT and response.
</li>
<li>
Issues <a href="luac04_2lr5.htm"><b>SLI_SEND</b></a> and <a href="luac04_2nfl.htm"><b>SLI_RECEIVE</b></a> to transfer data, SNA commands, or SNA responses between the host and the application.</li>
<li>
Issues <a href="luac04_7sf5.htm"><b>SLI_CLOSE</b></a> to terminate the SSCP session. (SNA Server sends a NOTIFY message to the host and waits for a positive response; however, these messages are handled by SNA Server and are not exposed to the LUA application.)</li>
</ul>
