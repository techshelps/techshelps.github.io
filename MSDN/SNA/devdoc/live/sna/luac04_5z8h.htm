<dd>
Secondary return code; LUA was not active within SNA Server when an LUA verb was issued.</dd>
<dt>
LUA_INVALID_PROCESS</dt>
<dd>
Secondary return code; the session for which an LUA verb was issued is unavailable because another process owns the session.</dd>
<dt>
LUA_LU_INOPERATIVE</dt>
<dd>
Secondary return code; a severe error occurred while attempting to stop the session. This LU is unavailable for any LUA requests until an ACTLU is received from the host.</dd>
<dt>
LUA_RECEIVE_CORRELATION_TABLE_FULL</dt>
<dd>
Secondary return code; the session receive correlation table for the flow requested reached its capacity.
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dt>
LUA_NEGATIVE_RESPONSE</dt>
<dd>
Primary return code; either LUA sent a negative response to a message received from the primary LU because an error was found in the message, or the application responded negatively to a chain for which the end-of-chain has arrived.
<dl>
<dt>
LUA_FUNCTION_NOT_SUPPORTED</dt>
<dd>
Secondary return code; the LUA does not support the requested function. A control character, an RU parameter, or a formatted request code may have specified the function. Specific sense code information is in bytes 2 and 3.</dd>
<dt>
LUA_DATA_TRAFFIC_RESET</dt>
<dd>
Secondary return code; a half-session of an active session but with inactive data traffic received a normal flow DFC or FMD request. An invalid request header or request unit for the receiver's current session control or data flow control state was found. Delivery to the half-session component was prevented.</dd>
<dt>
LUA_DATA_TRAFFIC_NOT_RESET</dt>
<dd>
Secondary return code; while the data traffic state was not reset, the session control request was received. An invalid request header or request unit for the received current session control or data flow control state was found. Delivery to the half-session component was prevented.</dd>
<dt>
LUA_SC_PROTOCOL_VIOLATION</dt>
<dd>
Secondary return code; a violation of the session control (SC) protocol occurred. A request (that is permitted only after an SC request and a positive response to that request have been successfully exchanged) was received before the required exchange. Byte 4 of the sense data contains the request code. No user data exists for this sense code. An invalid header request or request unit for the received current session control or data flow control state was found. Delivery to the half-session component was prevented.</dd>
<dt>
LUA_INVALID_SC_OR_NC_RH</dt>
<dd>
Secondary return code; the RH of an SC or NC request was invalid.</dd>
<dt>
LUA_PACING_NOT_SUPPORTED</dt>
<dd>
Secondary return code; the request contained a pacing indicator when support of pacing for this session does not exist for the receiving half-session or boundary function half-session. The BIND options chosen previously or the architectural rules were violated by <b>lua_rh</b> values. Delivery to the half-session component was prevented. The errors are not dependent on the current session state. The sender's failure to enforce session rules may have caused the errors.</dd>
<dt>
LUA_NAU_INOPERATIVE</dt>
<dd>
Secondary return code; the network addressable unit (NAU) is not able to process responses or requests. Delivery to the receiver could not take place for one of the following reasons:

<h4>Remarks</h4>
<p>
<b>SLI_BID</b> does the following:
<ul>
<li>
Notifies a Windows LUA application that a message is waiting to be read.</li>
<li>
Provides the current session status.</li>
<li>
Provides a preview of the next message that will be read by <a href="luac04_2nfl.htm"><b>SLI_RECEIVE</b></a>.<p>
This preview contains a maximum of 12 bytes of information (peek data) that enables the Windows LUA application to define its processing strategy for the data.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
To use <b>SLI_BID</b> within a Windows LUA application, issue <b>SLI_BID</b>. When the verb completes, it can be reactivated in the following two ways:
<ul>
<li>
Reissue <b>SLI_BID</b>.</li>
<li>
Issue <b>SLI_RECEIVE</b> with <b>lua_flag1_bid_enable</b> set to 1. This issues an <b>SLI_BID</b> that uses the most recently accepted address for the VCB and establishes the active bid.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Each session can have only one <b>SLI_BID</b> at a time.</p>
<p>
If multiple messages are available when a Windows LUA application issues <b>SLI_BID</b>, the data flow with the highest priority is returned. The order in which the data can be returned is as follows:
<ul>
<li>
SSCP expedited</li>
<li>
LU expedited</li>
<li>
SSCP normal</li>
<li>
LU normal</li>
</ul>
<p>
If <a href="luac04_2nfl.htm"><b>SLI_RECEIVE</b></a> has flags set to read more than one type of message flow, the data returned by <b>SLI_BID</b> might be for a flow different than the one for which you actually receive data through <b>SLI_RECEIVE</b>. This situation occurs when higher priority data arrives from the host after <b>SLI_BID</b> completes processing, but before <b>SLI_RECEIVE</b> is issued.</p>
<p>
To ensure that <b>SLI_RECEIVE</b> reads the data, the <b>SLI_BID</b> returned specifies the flow that matches <b>lua_flag2</b> returned by the completed <b>SLI_BID</b>.</p>
<h4>Session Status Return Values</h4>
<p>
If LUA_STATUS is the primary return code, the secondary return code can be LUA_READY, LUA_NOT_READY, LUA_SESSION_END_REQUESTED, or LUA_INIT_COMPLETE. In addition, if LUA_STATUS is the primary return code, the following parameters are used:</p>
<p class=indent1>
<b>lua_sec_rc</b></p>
<p class=indent1>
<b>lua_sid</b></p>
<p>
LUA_READY is returned after LUA_NOT_READY status, and indicates that the SLI is again ready to perform all commands.</p>
<p>
LUA_NOT_READY indicates that the SLI session is suspended because the SLI has received either an SNA CLEAR command or an SNA UNBIND command with an 0x02 UNBIND type (UNBIND with BIND forthcoming). Depending on what caused the suspension, the session can be reactivated as follows:
<ul>
<li>
When the suspension is caused by an SNA CLEAR, receiving an SNA SDT reactivates the session.</li>
<li>
When an SNA UNBIND type BIND forthcoming causes suspension of the session and the <a href="luac04_7bxd.htm"><b>SLI_OPEN</b></a> that opened the session is completed, the session is suspended until the SLI receives a BIND and SDT command. The session can also optionally receive an STSN command. As a result, user-supplied routines issued with the initial <b>SLI_OPEN</b> must be re-entered because they will be recalled.</li>
</ul>
<p>
The application can send SSCP data after a CLEAR or UNBIND type BIND forthcoming arrives and before the NOT READY status is read. The application can send and receive SSCP data after reading a NOT READY.</p>
<p>
When an SNA UNBIND type BIND forthcoming arrives before completion of the <b>SLI_OPEN</b> that opened the session, LUA_SESSION_FAILURE (not LUA_STATUS) is the primary return code.</p>
<p>
LUA_SESSION_END_REQUESTED indicates that the application received an SNA SHUTD from the host. The Windows LUA application should issue <a href="luac04_7sf5.htm"><b>SLI_CLOSE</b></a> to close the session when convenient.</p>
<p>
LUA_INIT_COMPLETE is returned only when<b> lua_init_type</b> for <b>SLI_OPEN</b> is LUA_INIT_TYPE_PRIM_SSCP. The status means that <b>SLI_OPEN</b> has been processed sufficiently to allow SSCP data to now be sent or received.</p>
<h4>Exception Requests</h4>
<p>
If a host application request unit is converted into an EXR, sense data will be returned. When an <b>SLI_BID</b> completes with the returned verb parameters set as shown, an EXR conversion occurs.</p>
