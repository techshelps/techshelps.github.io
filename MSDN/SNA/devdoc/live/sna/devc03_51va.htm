<p>
After receiving a <a href="devc04_977a.htm"><b>Request-Open-Station</b></a> (RQOS) message, the local node sends an <a href="devc04_3ut2.htm"><b>Open(STATION)</b></a> message to the SNALink when:
<ul>
<li>
The station is configured as secondary (or has negotiated to secondary), and the RQOS message has the Rcv-Set-Mode flag on, indicating that the SNALink has received a mode-setting command such as SNRM.</li>
<li>
The station is configured as primary (or has negotiated to primary), the RQOS message contains a secondary XID, and the local station has sent at least one negotiation-proceeding XID.</li>
</ul>
<p>
The <a href="devc04_12ra.htm"><b>Open(STATION) Request</b></a> contains the link index that was on the <a href="devc04_4qeu.htm"><b>Open(LINK) Request</b></a>. This field is used to correlate the LINK and STATION LPI connections for SNALinks that support multiple connections, such as X.25, 802.2, and channel.</p>
<p>
This <b>Open(STATION) Request</b> contains configuration data for the link station, such as the SDLC address of the adjacent link station (0x00 for secondary stations, 0x01 to 0xFE for primary stations).</p>
<p>
The SNALink should use this address field for determining the local station's role. If it is set to 0x00, the local station is a secondary. Otherwise, the local station is primary. This field has this meaning even when the address is not used because of the link type (such as 802.2).</p>
<p>
See <a href="devc04_12ra.htm"><b>Open(STATION) Request</b></a> for the format of this message.</p>
<p>
If the station cannot be initialized (perhaps due to a lack of resources), the SNALink responds with an <a href="devc04_0mye.htm"><b>Open(STATION) Error Response</b></a> containing the appropriate error code.</p>
