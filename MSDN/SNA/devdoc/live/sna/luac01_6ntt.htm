<h1><a name="_sna_windows_lua_overview_lua"></a>Windows LUA Overview</h1>
<p>
To provide one common API to port applications from various operating environments to Microsoft® Windows NT®, Windows® 95, and Windows® version 3.<i>x</i>, a Windows SNA standard was created. As a direct result of this work, Windows LUA was developed. The LUA verbs, routines, and information presented in this guide represent an evolving Windows LUA that is based on IBM Extended Services for OS/2 version 1.0 and includes a set of Windows extensions.</p>
<p>
The use of the Windows LUA interface on Windows NT, Windows 95, and OS/2  will cause additional threads to be created within the calling process. These other threads perform interprocess communication with the SNA Server service over the LAN interface that the client is configured to use (TCP/IP, IPX/SPX, or named pipes, for example). </p>
<p>
If an application using Windows LUA is running on Windows NT, stopping the SNABASE service will cause the application to be unloaded from memory.</p>
