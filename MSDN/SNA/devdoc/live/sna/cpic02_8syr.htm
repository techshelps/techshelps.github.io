<h2><a name="_sna_fundamental_terms_for_tps_and_lus_cpic"></a>Fundamental Terms for TPs and LUs</h2>
<p>
The following terms describe some fundamental characteristics of TPs communicating through LUs:
<dl>
<dt>
<b>basic conversation</b></dt>
<dd>
A type of conversation more complex than a mapped conversation and generally used by service TPs (SNA-based programs that provide services to other programs). For a basic conversation, use <a href="cpic03_38v7.htm"><b>Set_Conversation_Type</b></a> and specify CM_BASIC_CONVERSATION for the <i>conversation_type</i>. For more information, see <a href="cpic02_49b7.htm">Basic and Mapped Conversations Compared</a>.</dd>
<dt>
<b>conversation</b></dt>
<dd>
The interaction between TPs carrying out a specific task. Each conversation requires an LU-LU session. A TP can be involved in several conversations simultaneously, as shown with TP B in <a href="cpic02_3wyr.htm">Communication Between TPs</a>.</dd>
<dt>
<b>invokable TP</b></dt>
<dd>
A TP that can be invoked by another TP. Invokable TPs are usually server-type applications, that is, they work in the same general way that an IBM CICS application works. Parameters for an invokable TP are configured through registry or environment variables.
<p>
There are several types of invokable TPs:

<dl>
<dt>
<b>operator-started invokable TP</b></dt>
<dd>
A TP that is started manually in preparation for being invoked.</dd>
<dt>
<b>autostarted invokable TP</b></dt>
<dd>
A TP that is automatically started by CPI-C when invoked.</dd>
<dt>
<b>queued TP</b></dt>
<dd>
A TP that, when invoked multiple times, loads once and then queues up subsequent requests to be dealt with one at a time. All operator-started TPs and some autostarted TPs are queued.</dd>
<dt>
<b>nonqueued TP</b></dt>
<dd>
A TP loaded multiple times, once for every time it is invoked. Some autostarted TPs are nonqueued but no operator-started TPs are nonqueued.
</dd>
</dl>

<p>
For more information see <a href="cpic02_43s3.htm">Invokable TPs</a>.
</dd>
<dt>
<b>invoking TP</b></dt>
<dd>
A TP that can invoke (that is, initiate a conversation with) other TPs. Invoking TPs are usually client-type applications, that is, they work in the same general way that an emulator works. For more information see <a href="cpic02_7cf7.htm">Invoking TPs</a>.</dd>
<dt>
<b>local LU</b> and <b>local TP</b></dt>
<dd>
An LU and TP working together, when viewed as the "home base" for a particular conversation. From this viewpoint, some other LU and TP are seen as the "partner" or "remote" LU and TP.</dd>
<dt>
<b>LU alias</b></dt>
<dd>
The string that identifies an LU to a TP. The alias can be up to eight characters long.</dd>
<dt>
<b>LU-LU session</b></dt>
<dd>
The communication between two LUs over a specific connection for a specific amount of time. An LU-LU session is needed for two TPs to interact. One session can be used serially by many pairs of TPs.
<p>
An LU 6.2 can have multiple sessions (two or more concurrent sessions with different partner LUs) and parallel sessions<b> </b>(two or more concurrent sessions with the same partner LU).

<p>
LUs are configured through SNA Server Manager, as are LU-LU pairs and modes; the LU and mode configurations control how many sessions a particular LU-LU pair supports.
</dd>
<dt>
<b>mapped conversation</b></dt>
<dd>
A type of conversation simpler than a basic conversation and generally used by application TPs (programs that accomplish tasks for end users). The default for conversation type is mapped; the conversation type can be changed with the <a href="cpic03_38v7.htm"><b>Set_Conversation_Type</b></a> call. For more information, see <a href="cpic02_49b7.htm">Basic and Mapped Conversations Compared</a>.</dd>
<dt>
<b>partner LU</b> and <b>partner TP</b>, or <b>remote LU</b> and <b>remote TP</b></dt>
<dd>
An LU and TP working together, when viewed as being at the far end of a particular conversation.
</dd>
