<h1><a name="_sna_mc_receive_and_post_appc"></a>MC_RECEIVE_AND_POST</h1>
<p>
The <b>MC_RECEIVE_AND_POST</b> verb receives application data and status information asynchronously. This allows the local TP to proceed with processing while data is still arriving at the local LU.</p>
<p>
<b>MC_RECEIVE_AND_POST</b> is only supported under the Microsoft® Windows NT®, Microsoft® Windows® 95, and OS/2 operating systems. For similar functionality under the Windows version 3.<i>x</i> graphical environment, use <a href="appc05a_5qlf.htm"><b>MC_RECEIVE_AND_WAIT</b></a> in conjunction with <a href="appc06_66sj.htm"><b>WinAsyncAPPC</b></a>. Specifically, while an asynchronous<b> MC_RECEIVE_AND_POST</b> is outstanding, the following verbs can be issued on the same conversation:</p>
<p class=indent1>
<a href="appc05a_4nab.htm"><b>GET_TYPE</b></a></p>
<p class=indent1>
<a href="appc05a_1zvn.htm"><b>MC_GET_ATTRIBUTES</b></a></p>
<p class=indent1>
<a href="appc05b_0737.htm"><b>MC_REQUEST_TO_SEND</b></a></p>
<p class=indent1>
<a href="appc05b_1c6b.htm"><b>MC_SEND_ERROR</b></a></p>
<p class=indent1>
<a href="appc05b_0g9v.htm"><b>MC_TEST_RTS</b></a></p>
<p class=indent1>
<a href="appc04_8k0z.htm"><b>TP_ENDED</b></a></p>
<p>
This allows an application to use an asynchronous <b>MC_RECEIVE_AND_POST</b> to receive data. While the <b>MC_RECEIVE_AND_POST</b> is outstanding, it can still use <b>MC_SEND_ERROR</b> and <b>REQUEST_TO_SEND</b>. It is recommended that you use this feature for full asynchronous support. For information on how a TP receives data and how to use this verb, see Remarks in this topic.</p>
<p>

<dl>
<dt>
<b>opcode</b></dt>
<dd>
Supplied parameter. Specifies the verb operation code, AP_M_RECEIVE_AND_POST.</dd>
<dt>
<b>opext</b></dt>
<dd>
Supplied parameter. Specifies the verb operation extension, AP_MAPPED_CONVERSATION.</dd>
<dt>
<b>primary_rc</b></dt>
<dd>
Returned parameter. Specifies the primary return code set by APPC at the completion of the verb. The valid return codes vary depending on the APPC verb issued. See Return Codes for valid error codes for this verb.</dd>
<dt>
<b>secondary_rc</b></dt>
<dd>
Returned parameter. Specifies the secondary return code set by APPC at the completion of the verb. The valid return codes vary depending on the APPC verb issued. See Return Codes for valid error codes for this verb.</dd>
<dt>
<b>tp_id</b></dt>
<dd>
Supplied parameter. Identifies the local TP. The value of this parameter is returned by <a href="appc04_0fs3.htm"><b>TP_STARTED</b></a> in the invoking TP or by<b> <a href="appc05b_0m77.htm">RECEIVE_ALLOCATE</a></b> in the invoked TP.</dd>
<dt>
<b>conv_id</b></dt>
<dd>
Supplied parameter. Provides the conversation identifier. The value of this parameter is returned by <a href="appc05a_38f7.htm"><b>MC_ALLOCATE</b></a><b> </b>in the invoking TP or by <b>RECEIVE_ALLOCATE</b> in the invoked TP.</dd>
<dt>
<b>what_rcvd</b></dt>
<dd>
Returned parameter. Indicates whether data or conversation status was received.
<ul>
<li>
ap_confirm_deallocate indicates that the partner TP issued <a href="appc05a_4okj.htm"><b>MC_DEALLOCATE</b></a> with <b>dealloc_type</b> set to AP_SYNC_LEVEL. The conversation's synchronization level, established by <a href="appc05a_38f7.htm"><b>MC_ALLOCATE</b></a>, is AP_CONFIRM_SYNC_LEVEL. Upon receiving this value, the local TP normally issues <a href="appc05a_5qhv.htm"><b>MC_CONFIRMED</b></a>.</li>
<li>
ap_confirm_send indicates that the partner TP issued <a href="appc05a_8ktf.htm"><b>MC_PREPARE_TO_RECEIVE</b></a> with <b>ptr_type</b> set to AP_SYNC_LEVEL. The conversation's synchronization level, established by <b>MC_ALLOCATE</b>, is AP_CONFIRM_SYNC_LEVEL. Upon receiving this value, the local TP normally issues <b>MC_CONFIRMED</b>, and begins to send data.</li>
<li>
ap_confirm_what_received indicates that the partner TP issued <a href="appc05a_0b8j.htm"><b>MC_CONFIRM</b></a>. Upon receiving this value, the local TP normally issues <b>MC_CONFIRMED</b>.</li>
<li>
ap_data_complete indicates, for <b>MC_RECEIVE_AND_POST</b>, that the local TP has received a complete data record or the last part of a data record. Upon receiving this value, the local TP normally reissues <b>MC_RECEIVE_AND_POST</b> or issues another receive verb. If the partner TP has sent more data, the local TP begins to receive a new unit of data. Otherwise, the local TP examines status information.<p>
If <b>primary_rc</b> contains ap_ok and <b>what_rcvd</b> contains AP_SEND, AP_CONFIRM_SEND, AP_CONFIRM_DEALLOCATE, or AP_CONFIRM_WHAT_RECEIVED, see the description of the value (in this section) for the next action the local TP normally takes.
<p>
If <b>primary_rc</b> contains AP_DEALLOC_NORMAL, the conversation has been deallocated in response to the <a href="appc05a_4okj.htm"><b>MC_DEALLOCATE</b></a> issued by the partner TP.
</li>
<li>
ap_data_incomplete indicates, for <b>MC_RECEIVE_AND_POST</b>, that the local TP has received an incomplete data record. The <b>max_len</b> parameter specified a value less than the length of the data record (or less than the remainder of the data record if this is not the first receive verb to read the record). Upon receiving this value, the local TP normally reissues <b>MC_RECEIVE_AND_POST</b> (or issues another receive verb) to receive the next part of the record.</li>
<li>
ap_none indicates that the TP did not receive data or conversation status indicators.</li>
<li>
ap_send indicates, for the partner TP, that the conversation has entered RECEIVE state. For the local TP, the conversation is now in SEND state. Upon receiving this value, the local TP normally uses <a href="appc05b_8iub.htm"><b>MC_SEND_DATA</b></a> to begin sending data.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dt>
<b>rtn_status</b></dt>
<dd>
Supplied parameter. Indicates whether both data and conversation status indicators should be returned within one API call.
<ul>
<li>
AP_NO specifies that indicators should be returned individually on separate invocations of the verb.</li>
<li>
AP_YES specifies that indicators should be returned together, provided both are available. Both can be returned when:<p>
The receive buffer is large enough to hold all of the data that precedes the status indicator.
<p>
The data is the last data record before the status indicator.
</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dt>
<b>rts_rcvd</b></dt>
<dd>
Returned parameter. Indicates whether the partner TP issued <a href="appc05b_0737.htm"><b>MC_REQUEST_TO_SEND</b></a>. 
<ul>
<li>
ap_yes indicates that the partner TP issued <b>MC_REQUEST_TO_SEND</b>, which requests that the local TP change the conversation to RECEIVE state.</li>
<li>
ap_no indicates that the partner TP has not issued <b>MC_REQUEST_TO_SEND</b>.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dt>
<b>max_len</b></dt>
<dd>
Supplied parameter. Specifies the maximum number of bytes of data the local TP can receive. The range is from 0 through 65535.
<p>
The value must not exceed the length of the buffer to contain the received data. The offset of <b>dptr</b> plus the value of <b>max_len</b> must not exceed the size of the data segment.
</dd>
<dt>
<b>dlen</b></dt>
<dd>
Returned parameter. Specifies the number of bytes of data received. Data is stored in the buffer specified by <b>dptr</b>. A length of zero indicates that no data was received.</dd>
<dt>
<b>dptr</b></dt>
<dd>
Supplied parameter. Provides the address of the buffer to contain the data received by the local LU.
<p>
For the Windows NT and Windows 95 operating systems, the data buffer can reside in a static data area or in a globally allocated area. The data buffer must fit entirely within this area.

<p>
For the OS/2 operating system, the data buffer must reside on an unnamed, shared segment, which is allocated by the <b>DosAllocSeg</b> function with <b>Flags</b> equal to 1. The data buffer must fit entirely on the data segment.
</dd>
<dt>
<b>sema</b></dt>
<dd>
Supplied parameter. Provides the address of the semaphore that APPC is to clear when the asynchronous receiving operation is finished. On OS/2, the <b>sema</b> parameter is either a RAM or system semaphore. On Windows NT and Windows 95, the <b>sema</b> parameter is an event handle obtained by calling either the <b>CreateEvent</b> or <b>OpenEvent</b> Win32® function.

<li>
The partner TP encountered an ABEND, causing the partner LU to send an <b>MC_DEALLOCATE</b> request.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<h4>Remarks</h4>
<p>
The local TP receives data through the following process:
<ol>
<li>
The local TP issues a receive verb until it finishes receiving a complete unit of data. The data received is one data record.<p>
The local TP may need to issue the receive verb several times in order to receive a complete unit of data. After a complete unit of data has been received, the local TP can manipulate it. The receive verbs are <b>MC_RECEIVE_AND_POST</b> (Windows NT, Windows 95, and OS/2), <a href="appc05a_5qlf.htm"><b>MC_RECEIVE_AND_WAIT</b></a>, and <a href="appc05a_2dib.htm"><b>MC_RECEIVE_IMMEDIATE</b></a>.
</li>
<li>
The local TP issues the receive verb again. This has one of the following effects:<ul>
<li>
If the partner TP has sent more data, the local TP begins to receive a new unit of data.</li>
<li>
If the partner TP has finished sending data or is waiting for confirmation, status information (available through <b>what_rcvd</b>) indicates the next action the local TP normally takes.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>
The following procedure shows tasks performed by the local TP in using <b>MC_RECEIVE_AND_POST</b>.</p>
<h5><img src="../../images/wedge.gif" border=0>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To use MC_RECEIVE_AND_POST</h5>
<ol>
<li>
For the Windows NT and Windows 95 operating systems, the TP retrieves the <a href="appc06_66sj.htm"><b>WinAsyncAPPC</b></a> message number by calling the <b>RegisterWindowMessage</b> API or allocating a semaphore. The <b>sema</b> field should be set to NULL if the application expects to be notified through the Windows message mechanism.<p>
APPC sends the Windows message or clears the semaphore when the local TP finishes receiving data.
<p>
For the OS/2 operating system, the TP uses the <b>DosSemSet</b> function to set the semaphore pointed to by <b>sema</b>.
<p>
The semaphore will remain set while the local TP receives data asynchronously. APPC will clear the semaphore when the local TP finishes receiving data.
</li>
<li>
The TP issues <b>MC_RECEIVE_AND_POST</b>.</li>
<li>
The TP checks the value of <b>primary_rc</b>.<p>
If <b>primary_rc</b> is ap_ok, the receive buffer (pointed to by <b>dptr</b>) is asynchronously receiving data from the partner TP. While receiving data asynchronously, the local TP can:
<ul>
<li>
Perform tasks not related to this conversation.</li>
<li>
Issue <a href="appc05b_0737.htm"><b>MC_REQUEST_TO_SEND</b></a>.</li>
<li>
Gather information about this conversation by issuing <a href="appc05a_4nab.htm"><b>GET_TYPE</b></a>, <a href="appc05a_1zvn.htm"><b>MC_GET_ATTRIBUTES</b></a>, or <a href="appc05b_0g9v.htm"><b>MC_TEST_RTS</b></a>.</li>
<li>
Prematurely cancel <b>MC_RECEIVE_AND_POST</b> by issuing <a href="appc05a_4okj.htm"><b>MC_DEALLOCATE</b></a> with <b>dealloc_type </b>set to AP_ABEND; <a href="appc05b_1c6b.htm"><b>MC_SEND_ERROR</b></a>;<b> </b>or <a href="appc04_8k0z.htm"><b>TP_ENDED</b></a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>
If, however, <b>primary_rc</b> is not ap_ok, <b>MC_RECEIVE_AND_POST</b> has failed. In this case, the local TP does not perform the next two tasks.
</li>
<li>
For the Windows NT and Windows 95 operating systems, when the TP finishes receiving data asynchronously, APPC issues the <a href="appc06_66sj.htm"><b>WinAsyncAPPC</b></a> Windows message or clears the semaphore.<p>
For the OS/2 operating system, the TP uses the <b>DosSemWait</b> function to wait for APPC to clear the semaphore pointed to by <b>sema</b>. When the TP finishes receiving data asynchronously, APPC clears the semaphore. To prevent the local TP from waiting, have it test the semaphore (invoking <b>DosSemWait</b> with <b>Timeout</b> set to zero) until APPC clears the semaphore.
</li>
<li>
The TP checks the new value of <b>primary_rc</b>.<p>
If <b>primary_rc</b> is ap_ok, the local TP can examine the other returned parameters and manipulate the asynchronously received data.
<p>
If <b>primary_rc</b> is not ap_ok, only <b>secondary_rc</b> and <b>rts_rcvd</b> (request-to-send received) are meaningful.
</li>
</ol>
<h4>Conversation State Effects</h4>
<p>
The conversation must be in RECEIVE or SEND state when the TP issues this verb.</p>
<p>
Issuing <b>MC_RECEIVE_AND_POST</b> while the conversation is in SEND state has the following effects:
<ul>
<li>
The local LU sends the information in its send buffer and a SEND indicator to the partner TP.</li>
<li>
The conversation changes to PENDING_POST state; the local TP is ready to receive information from the partner TP asynchronously.</li>
</ul>
<p>
The conversation changes states twice:
<ul>
<li>
Upon initial return of the verb, if <b>primary_rc</b> contains ap_ok, the conversation changes to PENDING_POST state.</li>
<li>
After completion of the verb, the state changes depending on the value of the following:<p class=indent1>
The <b>primary_rc</b> parameter</p>
<p class=indent1>
The <b>what_rcvd</b> parameter if <b>primary_rc</b> is ap_ok</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
The following table shows the new state associated with each value of <b>what_rcvd</b> when <b>primary_rc</b> is AP_OK.</p>
