<p>
If your SNA Server installation contains multiple systems (clients and/or SNA servers), you can place a given invokable TP on more than one system. When an invoking request is received in such an installation, there can be a choice of systems on which to run the invokable TP. You can maintain specific control over this choice; alternatively, by following the instructions in <a href="appc02wr_54rn.htm">TP Name Not Unique; Local LU Alias Unspecified</a>, you can allow SNA Server to make the choice randomly to distribute the load.</p>
<p>
You can maintain specific control over the choice of system by setting up invokable TPs with unique names, or by setting up each invokable TP to run only with a specific, unique LU alias. With this arrangement, the information provided by the invoking TP (in the <b>ALLOCATE</b> or <b>MC_ALLOCATE</b> verb) specifies the system on which the invokable TP should run.</p>
<p>
You can allow SNA Server to make the system choice randomly by setting the <b>DloadMatchLocalFirst</b> registry entry to NO, as described in the <i>Microsoft SNA Server Reference</i>, and using invokable TPs that leave the local LU alias unspecified. Then, when an incoming request is received, it is routed randomly, rather than preferentially to the local SNA server; in addition, no matter what LU alias is requested for the invokable TP, there cannot be a mismatch. SNA Server starts one instance of the requested TP, choosing randomly among the available systems.</p>
<p>
The following topics describe some of the possible arrangements that can be made for running TPs.</p>
