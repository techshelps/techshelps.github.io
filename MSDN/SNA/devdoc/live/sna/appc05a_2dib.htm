<h1><a name="_sna_mc_receive_immediate_appc"></a>MC_RECEIVE_IMMEDIATE</h1>
<p>
The <b>MC_RECEIVE_IMMEDIATE</b> verb receives any data currently available from the partner TP. If no data is available, the local TP does not wait. To avoid blocking the conversation, the Microsoft® Windows NT®, Microsoft® Windows® 95, and Windows version 3.<i>x</i> systems can issue <a href="appc05a_5qlf.htm"><b>MC_RECEIVE_AND_WAIT</b></a> in conjunction with <a href="appc06_66sj.htm"><b>WinAsyncAPPC</b></a>. For OS/2 systems, use <a href="appc05a_3jvn.htm"><b>MC_RECEIVE_AND_POST</b></a>.</p>
<p>
The following structure describes the verb control block used by the <b>MC_RECEIVE_IMMEDIATE</b> verb.</p>
<pre><code>struct mc_receive_immediate {

<h4>Members</h4>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>opcode</b></dt>
<dd>
Supplied parameter. Specifies the verb operation code, AP_M_RECEIVE_IMMEDIATE.</dd>
<dt>
<b>opext</b></dt>
<dd>
Supplied parameter. Specifies the verb operation extension, AP_MAPPED_CONVERSATION.</dd>
<dt>
<b>primary_rc</b></dt>
<dd>
Returned parameter. Specifies the primary return code set by APPC at the completion of the verb. The valid return codes vary depending on the APPC verb issued. See Return Codes for valid error codes for this verb.</dd>
<dt>
<b>secondary_rc</b></dt>
<dd>
Returned parameter. Specifies the secondary return code set by APPC at the completion of the verb. The valid return codes vary depending on the APPC verb issued. See Return Codes for valid error codes for this verb.</dd>
<dt>
<b>tp_id</b></dt>
<dd>
Supplied parameter. Identifies the local TP. The value of this parameter is returned by <a href="appc04_0fs3.htm"><b>TP_STARTED</b></a> in the invoking TP or by <a href="appc05b_0m77.htm"><b>RECEIVE_ALLOCATE</b></a> in the invoked TP.</dd>
<dt>
<b>conv_id</b></dt>
<dd>
Supplied parameter. Provides the conversation identifier. The value of this parameter is returned by <a href="appc05a_38f7.htm"><b>MC_ALLOCATE</b></a> in the invoking TP or by <b>RECEIVE_ALLOCATE</b> in the invoked TP.</dd>
<dt>
<b>what_rcvd</b></dt>
<dd>
Returned parameter. Contains information received with the incoming data:
<ul>
<li>
ap_confirm_deallocate indicates that the partner TP has issued <a href="appc05a_4okj.htm"><b>MC_DEALLOCATE</b></a> with <b>dealloc_type</b> set to AP_SYNC_LEVEL, and the conversation's synchronization level, established by <b>MC_ALLOCATE</b>, is AP_CONFIRM_SYNC_LEVEL. Upon receiving this value, the local TP normally issues <a href="appc05a_5qhv.htm"><b>MC_CONFIRMED</b></a>.</li>
<li>
ap_confirm_send indicates that the partner TP has issued <a href="appc05a_8ktf.htm"><b>MC_PREPARE_TO_RECEIVE</b></a> with <b>ptr_type</b> set to AP_SYNC_LEVEL, and the conversation's synchronization level, established by <b>MC_ALLOCATE</b>, is AP_CONFIRM_SYNC_LEVEL. Upon receiving this value, the local TP normally issues <b>MC_CONFIRMED</b>, and begins to send data.</li>
<li>
ap_confirm_what_received indicates that the partner TP has issued <a href="appc05a_0b8j.htm"><b>MC_CONFIRM</b></a>. Upon receiving this value, the local TP normally issues <b>MC_CONFIRMED</b>.</li>
<li>
ap_data_complete indicates, for <b>MC_RECEIVE_IMMEDIATE</b> in mapped conversations, that the local TP has received a complete data record or the last part of a data record. Upon receiving this value, the local TP normally reissues <b>MC_RECEIVE_IMMEDIATE </b>or issues another receive verb. If the partner TP has sent more data, the local TP begins to receive a new unit of data.<p>
Otherwise, the local TP examines status information if <b>primary_rc</b> contains ap_ok and <b>what_rcvd</b> contains any of these values:
<p>
AP_SEND
<p>
AP_CONFIRM_SEND
<p>
AP_CONFIRM_DEALLOCATE
<p>
AP_CONFIRM_WHAT_RECEIVED
<p>
See the description of the value in Return Codes in this topic for the next action the local TP normally takes.
<p>
If <b>primary_rc</b> contains ap_dealloc_normal, the conversation has been deallocated in response to <a href="appc05a_4okj.htm"><b>MC_DEALLOCATE</b></a> issued by the partner TP.
</li>
<li>
ap_data_incomplete indicates for <b>MC_RECEIVE_IMMEDIATE</b> in mapped conversations that the local TP has received an incomplete data record. The <b>max_len</b> parameter specified a value less than the length of the data record (or less than the remainder of the data record if this is not the first receive verb to read the record). Upon receiving this value, the local TP normally reissues <b>MC_RECEIVE_IMMEDIATE </b>(or issues another receive verb) to receive the next part of the record.</li>
<li>
ap_none indicates that the TP did not receive data or conversation status indicators.</li>
<li>
ap_send indicates, for the partner TP, the conversation has entered RECEIVE state. For the local TP, the conversation is now in SEND state. Upon receiving this value, the local TP normally uses <a href="appc05b_8iub.htm"><b>MC_SEND_DATA</b></a><b> </b>to begin sending data.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dt>
<b>rtn_status</b></dt>
<dd>
Supplied parameter. Indicates whether both data and conversation status indicators should be returned within one API call.
<ul>
<li>
AP_NO specifies that indicators should be returned individually on separate invocations of the verb.</li>
<li>
AP_YES specifies that indicators should be returned together, provided both are available. Both can be returned when:<p>
The receive buffer is large enough to hold all of the data that precedes the status indicator.
<p>
The data is the last data record before the status indicator.
</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dt>
<b>rts_rcvd</b></dt>
<dd>
Returned parameter. Contains the request-to-send indicator. Possible values are:
<ul>
<li>
ap_yes indicates that the partner TP has issued <a href="appc05b_0737.htm"><b>MC_REQUEST_TO_SEND</b></a>, which requests that the local TP change the conversation to RECEIVE state.</li>
<li>
ap_no indicates that the partner TP has not issued <b>MC_REQUEST_TO_SEND</b>.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dt>
<b>max_len</b></dt>
<dd>
Supplied parameter. Indicates the maximum number of bytes of data the local TP can receive. The range is from 0 through 65535.
<p>
For the Windows NT and Windows 95 operating systems and the Windows graphical environment, this value must not exceed the length of the buffer to contain the received data.

<p>
For the OS/2 operating system, the offset of <b>dptr</b> plus the value of <b>max_len</b> must not exceed the size of the data segment. 

<p>
By issuing <b>MC_RECEIVE_IMMEDIATE</b> with <b>max_len</b> set to zero, the local TP can determine whether the partner TP has data to send, seeks confirmation, or has changed the conversation state.
</dd>
<dt>
<b>dlen</b></dt>
<dd>
Returned parameter. Provides the number of bytes of data received. Data is stored in a buffer specified by <b>dptr</b>. A length of zero indicates that no data was received.</dd>
<dt>
<b>dptr</b></dt>
<dd>
Supplied parameter. Address of the buffer to contain the data received by the local TP.
<p>
For the Windows NT and Windows 95 operating systems and the Windows graphical environment, the data buffer can reside in a static data area or in a globally allocated area. The data buffer must fit entirely within this area.

<p>
For the OS/2 operating system, the data buffer must reside on an unnamed, shared segment, which is allocated by the function <b>DosAllocSeg</b> with <b>Flags</b> equal to 1. The data buffer must fit entirely on the data segment.

</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<h4>Remarks</h4>
<p>
The local TP receives data through the following process:
<ol>
<li>
The local TP issues a receive verb until it finishes receiving a complete unit of data. The data received is one data record.<p>
The local TP may need to issue the receive verb several times in order to receive a complete unit of data. After a complete unit of data has been received, the local TP can manipulate it.
<p>
The receive verbs are <a href="appc05a_3jvn.htm"><b>MC_RECEIVE_AND_POST</b></a> (Windows NT, Windows 95, and OS/2 operating systems), <a href="appc05a_5qlf.htm"><b>MC_RECEIVE_AND_WAIT</b></a>, and <b>MC_RECEIVE_IMMEDIATE</b>.
</li>
<li>
The local TP issues the receive verb again. This has one of the following effects:<ul>
<li>
If the partner TP has sent more data, the local TP begins to receive a new unit of data.</li>
<li>
If the partner TP has finished sending data or is waiting for confirmation, status information (available through <b>what_rcvd</b>) indicates the next action the local TP normally takes.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>
The conversation must be in RECEIVE state when the TP issues this verb.</p>
<p>
The new state is determined by <b>primary_rc</b>. If <b>primary_rc</b> is ap_ok, the new state is determined by <b>what_rcvd</b>.</p>
<p>
The following table details the state changes when the <b>primary_rc</b> is ap_ok.</p>
