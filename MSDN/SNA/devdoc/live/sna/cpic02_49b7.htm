<p>
The following table offers some guidelines for choosing between basic and mapped conversations for your TPs. The default for conversation type is mapped; to change to a basic conversation, use <a href="cpic03_38v7.htm"><b>Set_Conversation_Type</b></a>, and specify CM_BASIC_CONVERSATION for the <i>conversation_type</i>. For definitions of basic and mapped conversations, see <a href="cpic02_8syr.htm">Fundamental Terms for TPs and LUs</a>.</p>

<td width=39%>Before a TP can begin a send operation, it must convert data records into logical records. The TP does this by adding a 2-byte prefix that indicates the length of the record. A TP can send several logical records at one time.<p>
When a partner TP receives logical records, it must reconstruct them into usable data records. For more information, see <a href="cpic02_8u1v.htm">Logical Records Used in Basic Conversations</a>.</p>
