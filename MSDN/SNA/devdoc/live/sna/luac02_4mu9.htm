<p>
Two processes cannot use the same LUA session. Only the process that issues <a href="luac03_37z5.htm"><b>RUI_INIT</b></a> can use the session that is started by the verb. Before another process can use LUA, it must issue <b>RUI_INIT</b> to obtain a new session. However, different threads of the same process can issue verbs for the same LUA session.</p>
<p>
A single process can simultaneously use more than one LUA session (up to 512 sessions for applications based on the Microsoft® Windows NT®, Microsoft® Windows® 95, Windows version 3.<i>x</i>, or OS/2 systems) by issuing multiple <b>RUI_INIT</b> verbs. Each session must use a different LU; two or more sessions can use the same pool, but the <b>lua_luname</b> member (which is either the name of the pool or the name of an LU within the pool) must be different for each <b>RUI_INIT</b>.</p>
<p>
Two or more instances of the same LUA application can run as different processes, but they must use different LUs. This can be done by using LU pools; the two processes can specify the same pool and are allocated different LUs from that pool.</p>
