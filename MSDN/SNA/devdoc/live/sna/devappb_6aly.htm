<h1><a name="_sna_supporting_modem_status_in_an_sna_link_service_dev"></a>Supporting Modem Status in an SNA Link Service</h1>
<p>
The implementation of a link service that supports the modem status requires the following:
<ul>
<li>
A call to the SNA Modem interface to initialize the SNA Modem data structures.</li>
<li>
Modification of the SNA Modem structures as the status changes, as reported by the DevIoctl calls.</li>
</ul>
<p>
IHVs who use the Microsoft® SNA Server SDLC link service and who fully implement the SNADIS interface will have no changes to make to use the modem status feature. However, IHVs should check that the status returned by DevIoctl calls from their device driver conforms to the requirements described below.</p>
<p>
IHVs who provide both the device driver and link service need to implement the code in their link service that initializes the SNA Modem API and updates the modem status information.</p>
