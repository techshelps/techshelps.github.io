<p>
The concept of a TP "running as a service" or "running as an application" is distinct from a service TP or an application TP. Service TP and application TP are SNA terms that describe how a TP is used: either as a supportive service program for other APPC programs, or directly by a user, as an application. For detailed information about Windows NT-based services and applications, see the documentation for Windows NT and for Win32®.</p>
<p>
To write an autostarted TP so it will run under Windows NT as a service and also run in a nonqueued way, write a multithreaded program with a <a href="appc05b_0m77.htm"><b>RECEIVE_ALLOCATE</b></a> always outstanding. See <a href="appc02wr_2vkz.htm">Invokable TPs</a>.</p>
<p>
To run an autostarted TP as an application under Windows NT, make sure the TPSTART program is always started before the TP. See <a href="appcapc_4u03.htm">Sample APPC TPs in the SDK</a>.</p>
