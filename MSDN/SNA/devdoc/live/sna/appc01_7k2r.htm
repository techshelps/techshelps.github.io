<h1><a name="_sna_windows_appc_overview_appc"></a>Windows APPC Overview</h1>
<p>
A  Windows SNA standard was created to provide one common API to port applications from various operating environments to Microsoft® Windows NT®, Windows® 95, and Windows version 3.<i>x</i>. As a direct result of this work, Windows APPC was developed.</p>
<p>
The information provided in this guide is source code and executable code compatible with the following implementations of APPC:
<ul>
<li>
SNA Server APPC applications residing on the server or on a client running Windows NT, Windows 95, Windows 3.<i>x</i>, MS-DOS®, or OS/2.</li>
<li>
IBM APPC Extended Services for OS/2 version 1.0.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Programs written to use this implementation of APPC can exchange data with programs written to use other implementations of APPC that adhere to the SNA LU 6.2 architecture.</p>
<p>
The use of the Windows APPC interface on Windows NT, Windows 95, and OS/2  will cause additional threads to be created within the calling process. These other threads perform interprocess communication with the SNA Server service over the LAN interface that the client is configured to use (TCP/IP, IPX/SPX, or named pipes, for example). </p>
<p>
If an application using Windows APPC is running on Windows NT, stopping the SNABASE service will cause the application to be unloaded from memory.</p>
