If you experience difficulty in using Microsoft<sup>®</sup> Visual InterDev™ with Microsoft<sup>®</sup> Visual SourceSafe™, you may need to make changes outside of Visual InterDev in the applications that support Visual InterDev. You can check the following items to resolve issues with enabling and using Visual InterDev with Visual SourceSafe.</p>
<h2>Appropriate Login and Permissions</h2>
<ul type=disc>
<li>
On your local computer, make sure that you are logged in as yourself, at your client machine. If someone else has used your computer and doesn't have the same permissions as you, you may be denied permissions. To solve the problem, log in as yourself to get appropriate access to files.<br><br></li>
<li>
In the Visual SourceSafe Administrator, make sure that you are entered as a valid user. Also, make sure your server's anonymous user is in the user list. By default, the anonymous user name is IUSR_&lt;<i>machinename</i>&gt;. If you don't know your computer's anonymous user name, you can find it in the Internet Information Server configuration in the properties for the WWW service.<br><br></li>
<li>
In the Microsoft<sup>®</sup> Internet Information Server Manager, make sure that either Basic authentication or NT Challenge/Response is enabled. If the No Authentication option is selected, access is not available to modify projects.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Proper Software Installation</h2>
<ul type=disc>
<li>
On your Web server, check that you have installed the FrontPage<sup>®</sup> Server Extensions, Active Server Pages, and Visual SourceSafe. If Visual SourceSafe was installed using the Typical or Client installations, you need to reinstall and use the "Custom" or "Server" installation, and select the option to "Enable SourceSafe Integration."</li>
</ul>
<h2>Visual SourceSafe Connection</h2>
<ul type=disc>
<li>
If you have Visual SourceSafe installed on your local computer in addition to the Web server, make sure the LAN connection between your computer and the server is working and that the appropriate permissions are set. <p class=tl>
You do not need Visual SourceSafe on your local computer; you only need Visual InterDev. If you want to use the Visual SourceSafe Explorer to work with your Web files directly in the VSS database, you can install the Visual SourceSafe client on your local computer. </P><p class=tl>
For more information about installing and setting up a Visual SourceSafe database, see "How to Install VSS" in the Visual SourceSafe documentation.</P></li>
