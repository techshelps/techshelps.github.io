<h1><a name="victlincludecontrol"></a>Include Design-Time Control</h1>
<p>
Adds an #INCLUDE FILE directive (for a path relative to the current file) or an #INCLUDE VIRTUAL directive (for a path relative to the virtual root) into your .asp file.</p>
<p class=indent>
<B><b>Note&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</b></B>This control is included for compatibility for Microsoft<sup>®</sup> Visual InterDev™ 1.0 only. For complete details, see your Visual InterDev 1.0 documentation.</p>
<p class=label>
<b>Remarks</b></p>
<p>
An #INCLUDE VIRTUAL path contains a forward slash at the beginning of the URL. For example, if a file named Footer.inc resides in a virtual root named /Myapp, the following value would insert the contents of Footer.inc.</p>
<pre><code>/myapp/footer.inc
</code></pre>
<p>
An #INCLUDE FILE path begins with the directory that contains the including file. For example, if you have a file in the directory Myapp, and the file Header1.inc is in Myapp\Headers, the following value would insert Header1.inc in your file:</p>
<pre><code>headers/header1.inc
</code></pre>
<p>
The #INCLUDE VIRTUAL directive inserts the contents of a file in your server page at run time. This is most useful for common elements like copyrights, headers, footers, and disclaimers that appear on more than one page. This is also a convenient way for you to share script functions and procedures.</p>
<p>
The Include control provides access to a graphical URL builder so that all you have to do is select the file you want to include. If you want an #INCLUDE VIRTUAL statement, choose Root Relative in the URL builder. If you want an #INCLUDE FILE directive, choose Doc Relative. The Include control will generate the proper syntax and path to the file. For example:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;!--#INCLUDE FILE="intro.htm"--&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>
You can also include files that contain server script. </p>
<p class=indent>
<B><b>Note</b></B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Include files are merged into the target file before any server script is processed. Because of this, the INCLUDE directive cannot be executed conditionally by script.</p>
