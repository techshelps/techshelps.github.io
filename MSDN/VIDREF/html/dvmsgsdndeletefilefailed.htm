<h1><a name="dvmsgsdndeletefilefailed"></a>Could not delete files from the project.</h1>
<p>
Site Designer has deleted the selected pages from the site diagram but was unable to delete the pages from the Web project. Usually this is the result of a lost connection with the master Web server.
<ul type=disc>
<li>
To correct this error, delete these pages manually from the Project Explorer.</li>
