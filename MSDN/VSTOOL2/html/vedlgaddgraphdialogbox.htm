<p>
Use the Add Graph dialog box to add line graphs representing Microsoft<sup>®</sup> Windows NT<sup>®</sup> Performance Monitor counters to a Visual Studio Analyzer Chart view. Adding line graphs to the Chart view shows you environment activity, such as CPU usage, along with Visual Studio Analyzer events.</p>
<p>
The Add Graph dialog box constructs a filter that it uses to draw the line graph on the Chart view. This filter specifies the machine, component, and Performance Monitor event of interest.</p>
<p>
Although the Add Graph dialog box appears very similar to the Filter Editor dialog box, the Add Graph dialog box is different in the following ways:
<ul type=disc>
<li>
You can select only one item in each column; therefore, you cannot select parent items. Performance Monitor data comes from the Perfmon Dynamic Source component listed in the Components column.<br><br></li>
<li>
The Categories/Events column shows existing events in the event log in bold. You can select any event (bold or not). Selecting events that are not bold causes the event to be graphed when data arrives. This is useful for future sessions.<br><br></li>
<li>
Only measured events are included in the Categories/Events column.<br><br></li>
<li>
Only machines are included in the Machines/Processes column.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Options</h2>
<h3>Categories/Events</h3>
<p>
Specifies the available Performance Monitor events, organized by category. Click the plus sign next to a subcategory to display a list of events in that category. You can select only one Performance Monitor event at a time. If you want to look at more than one Performance Monitor event, you need to add a line graph for each one.</p>
<h3>Components</h3>
<p>
Specifies the components of interest. You can select only one component at a time. If you want to look at more than one component, you need to add a line graph for each one.</p>
<h3>Edit Text</h3>
<p>
Displays the filter in an edit box where you can type the expression representing the filter.</p>
<p class=indent>
<B><b>Warning</b></B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some filters, although you can type them in yourself, cannot be shown using the Filter Editor user interface. An example of these filters is an expression that uses inequality operators, such as &lt;&gt;. When you click Edit Text, a message appears that warns you about this. Click OK to confirm that you want to edit the filter text. Also, although you can enter any filter you want using Edit Text, it is possible that such a filter will not be suitable for graphing.</p>
<h3>Machines/Processes</h3>
<p>
Specifies the machines of interest.</p>
