<p>
The Visual Studio Analyzer Project Wizard is the fastest way to create a Visual Studio Analyzer project. The wizard consists of four main steps:
<ol>
<li>
Scan the current solution for the machines you want to monitor with Visual Studio Analyzer.<br><br></li>
<li>
Identify by name any additional machines you want to monitor.<br><br></li>
<li>
Select the components from which you want to see Visual Studio Analyzer events. This step is repeated for each machine you want to monitor.<br><br></li>
<li>
Select the sample filters that you would like to include in your Visual Studio Analyzer project.</li>
</ol>
<p>
Additionally, the wizard creates and activates a default event log and filter, both of which are required to be present in a project before you can begin collecting events.</p>
<p>
The wizard includes a standard set of buttons along the bottom. These buttons control the following actions:</p>
<table border=1 cellpadding=5 cols=2 frame=below rules=rows>
<tr valign=top>
<td class=label width=18%><b>Button</b></td>
<td class=label width=82%><b>Description</b></td>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=18%>Help</td>
<td width=82%>Displays online help for the Project Wizard.</td>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=18%>&lt; Back</td>
<td width=82%>Moves back one step in the process.</td>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=18%>Next &gt;</td>
<td width=82%>Moves forward one step in the process.</td>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=18%>Finish</td>
<td width=82%>Creates all items and closes the wizard.</td>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=18%>Cancel</td>
<td width=82%>Closes the wizard; no project is created.</td>
</tr>
</table><br>
<h2>Scan for Machines</h2>
<p>
This step scans the current solution for machines. If you click Yes the wizard will create a list of every machine it finds. You can then select from this list to identify the machines you want to monitor with Visual Studio Analyzer. If you click No the wizard will continue with step 2, where you can specify individual machines by name.</p>
<h2>Specify Additional Machines</h2>
<p>
In this step you can select machines from the list that the wizard built in step 1 and identify other machines that you would like to monitor. All machines you want to monitor must have the Visual Studio Analyzer Server components installed and running; you might have to start the server components manually on remote Windows 95 machines. See <a href="vehowstartingvisualstudioanalyzerserveronwindows95.htm">Starting the Visual Studio Analyzer Server on Windows 95</a> for a step-by-step procedure describing how to do this.</p>
<h3>Add Machine</h3>
<p>
Click to display the Connect to Machine dialog box, where you can specify a machine you want to monitor with Visual Studio Analyzer.</p>
<h2>Select Components</h2>
<p>
In this step you select the components from which you would like to see Visual Studio Analyzer events. You repeat this step for each machine you specified. The components listed here are Microsoft technologies that are shipped ready to generate Visual Studio Analyzer events. See <a href="veconabouteventsources.htm">Microsoft Components That Generate Visual Studio Analyzer Events</a> for a complete list of these technologies and information about the specific events each technology generates.</p>
<h2>Import Filters</h2>
<p>
In this step you select any existing filters from other projects in the current solution that you want to add to your new Visual Studio Analyzer project. You apply filters to event logs to specify which events to collect, and to Visual Studio Analyzer views to determine what subset of events in the event log to display. Sample filters are predefined filters that you can modify as necessary.</p>
<h2>Select Sample Filters</h2>
<p>
In this step you select sample filters to include in your Visual Studio Analyzer project. You apply filters to event logs to specify which events to collect, and to Visual Studio Analyzer views to determine what subset of events in the event log to display. Sample filters are predefined filters that you can modify as necessary.</p>
<h2>Finish</h2>
<p>
This step completes the wizard. It shows a confirmation box that summarizes the options you have chosen. If you want to change any of the options shown, use the Back button to step back through the wizard and make changes. Once you click Finish, the wizard actually creates the project file and the items inside the file, including a default event log and default filter, both of which are automatically set to record events.</p>
