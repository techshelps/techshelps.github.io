Visual Studio Analyzer presents its data in several different views, each emphasizing different aspects of your application. Through these views, you can interpret the data that Visual Studio Analyzer collects. The following table describes the Visual Studio Analyzer views and their uses. Use the links to see topics with more detailed information on each.</p>
<table border=1 cellpadding=5 cols=3 frame=below rules=rows>
<tr valign=top>
<td class=label width=24%><b>Viewer</b></td>
<td class=label width=36%><b>Description</b></td>
<td class=label width=40%><b>Recommended Use</b></td>

<tr valign=top>
<td width=24%><a href="vedlgeventview.htm">Event List View</a></td>
<td width=36%>Shows a tabular list of all the events in the active Visual Studio Analyzer event log.</td>
<td width=40%>See a spreadsheet-like view of events and their parameters.</td>

<tr valign=top>
<td width=24%><a href="vedlgapplicationperformanceviewer.htm">Chart View</a></td>
<td width=36%>Shows the events in the event log in a tree view, along with a Gantt chart showing the timing of the events. You can add one or more line charts showing performance data (from the Windows NT Performance Monitor) on top of the Gantt chart.</td>
<td width=40%>Understand how your application is performing, isolate hot spots, or understand relative timing information.</td>

<h2>Combining Views</h2>
<p>
You can combine more than one Visual Studio Analyzer view on your desktop; for example, you might want to display the Event List and one of the Block Diagram views simultaneously. Each view opens in its own window. All you need to do is open the views you want and use the commands on the Window menu to arrange the views to your liking.</p>
<p>
You can also dock the Visual Studio Analyzer views the same way you dock other windows in the development environment. See <object id=alink_3 type="application/x-oleobject"
	classid="clsid:adb880a6-d8ff-11cf-9377-00aa003b7a11">
<PARAM name="Command" value="ALink">
<PARAM name="DefaultTopic" value="_topic_not_found.htm">
<PARAM name="Item1" value="">
<PARAM name="Item2" value="csconWindowManagement">
</object><a href=JavaScript:alink_3.Click()>Window Management</a> for information on docking windows, linking windows, and customizing your window preferences.</p>
<h2>Linking and Unlinking Views</h2>
<p>
By default, all open Visual Studio Analyzer views are automatically linked to other open views and to the currently applied filter. This linking affects open views as follows:
<ul type=disc>
<li>
If you select an event in an open view, all the other views change to reflect the selection.<br><br></li>
<li>
If you change the currently applied filter, the updates are reflected immediately in all open views.<br><br></li>
<li>
If you are watching the events your application generates in real time, the views you have open will update automatically.</li>
</ul>
<p>
You can unlink the view from other views and from the currently applied filter by selecting AutoSelect or AutoFilter, respectively, from the shortcut menu.</p>
<h2>Replaying Events in Views</h2>
<p>
All Visual Studio Analyzer views are capable of replaying the events in the event log. Even the Event view updates to show the detailed information for the currently selected view. The replay commands are located on both the Analyzer menu and on the Analyzer toolbar.</p>
