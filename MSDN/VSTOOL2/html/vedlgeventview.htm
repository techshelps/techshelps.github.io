Use the Event List view when you want to see a comprehensive list of the events generated by an application and their associated event data. The Event List view shows a list of all events that match the criteria of the filter currently applied to the view. The view includes several columns that provide detailed information about each event. You can:
<ul type=disc>
<li>
Sort each column's contents (a small arrow indicates the sort order).<br><br></li>
<li>
Select an event or range of events.<br><br></li>
<li>
Refine the filter applied to the view.<br><br></li>
<li>
Select which columns are displayed in the view.<br><br></li>
<li>
Resize and reorder the columns by dragging.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Customizations you make to the Event List view are not saved until you explicitly do so, by clicking Save Column Settings on the view's shortcut menu.</p>
<p>
You can play back the events shown in the view. You can use standard VCR-like buttons to navigate forward or backward through events. You can also skip events until a different component is involved — this choice omits back-and-forth messages between the same two components.</p>
<p>
The event playback is animated. You can adjust the animation's speed, and that speed is remembered.</p>
<h2>Options</h2>
<h3>AutoFilter</h3>
<p>
Controls whether the view is linked to the current autofilter, so that when you change the filter, the changes are immediately reflected in the view and in all other views that are linked to the current autofilter.</p>
<h3>AutoPlayTrack</h3>
<p>
Controls whether the view changes during playback to highlight each event as it occurs.</p>
<h3>AutoSelect</h3>
<p>
Controls whether the Event List view is linked to other open views, so that when you select an event in any open view, the same event is also selected in the Event List view.</p>
<h3>Columns</h3>
<p>
Displays the Add/Remove Columns dialog box, which you can use to select the columns you want displayed in the Event List view.</p>
<h3>Save Column Settings</h3>
<p>
Saves the columns you have chosen and the order in which they are displayed in the Event List view.</p>
<h3>Size Columns To Fit</h3>
<p>
Sizes the columns you have chosen for display so that they all fit within the view.</p>
