Imagine yourself as the newest member of the MIS department in a small fish and seafood distributing company. Your first assignment is to make changes to the company’s sales order support application. After meeting with your boss, you understand that:
<ul type=disc>
<li>
An order has a purchaser<br><br></li>
<li>
An order consists of one or more order rows, each of a given article in a given quantity<br><br></li>
<li>
Orders are registered and handed to shipping<br><br></li>
<li>
Customers, orders, and articles need to be persistently stored by the order system</li>
</ul>
<p>
Before making any decisions on how to change the order system, you wisely decide to run the current implementation and to use Visual Modeler for studying the current architecture.</p>
<h2>Starting the Order System</h2>
<p class=label>
<b>To start the order system application: </b>
<ol>
<li>
Start your Microsoft Visual Basic development environment by double clicking on the ordersys.vbp project file, which you can find in the folder where the Order System sample is installed.<br><br></li>
<li>
Run the program by choosing <b>Start With Full Compile</b> from the <b>Run</b> menu. <p>

</ol>
<p class=label>
<b>If you have problems running the order system, make sure that: </b>
<ul type=disc>
<li>
The database files ordersys.mbd and ordersys.ldb are located in the same folder as the project file, and that the files are writable (not read only)<br><br></li>
<li>
The correct DAO Object Library is loaded. Choose <b>References</b> on the <b>Project</b> menu and check the appropriate library<br><br></li>
<li>
None of the references in the <b>References</b> dialog box are marked as "MISSING:"</li>
</ul>
<h2>Entering a New Order</h2>
<p>
After having successfully started the order system application you are now ready to enter a new order. An Order Id has already been allocated in the <b>Order</b> dialog box.</p>
<p class=label>
<b>To enter a new order: </b>
<ol>
<li>
Start by assigning a customer to the new order. By default the first customer found has been chosen, which is "101", "Baron's Inne", at "499 N. Gulp Rd, King of Prussia". Click the <b>Name</b> box to view all other customers and select one of them.<br><br></li>
<li>
Continue by adding new rows to the order: Click <b>New</b> to open the <b>Order Row </b>dialog box. <p>
<img src="ve4vz22.gif" border=0></P></li>
<li>
Select an article from the <b>Article Name</b> list and see how the information in the dialog box changes.<br><br></li>
<li>
To populate the <b>Article Name</b> list with seafood articles with a higher article identifier, type "2*" in the <b>Article Id</b> box and press ENTER.<br><br></li>
<li>
Select any article, enter a number in the <b>Quantity</b> field, and click <b>OK</b>.<br><br></li>
<li>
The <b>Order</b> dialog box now presents the new order row and recalculates the total order sum after each new order row has been created.<br><br></li>
<li>
Click <b>OK</b> to accept and register the new order.<br><br></li>
<li>
Click <b>OK</b> to exit the order system.</li>
</ol>
