<h2><a name="_denali_about_installation"></a>About Installation</h2>
<p>
To use the CDO for NTS Library, make sure it is referenced by the automation controller you are using. With Microsoft Visual Basic, for example, run the <b>References</b> command and select the check box for <b>Microsoft CDO for NTS 1.2 Library</b>. </p>
<p>
To successfully run the CDONTS.DLL file, which holds both the in-process server and the type library, you must have installed Microsoft® Internet Explorer version 4.0 or later. A minimal installation is sufficient, and the Internet Explorer does not have to be actually running. </p>
<p>
CDO for NTS is automatically installed during the typical installation of IIS 4.0. Microsoft Exchange does not have to be installed at the IIS computer on which CDO for NTS is being installed. </p>
<p>
To run with Microsoft Exchange version 5.5, a minimal installation of Internet Explorer 4.0 is still required on the server. If the Microsoft Exchange Server is already installed, you can install Internet Explorer 4.0 on the server and then run the Internet Mail Service (IMS) Setup Wizard to enable CDO for NTS. This configures CDO for NTS to use the SMTP services that Exchange provides. </p>
<p>
If you are installing the Microsoft Exchange Server on the same machine as IIS 4.0, Internet Explorer 4.0 should already be installed. You must also run the IMS Wizard in order to configure CDO for NTS correctly. If the IMS Wizard is not run, CDO for NTS continues to use the SMTP services provided by IIS 4.0. </p>
<p>
For proper delivery of mail, you must have the SMTP server component of IIS configured to send mail to the addresses you specify. This is done through the Domain Name System (DNS). For more information, see <i>Microsoft SMTP Service</i> in the <i>Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 Option Pack Documentation</i>. </p>
