<h2><a name="_wsh_activex_scripting_hosts"></a>ActiveX Scripting Hosts</h2>
<p>
ActiveX scripting architecture supports powerful scripting using languages such as VBScript, JScript, Perl, and others. Microsoft currently provides three hosts for running these scripting languages across the Windows platform:
<ul>
<li>
<b>Microsoft</b>®<b> Internet Explorer</b>. Internet Explorer can execute scripts on client computers from within HTML pages.</li>
<li>
<b>Internet Information Server (IIS)</b>. IIS supports Active Server Pages, so scripts can run on Web servers. In other words, IIS supports server-side scripting over the Internet or an intranet.</li>
<li>
<b>Windows Scripting Host</b>.<b> </b>Windows Scripting Host provides a low-memory scripting host so scripts can execute directly on the Windows desktop or Command Prompt window; the scripts do not need to be embedded in an HTML document. Windows Scripting Host is an ideal host for non-interactive scripts that perform logon and administrative tasks.</li>
</ul>
<p>
In addition to having a smaller footprint than the other two scripting hosts, the Windows Scripting Host does not rely on an HTML SCRIPT tag or LANGUAGE attribute to identify a scripting engine. Instead Windows Scripting Host uses the extension of the script file to determine which scripting engine to use. As a result, the script writer does not need to obtain a scripting engine ProgID. The scripting host itself maintains a mapping of script extensions to ProgIDs and uses the Windows association model to launch the appropriate engine for a given script.</p>
