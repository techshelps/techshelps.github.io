<h1><a name="_status_component"></a>Status Component</h1>
<p>
The Status component creates a <b>Status</b> object that has properties that contain server status information. Currently this server status is only available on Personal Web Server for Macintosh. </p>
<h4>File Names</h4>
<table cellspacing=4 cols=2>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=22%>status.dll</td>
<td width=78%>The Status<b> </b>component.</td>
</tr>
</table><br>
<h4>Syntax</h4>
<pre><code><b>Set </b><i>Status</i><b> = Server.CreateObject("MSWC.Status")</b>
<b> </b></code></pre>
<h4>Parameters</h4>
<dl>
<dt>
<i>Status</i></dt>
<dd>
Specifies the name of the <b>Status</b> object created by the call to <b>Server.CreateObject</b>.
</dd>
</dl>
<h4>Registry Entries</h4>
<p>
None.</p>
<h4>Remarks</h4>
<p>
Currently, the <b>Status</b> object only returns server status information for Personal Web Server for Macintosh. For all Windows platforms, the properties of the <b>Status</b> object currently all return the string 'unavailable'.</p>
<p>
The only time you may need to include a <b>Status</b> object is when you are running ASP scripts that were developed on Macintosh and use <b>Status</b> properties. </p>
<p>
<b>Note</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;The following table describes the <b>Status</b> properties as they are implemented on Macintosh.</p>
