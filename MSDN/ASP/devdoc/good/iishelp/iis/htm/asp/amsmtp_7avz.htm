<h3><a name="_denali_delete_method_cdonts_attachments_collection_"></a>Delete Method (CDONTS Attachments Collection)  <a href="amsmtp_18db.htm"><img src="../../../../../images/group.gif" border=0></a></h3>
<p>
The <b>Delete</b> method removes all the <a href="amsmtp_8hpb.htm">Attachment</a> objects from the Attachments collection. </p>
<h4>Syntax </h4>
<pre><code><i>collAttachments</i>.<b>Delete( ) </b>
 </code></pre>
<h4>Remarks </h4>
<p>
The <b>Delete</b> method performs an irreversible operation on the collection. It calls <b>Release</b> on the collection's reference to every Attachment object. If you have another reference to an attachment, you can still access its properties and methods, but you can never again associate it with any collection because the <a href="amsmtp_2vhb.htm"><b>Add</b></a> method always creates a new object. You should <b>Set</b> your reference variable either to <b>Nothing</b> or to another attachment. </p>
<p>
The final <b>Release</b> on each Attachment object takes place when you call <b>Delete</b> if you had no other reference, or when you assign your reference variable to <b>Nothing</b>. At this point the object is removed from memory. Attempted access to a released object results in an error return of <b>CdoE_INVALID_OBJECT</b>. </p>
<p>
Be cautious using the <b>Delete</b> method with a collection, because it deletes all the collection's member objects. To delete only one Attachment object, use the <a href="amsmtp_5k2n.htm"><b>Delete</b></a> method specific to that object. </p>
<p>
The effect of the <b>Delete</b> method is not permanent until you use the <a href="amsmtp_2fhb.htm"><b>Send</b></a> or <a href="amsmtp_4o2n.htm"><b>Delete</b></a> method on the <a href="amsmtp_3odb.htm">Message</a> object containing the Attachments collection. A permanently deleted member cannot be recovered. However, the collection itself is still valid, and you can <a href="amsmtp_2vhb.htm"><b>Add</b></a> new members to it. </p>
<p>
The CDO for NTS Library does not permit any modifications to messages in the Inbox, other than deleting the entire message. Prohibited modifications include adding, deleting, or modifying any attachment; adding, deleting, or modifying any recipient; and modifying any message property, even one with read/write access. </p>
