<h3><a name="_denali_delete_method_cdonts_recipients_collection_"></a>Delete Method (CDONTS Recipients Collection)  <a href="amsmtp_9zbz.htm"><img src="../../../../../images/group.gif" border=0></a></h3>
<p>
The <b>Delete</b> method removes all the <a href="amsmtp_50nz.htm">Recipient</a> objects from the Recipients collection. </p>
<h4>Syntax </h4>
<pre><code><i>collRecips</i>.<b>Delete( ) </b>
 </code></pre>
<h4>Remarks </h4>
<p>
The <b>Delete</b> method performs an irreversible operation on the collection. It calls <b>Release</b> on the collection's reference to every Recipient object. If you have another reference to a recipient, you can still access its properties and methods, but you can never again associate it with any collection because the <a href="amsmtp_8hjz.htm"><b>Add</b></a> method always creates a new object. You should <b>Set</b> your reference variable either to <b>Nothing</b> or to another recipient. </p>
<p>
The final <b>Release</b> on each Recipient object takes place when you call <b>Delete</b> if you had no other reference, or when you assign your reference variable to <b>Nothing</b>. At this point the object is removed from memory. Attempted access to a released object results in an error return of <b>CdoE_INVALID_OBJECT</b>. </p>
<p>
Be cautious using the <b>Delete</b> method with a collection, because it deletes all the collection's member objects. To delete only one Recipient object, use the <a href="amsmtp_825b.htm"><b>Delete</b></a> method specific to that object. </p>
<p>
The effect of the <b>Delete</b> method is not permanent until you use the <a href="amsmtp_2fhb.htm"><b>Send</b></a> or <a href="amsmtp_4o2n.htm"><b>Delete</b></a> method on the <a href="amsmtp_3odb.htm">Message</a> object containing the Recipients collection. A permanently deleted member cannot be recovered. However, the collection itself is still valid, and you can <a href="amsmtp_8hjz.htm"><b>Add</b></a> new members to it. </p>
<p>
The CDO for NTS Library does not permit any modifications to messages in the Inbox, other than deleting the entire message. Prohibited modifications include adding, deleting, or modifying any attachment; adding, deleting, or modifying any recipient; and modifying any message property, even one with read/write access. </p>
