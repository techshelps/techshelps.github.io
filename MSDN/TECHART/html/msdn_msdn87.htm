<h1><sup><a name="msdn_msdn87"></a></sup>Tip 87: Sending Output to the Printer in Any Order</h1>
<p>
May 15, 1995</p>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>
You can use the Visual Basic® <b>Print</b> method to send text to the default printer. This article explains how you can send data to the printer in any order (that is, you can print a line of text in the middle of the page and then print some other text at the top of page).</p>
<h2>Outputting Data to the Printer</h2>
<p>
In a Visual Basic® application, you may need to create a hard copy of some data. To send data to the default printer, you use Visual Basic's <b>Print</b> method. For example, to send a line of text to the printer, you would issue a statement such as:</p>
<pre><code>Printer.Print "This is a test"
</code></pre>
<p>
When this statement is executed, Visual Basic will print the text on the printer. Note that the text is printed at the coordinates specified by the <b>CurrentX</b> and <b>CurrentY</b> properties.</p>
<p>
Each time you send data to the printer, Visual Basic automatically updates the <b>CurrentX</b> and <b>CurrentY</b> properties. <b>CurrentX</b> is incremented each time a new character is sent to the printer on the same line. When a new line is needed, the value in <b>CurrentX</b> is reset to zero, and <b>CurrentY</b> is incremented by one to account for the new line.</p>
<p>
Therefore, as the example program below shows, you can print to any specific physical location on the paper. You can print a line of text in the center of the paper first and then, by simply changing the <b>CurrentX</b> and <b>CurrentY</b> properties, print a line of text at the top of the page.</p>
<h2>Example Program</h2>
<p>
The example program below prints two lines of text on the default printer. The first line is actually the second line to be physically transferred to the printer.
<ol>
<li>
Create a new project in Visual Basic. Form1 is created by default.<br><br></li>
<li>
Add a <b>Command Button</b> control to Form1. Command1 is created by default.<br><br></li>
<li>
Add the following code to the Click event for Command1:<pre><code>Private Sub Command1_Click()
 &nbsp;&nbsp; Printer.ScaleMode = 2
 &nbsp;&nbsp; Printer.FontSize = 42
 &nbsp;&nbsp; Printer.CurrentX = 40
 &nbsp;&nbsp; Printer.CurrentY = 40
 &nbsp;&nbsp; Printer.Print "This is the first line to be printed"
 &nbsp;&nbsp; 
 &nbsp;&nbsp; Printer.CurrentX = 40
 &nbsp;&nbsp; Printer.CurrentY = 12
 &nbsp;&nbsp; Printer.FontSize = 14
 &nbsp;&nbsp; Printer.Print "This is actually the second line to be printed"
 &nbsp;&nbsp; Printer.EndDoc
 &nbsp;&nbsp; 
End Sub
</code></pre>
</li>
</ol>
