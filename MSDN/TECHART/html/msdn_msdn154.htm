<h1><sup><a name="msdn_msdn154"></a></sup>Tip 154: Terminating Windows 95 in Visual Basic</h1>
<p>
September 5, 1995</p>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>
In a Microsoft® Visual Basic® program, you can use a Microsoft Windows® application programming interface (API) function to reboot the computer system in various ways. This article explains how to quit Windows 95 and shut down the computer system.</p>
<h2>Shutting Down the Computer System</h2>
<p>
You can use the Microsoft® Windows® application programming interface (API) <b>ExitWindowsEx</b> function to reboot a computer system from within a Microsoft Visual Basic® application. To use this function, include the following <b>Declare</b> statement in the General Declarations section of your form:</p>
<pre><code>Private Declare Function ExitWindowsEx Lib "user32" (ByVal uFlags 
 &nbsp; As Long, ByVal dwReserved As Long) As Long
</code></pre>
<p>
The <b>ExitWindowsEx</b> function takes two arguments—the shutdown operation you want performed, and a parameter that is not used. You can use one or more combinations of the following flags to tell the <b>ExitWindowsEx</b> function how you want to perform the shutdown procedure.</p>
<table border=1 cellpadding=5 cols=2 frame=below rules=rows>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=24%>EWX_FORCE</td>
<td width=76%>All processes all forced to terminate.</td>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=24%> EWX_LOGOFF</td>
<td width=76%>All processes are forced to terminate and the user is logged off.</td>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=24%>EWX_POWEROFF</td>
<td width=76%>The computer system is shut down and, if supported by the power-off feature, the computer is physically turned off.</td>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=24%>EWX_REBOOT</td>
<td width=76%>The computer system is shut down and rebooted.</td>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=24%>EWX_SHUTDOWN</td>
<td width=76%>The computer system is shut down to where it is safe to physically turn the power off.</td>
</tr>
</table><br>
<p>
In the example program below, you use a combination of three of the above flags. This flag combination (EWX_LOGOFF, EWX_FORCE, and EWX_REBOOT) tells Windows 95 to quit all currently executing processes, log the user off network connections, and leave the computer system ready for the user to turn off.</p>
<h2>Example Program</h2>
<p>
This program shows how to shut down the computer system.
<ol>
<li>
Create a new project in Visual Basic. Form1 is created by default.<br><br></li>
<li>
Add the following <b>Constant </b>and <b>Declare</b> statements to the General Declarations section of Form1 (note that the <b>Declare</b> statement must be typed as a single line of code):<pre><code>Private Declare Function ExitWindowsEx Lib "user32" (ByVal uFlags As Long,
 &nbsp; ByVal dwReserved As Long) As Long
Const EWX_LOGOFF = 0
Const EWX_SHUTDOWN = 1
Const EWX_REBOOT = 2
Const EWX_FORCE = 4
Const EWX_POWEROFF = 8
Const EWX_RESET = EWX_LOGOFF + EWX_FORCE + EWX_REBOOT
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
Add a <b>Command Button</b> control to Form1. Command1 is created by default.<br><br></li>
<li>
Add the following code to the Click event for Command1:<pre><code>Private Sub Command1_Click()
 &nbsp;&nbsp; Dim X As Long
 &nbsp;&nbsp; X = ExitWindowsEx(EWX_RESET, dwReserved)
End Sub
</code></pre>
</li>
</ol>
<p>
Run the example program by pressing f5. Click the command button to reboot the computer system.</p>
