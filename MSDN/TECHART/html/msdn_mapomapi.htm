<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>
This article consists primarily of a graphic map of the OLE Messaging Object 1.0 (<b>MAPI</b>), showing its properties, methods, and child objects. This object manipulates messages in Microsoft® Exchange and may be accessed using Visual Basic®, Visual Basic for Applications, or Visual C++™.</p>
<h2>The OLE Messaging Object</h2>
<p>
The OLE Messaging Object Library enables the developer to manipulate messages, attachments, folders, and addresses in Microsoft Exchange.</p>
<p>
The OLE Messaging object (<b>MAPI</b>) is accessible from Visual C++™ and many products that include Visual Basic® for Applications, including Microsoft® Excel version 5.0 and higher, Microsoft Access 95, Visual Basic version 4.0, Microsoft Project, and Visual C++ version 4.0. For further information on using this object, see the Win32® SDK documentation (Development Library, Product Documentation, SDKs), and search the Development Library CD. A good starting point is my article <a href="msdn_ole2soln.htm">"Using Microsoft OLE Automation Servers to Develop Solutions."</a></p>
<p class=indent>
<B><b>Note</b></B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the time of this writing (October 1995), the OLE Messaging object is still in beta testing. The object will be different when released.</p>
<p>
Figure 1 shows the relationship between objects as described by the Object Viewer and online Help files. A map is a good learning aid and a quick reference when developing an application. After producing a map, I found that it was easy to work with the object: I just post the appropriate map on my wall for quick reference, which is a lot faster than clicking objects in a Help file one by one to discover their properties and methods.</p>
<p>
Because Figure 1 is unreadable online, I have included the two most common graphics formats—encapsulated PostScript™ (.EPS) and Windows® metafile (.WMF)—as well as a copy of my original Shapeware® Visio™ version 4.0 file (.VSD). The first two formats can be printed across multiple pages using any of the commercial graphics applications—such as Adobe™ PageMaker™, Corel® Draw, or Microsoft Publisher—or using Microsoft Excel. The original Visio file is included for those who have a copy of Visio and wish to modify the diagram easily. </p>

<h3>Object Definitions</h3>
<p>
The objects and collections in Figure 1 are defined in Table 1. The objects are listed in the same sequence as they appear in the map. </p>
