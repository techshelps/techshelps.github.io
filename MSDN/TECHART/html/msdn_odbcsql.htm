<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
An Application Programming Interface (API) is a definition of the set of functions an application can use to access a system resource. ODBC is a database API based on the Call Level Interface (CLI) API definition published by the standards organizations X/Open and ISO/CAE. ODBC applications can access data in many of today's leading database management systems (DBMSs) by using ODBC drivers written to access those DBMSs. The application calls the ODBC API functions using a standard ODBC SQL syntax, then the ODBC driver makes any necessary translations to send the statement to the DBMS and presents the results back to the application.</p>
<p>
This paper describes how application programmers using the ODBC API can optimize access to Microsoft® SQL&nbsp;Server® when using the Microsoft SQL&nbsp;Server ODBC driver. The paper also discusses issues commonly raised by customers who have called Microsoft Support for help with the SQL&nbsp;Server ODBC driver. This paper is not a tutorial on ODBC programming in general, nor is it a comprehensive discussion about performance tuning on SQL&nbsp;Server. It assumes the reader is already familiar with ODBC programming and the use of SQL&nbsp;Server. For more information about ODBC, see the <i>Microsoft ODBC 2.0 Programmer's Reference and SDK Guide</i> available on MSDN and from Microsoft&nbsp;Press®, and <i>Inside ODBC</i> by Kyle&nbsp;Geiger, also available from Microsoft&nbsp;Press. For more information about SQL&nbsp;Server, see the SQL&nbsp;Server documentation.</p>
<p>
Except where noted, users should assume that this paper is discussing the operation of Microsoft SQL&nbsp;Server version 6.5 and its associated version 2.65 ODBC driver. This paper uses the ODBC version 2.5 API functions because version 2.5 is the version used by most existing applications and is also the version of the ODBC SDK that ships with Microsoft SQL&nbsp;Server Workstation version 6.5. Programmers writing ODBC 3.0 applications should refer to the <i>Microsoft ODBC 3.0 Software Development Kit and Programmer's Reference</i>.</p>
