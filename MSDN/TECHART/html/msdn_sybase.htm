<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>
Microsoft® SQL Server™ and Sybase SQL Server are similar because they were developed together until their respective 4.2 versions. This similarity provides for a unique, low-cost opportunity for Sybase sites to migrate to Microsoft SQL Server; however, proper planning is necessary for a successful migration.</p>
<p>
While Microsoft and Sybase SQL Servers have a shared past, Microsoft SQL Server offers some new and unique features. This paper discusses the new Microsoft features that are available to Sybase sites after a migration and compares the features of the recent Microsoft and Sybase versions of SQL Server. It then discusses issues that sites have encountered in past migrations from Sybase to Microsoft SQL Server and outlines the steps to take in a migration. This paper is intended for database administrators (DBAs) and managers at Sybase SQL Server sites who are considering a move to Microsoft SQL Server 6.5. It assumes the reader knows Sybase SQL Server and is primarily interested in areas that must be addressed when migrating from Sybase SQL Server to Microsoft SQL Server.</p>
<p>
This paper addresses migrating databases and differences in Transact-SQL statements and administrative procedures. Issues that affect your conversion from CT-Library applications to DB-Library, or the porting of ODBC applications from Sybase SQL Server to Microsoft SQL Server are not discussed.</p>
