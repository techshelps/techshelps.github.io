<h1><sup><a name="msdn_msdn163"></a></sup>Tip 163: Emulating a Double-Click Event in the Directory List Box Control</h1>
<p>
December 5, 1995</p>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>
This article explains how to allow the user of your Microsoft® Visual Basic® application use the enter key, instead of double-clicking with the mouse, to select a directory.</p>
<h2>Using the ENTER Key to Select Directories</h2>
<p>
The Microsoft® Visual Basic® <b>Directory List Box</b> control displays a list of all directories stored on the specified disk drive. You can select a specific directory to work with by double-clicking its entry in the control. The selected directory can then be manipulated by your Visual Basic application.</p>
<p>
You may, however, want to select a directory from the <b>Directory List Box</b> control by pressing the enter key instead of double-clicking with the mouse. This functionality can be accomplished by monitoring the KeyPress event of the <b>Directory List Box</b> control.</p>
<p>
Whenever a key is pressed on the keyboard, a KeyPress event is triggered in the control that has the focus. A special number representing that particular key is stored in the KeyPress event's <i>KeyAscii</i> variable. You can then test the <i>KeyAscii</i> variable to determine whether a specific key, such as enter, was pressed on the keyboard.</p>
<p>
In the example program below, each time a KeyPress event is triggered, the focus is set to the <b>Directory List Box</b> control. The <i>KeyAscii</i> variable is then tested to determine whether enter (represented by the number 13) was pressed. Next, a WM_LBUTTONDBLCLK (double-click) message is sent to the <b>Directory List Box</b> control by using the Microsoft Windows® application programming interface (API) <b>SendMessage</b> function. The <i>KeyAscii</i> variable is then set to a value of zero, which prevents the beep from being played on the computer's speaker. Finally, the default directory is changed to the newly selected directory.</p>
<h2>Example Program</h2>
<p>
This program shows how to emulate a double-click event in a <b>Directory List Box</b> control with the enter key.
<ol>
<li>
Create a new project in Visual Basic. Form1 is created by default.<br><br></li>
<li>
Add the following <b>Constant </b>and <b>Declare</b> statements to the General Declarations section of Form1 (note that each statement must be typed as a single line of code):<pre><code>Private Declare Function GetFocus Lib "user32" () As Long
Private Declare Function SendMessage Lib "user32" Alias "SendMessageA" 
 &nbsp; (ByVal hwnd As Long, ByVal wMsg As Long, ByVal wParam As Integer, 
 &nbsp; ByVal lParam As Long) As Long
Const WM_LBUTTONDBLCLK = &amp;H203
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
Add the following code to the Form_Load event for Form1:<pre><code>Private Sub Form_Load()
 &nbsp;&nbsp; Text1.Text = ""
 &nbsp;&nbsp; Text1.Text = CurDir$
End Sub
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
Add a <b>Text Box</b> control to Form1. Text1 is created by default.<br><br></li>
<li>
Add a <b>Directory List Box</b> control to Form1. Dir1 is created by default.<br><br></li>
<li>
Add the following code to the Dir1_KeyPress event for Dir1:<pre><code>Private Sub Dir1_KeyPress(KeyAscii As Integer)
 &nbsp;&nbsp; Dim R As Long
 &nbsp;&nbsp; Dim DirHwnd As Integer
 &nbsp;&nbsp; Dim X As String
 &nbsp;&nbsp; If KeyAscii = 13 Then
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dir1.SetFocus
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DirHwnd = GetFocus()
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; R = SendMessage(DirHwnd, WM_LBUTTONDBLCLK, 0, 0)
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; KeyAscii = 0
 &nbsp;&nbsp; End If
 &nbsp;&nbsp; X = Dir1.Path
 &nbsp;&nbsp; ChDir X
 &nbsp;&nbsp; Text1.Text = CurDir$
End Sub
</code></pre>
</li>
</ol>
<p>
Run the example program by pressing f5. The <b>Directory List Box</b> control displays a list of directories found on your hard drive. The name of the default directory appears in the <b>Text Box</b> control.</p>
<p>
Select a directory from the <b>Directory List Box</b> control by pressing the first letter of the directory name or by clicking the directory name. Press enter. The currently selected directory is now the default directory.</p>
