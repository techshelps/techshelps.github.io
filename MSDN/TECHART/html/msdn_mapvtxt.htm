<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>
This article consists primarily of a graphic map of the VoiceText 1.0 Type Library (<b>VTxtAuto</b>), showing its properties, methods, and child objects. This object allows developers to add speech capability to their applications. It is distributed as part of the Speech API Software Development Kit (SDK). Any Visual Basic®-based language and Visual C++™ can access the VoiceText 1.0 Type Library.</p>
<h2>The VoiceText 1.0 Type Library</h2>
<p>
The VoiceText 1.0 Type Library enables developers to add a speech capability to their applications. This allows an application to generate speech from text instead of from wave files.</p>
<p>
The VoiceText 1.0 Type Library (<b>VTxtAuto</b>) is accessible from Visual C++™ and from many products that contain Visual Basic® for Applications. These include Microsoft® Excel version 5.0 and higher, Microsoft Access 95, Visual Basic version 4.0, Microsoft Project, and Visual C++ version 4.0. For further information on using this object, see the Speech API SDK documentation (Development Library, Product Documentation, SDKs), and search the Development Library CD. A good starting point is my article <a href="msdn_ole2soln.htm">"Using Microsoft OLE Automation Servers to Develop Solutions."</a></p>
<p>
Figure 1 shows the relationship between objects as described by the Object Viewer and online Help files. A map is a good learning aid and a quick reference when developing an application. After producing a map, I found that it was easy to work with the object: I just post the appropriate map on my wall for quick reference, which is a lot faster than clicking objects in a Help file one by one to discover their properties and methods.</p>
<p>
Because Figure 1 is difficult to read online, I have included the two most common graphics formats—encapsulated PostScript (.EPS) and Windows® metafile (.WMF)—as well as a copy of my original Shapeware® Visio™ version 4.0 file (.VSD). The first two formats can be printed across multiple pages using any of the commercial graphics applications—such as Adobe™ PageMaker™, Corel® Draw, or Microsoft Publisher—or using Microsoft Excel. The original Visio file is included for those who have a copy of Visio and wish to modify the diagram easily. </p>
