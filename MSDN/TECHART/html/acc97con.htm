<h1>Conversion Issues in Microsoft Access 97</h1>
<p>
Microsoft Corporation</p>
<p>
Updated January 3, 1997</p>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
When you open a database in Microsoft® Access 97 that you created in Microsoft Access 1.<i>x</i>, Access 2.0, or Access 95 (7.0), in most cases, you want to convert that database to Microsoft Access 97. Although you can enable a database from an earlier version without converting it, you cannot use Microsoft Access 97 to change the design of any objects in that database, nor can you take advantage of the many new features in Microsoft Access 97 until you convert the database. </p>
<p class=indent>
<B><b>Caution</b></B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once you convert a database to Microsoft Access 97, you cannot open that database in earlier versions of Microsoft Access, and you cannot convert it back. If you plan to share your database with multiple users who are not all able to upgrade to Microsoft Access 97 at the same time, you can't convert it; you'll have to enable it. Always make a backup of your database before you convert it.</p>
<p>
Most databases created with earlier versions of Microsoft Access databases convert to Microsoft Access 97 with no difficulty. In some rare cases, however, new features can conflict with existing objects and code in the converted database. This white paper summarizes issues you may encounter when you convert your database. For supporting information about database conversion issues, search the Microsoft Access 97 Help index for "converting databases." You can also find information about conversion issues in the Acread80.wri file; search the Microsoft Access 97 Help index for "readme, Microsoft Access."</p>
<h2>Code Conversion</h2>
<h3>Microsoft Access Intrinsic Constants</h3>
<p>
Intrinsic constants in Microsoft Access 95 and Access 97 are a mix of lowercase and uppercase letters, and parts of the constant are concatenated rather than separated by underscore characters. For example, the constant <b>A_NORMAL</b> in Microsoft Access 2.0 is <b>acNormal</b> in Microsoft Access 95 and Access 97. </p>
<p>
Intrinsic constants in databases created with earlier versions of Microsoft Access will not automatically be converted to the new constant format, but old constants will continue to work without errors. However, it is recommended that you use the new format whenever you write new code.</p>
<h3>Microsoft Office for Windows 95 Automation Code</h3>
<p>
Your Microsoft Office for Windows® 95 OLE Automation code, now called simply Automation code, may require modification after you convert your database if you use code that references a specific product version. For example, the following line of code refers to Microsoft Excel version 5.0:</p>
<pre><code>Set xlObject = CreateObject("Excel.Application.5")
</code></pre>
<p>
whereas the following is a generic reference to Microsoft Excel:</p>
<pre><code>Set xlObject = CreateObject("Excel.Application")
</code></pre>
<p>
Most of the Automation code samples for Microsoft Access in the Microsoft Knowledge Base use generic object references, as does all of the code in "Your Unofficial Guide to Using OLE Automation with Microsoft Office and Microsoft BackOffice," a booklet included with Microsoft Office Professional for Windows 95. </p>
<p>
Because Microsoft Word 97 uses the Visual Basic® for Applications object model instead of the WordBasic command model used in earlier versions, you may want to modify Microsoft Access code that runs Microsoft Word using Automation, to take advantage of Visual Basic for Applications features. Microsoft Word 97 still provides WordBasic compatibility, so Automation code written for earlier versions of Microsoft Word will work properly, but converting Automation code to use the new Visual Basic for Applications model is recommended. </p>
<h3>Wizard-Generated Code</h3>
<p>
Access Basic or Visual Basic code in your database that was generated by a Microsoft Access Wizard may need to be modified when you convert your database. Some of the code created by wizards in Microsoft Access 2.0 and Access 95 (7.0) references specific functions in the Utility.mda or Wzmain70.mda library databases. For example, if you created a database in Microsoft Access 95 using the Database Wizard and one of the database templates, the wizard&nbsp; generated the following code to invoke the SwitchBoard Manager from the SwitchBoard form:</p>
<pre><code>Application.Run "WZMAIN70.sbm_Entry"
</code></pre>
<p>
This code fails in Microsoft Access 97 because the new wizard file name is WZMain80.mde. In Microsoft Access 97, the code is:</p>
<pre><code>Application.Run "WZMAIN80.sbm_Entry"
</code></pre>
<p>
The Command Button Wizard in Microsoft Access 2.0 and 95 generates some code that does not work in Microsoft Access 97, specifically any command buttons that create code to run other Microsoft Office applications. Remove these buttons in your converted database and recreate them using the Microsoft Access 97 Command Button Wizard.</p>
<h3>DoCmd Statement</h3>
<p>
The <b>DoCmd</b> statement in Microsoft Access 2.0 becomes the <b>DoCmd</b> object in Microsoft Access 95 and Access 97, which requires slightly different syntax. The following Access Basic code in Microsoft Access 2.0:</p>
<pre><code>DoCmd OpenForm "MyForm"
</code></pre>
<p>
becomes the following Visual Basic method of the <b>DoCmd</b> object in Microsoft Access 95 and Access 97:</p>
<pre><code>DoCmd.OpenForm "MyForm"
</code></pre>
<p>
In some cases, Microsoft Access 97 may fail to convert Microsoft Access 2.0 <b>DoCmd</b><i>&lt;space&gt;Action</i> to the proper <b>DoCmd</b><i>&lt;dot&gt;Method</i> syntax used in Microsoft Access 95 and Access 97. When that happens, you receive code compilation error messages in the converted database, which are easily corrected by removing the space and adding the dot (.) in the <b>DoCmd</b> portion of your code.</p>
<p class=indent>
<B><b>Note</b></B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DoCmd DoMenuItem (or DoCmd.DoMenuItem in Microsoft Access 95) actions in code are not automatically converted to the Microsoft Access 97 RunCommand syntax, but the DoMenuItem syntax works correctly in Microsoft Access 97. </p>
<p class=indent>
However, DoMenuItem macro actions are automatically converted to their equivalent RunCommand actions when you open a macro in the Macro window. A few DoMenuItem macro actions do not have equivalent RunCommand actions in Microsoft Access 97. Those actions are documented in Microsoft Access 97 Help. For more information, search the Microsoft Access 97 Help index for "RunCommand action."</p>
<h3>SendKeys Statement and Macro Action</h3>
<p>
Because some menu items and the structure of the menu tree are different in Microsoft Access 97 from in earlier versions, your <b>SendKeys</b> statements in code or SendKeys actions in a macro may fail or may not produce the desired action. Locate the new menu items in Microsoft Access 97 and modify your <b>SendKeys</b> code or macros to send the correct keys. New features in Microsoft Access 97 may make some of your old SendKeys actions obsolete or unnecessary.</p>
<h3>ObjectName.FieldName Legacy Syntax</h3>
<p>
If you convert a Microsoft Access 2.0 database that uses <i>ObjectName.FieldName</i> data access objects (DAO) syntax in Access Basic,&nbsp; the database converts properly. However, in order to maintain backward compatibility with your DAO syntax, the converted database contains a reference to the Microsoft DAO 2.5/3.5 Compatibility Library instead of the new Microsoft DAO 3.5 Object Library. </p>
<p>
For example, the following code is acceptable in Microsoft Access 2.0:</p>
<pre><code>Dim db As Database
Dim rs As Recordset
Set db = CurrentDB()
Set rs = db.OpenRecordset("Customers")
Debug.Print rs.[Customer ID]
</code></pre>
<p>
The same code in Microsoft Access 95 and Access 97 requires an exclamation point (!) in front of the [Customer ID] field:</p>
<pre><code>Dim db As Database
Dim rs As Recordset
Set db = CurrentDB()
Set rs = db.OpenRecordset("Customers")
Debug.Print rs![CustomerID]
</code></pre>
<p>
If you change the reference in your database from Microsoft DAO 2.5/3.5 Compatibility Library to the Microsoft DAO 3.5 Object Library, you must also update any <i>ObjectName.FieldName</i> syntax to <i>ObjectName!FieldName</i> syntax in your code; otherwise, compilation errors will occur.</p>
<h3>Conflicts with Reserved Words</h3>
<p>
In Microsoft Access 97, module names cannot be any of the following reserved words:</p>
<p class=indent>
Application<br>
Assistant<br>
CommandBars<br>
DoCmd<br>
Forms<br>
Modules<br>
References<br>
Reports<br>
Screen</p>
<p>
If you attempt to convert a Microsoft Access 2.0 or Access 95 (7.0) database containing a module that has one of these names, the conversion fails with a message indicating that the module name is invalid. To correct the error, open the database in the original version of Microsoft Access, rename the module, and then convert the database again.</p>
<h3>Standard Module/Class Module Name Conflicts</h3>
<p>
In Microsoft Access 95 and Access 97, form and report class modules share the same namespace with standard code modules. For example, if you have a form named <b>Form1,</b> Visual Basic for Applications creates a class module named <b>Form_Form1,</b> which means you cannot have a standard code module named <b>Form_Form1.</b> </p>
<p>
If you attempt to convert a Microsoft Access 2.0 database with a standard code module name that conflicts with a class module name, the conversion fails with a message indicating that the module name is invalid. To correct the error, open the database in the original version of Microsoft Access, rename the standard module, and then convert the database again.</p>
<h3>Module Name/Procedure Name Conflicts</h3>
<p>
If your Microsoft Access 2.0 database contains a procedure and a module with the same name, the procedure fails in Microsoft Access 95 and Access 97 with the error message "Expected variable or procedure, not module."</p>
<p>
You can resolve this error in one of two ways. You can change the name of the module so that it does not conflict with any procedure names, or you can make changes in your converted database to call the procedure using <i>ModuleName.ProcedureName</i> syntax.</p>
<h3>New Error Codes in Microsoft Access 97</h3>
<p>
Some error codes have changed in Microsoft Access 97, and this may have an impact on a converted database that uses extensive error trapping. For example, when you reference the <b>PaletteSource</b> property of a text box that does not exist, Microsoft Access 95 returns the error message "2455, Application-defined or object-defined error," whereas Microsoft Access 97 returns the error message "438, Object doesn't support this property or method."</p>
<p>
Therefore, error-trapping routines that check for specific error codes must be tested in converted databases to ensure that the error codes have not changed. </p>
<p>
Also, certain actions in Microsoft Access 95 code do not generate a run-time error, but they do in Microsoft Access 97. For example, if your code sets the value of a form control's <b>Text</b> property to <b>Null</b>, no error occurs in Microsoft Access 95, but Microsoft Access 97 generates the error message "Run-time error 13, Type Mismatch," because of more stringent control property type checking.</p>
<p>
This issue is documented in the Acread80.wri file; search the Microsoft Access 97 Help index for "readme, Microsoft Access." </p>
<p>
<b>Examples of Error Code Changes</b></p>
<p>
<b>Microsoft Access tries to read a nonexistent control property:</b></p>
<p>
Code sample:&nbsp; Debug.Print Forms!Form1!Text0.Bogus</p>
<p>
Microsoft Access 95 error message: <br>
"2455, Application-defined or object-defined error."</p>
<p>
Microsoft Access 97 error message:<br>
"438, Object doesn't support this property or method."</p>
<p>
<b>You try to set a control property that requires a Long Integer to a Null value:</b></p>
<p>
Code sample:&nbsp; Forms!Form1!Text0.BorderColor = Null</p>
<p>
Microsoft Access 95 error message:<br>
(No error occurs)</p>
<p>
Microsoft Access 97 error message:<br>
"13, Type mismatch."</p>
<p>
<b>You try to set a control's Text property to a Null value:</b></p>
<p>
Code sample:&nbsp; Forms!Form1!Text0.Text = Null</p>
<p>
Microsoft Access 95 error message:<br>
(No error occurs)</p>
<p>
Microsoft Access 97 error message:<br>
"13, Type mismatch."</p>
<p>
<b>You try to set a value for a nonexistent control property:</b></p>
<p>
Code sample:&nbsp; Forms!Form1!Text0.Bogus = "Hello"</p>
<p>
Microsoft Access 95 error message:<br>
"2455, Application-defined or object-defined error."</p>
<p>
Microsoft Access 97 error message:<br>
"438, Object doesn't support this property or method."</p>
<p>
<b>You try to set a control property to a value that's outside the range of allowable settings:</b></p>
<p>
Code sample: Forms!Form1!Text0.Left = 1239992139</p>
<p>
Microsoft Access 95 error message:<br>
"2113, The value you entered isn't valid for the DataType or FieldSize…"</p>
<p>
Microsoft Access 97 error message:<br>
"6, Overflow"</p>
<h3>Code with Line-Continuation Characters</h3>
<p>
In rare cases, Microsoft Access 95 Visual Basic code that uses an underline (_) as a line-continuation character may not compile properly after it is converted. This is because of changes in the module window line-continuation algorithm in Microsoft Access 97.</p>
<p>
Any code that does not convert properly because of misplaced line-continuation characters causes a compilation error. The error is easily corrected by removing or relocating the line-continuation character in your code<i>. </i>This information is documented in the Acread80.wri file; search the Microsoft Access 97 Help index for "readme, Microsoft Access."</p>
<h3>Database with Many Objects Increases in Size</h3>
<p>
Microsoft Access 95 and Access 97 databases store form, report, and standard module objects differently than earlier versions. When you convert a Microsoft Access 2.0 database with many forms, reports, or modules, the Microsoft Access 97 database may increase dramatically in size. </p>
<p>
Microsoft Access 97 introduces lightweight objects, which are forms or reports that do not have class modules associated with them. If a form or report in your previous-version database does not contain any code, Microsoft Access 97 changes it to a lightweight object when you convert the database. This helps to minimize the increase in size of a converted database. </p>
<p>
You can also reduce the size of your database by converting it to an MDE file, which is a database from which all source code has been removed, and only compiled executable code remains.</p>
<h3>dbFailOnError Behavior in Microsoft Access 97</h3>
<p>
Using the <b>dbFailOnError</b> option in Microsoft Access 95 (or <b>DB_FAILONERROR</b> in version 2.0) with the <b>Execute</b> method of a <b>QueryDef</b> object automatically places an action query inside a transaction. This causes the entire operation to roll back if any errors occur during the processing of the query. </p>
<p>
In Microsoft Access 97, the <b>dbFailOnError</b> option does not automatically place the action query in a transaction, so all changes up to the failed record will not roll back automatically if the query fails. You must review all code that uses the <b>Execute</b> method with the <b>dbFailOnError</b> option in Microsoft Access 97, and use explicit transactions if necessary. More information is available in the Acread80.wri file; search the Microsoft Access 97 Help index for "readme, Microsoft Access."</p>
<h3>Databases with Many Modules</h3>
<p>
When you convert a Microsoft Access 2.0 database with a large number of forms, reports, and modules, conversion may fail with either the error message "Can't create any more class modules" or the message "Out of memory."</p>
<p>
Both Microsoft Access 95 and Access 97 have a limit of 1,024 Visual Basic for Applications modules. The use of lightweight forms and reports in Microsoft Access 97 greatly reduces the impact of this limitation. </p>
<p>
If your database fails to convert because it has too many objects, reduce the number of objects in your database. Consider dividing your application into multiple databases or using library databases to store your code.</p>
<h2>Toolbar and Menu Bar Conversion</h2>
<h3>Macro-Defined System Menus</h3>
<p>
In Microsoft Access 2.0 and Access 95 (7.0), all user-defined menus are created using macros to define the menu bars and menu items. In Microsoft Access 97, menu bars, toolbars, and shortcut menus are all part of the <b>CommandBars</b> collection of objects in Visual Basic for Applications. </p>
<p>
When you convert a database that contains macro-defined custom menus, the menus work as they did before, but the conversion process does not automatically convert your macro-defined menus to the <b>CommandBar</b> object model. To convert a macro-defined custom menu to a command bar after you convert your database, select the macro in the <b>Database</b> window, and then click <b>Macro</b> on the <b>Tools</b> menu. Then click <b>Create Menu From Macro</b>, <b>Create Toolbar From Macro</b>, or <b>Create Shortcut Menu From Macro</b>. </p>
<h3>Converted Toolbars Lose Button Images</h3>
<p>
After you convert a database in Microsoft Access 97, some custom toolbar buttons may appear blank because there is no equivalent image in the new version. The Exit door in Microsoft Access 95 is one example of an image that has changed. You can replace the missing image with one that is available in Microsoft Access 97, or you can use an icon editor to recreate the old button image to use in your database.</p>
<p>
On a form, command button images do not change because they are stored in the <b>Picture</b> property of the control. </p>
<h2>Conversion from 16-Bit to 32-Bit</h2>
<h3>16-Bit and 32-Bit ActiveX Controls (OLE Custom Controls)</h3>
<p>
When you convert a database that uses 16-bit ActiveX™ controls designed for Microsoft Access 2.0, Microsoft Access 97 does not convert those controls to their new 32-bit equivalents. You must manually insert an equivalent 32-bit ActiveX control and recreate its event procedures after you convert the database.</p>
<p>
When you convert a database that contains 32-bit ActiveX controls designed for Microsoft Access 95 (version 7.0), those controls convert to Microsoft Access 97 on a computer that has the Microsoft Access 95 controls properly registered. For example, the Microsoft Access 95 Calendar control on a form is replaced by the Microsoft Access 97 Calendar control during conversion. </p>
<p>
The 32-bit Data Outline control included with Microsoft Access Developer's Toolkit for Windows 95 is not updated to a new version when you convert your database. A Microsoft Access 97 version of the Data Outline control will be available for download from Microsoft's Internet site after Microsoft Office 97, Developer Edition is released.</p>
<h3>16-Bit and 32-Bit API Calls</h3>
<p>
If your Microsoft Access 1.<i>x </i>or 2.0 database uses Windows application programming interface (API) procedures, you must manually update them to their 32-bit API equivalents after you convert the database.</p>
<p>
You can find references to the correct syntax for most 32-bit API calls in the Win32api.txt file or the Windows API Viewer included with Microsoft Access Developer's Toolkit for Windows 95 and Microsoft Office 97, Developer Edition.</p>
<p>
Converting a Microsoft Access 95 database that already uses 32-bit API calls should not present any conversion issues in Microsoft Access 97. </p>
<h3>16-Bit ODBC Data Sources</h3>
<p>
If a table in your Microsoft Access 1.<i>x</i> or Access 2.0 database uses a 16-bit driver to link to an ODBC data source, you may receive the error message "ODBC - connection to <i>DataSourceName</i> failed" when you open the table, or when you open a form or report based on that table.</p>
<p>
To resolve this error, create an identically named data source using a 32-bit version of the ODBC driver.</p>
<h2>Add-in Library and Type Library Conversion</h2>
<h3>Microsoft Access Library Database References</h3>
<p>
If your database uses add-ins or library databases created in an earlier version of Microsoft Access, you must convert them in order to use them.</p>
<p>
In Microsoft Access 1.<i>x</i> and Access 2.0, you can create circular library references. For example, you can create a reference from Library A to Library B and a reference from Library B to Library A. Circular references are not allowed in Microsoft Access 95 and Access 97.</p>
<h3>Object Library or Type Library References</h3>
<p>
Converting a database with references to object libraries or type libraries retains those references as long as the referenced libraries exist on the computer when the database is converted. </p>
<p>
Microsoft Access default references—Visual Basic® for Applications, Microsoft Access for Windows 95, Microsoft Jet SQL Help Topics, and Microsoft DAO 2.5/3.0 or Microsoft DAO 3.0 Library—are automatically converted to their Microsoft Access 97 equivalents when you convert a database, as are most references to Microsoft Office 95 component libraries. For example, a reference to the Microsoft Graph 5.0 Object Library, Gren50.olb, is automatically updated to the Microsoft Graph 97 Object Library, Graph8.olb, when you convert your database.</p>
<p>
The Microsoft Jet SQL Help Topics reference created when you install the Microsoft Access Developer's Toolkit for Windows 95 is automatically removed during conversion if the library is not found on your hard drive. If any other referenced library file (.OLB or .TLB file) is not on your computer hard drive when you convert a database, compilation errors may occur during conversion because of the missing references. </p>
<h3>Converting Add-in Databases</h3>
<p>
When a Microsoft Access 2.0 add-in database is converted to Microsoft Access 95 or Access 97, and then you attempt to activate the add-in using the Add-in Manager, you may receive the error message "The add-in could not be installed because it is missing a USysRegInfo table."</p>
<p>
For information about creating a USysRegInfo table, see Chapter 17, "Creating Wizards, Builders, and Menu Add-ins," in <i>Building Applications with Microsoft Access 97</i>, or see article Q153858 in the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/kb/">Microsoft Knowledge Base</a> (http://www.microsoft.com/kb/).</p>
<p>
The Internet Assistant 95 Add-in will not install as an add-in if you convert it to Microsoft Access 97; however, in Microsoft Access 97, most of the functionality of the Internet Assistant is built into the product.</p>
<h2>Form and Report Conversion</h2>
<h3>Report Margins Adjust to Default Print Region</h3>
<p>
When you convert a Microsoft Access 2.0 database to Microsoft Access 95 or Access 97, all print margins are modified to remain within the default print region defined by the printer driver on your computer.</p>
<p>
If a report in your Microsoft Access 2.0 database has its top, bottom, left, or right margin set to zero inches, after you convert the database, you may see those margins changed to the minimum default margin defined by your printer driver.</p>
<h3>Forms or Reports with Many Controls</h3>
<p>
When you convert a Microsoft Access 2.0 or Access 95 (7.0) database that contains a form or report with a large number of controls, the conversion may fail with the error message "The form or report <i>ObjectName</i> has too many controls."</p>
<p>
Open the database in the original version of Microsoft Access, reduce the number of controls on the form or report, and then convert the database again. Visual Basic for Applications v-table binding limits the total number of controls plus fields plus sections on a form or report to 754. This limit does not exist in Microsoft Access 2.0 or Access 95 (7.0).</p>
<h3>ForceNewPage Property in Group Section</h3>
<p>
In Microsoft Access 2.0 and Access 95 (7.0), if you set the <b>ForceNewPage</b> property to <b>Before Section</b> in a Group Header section on a report, the setting does not force a page break before the first group section. </p>
<p>
In Microsoft Access 97, setting the <b>ForceNewPage</b> property to <b>Before Section</b> forces a page break before every section, including the first group section encountered in the report.</p>
<h3>Conversion Fails Without Default Printer</h3>
<p>
If you attempt to convert a Microsoft Access 2.0 database that contains form or report objects, and your computer does not have a default printer installed, you receive the error message "You must set a default printer before you design, print, or preview," and the database fails to convert.</p>
<p>
Note that this is not an issue when you convert a Microsoft Access 95 database. To resolve the error, set up a default printer on your computer and then convert the database again.</p>
<h2>Query Conversion</h2>
<h3>Queries with Date Criteria Between 1900 and 1929</h3>
<p>
If you use a literal date specifying the years 1900 through 1929 as part of your criteria in a Microsoft Access 2.0 or Access 95 (7.0) query, the query may return different results after you convert the database to Microsoft Access 97. This happens because new interpretation of year dates ending in the digits 00 through 29 places them in the twenty-first century.</p>
<p>
For example, a literal date criteria of <b>#01/01/15</b># in Microsoft Access 2.0 and Access 95 represents January 1, 1915; the same date criteria in Microsoft Access 97 represents January 1, 2015. To work around this difference, modify the data by using the specific four-digit year in your criteria (for example, <b>#01/01/1915#)</b>.</p>
<h3>MaxLocksPerFile Setting Restricts Transaction Size</h3>
<p>
In Microsoft Access 97, action queries can be restricted by a <b>MaxLocksPerFile</b> setting in the Windows registry, which limits the number of page locks allowed in a transaction. If the number of page locks in a transaction attempts to exceed the <b>MaxLocksPerFile</b> value, then the action is split into two or more transactions and the completed portion of the query is committed. </p>
<p>
This setting was added to Microsoft Access 97 to prevent Novell NetWare 3.1 server crashes when the specified NetWare lock limit is exceeded and to improve performance with both Novell NetWare and Microsoft Windows NT® networks. The default <b>MaxLocksPerFile</b> setting is 9500, but you can dynamically configure this setting in code using the <b>DBEngine.SetOption</b> method, so you are not forced to change registry settings in order to run large action queries within transactions. </p>
<p>
If you exceed the <b>MaxLocksPerFile</b> setting when you are running an action query, you may receive the error message "There isn't enough disk space or memory to undo the data changes this action query is about to take."</p>
<p>
You can continue with the action query, but you will not be able to undo the action.</p>
<h2>Converting Secured Databases</h2>
<p>
Converting a secured Microsoft Access 2.0 or Access 95 (version 7.0) database in Microsoft Access 97 requires additional steps and consideration. Microsoft Access 97 Help provides detailed information on this topic. For more information, search the Microsoft Access 97 Help index for "converting databases."</p>
<p>
Multiple versions of Microsoft Access can share the same workgroup information file (System.mda or System.mdw) as long as the workgroup information database remains in the oldest-version format.</p>
<p>
Converting a Microsoft Access 95 database that only uses a database password is a simple process. When you convert the database, you must type the database password twice. After you convert the database, the database password works exactly as it did in Microsoft Access 95.</p>
<h2>Converting Replicated Databases</h2>
<p>
When you convert a Microsoft Access 95 Design Master database, it triggers conversion of the other databases in the replica set. When you synchronize a replica with the converted Design Master, the replica is automatically converted to Microsoft Access 97.</p>
<p>
You cannot mix database versions in a set of replicated databases, so be sure all replica users upgrade to Microsoft Access 97 before you convert the Design Master. It is possible to enable a replicated Microsoft Access 95 database to use in Microsoft Access 97; however, the replica set remains unconverted, and you must use Microsoft Access 95 to synchronize members of the replica set.</p>
<p>
Microsoft Access 97 Help documents a method to convert a replica set from Microsoft Access 95 and describes a procedure to test a temporary replica set before you convert the original. For more information, search the Microsoft Access 97 Help index for "converting replicas."</p>
<h2>Conversion and the Windows Registry</h2>
<h3>INFPath Registry Setting for Xbase ISAM Drivers</h3>
<p>
When you link (attach) to dBASE or Microsoft FoxPro® tables, Microsoft Access looks for, and if necessary creates, an information (.INF) file in the same folder as the linked table. If the table is located on read-only media, then Microsoft Access uses the alternate path specified in the <b>INFPath</b> registry setting as the location to create the .INF file.</p>
<p>
Microsoft Access 95 and Access 97 do not use the <b>INFPath</b> setting as they should. You can work around this problem by including the proper .INF file when you distribute your database on read-only media so that Microsoft Access does not have to create one.</p>
<h3>Tables with Many Indexes or Relationships</h3>
<p>
In Microsoft Access 95 and Access 97, a single table cannot have more than 32 indexes and direct relationships combined. In Microsoft Access 2.0, a table can have up to 32 indexes and a virtually unlimited number of relationships. </p>
<p>
When you convert a Microsoft Access 2.0 database containing a table with more than 32 combined indexes and relationships, conversion fails with a message indicating that the limit was exceeded. Open the database in Microsoft Access 2.0, reduce the number of indexes or relationships, and then convert the database again.</p>
