<h1><sup><a name="msdn_msdn49"></a></sup>Tip 49: Centering Forms</h1>
<p>
Created: April 10, 1995</p>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>
To make your Visual Basic® applications more visually attractive, you can center each form on your screen. Centering forms can be done by using the <b>Height</b> and <b>Width</b> properties of the form and then using the <b>Move</b> method to position the form at its new location on the screen.</p>
<h2>Centering a Form on the Screen</h2>
<p>
To center a Visual Basic® form on the screen at run time is very simple. The <b>Screen</b> object can tell you the width and height of a specific form, the <b>Height</b> property reports the height of a form or control, and the <b>Width</b> property reports the width of a form or control.</p>
<p>
If you subtract the form's height from the screen's height and divide the result by 2, you can center the form vertically on the screen. Likewise, subtracting the form's width from the screen's width and dividing the result by 2 gives you the position needed to center the form vertically on the screen. It is then a simple matter of executing the <b>Move</b> method to actually center the form on the display screen.</p>
<h2>Example Program</h2>
<p>
The following program shows how you can center a form in your Visual Basic application.
<ol>
<li>
Create a new project in Visual Basic. Form1 is created by default.<br><br></li>
<li>
Add the following code to the Form_Load event for Form1:<pre><code>Sub Form_Load()
  Dim TopCorner As Integer
  Dim LeftCorner As Integer
 &nbsp;&nbsp; 
  If Form1.WindowState &lt;&gt; 0 Then Exit Sub
 &nbsp;&nbsp; 
  TopCorner = (Screen.Height - Form1.Height) \ 2
  LeftCorner = (Screen.Width - Form1.Width) \ 2
  Form1.Move LeftCorner, TopCorner
 &nbsp;&nbsp; 
End Sub
</code></pre>
</li>
</ol>
</BODY>
