<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>
This article consists primarily of a graphic map of the Microsoft® Binder Object Library (<b>OfficeBinder</b>) showing its properties, methods, and child object. This object allows different documents to be bound together in a binder. Any Visual Basic®-based language (Access Basic, Visual Basic, and Visual Basic for Applications) and Visual C can access the OfficeBinder object.</p>
<h2>The OfficeBinder Object</h2>
<p>
The Microsoft® Binder Object Library enables the developer to manipulate the binder, which is a container for multiple documents. The binder is part of Microsoft Office 95.</p>
<p>
The Office Binder object (<b>OfficeBinder</b>) is accessible from Visual C and from many Visual Basic for Application–based products. These include Microsoft Excel version 5.0 and higher, Microsoft Access 95, Visual Basic® version 4.0, Microsoft Project, and Visual C++™ version 4.0. For further information on using this object, see the Microsoft Office product documentation and search the Development Library CD. A good starting point is my article <a href="msdn_ole2soln.htm">"Using Microsoft OLE Automation Servers to Develop Solutions."</a></p>
<p>
Figure 1 (below) shows the relationship between objects as described by the Object Browser built into Visual Basic for Applications and online Help files for Microsoft Office. A map is a good learning aid and a quick reference when developing an application. After producing a map, I found that it was easy to work with the object: I just post the appropriate map on my wall for quick reference, which is a lot faster than clicking objects in a Help file one by one to discover their properties and methods.</p>
<p>
I have included the two most common graphics formats—encapsulated PostScript™ (.EPS) and Windows® metafile (.WMF)—as well as a copy of my original Shapeware® Visio™ version 4.0 file (.VSD). The first two formats can be printed across multiple pages using any of the commercial graphics applications—such as Adobe™ PageMaker™, Corel® Draw, or Microsoft Publisher—or using Microsoft Excel. The original Visio file is included for those who have a copy of Visio and wish to modify the diagram easily.</p>
