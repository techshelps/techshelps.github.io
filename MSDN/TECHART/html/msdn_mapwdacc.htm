<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>
This article consists primarily of a graphic map of the "Word95 Objects for ACCESS" object (<b>Word95Access</b>), showing its properties, methods, and child objects. This object allows a mail merge in Microsoft® Word to be done using Microsoft Access, Visual Basic®, Visual Basic for Applications, or Visual C++™. </p>
<h2>The "Word95 Objects for ACCESS"</h2>
<p>
The "Word95 Objects for ACCESS" enables the developer to manipulate Microsoft® Word mail merge facilities. This object is a subset of the Microsoft WordBasic 95 type library and contains only one object, despite the name claiming to have multiple objects.</p>
<p>
The "Word95 Objects for ACCESS" (<b>Word95Access</b>) is accessible from Visual C++™ and many products containing Visual Basic® for Applications. These include Microsoft Excel version 5.0 and higher, Microsoft Access 95, Visual Basic version 4.0, Microsoft Project, and Visual C++ version 4.0. For further information on using this object, see <i>Building Applications with Microsoft Access for Windows 95</i> (Development Library, Product Documentation, Applications), and search the Development Library CD. A good starting point is my article "<a href="msdn_ole2soln.htm">Using Microsoft OLE Servers to Develop Solutions."</a></p>
<p>
Figure 1 shows the relationship between objects as described by the Object Viewer and online Help files. A map is a good learning aid and a quick reference when developing an application. After producing a map, I found that it was easy to work with the object: I just post the appropriate map on my wall for quick reference, which is a lot faster than clicking objects in a Help file one by one to discover their properties and methods.</p>
<p>
Because Figure 1 is difficult to read online, I have included the two most common graphics formats—encapsulated PostScript™ (.EPS) and Windows® metafile (.WMF)—as well as a copy of my original Shapeware® Visio® version 4.0 file (.VSD). The first two formats can be printed across multiple pages using any of the commercial graphics applications—such as Adobe™ PageMaker™, Corel® Draw, or Microsoft Publisher—or using Microsoft Excel. The original Visio file is included for those who have a copy of Visio and wish to modify the diagram easily. </p>
