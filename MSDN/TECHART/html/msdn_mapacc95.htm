<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>
This article presents a graphic map of the Microsoft® Access 95 object, showing its properties, methods, and child objects. This server is available in Visual C++® and many products based on Visual Basic® for Applications. These products include Microsoft Excel version 5.0 and later, Microsoft Access 95, Visual Basic version 4.0, and Visual C++ version 4.0.</p>
<h2>The Microsoft Access 95 Object</h2>
<p>
Microsoft® Access 95 uses the Data Access Object (DAO) to retrieve data from database servers by means of the Open Database Connectivity (ODBC) driver manager and a specified server driver. This extended map is not comprehensive: each major component of the Microsoft Access object (for example, DAO and controls) is described as a separate extended map. See the bibliography for a list of available extended maps.</p>
<p>
The DAO<b> </b>objects in Microsoft Access should not be used by controllers. DAO used directly is an in-process OLE Automation server resulting in high-performance data transfer. DAO used by Microsoft Access is an out-of-process OLE Automation server resulting in slow data transfer. Controllers should use DAO directly to gain the advantages of an in-process, early binding OLE Automation server. </p>
<p>
Figure 1 shows the relationship between objects as described by the Object Viewer and online Help files. A map serves as a good learning aid and as a quick reference for developers. After producing a map, I found that it was easy to work with the object: I just post the appropriate map on my wall for quick reference, which is a lot faster than clicking objects in a Help file one by one to discover their properties and methods. For an introduction to using OLE Automation see my article, "Using Microsoft OLE Servers to Develop Solutions."</p>
<p>
Because Figure 1 is unreadable online, I have included the two most common graphics formats—encapsulated PostScript™ (.EPS) and Windows® metafile (.WMF)—as well as a copy of my original ShapeWare™ Visio™ version 4.0 file (.VSD). The first two formats can be opened and the maps printed across multiple pages using Microsoft Excel or a commercial graphics application such as Adobe™ PageMaker™, CorelDRAW®, or Microsoft Publisher. The original Visio file is included for those who wish to modify the diagram.</p>
