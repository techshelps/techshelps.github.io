<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>
This article presents a graphic map of the Microsoft® Visual Basic® object (<b>VB 4.0</b>), showing its properties, methods, and objects. This map represents the Visual Basic application, excluding controls. </p>
<h2>The Microsoft Visual Basic 4.0 Object</h2>
<p>
The Microsoft® Visual Basic® object (<b>VB 4.0</b>) is the OLE Automation object that is the core of Visual Basic applications. This object is private, although technically it can be made public and exposed by an application. No element of this object should <i>ever</i> be made public in a production or distributed system. Visual Basic is composed of several OLE Automation servers, of which this is one. The other components are controls, the Visual Basic for Applications object library, and the Standard OLE Types object library. Extended maps for the latter two appear in articles listed in the bibliography.</p>
<p>
Figure 1 shows the relationship between objects as described by the Object Browser in Visual Basic. A map serves as a good learning aid and a quick reference for developers. After producing a map, I found that it was easy to work with the objects: I just post the three appropriate extended maps for Visual Basic on my wall for quick reference, which is a lot faster than clicking objects in a Help file one by one to discover their properties and methods.</p>
<p>
I have included the two most common graphics formats—encapsulated PostScript™ (.EPS) and Windows® metafile (.WMF)—as well as a copy of my original ShapeWare™ Visio™ version 4.0 file (.VSD). The first two formats can be opened and the maps printed across multiple pages using Microsoft Excel or a commercial graphics application such as Adobe™ PageMaker™, CorelDRAW™, or Microsoft Publisher. The original Visio file is included for those who wish to modify the diagram.</p>

<b>Figure 1. Map of the Microsoft Visual Basic 4.0 object </b></p>
<p>
This map excludes all of the form controls built into Visual Basic. These controls and OCX-based controls will be covered in an upcoming series of maps on controls. The Visual Basic type library (VB32.OLB) is slightly different from the map because some collections are omitted in it.</p>
<h3>Object Definitions</h3>
<p>
The objects in Figure 1 are defined in Table 1. The objects are listed in the same sequence as they appear on the map. </p>
