<i>Bruce McKinney was a factory assembly worker, a logger, a newspaper reporter, a PR flunky, and an unpublished fiction writer before he discovered computers and lost all interest in the real world. During his 10 years at Microsoft, he has written programming manuals and online help for assembly language, Basic, and C. Bruce also served for a time as czar of sample programs, writing or revising many of the samples known to long-time Microsoft language customers. He was a software developer on two Microsoft products:&nbsp; C7 and the FORTRAN compiler. He holds a journalism degree from the University of Washington and a computer science degree from the University of Hard Knocks. Bruce is author of Hardcore Visual Basic (Microsoft Press, 1995). He can be reached at brucem_MS@msn.com. The Web site for his book is: http://www.microsoft.com/mspress/brucem/hardcore.htm. </i></p>
