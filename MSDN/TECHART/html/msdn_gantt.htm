<h2>Introduction </h2>
<p>
Microsoft has gathered the best practices for planning, building, and managing distributed computing from its developers and consultants, technology partners, and customers. The result is Microsoft Solutions Framework (MSF). The Gantt Chart Builder is an application that implements the software project management principles in MSF. MSF advocates forming “a team of peers”, the sharing of project management responsibilities among the six team roles (product management, program management, development, testing, user education, and logistics planning) and a versioned-release, milestone-driven approach to solution development and deployment. Using the Gantt Chart Builder, program management (or project management) can gain a global view of the project easily, while control and accountability are maintained at the team level to assure maximum flexibility.</p>
