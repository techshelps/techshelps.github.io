<h1><sup><a name="msdn_msdn202"></a></sup>Tip 202: Forcing a Combo Box Control to Drop Down with the ENTER Key</h1>
<p>
February 28, 1996</p>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>
This article explains how to force a <b>Combo Box</b> control to drop down its list box when the enter key is pressed in a Microsoft® Visual Basic® application.</p>
<h2>Monitoring the KeyPress Event</h2>
<p>
The Microsoft® Visual Basic® <b>Combo Box</b> control lets your user select from its list box or optionally add a new item to the list box. A <b>Combo Box</b> control has three possible styles—<b>Dropdown Combo</b>, <b>Simple Combo</b>, and <b>Dropdown List</b>.</p>
<p>
The <b>Dropdown Combo </b>style of the <b>Combo Box</b> control is displayed with the arrow and text box portion of the control slightly separated. You must click the down arrow to select items from the <b>Combo Box</b> control.</p>
<p>
The <b>Simple Combo</b> style of the <b>Combo Box</b> control displays its list box immediately. The disadvantage of this style is that it takes up more space in your window.</p>
<p>
The <b>Dropdown List</b> style of the <b>Combo Box</b> control is almost identical to the <b>Dropdown Combo</b> style. However, this style does not allow you to modify the <b>Text</b> property of this control.</p>
<p>
Note that most applications use a <b>Combo Box</b> control with its <b>Style</b> property set to <b>Dropdown Combo</b>. Instead of clicking on the arrow to cause the <b>Combo Box</b> control to display its list box, it is more convenient to press the enter key.</p>
<p>
Each time a key is pressed, the <b>Combo Box</b> control's KeyPress event is triggered (providing that the <b>Combo Box</b> control has the focus, of course). By monitoring this event, you can determine whether a user pressed enter. You know the user pressed enter if the <i>KeyAscii</i> value is 13.</p>
<p>
After you have determined that enter was indeed pressed, you send a CB_SHOWDROPDOWN message to the <b>Combo Box</b> control by using the Microsoft Windows® application programming interface (API) <b>SendMessage</b> function. If this message is sent to the control with a parameter of True, the <b>Combo Box</b> control drops down its list box. If this message is sent to the <b>Combo Box</b> control with a parameter of False, however, the list box would not be dropped down.</p>
<h2>Example Program</h2>
<p>
This program shows how to force a <b>Combo Box</b> control to drop down when the enter key is pressed.
<ol>
<li>
Create a new project in Visual Basic. Form1 is created by default.<br><br></li>
<li>
Add the following <b>Constant </b>and <b>Declare</b> statements to the General Declarations section of Form1 (note that the <b>Declare</b> statement must be typed as a single line of code):<pre><code>Const WM_USER = &amp;H400
Const CB_SHOWDROPDOWN = &amp;H14F
Private Declare Function SendMessage Lib "user32" Alias "SendMessageA" 
 &nbsp; (ByVal hwnd As Long, ByVal wMsg As Long, ByVal wParam As Long, lParam As 
 &nbsp; Long) As Long
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
Add the following code to the Form_Load event for Form1:<pre><code>Private Sub Form_Load()
 &nbsp;&nbsp; Combo1.AddItem "Oranges"
 &nbsp;&nbsp; Combo1.AddItem "Peaches"
 &nbsp;&nbsp; Combo1.AddItem "Apples"
End Sub
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
Add a <b>Combo Box</b> control to Form1. Combo1 is created by default.<br><br></li>
<li>
Add the following code to the KeyPress event for Combo1:<pre><code>Private Sub Combo1_KeyPress(KeyAscii As Integer)
 &nbsp;&nbsp; Dim I As Long
 &nbsp;&nbsp; If KeyAscii = 13 Then
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I = SendMessage(Combo1.hwnd, CB_SHOWDROPDOWN, True, 0&amp;)
 &nbsp;&nbsp; End If
End Sub
</code></pre>
</li>
</ol>
<p>
Run the example program by pressing f5. While the <b>Combo Box</b> control has the focus, press enter. The <b>Combo Box</b> control displays its list box.</p>
