<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
This wizard analyzes tables and indexes in a database, and then creates a VBA code module for re-creating your database as needed. A great tool for system administrators and database users who want to programmatically create new instances of a database.</p>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
This is a useful tool to use when you distribute applications that are split into a forms/code front-end and a data back-end scenario. Typically, you would ship both components, and when a new back-end database was required, you would copy from a disk or installation set and then start with the new database file. When you use code to create the database file, you can allow the user to create the database files when needed or control the process using permissions and the CurrentUser() object.</p>
<p>
The Table Code Creation Wizard is a sophisticated tool that allows you to:
<ul type=disc>
<li>
Identify a database file.<br><br></li>
<li>
Document the tables and indices in a database file.<br><br></li>
<li>
Create a Visual Basic for Applications code module based upon data access objects (DAO).</li>
</ul>
<p>
The resulting code, when run, will create the database structure from the code exactly as the original database was designed.</p>
<p>
The Table Code Creation Wizard is designed to be used as an example of how to implement this functionality in a wizard and is not designed to be a solution for every design scenario.</p>
<p>
The following features are not supported by the wizard:
<ul type=disc>
<li>
Documenting of Relationships.<br><br></li>
<li>
Documenting of Security and Permissions.</li>
</ul>
