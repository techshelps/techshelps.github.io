<h1><a name="msdn_browser"></a>Browsing and Windows 95 Networking: Introduction</h1>
<p>
Microsoft Corporation</p>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>
This document discusses technical details related to browsing for 32-bit, protected-mode network clients provided with Microsoft® Windows® 95. The document has been divided into three parts:
<ol>
<li>
<a href="msdn_browse1.htm">Microsoft Networking Browser System</a><br><br></li>
<li>
<a href="msdn_browse2.htm">Microsoft TCP/IP and Name Resolution</a><br><br></li>
<li>
<a href="msdn_browse3.htm">IPX/SPX-Compatible Protocol and Name Resolution</a></li>
</ol>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
The information in this document is provided for network administrators and others responsible for maintaining networks that include workstations running Microsoft® Windows® 95. The focus here is the technical implementation of browsing with Microsoft networking, but details are also provided for the Novell NetWare-compatible peer server service called File and Printer Sharing for NetWare Networks.</p>
<p>
This information supplements details about installing and configuring network services described in the <i>Microsoft Windows 95 Resource Kit</i>. This document focuses on internal processes and topology issues. For information about how to use Network Neighborhood and other aspects of the user interface for browsing, see Windows 95 Help.</p>

<B><b>Note</b></B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this paper, the term <i>server </i>refers to any computer that can provide resources to the rest of the network. A computer running Windows 95 plus File and Printer Sharing for Microsoft Networks, for example, is a server because it can share file or printer resources with other computers on the network. The computer does not have to actually share resources to be considered a server. </p>
<p>
In this document, any reference to computers running Windows NT Server is always made explicitly. Any reference to computers running Windows 95 in this document refers to computers running Windows 95 plus File and Printer Sharing services.</p>

The information contained in this document represents the current view of Microsoft Corporation on the issues discussed as of the date of publication. Because Microsoft must respond to changing market conditions, it should not be interpreted to be a commitment on the part of Microsoft, and Microsoft cannot guarantee the accuracy of any information presented after the date of publication.</p>
