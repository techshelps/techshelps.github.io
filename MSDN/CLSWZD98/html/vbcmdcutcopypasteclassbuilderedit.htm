<p>
These commands are useful for copying and moving items in the class hierarchy. Properties, methods, and events can be cut and copied between classes and collections. Classes and collections can be cut and copied to rearrange the class hierarchy. A class or collection with the same name can exist in two or more places in the class hierarchy; when this happens, it means that there is only one class or collection with that name, and that class or collection appears in several places in the overall class hierarchy.</p>
<p>
Classes and collections that existed in the project before the Class Builder was invoked, even classes and collections that were created by previous invocations of the Class Builder, cannot be edited or deleted by the Class Builder utility. Only classes and collections created in the current invocation of the Class Builder utility can be edited or deleted.</p>
