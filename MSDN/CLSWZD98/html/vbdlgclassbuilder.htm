The Class Builder utility is meant to help you build your class and collection hierarchy for your Visual Basic project. The Class Builder utility keeps track of the hierarchy of your classes and collections and generates the framework code necessary to implement the classes and collections, including the properties, methods, events, and enums.</p>
<p>
The Object Model pane shows a representation of the hierarchy of all the classes and collections in your project. Clicking on a class or collection selects it for editing. Once a class or collection is selected, the properties, methods, and/or events appear in the Properties, Methods, and Events pane. Enums appear only on the All tab. Clicking on one of these members selects it for editing.</p>
<p>
Classes and collections that existed in the project before the Class Builder was invoked, even classes and collections that were created by previous invocations of the Class Builder, cannot be edited or deleted by the Class Builder utility. Only classes and collections created in this invocation of the Class Builder utility can be edited or deleted.</p>
<p>
If the Class Builder utility is invoked for the first time in a project that already has existing classes and collections, all these classes and collections initially appear at the root of the hierarchy; the Class Builder does not have information about the hierarchy. You can arrange the existing classes and collections using a drag-and-drop operation. The Class Builder will remember this arrangement. Subsequent invocations of the Class Builder in the project will preserve the arrangement of classes and collections.</p>
