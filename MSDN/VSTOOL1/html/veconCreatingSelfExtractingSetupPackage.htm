A setup executable distribution unit is a package that builds a setup (.exe) file. This file can be transferred to the user's computer, installed, and run there. </p>
<p>
When packaging with setup files, you should understand:

<h2>Why Use a Setup Distribution Unit?</h2>
<p>
Setup executable files you create with the Microsoft development environment provide a professional way to distribute your application.</p>
<p>
A simple way to distribute your application is to create a setup program that, when run, will install your application on the user's computer. This is best used for conventional Windows applications — Web-based applications are better distributed as cabinet files, which the Microsoft development environment can also create for you.</p>
<p>
The Microsoft development environment provides a setup distribution unit that creates the setup file for you. It creates a single executable that contains all the files that need to be installed, so it can be distributed on conventional media like floppy disks or CDs, over a network, or even from a Web page.</p>
<p>
The files are stored in a compressed format in the setup file, so they take up as little disk space as possible, and reduce Web download times. The files are automatically uncompressed during the installation process.</p>
<p>
The setup file also registers an uninstaller, so your application will be listed in the Add/Remove Programs dialog box in the Windows Control Panel, and can be uninstalled from this dialog box.</p>
<p>
The setup file can be digitally signed so that users downloading the file from a Web page can be sure that you published the application and that it was not tampered with in any way.</p>
<h2>Creating Setup Files</h2>
<p>
With the Microsoft development environment, you can create and customize setup files more easily than before.
<ul type=disc>
<li>
You can package the outputs of a Visual J++ project. If the outputs of the project change, the setup file will be automatically rebuilt.<br><br></li>
<li>
The setup file created is a professional, Windows logo-compliant installer, with a professional user interface and an uninstaller.<br><br></li>
<li>
Any ActiveX components included in the package are automatically registered on the target machine.</li>
</ul>
