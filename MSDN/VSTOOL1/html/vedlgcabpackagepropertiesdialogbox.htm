<p>
Use this dialog box to specify or change the settings for the cabinet (.cab) project.</p>
<h2>Options</h2>
<h3>Cabinet file name</h3>
<p>
Provides a place to enter or edit the file name for the cabinet file. This is the name of the cabinet generated when you build.</p>
<h3>Certificate file</h3>
<p>
Provides a place to enter or edit the location of the certificate file (.spc) you want to use to sign this cabinet file. To locate an existing certificate file, click Browse. To get a certificate file, contact a certificate file provider (certificate authority).</p>
<h3>Compression</h3>
<p>
Displays the current compression algorithm used to compress the cabinet file. There are four options: None, MSZip (the default), Quantum, or LZX.</p>
<h3>Friendly name</h3>
<p>
Provides a place to enter or edit the friendly name of the cabinet file. The friendly name appears in the Windows Downloaded Program Files folder when the contents of the cabinet file are installed on your user's computer. The default friendly name is the project name used in the development environment. Alphanumerics, spaces, and dashes are legitimate characters to enter here.</p>
<h3>Classes in this cabinet can only be called by trusted Java classes</h3>
<p>
Marks the packages in the cabinet file so that the Java classes in the packages can only be used by other trusted Java classes.</p>
<p>
Java classes in packages with this property can only be directly used by either system classes (which are implicitly fully trusted) or classes that have been loaded by Internet Explorer 4.0 and marked as fully trusted (for example, signed CAB with low permissions). This security check is made at the time the classes are run. This prevents a set of classes from being directly used by untrusted applets. </p>
<h3>Classes in this cabinet are globally available</h3>
<p>
Marks the packages in the cabinet file so that the Java classes in the packages can be loaded directly by the Microsoft Virtual Machine for Java (VM). Specifically, the WJView and JView utilities can load the Java classes in these packages. </p>
<p>
Selecting this check box controls how the packages in the cabinet file are installed into the Java Package Manager. You should use this check box where traditionally you would have installed these packages on the Java CLASSPATH. </p>
<p>
If you select this check box, you must sign your cabinet file with Java permissions at the Low level. You can set your Java Permissions on the Java Permissions tab (on the cabinet property pages). </p>
<h3>Private Key File</h3>
<p>
Provides a place to enter or edit the location of the private key file (.pvk) associated with this certificate.</p>
<h3>Sign Cabinet</h3>
<p>
Specifies that the distribution unit should be signed. If you sign a distribution unit, you identify yourself to the user before they download the software. Signing also verifies that the file has not been tampered with since you signed it.</p>
<h3>Timestamp server URL</h3>
<p>
Provides a place to enter or edit the location of a timestamp server. A timestamp server validates the date and time that the cabinet file was signed. Certificate files can expire after a certain period of time. Contact your certificate file provider (certificate authority) for the location of their timestamp server.</p>
<h3>Use Defaults</h3>
<p>
Resets the cabinet signing options to the development environment's default values set in the Tools menu, Options dialog box, Security node.</p>
<h3>Use test certificate file</h3>
<p>
Signs the cabinet file with the Visual Studio test certificate. The Visual Studio test certificate is provided to support test scenarios only, and should not be used for signing cabinet files that you deploy to the intranet or Internet. The text for the Visual Studio test certificate indicates that the user should not trust the signed component based on the test signature.</p>
<h3>Use certificate file</h3>
<p>
Enables the use of a personal or corporate signature file (certificate) to sign the cabinet file.</p>
<h3>Version</h3>
<p>
(Optional.) Provides a place to enter or edit the version number of the cabinet file's contents. This is in the format of #,#,#,#. This is used by Internet Explorer to determine if the cabinet file needs to be downloaded when a version of the file already exists on the user's computer.</p>
