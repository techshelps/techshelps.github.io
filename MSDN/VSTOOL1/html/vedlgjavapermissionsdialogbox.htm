<p>
Use this dialog box to specify the set of permissions requested for the signed classes in the cabinet file. This security/permissions information is used to present to the user a single dialog box that displays all the proper trust questions before any code from your cabinet is run on their computer. The dialog box can also accurately warn your user about the risk of each requested permission. This is because the set of permissions is fully defined and understood by the Microsoft<sup>®</sup> Win32<sup>®</sup> Virtual Machine (VM) for Java.</p>
<h2>Options</h2>
<h3>Contains ActiveX Controls</h3>
<p>
Specifies in the signature that your cabinet contains Microsoft<sup>®</sup> ActiveX<sup>®</sup> controls so that the ActiveX controls will run in your cabinet.</p>
<h3>Permission Level</h3>
<p>
Sets the cabinet file's permission level. This information is passed to the browser when the .cab file is scanned for signing upon being downloaded. There are four levels of security, as described in the following list.
<ul type=disc>
<li>
<b>Low</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A browser zone set with the "Low" setting is the least secure. This allows a signed cabinet file to have as much access to the target computer as the signed cabinet file asks for.<br><br></li>
<li>
<b>Medium</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A browser zone with the "Medium" setting is moderately secure. It will allow applets in signed cabinet files to have access to scratch space if the applets ask for it. (Scratch space is storage on the client machine that an applet can safely access without needing full access to the client file system.) Applets signed with medium permissions may also call user-directed file I/O routines. These routines will present dialog boxes to the user and ensure that all file operations are done with user intervention.<br><br></li>
<li>
<b>High</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A browser zone with the "High" setting is the most secure. It will allow applets in signed cabinet files to run in the "sandbox" (a protected space that prevents the applet from accessing files and selected system services).<br><br></li>
<li>
<b>Custom</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Enables the Permissions listing to select specific abilities for this .cab file.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Permissions</h3>
<p>
Displays a list of the individual permissions that can be added when you sign this cabinet file. If you set the permission level to Custom, you can select items in the list to match the permissions needed by the contents of your cabinet file.</p>
<h3>Sign Cabinet with Java Permissions</h3>
<p>
Specifies that the cabinet file should be signed with Java permissions.</p>
