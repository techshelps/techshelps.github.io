<p>
The Deployment Explorer tool window displays the list of deployment targets in the current solution. The deployment target specifies the list of projects and files that are to be deployed, the URL to which files are deployed, and the configuration of components on the server.</p>
<p>
Each deployment target can contain deployment services that the deployment target supports. There are two possible deployment services, as described in the following list.
<ul type=disc>
<li>
Web Content, Controls, and Applets: for deploying components that run in the Web browser. These components include HTML pages, applets and other Java classes, and ActiveX<sup>®</sup> controls.<br><br></li>
<li>
Server Components: For deploying components that run on the server. These components include Active Server Pages, Java classes and COM components.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Below each deployment service is the list of projects and files that are deployed to that service. The deployed configuration of the Web application is specified by appropriately distributing projects and files between the Web Content, Controls, and Applets service and the Server Components service.</p>
<p>
You can:
<ul type=disc>
<li>
View multiple services of different deployment targets at the same time.<br><br></li>
<li>
Add new deployment targets.<br><br></li>
<li>
Make a deployment target active by selecting it and clicking the Set as Active button.<br><br></li>
<li>
Rename your deployment target by right-clicking on the selected item, selecting Rename from the context menu, and typing the new name.<br><br></li>
<li>
Add project outputs and individual files to a deployment target.<br><br></li>
<li>
Remove project outputs or individual files from a deployment target.<br><br></li>
<li>
Remove deployment targets.<br><br></li>
<li>
View settings for the Server Component Installation service node, individual files, and the Deployment Target itself. (You cannot view settings for Outputs, the Web Contents, Controls and Applets service node or the Deploy to My Computer target.)<br><br></li>
<li>
You can expand and collapse the deployment target lists and view the services and items included in the services by clicking on the plus (+) or minus (-) to the left of the deployment target or service name.<br><br></li>
<li>
Deploy the selected deployment target or the active deployment target.<br><br></li>
<li>
Set a deployment target as the startup project for F5.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Elements</h2>
<p>
<img src="ve50gt1.gif" border=0></p>
<p>
Prompts you for a new deployment target in the New Deployment Target dialog box.</p>
<p>
<img src="ve50gt2.gif" border=0></p>
<p>
Sets the selected deployment target as the active deployment target. This selected target is the default.</p>
<p>
<img src="ve50gt3.gif" border=0></p>
<p>
Removes the deployment target from the list in the Deployment Explorer. This removes the deployment target but does not delete the projects or files that it deploys.</p>
<p>
<img src="ve50gt4.gif" border=0></p>
<p>
Deploys the selected deployment target.</p>
<p>
<img src="ve50gt5.gif" border=0></p>
<p>
Displays the Deployment Target Settings for the Deployment Target, the Server Component Installation service node, or for individual files.</p>
<h2>List Window</h2>
<p>
Lists all of the deployment targets and the corresponding services for each deployment target.</p>
<h4>Deployment Target</h4>
<p>
Lists the names of the deployment targets in the current solution. By default, the deployment target name includes the target Web server's URL. You can add or remove deployment targets.</p>
<p>
Double-click the service nodes in the Deployment Target node to expand or collapse the service nodes in the group.</p>
<h4>Server Components Service</h4>
<p>
Lists projects and files that are deployed to the Web server. This service contains server-side components: Items deployed in this service are configured to run on the server. For example, ASP pages and COM server components are server-side components.</p>
<p>
If your deployment target machine supports server-side components, this node will appear under that deployment target in the Deployment Explorer.</p>
<h4>Web Content, Controls, and Applets Service</h4>
<p>
Lists projects and files that are deployed to the Web server. This service contains client-side components; items deployed in this service are configured on the server so that they can be downloaded and run on the browser. For example, HTML pages and ActiveX controls are client-side components.</p>
<h4>Deploy to My Computer Target</h4>
<p>
This deployment target deploys the files locally to the developer's machine. This deployment target actually does not deploy any files, leaving them in locations where the development tools leave them. This is the default deployment target, and should be set as active whenever deployment to a remote server is not required.</p>
