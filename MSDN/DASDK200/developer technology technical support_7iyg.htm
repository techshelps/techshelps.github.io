<h2>Telephone a Microsoft Technical Support engineer.</h2>
<p>
Microsoft Technical Support provides no-charge and fee-based support via telephone. </p>
<h3>Standard No-Charge Support — for help during regular business hours</h3>
<p>
If you are using Microsoft Data Access Components in conjunction with a retail Microsoft product, see that product's individual help file for Standard No-Charge Support available, hours of operation, and telephone numbers to call. </p>
<p>
This product, when used in conjunction with a non-Microsoft product, is not eligible for Standard No-Charge Support. Please see the Pay-Per-Incident section below. </p>
<p>
If your Microsoft product was preinstalled or shipped with your personal computer, you are not eligible for Standard No-Charge Support from Microsoft and must contact your computer manufacturer for support. For phone numbers, please refer to the documentation that came with your computer.</p>
<h3><a name="psspayperincidentsupportforhelpafterhoursortosupplementstandardsupport"></a>Pay-Per-Incident Support — for help after hours or to supplement Standard Support</h3>
<p>
If you need help after hours, or are ineligible for Standard No-Charge Support, you can purchase Pay-Per-Incident Support for a fee of $95 U.S. per incident by calling (800) 936-5800. Support fees will be billed to your VISA, MasterCard, or American Express card. In the United States, you can also call (900) 555-2300 to have support fees applied to your telephone bill.</p>
