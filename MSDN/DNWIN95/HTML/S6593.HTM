<h3>Correcting Problems in Playing MIDI Files</H3><P>When a multimedia application is unable to play MIDI files, it is commonly due to one or more of the following problems:</P>
<UL><LI>The sound card is not installed properly.</LI><LI>You are using Sound Recorder and a MIDI driver is not installed.</LI><LI>A MIDI MCI driver is not installed.</LI><LI>The .IDF file is invalid or corrupt.</LI></UL><H4><A NAME="sec0"></A>The sound card is not installed properly.</H4><P>Most sound cards come with MS-DOS – based programs for playing sounds or testing card configurations. Run these test programs; if the sound card does not work with these programs, then it will not work with Windows&nbsp;95 sound support.</P>
<P>Make sure that the sound card settings do not conflict with other hardware. Use the Add New Hardware option in Control Panel to detect your hardware, which will determine whether you have any hardware for which the appropriate driver is not yet installed. Verify port and IRQ settings. </P>
<P><B>Note</B>   If the sound card can play .WAV files, the card is properly installed.</P>
<H4><A NAME="sec1"></A>A MIDI driver is not installed.</H4><P>If you are using Sound Recorder and cannot play a MIDI file, it might be because there is no MIDI driver installed. If the sound card is compatible with AdLib, try using the AdLib driver provided with Windows&nbsp;95. If you don't find the correct driver for the sound card in the list, try using the Windows 3.1 driver for that card (however, the Windows 3.1 driver might not be compatible with Windows&nbsp;95).</P>
<H4><A NAME="sec2"></A>A MIDI MCI driver is not installed or enabled.</H4><P>In Media Player, make sure that the option named MIDI Sequencer appears in the Device menu. If not, then the MIDI MCI driver is not installed or not enabled.</P>
<H4><A NAME="sec3"></A>To verify that the MIDI MCI driver is enabled</H4><OL><LI>In the Multimedia option in Control Panel, click the Advanced tab.</LI><LI>In the Multimedia Devices list, click the plus (+) sign next to Media Control Devices.
<P>If MIDI Sequencer Device does not appear in the list, the driver is not installed. See the following procedure for instructions.</P></LI><LI>Click MIDI Sequencer Device (Media Control), and then click the Properties button.</LI><LI>In the properties dialog box, click Use This Media Control Device.</LI></OL><H4><A NAME="sec4"></A>To install the MIDI MCI driver</H4><OL><LI>In the Add New Hardware option in Control Panel, click No when prompted to have Windows&nbsp;95 search for your hardware, and then click the Next button.</LI><LI>In the Hardware Types list, click Sound, Video And Game Controllers, and then click the Next button.</LI><LI>Click Microsoft MCI in the Manufacturers list, and then click MIDI Sequencer Device (Media Control) in the Models list. Click the Next button.</LI><LI>To complete the installation, click the Finish button.</LI></OL><h5><A NAME="sec5"></A>The .IDF file is corrupt or invalid.</H5><P>Copy the appropriate .IDF file for each device installed. For general MIDI devices, obtain a new copy of GENERAL.IDF from the Windows&nbsp;95 disks. For MIDI devices that come with their own .IDF file, reinstall the file from the device's setup disks.</P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
