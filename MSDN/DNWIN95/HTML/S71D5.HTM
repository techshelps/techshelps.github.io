<h2>Modems and Communications Tools: The Issues</H2><P>Before you install and configure a modem for use with Windows&nbsp;95, you should decide the following:</P>
<UL><LI>How many users need modems installed on their computers and what are the locations to which and from which they will be calling.</LI><LI>What kind of security restrictions you want to apply to modems installed on individual computers, as described in Chapter 14, "Security."</LI><LI>What properties you need to set for making connections, as described in "Setting Modem Properties" later in this chapter. </LI></UL><P><B>Note</B>   In Windows&nbsp;95, you cannot share a modem installed on another computer on the network. You can, however, share a fax modem over the network. For information, see Chapter 27, "Microsoft Fax."</P>
