<h3>Features Supporting Alternative Input Devices</H3><P>This section describes Windows&nbsp;95 support for the use of alternative input devices.</P>
<H4><A NAME="sec0"></A>SerialKeys</H4><P>This feature, in conjunction with a communications aid interface device, allows the user to control the computer using an alternative input device. Such a device needs only to send coded command strings through the computer's serial port to specify keystrokes and mouse events, which are then treated as if they were normal keyboard or mouse input.</P>
<H4><A NAME="sec1"></A>Support for Multiple Pointing Devices</H4><P>The new Plug and Play architecture in Windows&nbsp;95 inherently supports multiple pointing devices working in combination. This allows seamless addition of alternative pointing devices, such as head-pointers or eye-gaze systems without the need to replace or disable the normal mouse.</P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
