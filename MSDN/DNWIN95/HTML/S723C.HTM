<h2>Microsoft Fax: The Basics</H2><P>With Microsoft Fax, users with modems can exchange faxes and editable files as easily as printing a document or sending an electronic mail message. Microsoft Fax is compatible with the millions of traditional Group 3 fax machines worldwide, yet it provides advanced security and binary file transfer (BFT) features that make sharing information by means of a fax easier and more powerful. </P>
<P>To use Microsoft Fax, you must install Microsoft Exchange. Microsoft Fax has been integrated into Microsoft Exchange as a messaging application programming interface (MAPI) service provider. All faxes sent to Microsoft Fax are received in the Microsoft Exchange universal inbox. You can send a fax by composing a Microsoft Exchange message, or by using the Send option on the File menu of a MAPI-compatible application (such as Microsoft Excel or Microsoft Word). In addition, Microsoft Fax includes a fax printer driver so that users can "print to fax" from within any Windows-based application.</P>
<P></P>
<P>Microsoft Fax provides the following key features.</P>
<P><B>Fax at your fingertips.</B></P>
<P></P>
<P>With Microsoft Fax, sending traditional faxes to Group 3 fax machines is as easy as printing a document. Additionally, Microsoft Fax uses the highest transmission speed and image compression supported by the recipient fax machine. Faxes sent in this way cannot be edited by the recipient.</P>
<P><B>Delivery by address type.</B></P>
<P>The MAPI service provider architecture allows you to mix different types of recipients in the <I>same</I> message. For example, it is possible to send a message simultaneously to Microsoft Mail, CompuServe&reg;, Internet, and Microsoft Fax users as long as profiles for these destinations have been defined within Microsoft Exchange. A recipient's fax address can be selected from the Microsoft Exchange Personal Address Book, or the fax can be addressed by using an address that you use just once such as [fax: <I>555-1212</I>]. </P>
<P><B>Binary file transfer (BFT).</B></P>
<P>Microsoft Fax supports Microsoft At Work BFT, which makes it possible to attach an editable document to a Microsoft Exchange mail message. These editable documents can be sent to users of Windows&nbsp;95, Windows for Workgroups 3.11, and other Microsoft At Work&trade;-enabled platforms.</P>
<P><B>Security.</B></P>
<P>Microsoft Fax lets you securely exchange confidential documents by using public key encryption or digital signatures. Any security specified by the user is applied before the message is passed to the modem or connected fax device. </P>
<P><B>Network fax service.</B></P>
<P>You can install a fax device in one computer and share it with other users within a workgroup. Individual computers can have their own fax devices installed and still use the shared fax device.</P>
<P><B>Microsoft Fax Viewer.</B></P>
<P></P>
<P>The Microsoft Fax Viewer displays outgoing fax messages that have been queued to a local fax modem or to a Microsoft Fax network fax service. The Fax Viewer provides information about the current set of messages that are queued for transmission. You can also browse multipage faxes in thumbnail or full-page views.</P>
<P><B>"Best available" fax format.</B></P>
<P>When you make a fax connection in Windows&nbsp;95, Microsoft Fax queries and exchanges its fax capabilities with the recipient. This exchange of capabilities determines whether the recipient is a traditional Group 3 fax machine, which can only receive rendered faxes, or if the recipient has Microsoft Fax capabilities, and can receive editable files. Windows&nbsp;95, Windows for Workgroups 3.11, and Microsoft At Work fax platforms are all capable of receiving binary files and traditional faxes. </P>
<UL><LI>If the receiving fax device supports Microsoft Fax capabilities and an editable document is attached to a Microsoft Exchange message, then the file is transferred in its native format, in the same way as electronic mail. </LI><LI>If the receiving fax device is a traditional Group 3 fax machine, then Microsoft Fax converts the document to the most compressed type of fax supported by the machine (MH, MR or MMR compression type) and transmits the image by using the best available communications protocol supported by the mutual connection (that is, V.17, V.29 or V.27). </LI><LI>If Microsoft Fax sends a noneditable fax to another Microsoft Fax user, then the fax is transmitted by using the Microsoft At Work rendered fax format. This special format is much more compressed, on average, than Group 3 MMR. Therefore, the exchange of noneditable faxes between Microsoft Fax users is always faster than between Group 3 fax machines.</LI></UL><P><B>Compatibility with popular fax modems.</B></P>
<P>Microsoft Fax is compatible with Class 1 and Class 2 fax modems, and provides support for high-speed fax communications (V.17, V.29, and V.27). </P>
<P><B>Custom fax cover pages.</B></P>
<P>With Microsoft Fax, you can create new fax cover pages with a cover page designer that lets you incorporate graphics and text, or you can customize one of the predefined cover pages included with Microsoft Fax.</P>
<P><B>Connecting to fax information services.</B></P>
<P>Microsoft Fax easily connects to fax-on-demand systems by using a built-in, poll-retrieve feature that allows you to retrieve rendered faxes or editable documents from a fax information service. </P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
