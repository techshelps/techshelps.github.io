<h3>Setting Up Windows 95 with a Novell-Supplied NetWare Client</H3><P>To help you ensure successful installation of Windows&nbsp;95, make sure that the Novell-supplied NetWare client software is running before you start Windows&nbsp;95 Setup. To verify that the Novell-supplied software is running, make sure you can successfully connect to and use resources on a NetWare server. Running the Novell-supplied software helps to ensure that Setup can detect the network configuration for successful installation of Windows&nbsp;95.</P>
<P>Also, if you currently use IPX.COM, you should upgrade to the latest versions of NetWare client software that use ODI drivers before installing Windows&nbsp;95. For information about using ODI drivers versus monolithic IPX.COM, see "Configuring Network Adapter Drivers for Novell NetWare Clients" later in this chapter.</P>
<H4><A NAME="sec0"></A>Installing Windows 95 with a Novell NetWare Client</H4><P>This section presents the procedures for installing Windows&nbsp;95 to run with a Novell-supplied client, depending on various installation situations:</P>
<UL><LI>Installing Novell-supplied NetWare client support during Windows&nbsp;95 Setup</LI><LI>Installing Client for Microsoft Networks in addition to a Novell-supplied NetWare client </LI><LI>Installing a Novell-supplied NetWare client after installing Windows&nbsp;95 with no network support</LI></UL><P><b>Note</b></P>
<P>The method for installing VLM support is different if VLM support was not installed previously under Windows 3.x, as described in "VLM Technical Notes" later in this chapter.</P>
<P>Also notice that, if the NetWare client software is not running at the time Windows&nbsp;95 is installed, you must configure Windows&nbsp;95 manually after Setup to work in conjunction with the NetWare client software. </P>
<P>By default, Windows&nbsp;95 Setup automatically installs Microsoft Client for NetWare Networks if it detects NetWare software, except in the cases described in "Setting Up Windows 95 for NetWare Networks: an Overview" earlier in this chapter. You can select the Custom setup type and specify that the Novell-supplied software be retained during Setup. In this case, Windows&nbsp;95 will use the existing networking configuration specified in NET.CFG for protocols, adapter drivers, and other values. </P>
<H4><A NAME="sec1"></A>To select the Novell-supplied NETX client support during Windows&nbsp;95 Setup</H4><OL><LI>Start the computer as usual, making sure that the Novell-supplied network software is running. Then run Windows&nbsp;95 Setup, and select Custom as the Setup type. </LI><LI>When the Network Configuration dialog box appears, select Client for NetWare Networks in the list of components, and then click Remove.</LI><LI>Click Add, and then double-click Client in the Select Network Component Type dialog box.</LI><LI>In the Select Network Client dialog box, click Novell in the Manufacturers list, and click Workstation Shell 3.X [NETX] in the Network Clients list. Then click OK.
<P>If you also want to use Client for Microsoft Networks, follow the steps in the next procedure.</P></LI><LI>Click the Next button in the Network Configuration dialog box. 
<P>If you want to use only the NETX client, you do not need to specify settings for your network adapter driver or protocols. Setup automatically adds support for the ODI adapter and IPXODI (or for IPX.COM) by reading NET.CFG.</P></LI><LI>Continue with Windows&nbsp;95 Setup.</LI></OL><P><B>Note</B>   You cannot install Client for Microsoft Networks as an additional network client if you are installing Windows&nbsp;95 to run with an IPX monolithic configuration.</P>
<H4><A NAME="sec2"></A>To install Client for Microsoft Networks with a Novell NetWare client </H4>
<OL><LI>In the Network Configuration dialog box, click Add, and then double-click Client.</LI><LI>In the Select Network Client dialog box, click Microsoft in the Manufacturers list, and click Client for Microsoft Networks in the Network Clients list. Then click OK.</LI></OL><H4><A NAME="sec3"></A>To determine whether the correct adapter driver is installed</H4><OL><LI>In the Network option in Control Panel, double-click the network adapter (or IPX Monolithic) in the list of components. </LI><LI>In the properties for the network adapter, click the Driver Type tab.</LI><LI>Make sure the Real Mode (16-bit) ODI driver is selected. </LI></OL>
<H4><A NAME="sec4"></A>To install a Novell NetWare client with no previous networking</H4><OL><LI>Run the Novell-supplied installation program to install a NetWare client.</LI><LI>In the Network option in Control Panel, click Add, and then double-click Client in the Select Network Component Type dialog box.</LI><LI>In the Select Network Client dialog box, click Novell in the Manufacturers list, and click the workstation shell that you want (NETX orVLM) in the Network Clients list. Then click OK.</LI></OL><H4><A NAME="sec5"></A>Switching Back to NETX from Client for NetWare Networks</H4><P>If you install the protected-mode Client for NetWare Networks and later decide to return to your original Novell NetWare NETX configuration, follow these steps. </P>
<P><B>Important</B>   Be sure to use the Network option in Control Panel to remove Client for NetWare Networks, and then to configure Windows 95 to use NETX or VLM.</P>
<P>For details about adding or returning to VLM, see "VLM Technical Notes" later in this chapter.</P>
<H4><A NAME="sec6"></A>To return to NETX after installing Client for NetWare Networks</H4><OL><LI>In the Network option in Control Panel, select Client for NetWare Networks, and then click Remove.</LI><LI>Click Add, and then double-click Client.</LI><LI>In the Select Network Client dialog box, click Novell in the Manufacturers list, and click Workstation Shell 3.X [NETX] in the Network Clients list. Then click OK.
<P>Windows&nbsp;95 automatically installs IPXODI support.</P></LI><LI>Click OK in Network properties, and provide a disk or a location for any files that Windows&nbsp;95 requests to complete the installation. Then shut down and restart the computer.</LI></OL><P>Usually, you will have to reinstall Novell-supplied files at this stage, because Windows&nbsp;95 Setup previously replaced these files with versions required by Client for NetWare Networks. You must also make sure that NET.CFG is present and contains correct settings, and that the required settings are present in CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT. See your Novell documentation for information about these required settings.</P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
