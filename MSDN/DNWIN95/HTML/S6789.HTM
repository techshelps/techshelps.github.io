<h2>Installable File Systems</H2><P>Windows&nbsp;95 features a layered file system architecture that supports multiple file systems, including VFAT and CDFS.</P>
<P>The new file system architecture makes the computer easier to use and improves file and disk I/O performance. Features of the new file system architecture include long filename support and a dynamic system cache for file and network I/O.</P>
<P>Long filename support improves ease of use because users no longer need to reference files by the MS-DOS 8.3 filename structure. Instead, users can specify up to 255 characters to identify their documents. In addition, filenames seem less cryptic and thus easier to read because Windows&nbsp;95 hides the filename extensions from users. </P>
<P>Windows&nbsp;95 I/O performance is dramatically improved over Windows 3.1. This is because Windows&nbsp;95 features 32-bit protected-mode code for reading information from and writing information to the file system, and for reading information from and writing information to the disk device. It also includes 32-bit dynamically sizable caching mechanisms, and a full, 32-bit code path is available from the file system to the disk device.</P>
<P></P>
<P>Windows&nbsp;95 includes an open file system architecture for future system support. It also provides disk device driver compatibility with Windows&nbsp;NT.</P>
<P>The following figure shows the file system architecture used by Windows&nbsp;95.</P>
<P><img src="RK31_10.gif"></P>
<P>The Windows&nbsp;95 file system architecture is made up of the following components:</P>
<UL><LI>Installable File System (IFS) Manager. The IFS Manager is responsible for arbitrating access to different file system components.</LI><LI>File system drivers. The file system driver layer includes access to FAT-based disk devices, CD-ROM file systems, and redirected network device support.</LI><LI>Block I/O subsystem. The block I/O subsystem is responsible for interacting with the physical disk device.</LI></UL><P>The following sections describe these components.</P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
