<h2>Using the Windows 95 Logon Password </H2><P>With Windows 95, users can log on to all networks and Windows 95 at the same time. The first time a user starts Windows&nbsp;95, logon dialog boxes appear for Windows&nbsp;95 and for each network client on that computer. This is useful for you as a network administrator because you can use existing user accounts on a network security provider to validate access to the network for users running Windows&nbsp;95. For more information, see Chapter 11, "Logon, Browsing, and Resource Sharing."</P>
<P>If a user's password for Windows 95 or for another network is the same as the password for the primary logon client, Windows 95 logs the user on to Windows&nbsp;95 and the network automatically using that password. When a user logs on to other networks with different passwords and chooses to save them, the passwords are stored in the password list file. The Windows&nbsp;95 password unlocks this password list file. Thereafter, Windows 95 uses the passwords stored in the password list file to log a user on to other networks so no additional passwords need to be typed. </P>
<P>The Passwords option in Control Panel provides a way to synchronize logon passwords for different networks. This allows users to use the password for whatever logon dialog box appears first (the primary network logon client or Windows&nbsp;95 logon) for logging on to all the other network clients. </P>
<P>You can also use the Passwords option to change individual passwords to other network resources to be different than the Windows 95 logon password.</P>
