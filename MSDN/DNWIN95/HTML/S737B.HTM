<h3>Systems Management Server Components</H3><P>Systems Management Server consists of several Windows NT services and few platform-specific applications. These components communicate with each other by writing information to files, which they store in a specific database or directories. Each service or application polls the database or a directory for specific files, and records its results in files destined for the database or the next service. After all services or applications have completed their tasks, the finished product can be a client computer inventory or a successfully installed software package. </P>
<P>Inventory data and Systems Management Server component configurations are stored in a SQL Server database. The database information can be viewed using the Systems Management Server Administrator tool or through other SQL Server front-end tools, such as Microsoft Access.</P>
<P>The following terms describe the roles played by computers in the Systems Management Server system and define how they are structured within the management architecture.</P>

All sites and computers in the hierarchy can be administered from this site. There can be an unlimited number of subsites below the central site. The central site must be a primary site, and have a SQL Server database. The central site must be running Windows NT Server.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP"><P>Primary site</P></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP"><P>A Systems Management Server site that has its own database, which contains all of the hardware and software inventory information for the site and its subsites. Local administration can be performed for the site server and all the sites below it in the hierarchy. A primary site must be running Windows NT Server.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP"><P>Secondary site</P></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP"><P>A Systems Management Server site that does not have a SQL Server database or Systems Management Server Administrator tool. This site is administered from any site above it in the hierarchy and does not have subsites. Its site information is reported to the site above it. A secondary site must be running Windows NT Server.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP"><P>Domain</P></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP"><P>A Systems Management Server domain is a set of servers and client computers that have been grouped together. A domain is primarily used to organize servers and clients into manageable groups and provide logon validation, inventory collection, report generation, and package distribution. Within any one site there is always at least one domain. However, each site can have multiple domains to meet your management requirements. Valid domains are Windows NT, NetWare, LAN Manager, and LAN Server.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP"><P><B>Server Terms:</B></P></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP"><P></P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP"><P>Site server</P></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP"><P>Each site has at least one site server. A site server is a computer running Windows NT Server that contains Systems Management Server components needed to monitor and manage the site, its domains, and its computers. The site server also serves as a collection point for instructions and inventory information.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP"><P>Helper server</P></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP"><P>To help ease the load on the site server, you can move some of the components from the site server to other servers. These are called helper servers. Because helper servers are used to offload some of the processing from the site server, they must be running Windows NT Server.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP"><P>SQL Server</P></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP"><P>Each primary site must have a SQL Server. Systems Management Server uses Microsoft SQL Server to store the site database. SQL Server can be installed on the site server or on a separate server. Although each site must have its own database, different sites can share the same SQL&nbsp;Server. It is, however, more efficient for the SQL Server to be on the same LAN as the sites using its databases.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP"><P>Distribution server</P></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP"><P>This server is used as a distribution point when sending applications for clients to install or run. This means that the system administrator has to send only one copy of the software to each group of computers connected to the distribution server, thus reducing traffic on the network. A distribution server can be a Windows NT Server, a NetWare Server, a LAN Server, or a LAN Manager Server.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP"><P>Logon server</P></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP"><P>This server is used to validate client computer logons, and functions as a transfer point between clients and site servers. When a computer logs on, the network inventory information is placed onto the logon server, where it is collected by Systems Management Server, and stored in the database. Any supported network server can act as a logon server. For example, a NetWare Server can act as a logon server for its existing client computers.</P></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>
<P><BR></P><P>Notice that it is completely possible within a small Systems Management Server site for the site server to also be the logon server, the distribution server, and the SQL Server.</P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
