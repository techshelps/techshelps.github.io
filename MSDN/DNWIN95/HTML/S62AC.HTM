<h3>Installing Windows 95 over OS/2</H3><P>You can install Windows&nbsp;95 on a computer running any version of OS/2 as long as a FAT partition is available. If the computer has any HPFS partitions, these partitions are not available from within Windows&nbsp;95. Setup reminds you of this when it detects an HPFS partition.</P>
<P>The following notes apply to installing Windows&nbsp;95 on a computer running OS/2:</P>
<UL><LI>You must install Windows&nbsp;95 in a new directory.</LI><LI>Windows&nbsp;95 Setup cannot migrate desktop or other settings from OS/2.</LI><LI>You might have to reinstall any Windows-based applications to run under Windows&nbsp;95. </LI></UL><P>Windows&nbsp;95 Setup cannot run from within either OS/2 or OS/2 for Windows. You must start the computer by using MS-DOS and then run Windows&nbsp;95 Setup from an MS-DOS command prompt. If your OS/2 system is not configured to dual boot with MS-DOS, install MS-DOS first, and then start Windows&nbsp;95 Setup from MS-DOS.</P>
<P>If your computer has OS/2 Boot Manager, a message warns you that continuing with Windows&nbsp;95 Setup will disable Boot Manager. If you choose to continue, Windows&nbsp;95 Setup removes the OS/2 Boot Manager partition information because Windows&nbsp;95 Setup cannot determine which operating system or configuration Boot Manager will use to restart the computer. This ensures that Windows&nbsp;95 starts during the installation process.<B> </B></P>
<P>Windows&nbsp;95 Setup leaves all other OS/2 files intact and does not remove any files from the OS/2 directory. </P>
<H4><A NAME="sec0"></A>Tip for Restoring Boot Manager After Windows&nbsp;95 Is Installed</H4><P>Windows&nbsp;95 runs normally with Boot Manager after installation is complete. After Windows&nbsp;95 is installed, you can make Boot Manager active again by using the OS/2 boot disk to run the OS/2 Fdisk utility.  </P>
