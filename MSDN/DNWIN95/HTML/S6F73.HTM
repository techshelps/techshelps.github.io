<h2>Windows 95 Networking: The Basics</H2><P>The Windows&nbsp;95 operating system includes built-in networking support with a wide range of improvements over earlier versions of Windows. This includes built-in support for popular networks, plus an open, extensible networking architecture. </P>
<P>For supported networks other than Microsoft networking, the computer must already have the networking software from another vendor installed. Windows&nbsp;95 Setup adds only the client or protocols required to work with Windows&nbsp;95. The following networks are supported:</P>
<UL><LI>Artisoft&reg; LANtastic&reg; version 5.0 and greater</LI><LI>Banyan&reg; VINES&reg; version 5.52 and greater</LI></UL><P></P>
<UL><LI>DEC&trade; PATHWORKS&trade; (installed as a protocol)</LI><LI>Microsoft networking — Microsoft LAN Manager, Windows for Workgroups 3.x, and Windows&nbsp;NT</LI><LI>Novell&reg; NetWare&reg; version 3.11 and greater</LI><LI>SunSoft&trade; PC-NFS&reg; version 5.0 and greater</LI></UL><P></P>
<P>The built-in networking components include support for a wide range of network transports (such as TCP/IP and IPX/SPX), industry-wide communications protocols (such as RPC, NetBIOS, and named pipes), and existing network device standards (such as NDIS and ODI). Because of the extensible architecture, other network vendors can add network connectivity enhancements and application support, and you can mix and match components at every layer. For information, see Chapter 32, "Windows 95 Network Architecture." </P>
<P>The following list summarizes the benefits of networking features in Windows&nbsp;95.</P>
<P><B>Robust networking components using no conventional memory.</B></P>
<P>The protected-mode clients provided with Windows&nbsp;95 — Microsoft Client for NetWare Networks and Client for Microsoft Networks — use only 32-bit, protected-mode protocols, drivers, and supporting files. On large block transfers over the network, these protected-mode clients are up to twice as fast as real-mode clients under Windows 3.x. Windows&nbsp;95 includes new 32-bit drivers for network protocols and adapters, plus a new implementation of TCP/IP.</P>
<P><B>Easy, graphical configuration for all networking components.</B></P>
<P>All network clients, adapter drivers, protocols, and services are installed and configured by using the Network option in Control Panel rather than by editing configuration files manually. All configuration values for protected-mode components are stored in the Registry.</P>
<P></P>
<P><B>Automatic setup of Windows&nbsp;95 on network workstations.</B></P>
<P>For both Windows-based and MS-DOS – based computers, Setup upgrades the network software whenever possible to a Windows&nbsp;95 protected-mode client and supporting protected-mode components, based on information detected about existing networking components. Setup also supports automated installation and customization during installation from setup scripts, plus installing Windows&nbsp;95 to run from a local hard disk or from a shared network copy. For information, see Chapter 4, "Server-Based Setup for Windows 95," and Chapter 5, "Custom, Automated, and Push Installations."</P>
<P><B>Peer resource sharing with protected-mode network clients.</B></P>
<P>Any computer running the protected-mode Microsoft Client for NetWare Networks or Client for Microsoft Networks can be set up to serve as a file and print server for other computers on the network. Resources can be protected with user-level security on NetWare or Windows&nbsp;NT networks using existing user account databases. On Microsoft networks, resources can also be protected with share-level security.</P>
<P><B>Simultaneous connection to multiple networks on a computer.</B></P>
<P>The number of network connections allowed on a computer running Windows&nbsp;95 depends only on the limits of your networking software. (Windows 3.x supported connection to only one network. Windows for Workgroups&nbsp;3.11 allowed simultaneous connection to only two networks.) For information, see Chapter 32, "Windows 95 Network Architecture."</P>
<P><B>Plug and Play networking support.</B></P>
<P>You can insert or remove a PCMCIA network adapter while the computer is running, and Windows&nbsp;95 assigns the required resources automatically and makes or removes the network connection. For any network adapter that uses an NDIS 3.1 driver, you can remove a docking unit without turning off the computer. If you disconnect the network cable from a computer running Windows&nbsp;95 with Plug and Play components, the system continues to function. With most real-mode network clients, this causes the system to stall. For more information, see "Plug and Play Networking Overview" later in this chapter.</P>
<P><B>Unified logon, login script processing, and resource browsing.</B></P>
<P>You can use the Windows&nbsp;95 unified user logon and password caching to log on to Windows&nbsp;NT, Novell NetWare, and other networks. Automatic login script processing is provided for Microsoft and NetWare networks. Users can access network resources by using Network Neighborhood or common dialog boxes, such as the Open or Save As dialog boxes. For more information, see Chapter 11, "Logon, Browsing, and Resource Sharing."</P>
<P><B>Automatic reconnection for lost server connections.</B></P>
<P>When servers are available again after the loss of a network connection, Windows&nbsp;95 reconnects automatically and rebuilds the user's environment, including connection status, drive mappings, and printer connections.</P>
<P></P>
<P><B>Client-side caching of network data with protected-mode clients.</B></P>
<P>A protected-mode network client is a file system driver that uses the same 32-bit cache (VCACHE) used by all Windows&nbsp;95 file system drivers, so it can cache network data for quick access. Files read across the network are copied to the RAM cache and made available to applications much faster than they would by rereading the file across the network. For a given file request, the cache is checked for the needed data before checking the network. This feature is available when running Client for NetWare Networks or Client for Microsoft Networks. For more information, see Chapter 20, "Disks and File Systems."</P>
<P><B>Long filenames for network resources.</B></P>
<P>Computers running Windows&nbsp;95 can recognize and use long filenames on other computers running Windows&nbsp;95, on Windows&nbsp;NT servers, and on NetWare 3.x and 4.x volumes that have been configured to use the OS/2&reg; namespace. For more information, see Chapter 20, "Disks and File Systems."</P>
<P><B>Support for the Win32 WinNet interface.</B></P>
<P>This is an API that allows developers to create applications that run unmodified on different networks. The Win32 WinNet interface in Windows&nbsp;95 supports 16-bit and 32-bit applications (as opposed to the WinNet interface in Windows 3.x, which supports only 16-bit applications). For information, see Chapter 32, "Windows 95 Network Architecture."</P>
<P><B>User profiles and system policies for automatic configuration.</B></P>
<P>To take advantage of system policies, the computer must be running a protected-mode network client such as Microsoft Client for NetWare Networks or Client for Microsoft Networks. For information, see Chapter 15, "User Profiles and System Policies."</P>
<P></P>
<P><B>Agents for network backup and remote management.</B></P>
<P>Windows&nbsp;95 includes backup agents for Cheyenne&reg; ARCserve and Arcada&reg; Backup Exec. Agents for Simple Network Management Protocols (SNMP) and Microsoft Network Monitor are available in the ADMIN\NETTOOLS directory of the Windows&nbsp;95 compact disc. When the correct system management agent is installed on client computers, you can use a service such as HP&reg; Open View or Microsoft Systems Management Server to manage workstations remotely. For information about remote administration, see Chapter 16, "Remote Administration."</P>
<P><B>Dial-up networking for remote access.</B></P>
<P>Windows&nbsp;95 supports multiple protocols for remote access, including TCP/IP, IPX/SPX and the industry standard, Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP). For information about remote access protocols and connection types, see Chapter 28, "Dial-Up Networking and Mobile Computing."</P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
