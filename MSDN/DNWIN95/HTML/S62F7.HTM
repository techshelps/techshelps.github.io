<h3>Issues for Peer-to-Peer Networks</H3><P></P>
<P>In the peer-to-peer networking model, at least one computer must — but each computer can — act as both a client and a server. As a client in a peer network, the computer can access the network resources shared on another computer. A peer network can be an appropriate networking solution for small offices with only five to ten users. </P>
<P>Any computer running Windows&nbsp;95 can act as both a client and a server on peer networks. If you have the technical expertise, you can establish the wiring for a small peer network using Windows&nbsp;95 yourself; otherwise, use the services of a system integrator. The following sections summarize issues either you or the system integrator need to consider for peer networking with Windows&nbsp;95. For technical information about configuring and using File and Printer Sharing for Microsoft Networks, see Chapter 11, "Logon, Browsing, and Resource Sharing."</P>
<H4><A NAME="sec0"></A>Choosing Thinnet or Twisted Pair for Cabling</H4><P></P>
<P>Thinnet (also called thin-Ethernet or Thin Coax) is the simplest method of cabling 10 or fewer connections on a network. Thinnet cabling uses coaxial cable with a BNC connector at each end. The cable attaches to each computer with a BNC T-connector. The major disadvantage in using thinnet cabling is that if there is a fault in the cabling at any computer, it affects all computers on the network. Thinnet cabling is only appropriate for Ethernet topologies. </P>
<P>Unshielded Twisted Pair cabling (called VTP or twisted pair) cabling is based on common telephone wiring technology, using connectors similar to those inserted in telephone jacks. Twisted-pair cabling is appropriate if your network has or will have more than 10 computers, and if computers are located in low-noise environments such as an office — it's not appropriate for manufacturing or warehousing environments. You can use twisted-pair cabling for Ethernet or token-ring networks.</P>
<P>When cabling the network, make sure not to use twisted-pair wiring that was previously used for telephone systems or that is more than five years old. To make the network active, you need additional components such as hubs and concentrators. These components help to isolate cabling failures. </P>
<H4><A NAME="sec1"></A>Choosing the Peer Network Components</H4><P></P>
<P>This section summarizes issues for networking components and organization.</P>
<P><B>Choosing protocols and other networking components.</B></P>
<P>Microsoft NetBEUI is a fast protocol, requiring no additional configuration settings; it is a good choice for peer-to-peer networks. The IPX/SPX-compatible protocol is another alternative for small peer-to-peer networks. You also need an NDIS 3.1 network adapter driver. For information about these components, see Chapter 12, "Network Technical Discussion."</P>
<P><B>Setting up security and automated backup.</B></P>
<P>Share-level security is the only security option available on peer-to-peer networks. With share-level security, you create passwords to control access to shared resources on a peer server. For information about managing passwords for Windows&nbsp;95, see Chapter 14, "Security." If you need to control access to files or to particular computers based on user identity, create a server-based network. </P>
<P>You can use any backup software that is compatible with Windows&nbsp;95 to back up files on peer servers and other computers. To make sure data on the network is backed up automatically, use a server-based network. </P>
<P><B>Setting up peer servers.</B></P>
<P>Each computer that is running File and Printer Sharing for Microsoft Networks can act as a server, so that other computers can connect to it to use files or printers created on that peer server. Because work on a peer server can slow down if many users are using services on the peer server, you might want to dedicate one computer as a print server. In this configuration, users can return to work immediately after printing, and the dedicated computer can manage the print queue.</P>
<P>For optimal performance on each computer that is extensively used as a file or print server, use the System option in Control Panel to optimize the performance of the file system for supporting network server activities. For information, see Chapter 17, "Performance Tuning."</P>
<P><B>Managing a peer network.</B></P>
<P>Most of the remote administration features in Windows 95 rely on user-level security, which requires a server running Windows&nbsp;NT or NetWare to provide pass-through authentication of users for access to resources on remote computers. Therefore, on peer-to-peer networks, you cannot use Microsoft Remote Registry services, or any administrative features that require remote access to the Registry. However, you can use Net Watcher to manage the file system on remote computers, as described in Chapter 16, "Remote Administration."</P>
<P>If you want to take advantage of remote administrative features or user-level security, consider a small server-based network using Windows NT.</P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
