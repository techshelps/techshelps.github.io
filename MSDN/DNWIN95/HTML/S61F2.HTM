<h3>System Requirements for Windows 95</H3><P>The following table describes the basic hardware requirements for running Windows&nbsp;95 from the hard disk of a local computer. Windows&nbsp;95 is designed for computers that use Intel x86-based processors; it cannot be installed on any other processor. Windows&nbsp;95 does not have symmetric multiple processor (SMP) support and, therefore, cannot take advantage of multiple processors (as Windows&nbsp;NT does). For information about requirements for shared installations, see Chapter 4, "Server-Based Setup for Windows 95."</P>

<P>For installing Windows&nbsp;95 to run from a local hard disk, a high-density floppy disk drive and hard disk drive are required.</P>
<P>For installing Windows&nbsp;95 as a shared installation, the computer does not need a hard disk or floppy disk drive.</P>
<P>You cannot install Windows&nbsp;95 on a 80386 computer that has a B-step processor (that is, with ID 0303).</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP"><P>Peripheral</P></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP"><P>Mouse or equivalent pointing device</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP"><P>Memory</P></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP"><P>4 MB of RAM (minimum); 8 MB (recommended)</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP"><P>Video display</P></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP"><P>VGA (minimum); Super VGA (recommended)</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP"><P>Disk space</P></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP"><P>20 MB of free hard-disk space is required for a local installation.

<P>The full custom installation requires a minimum of 19 MB. A compact installation requires 10&nbsp;MB of disk space.</P>
<P>You also need a certain amount free disk space for a swap file, depending on how much RAM the computer has. As a guideline, you need at least 14&nbsp;MB of memory, which can be divided between RAM and hard disk space. For example, if the computer has 4&nbsp;MB of RAM, you need at least 10&nbsp;MB of free disk space for a swap file. If the computer has 16&nbsp;MB of memory, you will need very little disk space for a swap file.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP"><P>Optional</P></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP"><P>Modem (for The Microsoft Network and other components) <BR>CD-ROM drive <BR>Network adapter (required for networking) <BR>Sound card <BR>Other multimedia hardware components</P></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>
