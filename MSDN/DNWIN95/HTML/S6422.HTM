<h2>Using the Windows 95 Password Cache</H2><P>Keeping track of multiple passwords can be a problem for users. Often, they either forget the passwords or write them down and post lists of passwords near their computers. When this happens, the security policy is no longer doing the job it was meant to do — to allow access to those who should have it and to deny access to those who shouldn't.</P>
<P>Windows&nbsp;95 solves this problem by storing passwords for resources in a password list file (.PWL). This file stores passwords for the following network resources: </P>
<UL><LI>Resources on a computer running Windows&nbsp;95 protected by share-level security</LI><LI>Applications that are password-protected: these applications must be specifically written to the Master Password API</LI><LI>Windows&nbsp;NT computers that don't participate in a domain, or the Windows&nbsp;NT logon password if it isn't the Primary Network Logon</LI><LI>NetWare servers</LI></UL><P>The password list file is stored in the Windows directory on the local computer. Each resource typically has its own password. The password file is encrypted by using an algorithm. An unencrypted password is never sent across the network. </P>
<P><b>Caution</b></P>
<P>If you delete .PWL files, you will lose all previously stored passwords. You will need to retype each password.</P>
<P>Password caching is enabled by default when you install Windows&nbsp;95. When you access a password-protected resource for the first time, make sure the Save This Password In Your Password List option is checked to save the password to the password list file. </P>

<P><b>Note</b></P>
<P>If, during logon, you click the Cancel button to bypass the logon screen, the cache will not be opened and you will be prompted for a password each time you attempt to use a protected resource. </P>
<P>You can disable password caching by using System Policy Editor.</P>
<H3><A NAME="sec0"></A>To disable password caching by using system policies</H3><OL><LI>In System Policy Editor, double-click the Local Computer icon. </LI><LI>In the Local Computer Properties, click Network, and then click Passwords.</LI><LI>Click the policy named Disable Password Caching. 
<P>For more information, see Chapter 15, "User Profiles and System Policies."</P></LI></OL><P><B>Note</B>   If you have any share-level security servers and you disable password caching and are running Client for Microsoft Networks, you should not use the Quick Logon feature in the Network option in Control Panel. </P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
