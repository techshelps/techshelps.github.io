<h3>Installing and Sharing Applications Across the Network</H3>
<P>You can share most applications on a network by installing them on a network computer and then creating a shortcut to them. Users can run the application by double-clicking the shortcut or by double-clicking the application's icon in Network Neighborhood. </P>
<H4><A NAME="sec0"></A>To share an application on the network</H4><OL><LI>Install an application on a network server or workstation, as described in the documentation from the vendor.</LI><LI>In Network Neighborhood, right-click the icon for the application, and then click Create Shortcut. Windows&nbsp;95 asks if you want to create a shortcut on the desktop. </LI></OL><P>For more information about creating shortcuts, see online Help. For information about creating and distributing custom shortcuts using system policies, see Chapter 15, "User Profiles and System Policies."</P>
<P><b>Tip</B></P>
<P>In general, Windows&nbsp;95 doesn't allow you to specify a working directory in the properties sheet of a Win16-based application. This is because the program file has links assigned to it that rely on unchanging data. However, you can achieve the same effect by creating a shortcut for the application and specifying a working directory in the Start In box in the properties for the shortcut. </P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
