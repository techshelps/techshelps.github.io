<h2>Using Network Backup Agents</H2><P>You can back up user data remotely by using either of the two network-based backup agents included with Windows&nbsp;95. The Arcada&reg;  (Backup Exec Agent) and Cheyenne&reg; backup agents, allows you to back up computers to a tape drive on a network server. You must have the corresponding server-based network backup software from either Arcada or Cheyenne. </P>
<P>The following sections describe how to install these backup agents on an individual computer, with a summary of the steps for running network-based backup when the agent is installed. </P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
