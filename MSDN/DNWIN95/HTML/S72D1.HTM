<h3>WinNet16 Interface</H3><P>The WinNet16 interface is the earlier set of network-independent APIs introduced with Windows&nbsp;3.0 and enhanced in Windows&nbsp;3.1. WinNet16 provides simple functionality such as connecting to a drive letter or redirecting a printer port to a network printer. Windows&nbsp;95 provides support for using a single WinNet16 driver.</P>
<P>If a network vendor provides a WinNet16 network driver developed for Windows&nbsp;3.1 and has not written a 32-bit network provider and file system driver for Windows&nbsp;95, using the WinNet16 interface and WINNET16.DLL is the only way to support that network in Windows&nbsp;95. The WinNet16 driver that currently works with Windows&nbsp;3.1 can be used without modification under Windows&nbsp;95, using the WINNET16.DLL.</P>
<P>If Windows&nbsp;95 Setup detects a Windows&nbsp;3.x installation that uses a WinNet16 network driver and there is no 32-bit network provider available, Windows&nbsp;95 Setup keeps the 16-bit network driver in place and provides network functionality with the 16-bit network driver installed as the primary network.</P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
