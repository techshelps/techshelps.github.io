<h3>Unified System Logon Basics</H3><P>Windows&nbsp;95 offers a consistent user interface for logging on to and validating access to network resources. The first time the user logs on to Windows&nbsp;95, logon dialog boxes appear for each network client on that computer and for Windows&nbsp;95. If the user's password for Windows 95 or for another network is made the same as the password for the primary logon client, Windows 95 automatically logs the user on to Windows&nbsp;95 and all networks using that password every time the user logs on. This means that, for users, network logon is simplified in that a single logon dialog box is presented each time the operating system starts. For network administrators, it means they can use existing user accounts to validate access to the network for users running Windows&nbsp;95. </P>
<P><b>Note</b></P>
<P>The Passwords option in Control Panel provides a way to synchronize logon passwords for different networks so they can be made the same if one is changed. For more information, see Chapter 14, "Security." </P>
<P>When a user logs on to other networks with different passwords and chooses to save them, the passwords are stored in a password cache. The Windows&nbsp;95 password unlocks this password cache. Thereafter, Windows 95 uses the passwords stored in the password cache to log a user on to other networks so no additional passwords need to be typed. </P>
<P>For NetWare networks, Windows&nbsp;95 provides graphical logon to Novell NetWare versions 3.x, or 4.x if the network is configured for bindery emulation, plus a NetWare-compatible login script processor. This means that if you are using Microsoft Client for NetWare Networks, Windows&nbsp;95 can process NetWare login scripts. If drive mappings and search drives are specified in a login script, then under Windows&nbsp;95 the same user configuration is used for network connections as was specified under the previous operating system, with no administrative changes necessary. </P>
<P>For Microsoft networks, Windows&nbsp;95 supports network logon using domain user accounts and login script processing (as supported by LAN Manager version&nbsp;2.x and Windows&nbsp;NT).</P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
