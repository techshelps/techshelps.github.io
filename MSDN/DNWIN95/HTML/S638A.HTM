<h2>Overview of Logging on to Windows 95</H2><P>There can be two levels of system logon on Microsoft or NetWare networks:</P>
<UL><LI>Log on to Windows&nbsp;95 by using a user name and a password that is cached locally</LI><LI>Log on to a NetWare network or a Windows&nbsp;NT domain for validation, "Overview of Logging on to Windows 95" earlier in this chapter </LI></UL><P>When other network vendors make 32-bit, protected-mode networking clients available, network logon will be automatically available for those networks because of the Windows&nbsp;95 network provider interface, as described in Chapter 32, "Windows 95 Network Architecture."</P>
<P>Windows&nbsp;95 provides a single unified logon prompt. This prompt allows the user to log on to all networks and Windows&nbsp;95 at the same time. The first time a user starts Windows&nbsp;95, there are separate logon prompts for each network, plus one for Windows&nbsp;95. If these passwords are made identical, the logon prompt for Windows&nbsp;95 is not displayed again. </P>
<P>Logging on to Windows&nbsp;95 unlocks the password cache file (.PWL) that caches encrypted passwords. This is the only logon prompt that appears if no other network clients are configured on that computer.</P>
<H3><A NAME="sec0"></A>To log on to Windows&nbsp;95 when no other network logon is configured</H3><UL><LI>When the Welcome to Windows dialog box appears after starting Windows&nbsp;95 for the first time, specify the user name and password.</LI></UL><P><img src="RK11_01A.gif"></P>
<P>Windows&nbsp;95 uses this logon information to identify the user and to find any user profile information. User profiles define user preferences, such as the fonts and colors used on the desktop, and access information for the user. (For more information, see Chapter 15, "User Profiles and System Policies.")</P>
<H3><A NAME="sec1"></A>To log on to Windows&nbsp;95 on a Microsoft network</H3>
<OL><LI>When the Enter Network Password dialog box appears after starting Windows&nbsp;95 for the first time, specify the user name and password.
<P>For network logon on a Microsoft network, type the name of the Windows&nbsp;NT domain, LAN Manager domain, or Windows NT computer that contains the related user account.</P>

<P><B>This dialog box appears for logging on to Windows&nbsp;NT networks</B></P>

<P><img src="RK11_01G.gif"></P>

<P>After the user name and password pair are validated by the network server, the user is allowed to use resources on the network. If the user is not validated, the user cannot gain access to network resources.</P></LI><LI>The first time Windows&nbsp;95 starts, the Welcome to Windows dialog box appears, prompting you to type the user name and password defined for Windows&nbsp;95.</LI></OL>
<H3><A NAME="sec2"></A>To log on to Windows&nbsp;95 on a NetWare network</H3><OL><LI>To log on to a NetWare network, type the name of the NetWare server, which is the preferred server where the related user account is stored.
<P><B>This dialog box appears for logging on to NetWare networks</B></P>

<P><img src="RK11_02A.gif"></P>

<P>After the user name and password pair are validated by the NetWare server, the user is allowed to use resources on the network. If the user is not validated, the user will be prompted to type a password when connecting to a NetWare server during this work session.</P></LI><LI>The first time Windows&nbsp;95 starts, the Welcome to Windows dialog box appears, prompting you to type the user name and password defined for Windows&nbsp;95. Type this information and click OK.</LI></OL><P>The next time this computer is started, Windows&nbsp;95 displays the name of the last user who logged on and the name of the domain or preferred server used for validation. If the same user is logging on again, only the password for the network server or domain needs to be entered. If another user is logging on, that user's unique user name and password must be entered. If the passwords are the same for the network and Windows&nbsp;95, the second dialog box for logging on to Windows&nbsp;95 does not appear again.</P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
