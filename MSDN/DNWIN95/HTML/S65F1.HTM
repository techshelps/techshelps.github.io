<h2>Using Microsoft Print Services for NetWare </H2><P>Windows&nbsp;95 includes a Win32-based utility called Microsoft Print Services for NetWare (MSPSRV.EXE), which has some of the capabilities of a NetWare PSERVER. This utility allows a NetWare server (version 2.15 or later) to direct print jobs (despool) to computers running Windows&nbsp;95. The computer running Windows&nbsp;95 must also be running Microsoft Client for NetWare Networks, but does not need to run File and Printer Sharing for NetWare Networks. </P>
<P>A NetWare PSERVER must be a dedicated computer unlike a computer running Windows&nbsp;95 with Microsoft Print Services for NetWare that runs in the background using no resource except for data packet polling at a set interval. This means it won't interfere with other things the user wants to do on that computer. </P>
<P><img src="RK23_09.gif"></P>
<P>Microsoft Print Services for NetWare uses the queue management services (QMS) API for queue services. It can service one queue for printing to a single printer that is locally attached to a computer running Windows&nbsp;95. </P>
<P>When you enable the service, it logs on to the NetWare print server, attaches to the print queue, and gets a handle. Then it polls the NetWare print server and receives a header that includes information about how to complete the print job. For example, the header might include information about whether to use a banner, how many copies to print, and other information. Next, Microsoft Print Services for NetWare reads data from the job in the queue and uses Win32 calls to print to the printer. When the job is printed, it returns a call to the NetWare print server.</P>
<P>Microsoft Print Services for NetWare is provided on the Windows&nbsp;95 compact disc in the ADMIN\NETTOOLS\PRTAGENT directory.</P>
<H3><A NAME="sec0"></A>To install Microsoft Print Services for NetWare</H3><OL><LI>In the Network option in Control Panel, click Add.</LI><LI>In the Select Network Component Type dialog box, click Service, and then click Add.</LI><LI>In the Select Network Service dialog box, click Have Disk, and then type the path to the ADMIN\NETTOOLS\PRTAGENT directory. </LI></OL><H3><A NAME="sec1"></A>To enable the Microsoft Print Server for NetWare</H3><OL><LI>Before you set up Microsoft Print Server for NetWare, check the NetWare print server and the computer running MS-DOS and is configured as the PSERVER to make sure they are both working correctly. 
<P>If you see the following message, you will know that the NetWare print server is not configured correctly:</P></LI></OL><UL><LI>Cannot determine print queue name.</LI></UL><OL><LI>In the Printers folder on the computer running Windows&nbsp;95, right-click the printer to which the NetWare print queue will direct jobs, and then click Properties in the context menu.</LI><LI>In the print server properties, click Enable Microsoft Print Server For NetWare.
<P><img src="RK23_10.gif"></P></LI><LI>From the list of servers, click the NetWare server on which the queue resides. 
<P><B>Note</B>   You must have access to this server; only those NetWare servers to which you have access are listed. Access is determined by the user account under which you logged on to the network.</P>

<P>When a NetWare server is selected, the available print server appears in the Print Server list.</P></LI><LI>Adjust the time interval for polling the print queue, and then click OK. 
<P>This setting can be adjusted as high as 15 seconds for maximum print server performance, or as low as three minutes for increased local performance. The default is 30 seconds. Click OK.</P>

<P><B>Note</B>   Windows 95 supports only three ports for Microsoft Client for NetWare Networks.</P></LI></OL></FONT></BODY></HTML>
