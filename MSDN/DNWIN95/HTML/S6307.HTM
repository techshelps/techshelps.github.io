<h3>Running Windows 95 with LAN Manager</H3><P>Either Windows&nbsp;95 or Windows&nbsp;NT Server can be installed as upgrades for all versions of LAN Manager and IBM OS/2&reg; LAN Server, depending on the role you want that computer to serve on the network. Microsoft recommends that you upgrade these servers, rather than maintain these legacy systems on your network.</P>
<P>A workgroup in Windows&nbsp;95 is analogous to a LAN Manager domain in that it's a logical grouping of workstations. However, a workgroup in Windows&nbsp;95 does not share any of the advanced security features offered as part of a LAN Manager domain. Windows&nbsp;95 does not support using a LAN Manager domain controller as a security provider, so only share-level security can be used for computers running Windows&nbsp;95 on LAN Manager networks. (User-level security requires a Windows&nbsp;NT domain.)</P>
<P>To ensure computers running Windows&nbsp;95 can browse for LAN Manager servers, make sure that at least one computer running Client for Microsoft Networks sets its workgroup name to the LAN Manager domain name. After a computer running Windows&nbsp;95 becomes a member of the LAN Manager domain, it can distribute the names of LAN Manager servers in that domain to other computers running Windows&nbsp;95 on the network. The configuration must be duplicated for each LAN Manager domain.</P>
<H4><A NAME="sec0"></A>To ensure LAN Manager workstations can see and access resources on computers running File and Printer Sharing Services for Microsoft Networks</H4><OL><LI>Make sure that all the computers are using a common protocol.</LI><LI>Make sure that users running LAN Manager clients have been granted access to the resources on the computers running Windows&nbsp;95.</LI><LI>Set the value of the LM Announce property to Yes on each computer running Windows&nbsp;95 with File and Printer Sharing services, as described in "Configuring File and Printer Sharing for Microsoft Networks" in Chapter 11, "Logon, Browsing, and Resource Sharing."</LI></OL><P>The LM Announce setting ensures that the computer running Windows&nbsp;95 peer resource sharing services announces its presence to LAN Manager workstations and servers. By default, the LM Announce property is set to No to reduce broadcast traffic on the network.</P>
<H4><A NAME="sec1"></A>Tips for LAN Manager Variations</H4><P>IBM OS/2 LAN Server supports a domain model and is equivalent to LAN Manager for interoperating with Windows&nbsp;95. Just as with Windows for Workgroups, the Client for Microsoft Networks in Windows&nbsp;95 does not support LAN Server aliases.</P>
<P>DEC PATHWORKS is a LAN Manager-compatible network, but it does not support a domain model for browsing servers and shared resources. DEC PATHWORKS servers will appear in Network Neighborhood.</P>
<P>For more information about both of these networks, see Chapter 10, "Windows 95 on Other Networks."</P>
