<h2>Server-Based Setup: An Overview</H2><P></P>
<P>To install Windows&nbsp;95 source files on the network and create setup scripts, you must run Server-based Setup under Windows&nbsp;95, and follow the instructions to do the following:</P>
<UL><LI>Copy the Windows&nbsp;95 source files onto the server, as described in "Task 1: Copying Windows 95 Files to a Server" later in this chapter.
<P>This is the only step required to make Windows 95 source files available for running Windows&nbsp;95 Setup from a network source.</P></LI><LI>For shared installations, create a machine directory for each computer, as described in "Task 2: Creating Machine Directories" later in this chapter. This step is required for floppy disk-based and remote-boot installations. For computers that start from the hard disk, you must run Windows&nbsp;95 Setup on each computer, even if the computer will use a machine directory on the network.</LI><LI>Create setup scripts for automated installation of Windows&nbsp;95 on client computers, as described in Chapter 5, "Custom, Automated, and Push Installations."</LI></UL><P>The following illustration summarizes the main tasks that are performed using Server-based Setup.</P>
<P><img src="RK04_01.gif"></P>
<P>After you have completed these preliminary tasks, you can run Windows&nbsp;95 Setup to complete the installation, as described in "Installing Windows 95 for Shared Installations" later in this chapter.</P>
<P></P>
<P><B>Note</B>   Run Windows&nbsp;95 Setup from the directory where SETUP.EXE is stored. In Windows&nbsp;3.x, you had to switch to the directory you were setting up before running <B>setup /n</B>. This is no longer necessary in Windows&nbsp;95.</P>
<P>The files that make up Server-based Setup are uncompressed files in the ADMIN\NETTOOLS\NETSETUP directory on the Windows&nbsp;95 compact disc. The program can be run directly from the compact disc, which is the recommended method. </P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
