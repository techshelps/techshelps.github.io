<h3>Configuring a Windows 95 Dial-Up Server</H3><P>With Dial-Up Networking, you can configure a computer running Windows&nbsp;95 to be a remote access server for dial-up clients running Windows&nbsp;95, Windows for Workgroups, or Windows 3.1. The Windows&nbsp;95 dial-up server can act as a gateway to an IPX/SPX or NetBEUI network, or as a server to the client, sharing its file and printing resources with one dial-up client at a time.</P>
<P><b>Note</b></P>
<P>Dial-up server capabilities are only available if you purchase the Microsoft Plus! for Windows&nbsp;95. For information, please contact your Microsoft sales representative. </P>
<P>A Windows&nbsp;95 dial-up server differs from the Windows&nbsp;NT 3.5 dial up server in the following ways:</P>
<UL><LI>Windows&nbsp;NT 3.5 Server can act as an IP router, and Windows&nbsp;95 cannot. IP router capabilities permit accessing a TCP/IP network, such as the global Internet. Windows&nbsp;95 provides all the protocols you need to connect to the Internet, but cannot act as an IP router. Consequently, you need to connect a computer running Windows&nbsp;95 to a server with IP router capabilities in order to connect to the Internet. </LI><LI>Windows&nbsp;NT 3.5 supports 256 remote connections, whereas Windows&nbsp;95 provides one remote connection.</LI><LI>Windows&nbsp;NT 3.5 allows you to remotely administer the remote access server, whereas Windows&nbsp;95 requires you to use system policies to remotely administer the server. For more information about system policies, see Chapter 15, "User Profiles and System Policies."</LI></UL><P>The Windows&nbsp;95 dial-up server supports the following remote access clients: </P>
<UL><LI>Windows&nbsp;95 dial-up client</LI><LI>Windows for Workgroups </LI><LI>Windows 3.1 RAS client</LI><LI>Clients running PPP</LI></UL><P>A Windows&nbsp;95 dial-up server with the appropriate network protocols installed can act as a NetBIOS gateway, as illustrated in the following graphic.</P>

<P>For more information about connectivity options of a Windows&nbsp;95 dial-up server, see "Overview of Dial-Up Networking" earlier in this chapter.</P>
<P>Configuring a computer running Windows&nbsp;95 to be a dial-up server consists of the following steps:</P>
<UL><LI>Enabling File and Printer Sharing services for either Microsoft or NetWare networks on the dial-up server. For information, see Chapter 11, "Logon, Browsing, and Resource Sharing."</LI><LI>Enabling user-level or share-level security on the dial-up server. For information, see "Using Security with Dial-Up Networking" later in this chapter.</LI><LI>Configuring dial-up server capabilities in Dial-Up Networking. For information, see the following procedure.</LI></UL><H4><A NAME="sec0"></A>To configure a computer as a dial-up server</H4><OL><LI>From the Connections menu in the Dial-Up Networking, click the Connections menu, and then click Dial-Up Server. </LI><LI>In the Dial-Up Server dialog box, click Allow Caller Access. This dialog box will look different depending on whether you have enabled user-level or share-level security for the computer. </LI><LI>Optionally, click Change Password to define a call-in password for Dial-Up Networking clients, and then click OK.
<P> – Or –</P>

<P>If you are using user-level security for peer resource sharing, select the users who have access to this dial-up server. Then click OK.</P></LI><LI>Click the Server Type button and then select the server type. 
<P>If you select the Default server type, the dial-up server will automatically start in PPP mode for incoming calls and switch to RAS for Windows&nbsp;NT 3.1 and Windows for Workgroups mode if the PPP negotiation fails. For information on PPP negotiation, see "PPP Dial-Up Sequence" later in this chapter.</P></LI><LI>Click OK, and the dial-up server will be ready to answer incoming calls.</LI></OL><P>Notice that changes to the server type do not apply to a connection that is currently open. Changes will apply to any future connections made to this computer.</P>
<H4><A NAME="sec1"></A>To disconnect any users who are currently connected to this computer through Dial-Up Networking</H4><UL><LI>In the Dial-Up Server dialog box, click the Disconnect User button.</LI></UL><P><B>Note</B>   The Windows&nbsp;95 Dial-Up Server can use only one modem at a time. You can enable caller access on multiple modems at any one time, but only one modem can be connected. </P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
