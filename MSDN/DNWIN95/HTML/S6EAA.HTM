<h3>Testing Lab Setup and Equipment</H3><P>To effectively evaluate and test the Windows&nbsp;95 installation process, you need to set aside enough physical space and assemble a sufficient number of computers to test everything from Server-based Setup to hand-tuning options for the local computer. In addition, if your network environment includes the use of portable computers that dial in to the company, or if you use additional servers or mainframe computers for business data, you need to make sure that the lab computers have full access to the network and an analog phone line. </P>
<P>It is important that you test and implement all of the Windows&nbsp;95 features comprehensively in the lab with all of your mission-critical and noncritical business applications before moving to the pilot installation.</P>
<P></P>
<P>Installation of Windows&nbsp;95 on a server requires 90 MB of disk space.</P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
