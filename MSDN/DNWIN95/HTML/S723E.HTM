<h2>Overview of Microsoft Fax</H2><P>Users can easily exchange faxes and binary files in Microsoft Fax because it is accessible from the Windows&nbsp;95 desktop, from within applications, or through the Microsoft Exchange inbox. As a 32-bit application, Microsoft Fax works smoothly with other applications created for Windows&nbsp;95 through its support for MAPI, telephony API (TAPI), and OLE. The Send option in the File menu within any MAPI-enabled application (for example, Microsoft Excel or Word) will activate the Microsoft Exchange Send dialog box. The document appears as an icon attached to the electronic mail message. </P>
<P>To configure Microsoft Fax, do the following:</P>
<UL><LI>Install and configure a modem for sending and receiving faxes. For more information, see Chapter 25, "Modems and Communications Tools."</LI><LI>Install Microsoft Exchange and Microsoft Fax. The Microsoft Exchange Setup wizard will guide you through the installation procedure.</LI><LI>Add Microsoft Fax to Microsoft Exchange. </LI></UL><P></P>
<P>After Microsoft Fax is configured, users can easily exchange rendered faxes and binary files. Because Microsoft Fax is provided with Windows&nbsp;95 as a basic service, it is always available from within applications created for Windows&nbsp;95 or through the Microsoft Exchange inbox. Faxes are always received in a user's Microsoft Exchange inbox. </P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
