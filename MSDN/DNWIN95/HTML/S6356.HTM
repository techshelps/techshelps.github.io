<h3>Search Mode with Windows 95 on NetWare Networks</H3><P>Many applications, when started, also open a number of other files (such as overlay files and data files) that are used as application resources. To find these files, older NetWare-aware applications, such as the FILER version 3.x NetWare utility, look for files in NetWare search drives in these ways:</P>
<UL><LI>Using the PATH environment to search for executable files</LI><LI>Using a NetWare search path to find supporting files, such as required data files</LI></UL><P>Under Windows&nbsp;95, the search mode defines how files are found, depending on the network client you use, as described in the following table.</P>

<P><BR></P><P>If you see an error message that a supporting file could not be found, the search mode is not set properly, or you are not opening the application from the correct place. For example, in FILER, the message might be: "System message library file SYS$MSG.DAT could not be opened." In such a case, you will have to set the search mode.</P>
<P><B>Note</B>   Most newer NetWare-aware applications and utilities, such as SYSCON, do not use search mode to find auxiliary files.</P>
<H4><A NAME="sec0"></A>To set the search mode in Windows&nbsp;95</H4><OL><LI>From the File menu in System Policy Editor, click Open Registry. Then click the icon for Local Computer.
<P>For more information about using System Policy Editor in Registry mode, see Chapter 15, "User Profiles and System Policies."</P></LI><LI>Click Network, click Microsoft Client for NetWare Networks, and then click Search Mode.</LI><LI>Specify a setting based on the table following this procedure. Then shut down and restart the computer. </LI></OL><P>You can also use system policies to define the search mode for multiple computers.</P>
<P>Search Mode has five settings: Modes 1 (also shown as 0), 2, 3, 5, and 7. (Modes 4 and 6 are not used currently.) Check your application documentation to determine whether the application only reads its supporting files, or reads and writes to them. The search mode applies to all applications that use it, so select the mode that works for most programs. </P>
