<h3>Editing MSBATCH.INF for Custom Settings</H3><P>After you have used Server-based Setup or BATCH.EXE to create a setup script in MSBATCH.INF format, you can edit and save this file with a text editor to create alternate or more detailed setup scripts.</P>
<H4><A NAME="sec0"></A>To edit MSBATCH.INF</H4><OL><LI>Use a text editor such as Notepad to open the MSBATCH.INF file.</LI><LI>Edit the file, and save it in text-only format.</LI></OL><P>The following are the editing guidelines for MSBATCH.INF:</P>
<UL><LI>Each section starts with a unique section name enclosed in brackets ([&nbsp;]). </LI><LI>Any sections other than those defined in Appendix D, "MSBATCH.INF Parameters" are not evaluated by Windows&nbsp;95 Setup. </LI><LI>Each section can contain one or more entries. The typical entry consists of a key word and a value separated by an equal sign. </LI><LI>Key words within a section do not have to be unique, but each key word and its value should follow the guidelines for that key word, as defined in Appendix D, "MSBATCH.INF Parameters." </LI><LI>A comment can be included anywhere on a line by starting the comment with a semicolon. </LI></UL><H4><A NAME="sec1"></A>Tip for Defining Custom Entries in Setup Scripts</H4><P>Use the Custom Setup option to install Windows&nbsp;95 on a single computer. You can define all the optional components and other items you want installed for other similar computers at your site.</P>
<P>After Windows&nbsp;95 is completely installed on this single computer, you can use any text editor to copy the [OptionalComponents], [Setup], [NameAndOrg], and [System] sections from SETUPLOG.TXT in the computer's root directory. Add this information to define settings for the same sections in the custom setup script. </P>
<P>This is especially useful for defining entries for [OptionalComponents] or when many computers require the same [System] settings. Some settings for the [Network] section can also be copied from SETUPLOG.TXT.</P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
