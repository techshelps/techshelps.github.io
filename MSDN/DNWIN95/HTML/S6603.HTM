<h3>Deferred Printing Support </H3><P>The Windows&nbsp;95 printing subsystem features support for deferred printing. This capability allows users not connected to a printer to generate print jobs, which are stored on their local computers for later printing. This feature is available only if a computer is on a network or is a portable computer that has been removed from its docking station. It is useful when working at a remote site, or when a network printer connection is temporarily lost because of network or printer problems. Deferred printing works with print jobs created in Win16-based, Win32-based, or MS-DOS – based applications. </P>
