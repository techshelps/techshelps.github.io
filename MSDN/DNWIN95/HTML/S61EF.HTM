<h3>Operating System Requirements</H3><P>You must install the retail version of Windows&nbsp;95 as an upgrade over an existing operating system. You can install Windows&nbsp;95 over a number of different operating systems, including MS-DOS, Windows, and Windows for Workgroups. Windows&nbsp;95 can also be installed over Novell&reg; DR DOS&reg; (or Novell DOS&trade;), PC-DOS, and OS/2, and as a dual-boot operating system with Windows NT.</P>
<P>The minimum operating system software required to install Windows&nbsp;95 is any of the following:</P>
<UL><LI>MS-DOS version 3.2 or higher, or an equivalent version from the hardware manufacturer that supports partitions greater than 32 MB</LI><LI>Windows&nbsp;3.x</LI><LI>Windows for Workgroups 3.1x</LI><LI>Dual-boot OS/2 (with MS-DOS)</LI><LI>Dual-boot Windows NT (with MS-DOS)</LI></UL><H4><A NAME="sec0"></A>Tip for MS-DOS Versions and Windows&nbsp;95 Setup</H4><P>Windows&nbsp;95 Setup attempts to install Windows&nbsp;95 on a computer with an operating system version equivalent to MS-DOS 3.2 only if that version can exceed the 32-MB partition limit (such as COMPAQ&reg; version 3.31) because the operational disk space requirements for Windows&nbsp;95 can exceed the 32-MB partition limitation.</P>
<P>The computer must have MS-DOS version 3.2 or later. Because there are many variations of MS-DOS 3.2, Microsoft recommends you upgrade to Windows&nbsp;95 from MS-DOS version 5.0 or later.</P>
<P>To check the MS-DOS version, type <B>ver</B> at the command prompt.</P>
<P>For information about how Windows&nbsp;95 Setup treats disk partitions created under other operating systems, see "Partition Requirements" later in this chapter. For information about how Windows&nbsp;95 Setup deals with the boot sector and installs files for dual-boot operation with other operating systems, see Chapter 6, "Setup Technical Discussion."</P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
