<h2>Overview of Microsoft Exchange and Windows 95 Messaging </H2><P>The Microsoft Exchange client can communicate with any electronic mail system or messaging application that has a <I>MAPI service provider</I>, which<I> </I>is similar to a personal gateway. It specifies all the connection and addressing settings needed to communicate with a mail server on one end and with the Microsoft Exchange client on the other end. </P>
<P>MAPI is a set of API functions and OLE interface that allows messaging clients, such as Microsoft Exchange, to interact with various message service providers, such as Microsoft Mail and Microsoft Fax. MAPI helps Microsoft Exchange manage stored messages and define the purpose and content of messages. For more information about MAPI, see "Technical Notes on the Microsoft Exchange client and MAPI " later in this chapter. </P>
<P>The Microsoft Exchange client includes an OLE-compatible rich-text editor used for reading and composing messages; it supports the use of bullets, multiple font sizes and colors, and text alignments in messages. </P>
<P>If you install the Microsoft Exchange client, Windows&nbsp;95 provides several MAPI service providers. To install the Microsoft Mail workgroup postoffice to work with Microsoft Exchange, you must select it as a separate component under Microsoft Exchange during Windows&nbsp;95 Setup or afterward by using the Add/Remove Programs option in Control Panel. </P>
<P><B>Microsoft Mail workgroup postoffice.</B></P>
<P>This postoffice is a workgroup edition of the Microsoft Mail Server, allowing one computer to host the postoffice and allowing other users to access that postoffice to send and receive mail. The workgroup postoffice provides the same features as the full Microsoft Mail Server, with the following exceptions:</P>
<UL><LI>No mail exchange with users of other postoffices </LI><LI>No access to Microsoft Mail gateways </LI><LI>Simplified administration tools </LI></UL><P><B>Personal Address Book MAPI service provider.</B></P>
<P>This common address book can store electronic mail addresses and other personal messaging information such as names, phone and fax numbers, and mailing addresses from multiple messaging service providers. A Personal Address Book is accessible from applications that use MAPI. </P>
<P><B>Personal Folder (.PST) MAPI service provider.</B></P>
<P>The Personal Folder stores messages, forms, documents, and other information in a series of hierarchical folders. A Personal Folder acts as a universal inbox and outbox where users can send and receive messages from multiple service providers. </P>
<P><B>Microsoft Mail Services MAPI service provider.</B></P>
<P>This service provider connects the Microsoft Exchange client to either the Microsoft Mail workgroup postoffice or a Microsoft Mail Server (acquired separately) postoffice. To connect a computer running Windows&nbsp;95 to the Microsoft Mail Server postoffices, the postoffices must reside on a network file server (such as Windows&nbsp;NT 3.5 or Novell&reg;NetWare&reg;) that supports the MS-DOS driver redirector. </P>
<P>See "Using the Microsoft Exchange Client with Microsoft Mail Services" later in this chapter for information about configuring and using the Microsoft Exchange client with a Microsoft Mail workgroup postoffice. </P>
<P><B>Microsoft Fax MAPI service provider.</B></P>
<P>This service provider allows the Microsoft Exchange client to send and receive faxes in the same way as electronic mail. You can receive faxes in the same universal inbox as your mail, and use the same Personal Address Book for both mail and fax recipients. For more information, see Chapter 27, "Microsoft Fax." </P>
<P><B>The Microsoft Network MAPI service provider.</B></P>
<P>This service provider allows the Microsoft Exchange client to send and receive mail on The Microsoft Network, an online service accessible from the Windows&nbsp;95 desktop. For more information, see Chapter 29, "The Microsoft Network." </P>
<P><B>Internet Mail MAPI service provider.</B></P>
<P>This service provider allows the Microsoft Exhchange client to send and receive mail directly on the Internet or other networks using the Simple Mail Transport Protocol (SMTP) and the Post Office Protocol 3 (POP3) over TCP/IP. This product is available as part of Microsoft Plus! for Windows&nbsp;95. For information, contact your Microsoft sales representative.</P>
<P><B>CompuServe Mail MAPI service provider.</B></P>
<P>This service provider allows the Microsoft Exchange client to send and receive mail using the CompuServe Mail Services. To use this service provider, you must have an account with CompuServe. For more information, contact CompuServe.</P>
<P><B>Microsoft Exchange Server MAPI service provider.</B></P>
<P>This service provider will allow the Microsoft Exchange client to connect to the Microsoft Exchange server, which is a client-server messaging system that runs on Windows&nbsp;NT Server. This Microsoft product will be available after the first release of Windows&nbsp;95.</P>
<P>Installing the Microsoft Exchange server will provide the Microsoft Exchange client with specific functionality, including the following</P>
<UL><LI>Inbox Assistant, a set of server-based rules for filtering, forwarding, replying to, and deleting messages</LI><LI>Out of Office Assistant, a set of server-based rules for automatically forwarding and replying to mail when users are working away from the office </LI></UL></FONT></BODY></HTML>
