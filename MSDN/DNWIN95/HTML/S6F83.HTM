<h3>Issues for Server-Based Microsoft Networks</H3><P>On server-based networks, central servers running Windows NT Server or Microsoft LAN Manager 2.x act as file and print servers and provide support for managing network logon and security. For information about the benefits of server-based networks using Windows NT Server, see "Running Windows 95 with Windows NT" later in this chapter.</P>
<UL><LI>You must configure Client for Microsoft Networks as the Primary Network Logon client if you want to take advantage of user profiles for configuring or managing custom desktops on a Microsoft network, or if you want users to use system policies stored on a Windows&nbsp;NT server.</LI><LI>To share resources with computers running other Microsoft networking products, the computers must be running a common protocol.</LI><LI>Client for Microsoft Networks can use a LAN Manager domain controller for logon validation. However, File and Printer Sharing Services for Microsoft Networks cannot use a LAN Manager domain controller for pass-through validation. To take advantage of the user-level security support on Microsoft networks, the user must have an account on a Windows&nbsp;NT domain.</LI></UL></FONT></BODY></HTML>
