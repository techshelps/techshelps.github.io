<h3>Planning for Machine Directories</H3><P></P>
<P>For a shared installation on each computer that starts from a floppy disk or a remote-boot disk image, the machine directory is a required network directory that contains the particular files required for that specific configuration. The machine directory contains WIN.COM, the full Registry, and startup configuration files such as SYSTEM.INI.</P>
<P>Both Windows&nbsp;95 Setup and Server-based Setup can create machine directories automatically, as described in "Task 2: Creating Machine Directories" later in this chapter. For shared installations for floppy disk-based and remote-boot workstations, you need to run Windows&nbsp;95 Setup only once for each type of computer configuration. Then you can use Server-based Setup to create machine directories for other computers. You can replicate the startup disks (or boot images) for other computers of the same type.</P>
<P>For computers that start from the hard disk, machine directories are optional; however, you must run Windows&nbsp;95 Setup on each computer that has a hard disk, even if the computer will use a machine directory on the network.</P>
<P>The machine directory is for computer-specific settings. This is different from the individual user directories on Windows&nbsp;NT networks or the individual Mail directories on NetWare networks, which contain user-specific files such as login scripts or user profiles for individual users. Using machine directories offers several benefits:</P>
<UL><LI>Computer-specific settings are saved in a central location, rather than with user-specific settings. So the correct configuration is available for the particular computer, no matter which user logs on.</LI><LI> A single boot image on the network (or single version of the floppy startup disk) can be used to start several computers.</LI><LI>The administrator can easily create and replicate shared Windows&nbsp;95 installations for new computers from a central location, often without having to run Windows&nbsp;95 Setup repeatedly.</LI></UL><P>Windows&nbsp;95 files for a shared installation are stored in the locations described in the following table. </P>
