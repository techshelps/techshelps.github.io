<h2>Configuring Dial-Up Networking Clients and Servers</H2><P>Configuring computers as Dial-Up Networking clients or servers consists of four tasks: </P>
<UL><LI>Installing the appropriate network protocols and making sure they are bound to the Microsoft Dial-Up adapter. All network protocols installed before you install Dial-Up Networking are automatically bound to the Microsoft Dial-Up adapter when you install Dial-Up Networking.</LI><LI>Running the Make New Connection wizard in Dial-Up Networking to set up a connection to a remote access server for the dial-up client. If you have not yet installed a modem, the wizard guides you through installing one. </LI><LI>Configuring the dial-up client in Dial-Up Networking by selecting the remote access server type it will connect to, and by choosing whether to log on to the network after connecting to the remote access server. Selecting the server type automatically enables the correct connection protocol, such as PPP or SLIP.</LI><LI>Optionally, installing dial-up server capabilities and configuring a computer running Windows&nbsp;95 as a dial-up server in the Dial-Up Server menu in Dial-Up Networking.</LI></UL></FONT></BODY></HTML>
