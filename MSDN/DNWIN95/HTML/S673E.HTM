<h2>Using Microsoft Exchange with The Microsoft Network</H2><P>The Microsoft Network has been integrated with the Microsoft Exchange client that is provided with Windows&nbsp;95. All electronic mail messages sent to or from other members of The Microsoft Network appear in the same mailbox as messages from other electronic mail (such as LAN mail), or information services such as CompuServe&reg; or the Internet. </P>
<P>All features of Microsoft Exchange are available to users when users run The Microsoft Network. Because both Microsoft Exchange and The Microsoft Network support binary file transfers and OLE, users can attach spreadsheets, graphics files, word processing documents, or almost any other kind of electronic file to a mail message. </P>
<P>Before users send and receive mail in The Microsoft Network, they must complete the following steps: </P>
<UL><LI>Install and configure Microsoft Exchange in Windows&nbsp;95</LI><LI>Connect to The Microsoft Network</LI></UL><P>For more information about setting up Microsoft Exchange, see Chapter 26, "Electronic Mail and Microsoft Exchange."</P>
<H3><A NAME="sec0"></A>To send or receive mail within The Microsoft Network</H3><UL><LI>In MSN Central, click E-mail to open Microsoft Exchange.</LI></UL><P><B>Note</B>   When users sign up for The Microsoft Network, their primary Microsoft Exchange profile will be updated so that The Microsoft Network is included as both an information service and an address book provider. Users can send and receive mail over The Microsoft Network without further configuring Microsoft Exchange or The Microsoft Network. </P>
<H3><A NAME="sec1"></A>To send mail on the Internet</H3><OL><LI>In MSN Central, click E-mail.</LI><LI>Click Compose, and then click New Message.</LI><LI>In the To box, specify an Internet address.</LI></OL><P>An Internet address consists of a user name and a domain name, separated by an at sign(@). In the following example, <B>jim256 </B>is the user name and <B>msn.com </B>is the domain:</P>
<P><BR></P>
<pre><code>jim256@msn.com</code></pre>
<P>In the next example, <B>rks </B>is the user name and <B>seas.ucla.edu </B>is the domain:</P>
<P><BR></P>
<pre><code>rks@seas.ucla.edu</code></pre>
<P>For more information about domain names, see Chapter 30, "Internet Access."</P>
<P>Mail from other users on the Internet appears in the Microsoft Exchange Inbox along with other messages.</P>
<H3><A NAME="sec2"></A>To download mail from The Microsoft Network at startup of Microsoft Exchange </H3><OL><LI>In Control Panel, double-click the Mail And Fax option.</LI><LI>In the Microsoft Exchange Settings Properties, click The Microsoft Network Online Service, and then click Properties. </LI><LI>In Transport properties, click the option named Download Mail When E-Mail Starts Up From MSN. </LI></OL><P>As a result of this procedure, The Microsoft Network connection box will be displayed every time users run The Microsoft Network. Users can cancel the connection and choose to download their mail from The Microsoft Network at a later time from within Windows&nbsp;95 or from within The Microsoft Network.</P>
<H3><A NAME="sec3"></A>To download mail from The Microsoft Network after Microsoft Exchange startup</H3><UL><LI>In Microsoft Exchange, click the Tools menu, and point to Connect To, and then click The Microsoft Network. </LI></UL><P>The Microsoft Network maintains an address book on The Microsoft Network servers that includes the name and electronic mail address of each member of The Microsoft Network. Users can access the address book in Microsoft Exchange, or in the Member Assistance section of The Microsoft Network. The Microsoft Network address book is available only when users are connected to The Microsoft Network because it is too large to copy to a local computer. </P>
<P>The Microsoft Network provides separate address books for each major region in the United States, Europe, Australia, and other countries. All members can access all of these address books. All address books appear in the list of address books in the Microsoft Exchange Address Book window. </P>
<P>For more information about using address books in Microsoft Exchange, see Chapter 26, "Electronic Mail and Microsoft Exchange." </P>
<H3><A NAME="sec4"></A>To display member information</H3><OL><LI>In Microsoft Exchange, open The Microsoft Network address book, and then double-click a member's name.</LI><LI>In the User Information dialog box, view information about the member, such as city, birth date, comments, and so on. </LI></OL></FONT></BODY></HTML>
