<h2>Using Bulletin Boards </H2><P>A bulletin board provides a place to exchange messages. Most bulletin boards are public, which means any member of The Microsoft Network can read them. Each bulletin board has a topic, such as scuba diving, computer graphics, or current events. Users post messages about the topics to do the following:</P>
<UL><LI>Ask or answer questions</LI><LI>Offer opinions, ideas, or suggestions</LI><LI>Share facts and exchange information</LI><LI>Distribute files for other people to copy to their computers</LI></UL><P>A thread is a collection of messages users can organize chronologically or hierarchically to reflect the flow of the discussion. Messages appear in a bulletin board in three possible default views:</P>
<UL><LI>List View lists all messages in the order they were sent to the bulletin board. </LI><LI>Conversation View lists all original messages and their replies and is organized according to a conversation thread. To read replies, click the + icon; to read individual messages, double-click a message. </LI><LI>Attached Files View lists only those messages with attached files. This is an effective way of seeing information that pertains to files rather than messages. </LI></UL><P>Message views can be further sorted in each bulletin board according to their subject, author, size, or date. </P>
