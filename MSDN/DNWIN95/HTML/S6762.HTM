<h3>Using Microsoft TCP/IP Utilities</H3><P>Windows&nbsp;95 provides a variety of TCP/IP utilities for copying files, initiating host sessions with other servers, and checking the status of your IP configuration. For more information about these tools, see Appendix A, "Command-Line Commands Summary." For more information about steps for using TCP/IP utilities such as <B>ping</B> to verify your connection, see the troubleshooting section of Chapter 12, "Network Technical Discussion."</P>
<P>FTP is a file-transfer protocol that allows the transfer of text and binary files between a host computer and a computer. FTP requires you to log on to the remote host for user authentication, but logging on as anonymous can be used to acquire various free software and documentation through the Internet. Some FTP servers have a limit to the number of anonymous users they can handle at any one time, so you might have to attempt to connect more than once to get a connection.</P>
<P>You can use FTP to access the Microsoft FTP server to get troubleshooting help and other information. This support service uses anonymous FTP to provide documentation, utilities, updated drivers, and other information for many Microsoft systems products. </P>
