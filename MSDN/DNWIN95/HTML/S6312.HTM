<h2>Windows 95 on NetWare Networks: The Basics</H2><P>Windows&nbsp;95 runs on NetWare workstations that use Novell NetWare versions 2.15, 2.2, 3.x, and 4.x servers. You can use several different networking clients, as described later in this section:</P>
<UL><LI>The new 32-bit, protected-mode Microsoft Client for NetWare Networks</LI><LI>Novell NetWare 3.x real-mode networking client (NETX)</LI><LI>Novell NetWare 4.x real-mode networking client (VLM)</LI></UL><P><B>Note</B>   In the <I>Windows&nbsp;95 Resource Kit</I>, NETX is used to refer to the Novell NetWare workstation shell for NetWare version 3.x; VLM (Virtual Loadable Module) is used to refer to the workstation shell for version 4.x.</P>
<P>Whichever client you choose, you can use the built-in features and commands in Windows&nbsp;95 to perform most common network operation and administration tasks. Microsoft Client for NetWare Networks can process login scripts, and also supports all 16-bit NetWare 3.x and most 4.x command-line utilities for both users and administrators, so that you can use these utilities in the same way as with NETX or VLM clients running under MS-DOS or an earlier version of Windows.</P>
<P>Windows&nbsp;95 provides complete 32-bit, protected-mode software for running on NetWare networks, including a network client (sometimes called the redirector or requestor), an IPX/SPX-compatible protocol, network adapter drivers, and administrative tools. With Microsoft Client for NetWare Networks in Windows&nbsp;95, users can access NetWare server services, browse and connect to NetWare servers, and queue print jobs by using either the Windows&nbsp;95 network user interface or NetWare utilities. </P>
<P>Whichever network client you use, the following networking features are available in Windows&nbsp;95 to support computers running on NetWare networks:</P>
<UL><LI>Automatic setup and customization of Windows&nbsp;95 on NetWare workstations<B>, </B>as described in Chapter 5, "Custom, Automated, and Push Installations."</LI><LI>Running a shared network copy of Windows 95 for remote-boot workstations and other shared installations, as described in Chapter 4, "Server-Based Setup for Windows 95." </LI><LI>System policies to enforce desktop and system settings for individual or multiple computers, as described in Chapter 15, "User Profiles and System Policies."</LI><LI>Backup agents for Cheyenne&reg; ARCserve and Arcada&reg; Backup Exec, plus an agent for Simple Network Management Protocols (SNMP)<B>,</B> as described in Chapter 16, "Remote Administration."</LI><LI>Complete integration of network resources in Network Neighborhood, and common controls such as the Open or Save As dialog boxes, as described in Chapter 11, "Logon, Browsing, and Resource Sharing." </LI><LI>Password caching for network connections and user-level security with pass-through validation to NetWare servers, as described in Chapter 14, "Security."</LI><LI>Printing to NetWare print queues using Point and Print. Also, the Win32-based Microsoft Print Services for NetWare Networks, available on the Windows&nbsp;95 compact disc, can be used to despool print jobs from NetWare print queues to printers connected to computers running Client for NetWare Networks. For information, see Chapter 23, "Printing and Fonts."</LI></UL><P>The following sections describe the different features available, depending on whether you choose to run Windows&nbsp;95 using the Microsoft Client for NetWare Networks or using a Novell-supplied NETX or VLM client.</P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
