<h3>Configuring a Windows NT Server for Windows 95 Dial-Up Clients</H3>
<P>To configure a Windows&nbsp;NT 3.5 Server so that Windows&nbsp;95 dial-up clients can remotely access it, you need to install and configure RAS. </P>
<P>You must be logged on as a member of the Administrators group to install and configure RAS. It can be installed during Custom Setup of Windows&nbsp;NT or afterward. During Express Setup, if there is not a network card in a computer, the user is given the option to install RAS.  </P>
<P>RAS installation varies slightly depending on which network protocols are  installed. If you use TCP/IP or IPX/SPX protocol with RAS, you should install the protocol before you install RAS, although selecting a protocol that is not installed causes that protocol to be installed at the conclusion of RAS Setup. For information about installing either protocol, see the <I>Windows&nbsp;NT Installation Guide</I>.</P>
<H4><A NAME="sec0"></A>To install RAS on a computer running Windows&nbsp;NT 3.5 Server </H4><OL><LI>In the Network option in Control Panel in Windows NT 3.5, click the Network Settings dialog box, and then click Add Software. </LI><LI>In the Network Software drop-down list, click Remote Access Service, and then click the Continue button.</LI><LI>Type the path name to the distribution files, and click OK.
<P>RAS files are copied to the computer.</P></LI><LI>In the Add Port dialog box, click the port you intend to use for remote access, and then click OK. 
<P>If you have successfully installed a multiport adapter, ISDN card, X.25 card, or other device, it should appear in this list. </P></LI><LI>In the RAS Auto Detection dialog box, click OK to allow RAS to automatically detect the modem connected to the port, or click Cancel to manually select a modem.
<P>Occasionally, when attempting to detect a modem, a dialog box appears, prompting you to select a modem from a short list. This occurs only when RAS Setup cannot distinguish between two or more modems.</P></LI><LI>In the Configure Port dialog box, click a modem if RAS did not detect one, and then click OK. Only supported modems are listed. 
<P>If you are adding a port after initial RAS installation, you can use the Detect button to automatically detect the modem connected to the new port.</P></LI><LI>In the Port Usage box, you define whether the port will be for dial-out or dial-in use. Clicking the Dial Out Only option configures the computer as a RAS client. Clicking the Receive Calls Only option configures the computer as a RAS server. Clicking both options allows the computer to be a dial-out client and dial-out server; however, the computer cannot be both at the same time.</LI><LI>To configure settings specific to the device attached to the port, click the device, and then click the Settings button. The default settings are usually ideal. Click OK.</LI><LI>In the Remote Access Setup dialog box, configure RAS network settings by clicking the Network button. You can also reconfigure the port, if necessary, by clicking it, and then clicking buttons at the bottom of the port dialog box.</LI></OL><P>Before users can use RAS to remotely connect to Windows&nbsp;NT, you must grant them remote access permissions. </P>
<H4><A NAME="sec1"></A>To grant Remote Access permission to users</H4><OL><LI>Double-click the Remote Access Admin icon to start the Administrators utility.</LI><LI>Set the focus on the server or domain on which you want to set permissions. To set the focus, see the Remote Access Admin online Help.</LI><LI>From the Users menu, click Permissions.</LI><LI>In the Remote Access Permissions dialog box, click the Help button for further instructions. </LI></OL><P><B>Note</B>   Microsoft does not recommend granting guest accounts dial-in permission. If you do, be sure to assign a password to the guest account.</P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
