<h2>Upgrading to Microsoft Exchange Server</H2><P>A next-generation client-server messaging system known as Microsoft Exchange Server will be available from Microsoft after the first release of Windows&nbsp;95. Microsoft Exchange Server provides advanced electronic mail, scheduling, groupware applications, and custom application development. Microsoft Exchange Server includes MAPI drivers that extend the capabilities of the Windows&nbsp;95 Microsoft Exchange client. For example, when Microsoft Exchange is connected to an Exchange Server, you can access a replicated "public folder," create custom forms and shared documents, schedule meetings with others, manage time and tasks, and create custom electronic forms for use in business.</P>
<P>Microsoft Exchange Server will require a computer running Windows&nbsp;NT Server version 3.5 or higher. It also includes a built-in X.400 gateway, plus support for SMTP and for Microsoft Mail for Intel&reg; and Apple Macintosh computers. For more information about Microsoft Exchange Server, contact your Microsoft sales representative.</P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
