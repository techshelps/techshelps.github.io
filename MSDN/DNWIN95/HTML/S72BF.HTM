<h3>Support for MS-DOS Mode</H3><P>While most MS-DOS – based applications run well in Windows&nbsp;95 and can run concurrently with other Win32-based and Win16-based applications, a small number of MS-DOS – based applications require exclusive access to system resources to run. In this case, it is the Virtual Memory Manager that creates this exclusive operating environment for the application called <I>MS-DOS Mode</I>. When an MS-DOS – based application runs in MS-DOS Mode, no other applications or processes are allowed to compete for system resources — all resources are at the exclusive access of the MS-DOS – based application. For related information, see Chapter 22, "Application Support."</P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
