<h2>Windows 95 Distribution Disk Storage Overview</H2><P>Windows&nbsp;95 is stored on the distribution disks as cabinet files (*.CAB). When the Windows&nbsp;95 disks are created, files are compressed into folders. The Windows&nbsp;95 files are read in and written as one, continuous byte-stream, which compresses the entire stream and divides it into folders as appropriate. Folders can fill one or more cabinets. The following defines the terms used to describe the distribution files.</P>
<P><B>Cabinet.</B></P>
<P>A normal file that contains pieces of one or more files, usually compressed.</P>
<P><B>Folder.</B></P>
<P>A decompression boundary. Large folders enable higher compression, because the compressor can refer back to more data in finding patterns. However, to retrieve a file at the end of a folder, the entire folder must be decompressed. </P>
<P>The Windows&nbsp;95 distribution disks use distribution media format (DMF), which is a special read-only format for 3.5-inch floppy disks that permits storage of 1.7 MB of data.</P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
