<h3>NETX Technical Notes</H3><P>This section describes specific notes related to using the Novell-supplied NetWare 3.x client software with Windows&nbsp;95. </P>
<H4><A NAME="sec0"></A>Using NETX with Client for Microsoft Networks</H4><P>When running NETX with Windows&nbsp;95, you keep all the same functionality that you had when running with MS-DOS or Windows 3.x. You also gain the features described in "Windows 95 on NetWare Networks: The Basics" earlier in this chapter.</P>
<P>If you are using NETX as the network client, you might also choose to install the 32-bit, protected-mode Client for Microsoft Networks if you want to connect to other Microsoft network computers, such as computers running Windows for Workgroups 3.x, LAN Manager, or Windows NT.</P>
<P>When you run the NetWare NETX client with Windows&nbsp;95 in this configuration, you should continue to load the necessary Novell-supplied client components and MS-DOS – based TSR programs (LSL, ODI driver, IPXODI, and NETX) in AUTOEXEC.BAT or STARTNET.BAT, just as you did with MS-DOS or Windows 3.1. Windows&nbsp;95 Setup automatically adds the configuration settings if they are not present. For information about required configuration settings, see your Novell documentation.</P>
<P>Notice that this configuration requires a Microsoft Windows NT Client Access license if the computer will be connecting to servers running Windows NT Server. For information, see Chapter 8, "Windows 95 on Microsoft Networks."</P>
<P><B>Architecture for Novell-supplied NETX with Client for Microsoft Networks; components shown in bold are supplied by Novell.</B></P>
<P><img src="RK09_06.gif"></P>
<P>In this configuration, the Novell-supplied version of NETWARE.DRV is installed and loaded only for applications that call it directly. Because this driver is not used by Windows&nbsp;95, all access to NetWare resources occurs by using the Windows&nbsp;95 user interface, not the NETWARE.DRV dialog boxes provided by Novell. The NW16.DLL component translates 32-bit network calls to 16-bit network calls that can be passed to VNETWARE.386.</P>
<P><B>Note</B>   You cannot install Client for Microsoft Networks as an additional networking client if you are using the IPX monolithic configuration.</P>
<H4><A NAME="sec1"></A>Using NETX as the Sole Client</H4><P>This configuration is for use in either of these cases:</P>
<UL><LI>The IPX monolithic configuration is used.</LI><LI>You do not need to connect to other computers running Windows for Workgroups 3.x, LAN Manager, or Windows NT. Of course, you can connect to computers running Microsoft File and Printer Sharing Services for NetWare.</LI></UL><P>To use only NETX client support, use the Network option in Control Panel to remove Client for NetWare Networks and Client for Microsoft Networks, if either of these clients is installed. Then add the Novell NetWare (Workstation Shell 3.X [NETX]) client, as described in "Installing Windows 95 with a Novell NetWare Client" earlier in this chapter.</P>

<P><BR></P><H4><A NAME="sec2"></A>Setting the LastDrive Parameter for NETX</H4><P>Windows&nbsp;95 uses the value of the <B>LastDrive=</B> entry in the Registry (or CONFIG.SYS) to allocate enough storage space in the internal memory structures to recognize drive letters for devices. For example, a setting of <B>LastDrive=Z</B> tells Windows&nbsp;95 to recognize drive letters from A to Z.</P>
<P>Windows&nbsp;95 uses all drive letters up to the letter assigned as the last drive. NetWare servers use all the drive letters following the last drive. For example, if <B>LastDrive=P</B> is specified, you can assign drive letters D through P for networks other than NetWare (assuming drive C is the only physical hard disk drive in the system). In this same example, NetWare begins mapping NetWare volumes with Q.</P>
<P>Unlike Windows 95 for Workgroups, Windows 95 does not update the value of the <B>LastDrive=</B> if a value is already set. If no value is specified in CONFIG.SYS, Windows 95 adds <B>LastDrive=E</B> to the Registry.</P>
<H4><A NAME="sec3"></A>Setting Show Dots and File Access Limits</H4><P>A NetWare file server does not include the directory entries dot (.) and double dot (..) as MS-DOS and Windows&nbsp;95 do. However, the NetWare workstation shell version 3.01 or later can emulate these entries when applications attempt to list the files in a directory. </P>
<H4><A NAME="sec4"></A>To turn on the Show Dots feature</H4><UL><LI>If you have problems listing files or deleting directories, add the following line to the beginning of NET.CFG:</LI><LI>show dots=on</LI></UL><P>By default, NetWare client software allows you access to only 40 files at a time. When you are running many applications under Windows&nbsp;95, it is possible to exceed this limit, so you will want to increase the settings for file limits. </P>
<H4><A NAME="sec5"></A>To increase the file access limit</H4><OL><LI>Add the following line to the beginning of NET.CFG:</LI></OL><UL><LI>file handles=60</LI></UL><OL start=2><LI>Add the following to CONFIG.SYS for the local computer:</LI></OL><UL><LI>files=60</LI></UL></FONT></BODY></HTML>
