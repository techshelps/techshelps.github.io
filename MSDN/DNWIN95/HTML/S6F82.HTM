<h2>Windows 95 and Microsoft Networking: The Basics</H2><P>Client for Microsoft Networks is the 32-bit, protected-mode network client for Windows&nbsp;95 that provides the redirector and other software components for Microsoft networking. Client for Microsoft Networks also supports limited interoperability with other Microsoft-compatible server message block-based (SMB) servers such as IBM&reg; LAN Server, DEC&trade; PATHWORKS&trade;, AT&amp;T&reg; StarLAN, and LAN Manager for UNIX&reg; Systems local area network software.</P>
<P>You can install Client for Microsoft Networks to serve as the sole network support for Windows&nbsp;95 or to coexist with Client for NetWare Networks or clients from other network vendors, as described in Chapter 10, "Windows 95 on Other Networks." For technical information about these optional configurations, see Chapter 32, "Windows 95 Network Architecture."</P>
<P>Support for computers running Client for Microsoft Networks includes all the robust networking features built into Windows&nbsp;95:</P>
<UL><LI>Automatic setup, user profiles, and system policies for configuring computers</LI><LI>Dial-Up Networking, share-level and pass-through user-level security, and remote administration capabilities</LI><LI>Unified logon and automatic reconnection to network resources</LI></UL><P>The following list summarizes the additional key benefits of using Client for Microsoft Networks.</P>
<P><B>A high-performance system using no conventional memory.</B></P>
<P>Client for Microsoft Networks uses only 32-bit, protected-mode supporting networking components and, as a file system driver, uses Windows&nbsp;95 caching (VCACHE). Client for Microsoft Networks uses 32-bit versions of NetBEUI, Microsoft TCP/IP, and the Microsoft IPX/SPX-compatible protocol and NDIS 3.1-compliant network adapter drivers. This protected-mode client is designed to be used in a multitasking environment, providing robust performance and using no MS-DOS conventional memory space. For information about supporting protocols and network adapter drivers, see Chapter 12, "Network Technical Discussion."</P>
<P><B>Protected-mode peer resource sharing services.</B></P>
<P>You can configure computers running Client for Microsoft Networks to provide peer server capabilities using File and Printer Sharing for Microsoft Networks. For information, see Chapter 11, "Logon, Browsing, and Resource Sharing."</P>
<P><B>Security and other support on Windows NT networks.</B></P>
<P>You can use Windows&nbsp;NT servers to validate user logon and to provide pass-through security for shared resources on computers running Windows&nbsp;95. Computers running Windows&nbsp;95 can recognize and use long filenames on Windows&nbsp;NT servers because the two operating systems use the same algorithm for long filenames and aliases. For information, see Chapter 14, "Security"and see also "Running Windows 95 with Windows NT" later in this chapter.</P>
<P>In addition, a computer running Windows&nbsp;95 can start from a floppy disk or local hard disk and run a shared copy of Windows&nbsp;95 stored on a Windows&nbsp;NT server. Support for booting diskless workstations will be available in Windows NT Server update releases. For information about shared installations, see Chapter 4, "Server-Based Setup for Windows 95." For information about installing Windows&nbsp;95 from login scripts using Windows&nbsp;NT Server, see Chapter 5, "Custom, Automated, and Push Installations." </P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
