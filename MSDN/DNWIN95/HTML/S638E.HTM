<h2>Configuring Network Logon</H2><P>If you install either Client for Microsoft Networks or Client for NetWare Networks, you can configure a computer running Windows&nbsp;95 to participate on a Windows&nbsp;NT or NetWare network.</P>
<P>Before you can use network logon on a computer running Windows&nbsp;95, however, you must have a Windows&nbsp;NT domain controller or NetWare server on the network that contains user account information for the Windows&nbsp;95 user. For more information about setting up permissions on a Windows&nbsp;NT or NetWare server, see the administrator's documentation for the server. For related information, see Chapter 8, "Windows 95 on Microsoft Networks" and Chapter 9, "Windows 95 on NetWare Networks." </P>
<P>The validation of a user's network password at system startup might not be required for accessing network resources later during that work session. However, system startup is the only time the login script can run, and it is the only time at which user profiles and system policies can be downloaded on the local computer. Therefore, proper network logon can be extremely important.</P>
<P>The following sections provide information about configuring network logon for computers on Windows&nbsp;NT and NetWare networks when using a 32-bit, protected-mode network client. You can also use system policies to control network logon options, as summarized at the end of this section. For information about enforcing logon password requirements, see Chapter 14, "Security."</P>
<P><b>Tip</b></P>
<P>Logon validation will control only user access to network resources, not access to running Windows&nbsp;95. To require validation by a network logon server before allowing access to Windows&nbsp;95, you must use system policies. For information, see "Setting Network Logon Options with System Policies" later in this chapter.</P>
<P>Notice, however, that Windows&nbsp;95 security cannot prevent a user from starting the computer by using Safe Mode or a floppy disk. If you require complete user validation before starting the computer in any way, use Windows&nbsp;NT as the sole operating system. </P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
