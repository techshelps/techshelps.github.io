<h2>Multimedia: The Issues</H2><P>In the corporate environment, you need to consider what multimedia features your users will be using to determine what extra hardware they'll need. For example, to use the audio capabilities as described in this chapter, computers need a sound card. For more information, see "Buying a Multimedia Computer" later in this chapter.</P>
<P>Windows&nbsp;95 includes basic audio recording, audio playback, and video playback tools, but your users might need more features than these tools offer. For example, if users will be capturing and compressing digital video, they'll need additional software. Consider which additional multimedia software tools you might need to purchase. For more information, see "Buying a Multimedia Computer" later in this chapter.</P>
<P>If you are planning to play video clips over the network, playback will probably appear somewhat jerky unless your network guarantees a continuous data stream (for example, if you use an isochronous Ethernet network or an asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) network).</P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
