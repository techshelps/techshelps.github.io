<h2>Troubleshooting for Logon, Browsing, and Peer Resource Sharing</H2><P>This section provides some general methods for troubleshooting.</P>
<H3><A NAME="sec0"></A>Setup doesn't run the login script.</H3><P>If the network logon server or domain controller is not validating the user account, the login script will not run. Check the following:</P>
<UL><LI>The network connection</LI><LI>The user name</LI><LI>The user password</LI><LI>The basic network functionality</LI><LI>The domain or server logon validation</LI></UL><P>If the network logon server or domain controller is validating the user account, do the following:</P>
<UL><LI>Check the network connection.</LI><LI>Verify that the login script is present in the home directory (on a Windows&nbsp;NT network) or in the user's mail directory (on a NetWare network).</LI><LI>Check for enough memory on the client computer.</LI><LI>Check for and remove unnecessary drivers and TSRs, and then try to log on again.</LI></UL><H3><A NAME="sec1"></A>You cannot browse to find SMB-based servers in the workgroup while using Client for Microsoft Networks.</H3><P>There might be no SMB-based servers in the workgroup (computers running Windows&nbsp;NT, LAN Manager, or File and Printer Sharing for Microsoft Networks). Windows&nbsp;95 does not support browsing in a workgroup that does not contain an SMB-based server if the computer is running Client for Microsoft Networks. The following presents a solution.</P>
<H3><A NAME="sec2"></A>To ensure there is an SMB-based server in the workgroup</H3><UL><LI>On a computer running File and Printer Sharing for Microsoft Networks, make sure the service is configured as the master browser server.
<P> – Or –</P>

<P><li>Make sure that a Windows&nbsp;NT server computer is a member of the workgroup (or domain).</P></LI></UL><H4><A NAME="sec3"></A>Access to an NCP-based server changes if SAP Advertising is defined.</H4><P>Where you access an NCP-based peer resource server in Network Neighborhood can change, depending on whether the server is configured for Workgroup Advertising or SAP Advertising. </P>
<UL><LI>If the computer running File and Printer Sharing for NetWare Networks is configured for Workgroup Advertising, that peer server appears as a computer in its workgroup. </LI><LI>If the File and Printer Sharing server is configured for SAP Advertising, it appears with the other Novell NetWare servers at the beginning of the list of workgroups in the Entire Network window of Network Neighborhood.</LI></UL><P>To set SAP Advertising or Workgroup Advertising, follow the procedures in "Configuring Browsing for Resource Sharing on NetWare Networks" earlier in this chapter. </P>
<H4><A NAME="sec4"></A>User cannot connect to any network resource.</H4><UL><LI>Check the workgroup assignment.</LI><LI>Check the domain or preferred server assignment for the protected-mode network client.</LI><LI>Check the rights for the user as defined on the domain or preferred server.</LI><LI>Check the basic network operations.</LI><LI>Use <B>net view</B> \\<I>computer name</I> to view shared resources.</LI><LI>Check for the termination of the local network cable.</LI></UL><H4><A NAME="sec5"></A>Others cannot connect to my shared resources.</H4><UL><LI>In the Network option in Control Panel, verify that the File and Print Sharing service appears in the list of installed components.</LI><LI>Make sure other users are running a common protocol.</LI></UL><H4><A NAME="sec6"></A>Network Neighborhood doesn't show servers.</H4>
<UL><LI>Verify that at least one active server is on the local network.</LI><LI>Verify that the proper network clients are installed and, if necessary, reinstall them. </LI><LI>Verify that the user is logged on to the particular network.</LI><LI>Check the network protocol settings.</LI><LI>Check that the IPX Frame Type is set to Auto or to the same type as the server.</LI><LI>Check the network cable termination.</LI></UL><H4><A NAME="sec7"></A>You can't connect to a specific server.</H4><UL><LI>Check error message details, if available.</LI><LI>Verify that you can connect to any server.</LI><LI>Verify that you can connect to a specific server from other computers. If you cannot connect to the specific server from other systems, it probably indicates a problem with that server or the cabling or routing to it. Also verify termination of the local network cable.</LI></UL><H4><A NAME="sec8"></A>The network redirector or server is not responding.</H4><P>If the computer running Windows&nbsp;95 is not responding properly as a client or server, use System Monitor to view statistics about the activity of the installed network servers and redirectors. If there is no activity, remove the client or server on the Network option in Control Panel, and then reinstall and try again.</P>
<H4><A NAME="sec9"></A>You cannot see computers running Windows&nbsp;95 on the other side of a router on a NetWare network.</H4><P>This might be related to the IPX network number. An IPX client (such as a computer running Client for NetWare Networks) determines its network number by sending Routing Information Protocol (RIP) requests to the nearest IPX router. If the router is configured incorrectly, all IPX clients on that network can be adversely affected. Network numbers are assigned in the server's AUTOEXEC.NCF file when the network adapter drivers are loaded and IPX is bound to the logical adapter.</P>
<H4><A NAME="sec10"></A>Access is denied for Windows for Workgroups users trying to connect to shared resources on a computer running File and Printer Sharing for Microsoft Networks.</H4><P>If the user with the Windows for Workgroups client computer is logging on to a different domain from the computer running File and Printer Sharing services (the peer server), then Windows 95 cannot confirm logon validation for access to shared resources. To solve this problem, do one of the following:</P>
<UL><LI>Upgrade the Windows for Workgroups clients to Windows&nbsp;95 (recommended).</LI><LI>Set the LM Announce option to Yes in the Advanced properties for File and Printer Sharing for Microsoft Networks on the peer server.</LI><LI>Switch to share-level security on the peer server.</LI><LI>Change the logon domain for the Windows for Workgroups clients.</LI></UL><P>This problem will not occur in these cases: if the client computers are running Windows&nbsp;95 or Windows&nbsp;NT; if the peer server uses share-level security; or if the same domains are used for the client computer's logon domain and the domain specified for pass-through validation in the peer server's Access Control properties.</P>
<H4><A NAME="sec11"></A>A user is incorrectly denied access to resources on a peer server on a Windows&nbsp;NT network.</H4><P>If a user is denied access to resources on a computer running File and Printer Sharing for Microsoft Networks with user-level security, you should first determine which security provider is specified for the peer server. Then, see if the client can be validated by that security provider directly without going through the peer server. </P>
<P>If this is successful, verify that the user is on the access control list for the shared resource on the peer server.<B><I> </I></B>Remove that user from the list of users and then add the name back. If this is unsuccessful, reconfigure the peer server to use another security provider that you know can validate the user.</P>
