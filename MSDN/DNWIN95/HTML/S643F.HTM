<h3>Defining Mandatory User Profiles</H3><P>In Windows&nbsp;95, you can create mandatory user profiles for use on Windows&nbsp;NT or NetWare networks. You can use this feature to create a standard user profile for each computer and ensure it is implemented at every logon. To do this, create a USER.DAT file with the settings you want, save it as USER.MAN, and place it in the network directory for each user you want to use that profile. The network directory is either the user's home directory (on a Windows NT network) or MAIL directory (on a NetWare network). </P>
<P>If USER.MAN is present when the user logs on, Windows&nbsp;95 uses this mandatory copy to load settings into the Registry rather than any previous local user profile. If the user manually makes changes to the desktop configuration during the work session, these changes are not saved to the master copy in the user's network directory when the user logs off. </P>
