<h2>Using File and Printer Sharing for Microsoft Networks</H2><P>File and Printer Sharing for Microsoft Networks is the 32-bit, protected-mode Windows&nbsp;95 SMB server (VSERVER.VXD), that supports all Microsoft networking products that use the SMB file-sharing protocol, including Windows for Workgroups, Windows&nbsp;NT, LAN Manager, LAN Manager for UNIX, AT&amp;T StarLAN, IBM LAN Server, 3Com&reg; 3+Open&reg; and 3+Share&reg;, and DEC PATHWORKS. Windows&nbsp;95 enhances the features of Windows for Workgroups peer services by providing administrative control over whether peer sharing services are enabled, by adding user-based security capabilities, and by supporting long filenames.<B><I> </I></B></P>
<P>The following summarizes some requirements for File and Printer Sharing for Microsoft Networks:</P>
<UL><LI>The computer must use Client for Microsoft Networks. </LI><LI>File and Printer Sharing for Microsoft Networks cannot run at the same time as NCP-based File and Printer Sharing for NetWare Networks. </LI><LI>If user-level security is used, a Windows&nbsp;NT domain controller must be used for authentication.</LI></UL><P>The default settings for File and Printer Sharing are correct for most installations. You should need to change these settings in the following circumstances only:</P>
<UL><LI>If you need to set Browse Master properties, as described in "Browsing on Microsoft Networks" earlier in this chapter.</LI><LI>If you want LAN Manager 2.x clients on your network to use resources on a computer running File and Printer Sharing for Microsoft Networks.</LI></UL><P>Use the Network option in Control Panel to configure the Browse Master and LM Announce parameters for the File and Printer Sharing service. For information about configuring security in Access Control properties, see Chapter 14, "Security."</P>
<H3><A NAME="sec0"></A>To specify Browse Master settings </H3><OL><LI>In the Network option in Control Panel, double-click File and Printer Sharing for Microsoft Networks in the list of installed components.</LI><LI>In Advanced properties for File and Printer Sharing for Microsoft Networks, select Browse Master in the Property list. </LI><LI>Select an option in the Value list, as described in the following table.</LI></OL><P></P>

<P><BR></P><P>At least one computer in the workgroup must have the value of Automatic or Yes for this parameter to ensure the browse list is available to network computers. This parameter is equivalent to the <B>MaintainServerList=</B> entry in the [network] section of SYSTEM.INI in Windows for Workgroups&nbsp;3.11.</P>
<P>The LM Announce property controls whether a computer running File and Printer Sharing for Microsoft Networks can be seen by LAN Manager 2.x clients. </P>
<H3><A NAME="sec1"></A>To specify LM Announce settings </H3><OL><LI>In Advanced properties for File and Printer Sharing for Microsoft Networks, select LM Announce in the Properties list. </LI><LI>Select an option in the Value list, as described in the following table. </LI></OL><P></P>

<P><BR></P><P>This parameter is the equivalent of the <B>LMAnnounce=</B> entry in the [Network] section of SYSTEM.INI in Windows for Workgroups 3.11. This value should be No unless there is a LAN Manager 2.x domain on your network.</P>
<P>A LAN Manager 2.x domain is known by browse servers in a workgroup only if at least one computer running Windows&nbsp;95 (or Windows&nbsp;NT in the domain) is a member of that LAN Manager 2.x domain.</P>
<H3><A NAME="sec2"></A>To make a computer running Windows&nbsp;95 a member of a LAN Manager 2.x domain </H3><UL><LI>Set the workgroup name for the computer to be the same as the LAN Manager 2.x domain name.</LI></UL><P>You can share a directory (or other resource) by selecting it in Windows Explorer or in My Computer and then configuring the related options. The following procedure describes how to share a directory on a computer where user-level security has been specified in the Network option in Control Panel. The steps for sharing resources with share-level security are similar to those for user-level security except that you do not select specific users. Rather, specify the type of access and define a password for the shared resource.</P>
<H3><A NAME="sec3"></A>To share a directory (folder) with user-level security</H3><OL><LI>In Windows Explorer, right-click the icon for the directory you want to share. In the context menu that appears, click Sharing.</LI><LI>Click the Sharing tab, and then type a share name for the directory. 
<P><B>Tip</B>   If you add a dollar sign ($) to the end of the share name, the resource will not appear in Network Neighborhood or elsewhere when people browse network resources.</P></LI><LI>Click the Add button, and use the Add Users dialog box to specify which users can access the directory. </LI></OL><P>For more information about sharing folders on a Microsoft network, see online Help.</P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
