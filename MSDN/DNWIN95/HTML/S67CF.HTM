<h2>Initialization Files and the Registry</H2><P></P>
<P>Although the Registry replaces the basic function of the initialization files used in earlier versions of Windows, the SYSTEM.INI, WIN.INI, and WINFILE.INI files still appear in the Windows&nbsp;directory. These files continue to be used for compatibility with earlier Windows-based applications and device drivers. For example, entries in WIN.INI and SYSTEM.INI created by Win16-based applications are not updated in the Registry, because such applications do not know how to access the Windows&nbsp;95 Registry. </P>
<P>If you install Windows&nbsp;95 as an upgrade over Windows 3.1, some INI file settings are copied into the Registry, including settings from CONTROL.INI, PROGMAN.INI, SYSTEM.INI, and WIN.INI.</P>
<P>Some INI file entries are not moved to the Registry, but remain in the INI file for compatibility with Win16-based applications. Most of these entries can be changed without editing the INI files by using the graphical tools provided with Windows&nbsp;95. However, some INI entries cannot be set using the Windows&nbsp;95 user interface. These entries are required for some applications to function properly, but shouldn't need direct modification by users.</P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
