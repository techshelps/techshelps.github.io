<h3>Using Security with Dial-Up Networking</H3><P>Dial-Up Networking gives you the option of requiring a password to connect to the remote access server, depending on whether the Windows&nbsp;95 dial-up server is protected with share-level or user-level security.</P>
<UL><LI>Share-level security assigns a password to the Windows&nbsp;95 dial-up server. When users dial in, they must provide the password before they can gain access to the server. After the connection is established, users can browse the resources on the dial-up server, subject to whatever level of security has been applied to them. Users can also log on to the network after connecting to the dial-up server if logging on to the network is enabled on the dial-up client. Because users can distribute passwords, this method is less secure than user-level security. </LI><LI>User-level security restricts access to a network resource until a security provider, such as a Windows&nbsp;NT domain controller or a NetWare server, authenticates the request. You can require that a user's logon password to a remote access server be the same as the network and Windows&nbsp;95 logon passwords. For more information, see Chapter 14, "Security."</LI><LI>With user-level security, when the user accesses shared resources on the dial-up server, Windows&nbsp;95 controls what rights a user has to the shared resources, such as whether the user has read-only access or full access to files. Access rights are specified in the sharing properties for each resource protected by user-level security. For more information, see Chapter 14, "Security."</LI></UL><H4><A NAME="sec0"></A>To configure the dial-up server to use user-level security </H4><OL><LI>In the Network option in Control Panel, enable File and Printer Sharing services for Microsoft or NetWare networks and enable user-level security in Access Control properties. For more information, see Chapter 11, "Logon, Browsing, and Resource Sharing."</LI><LI>In Dial-Up Networking, click the Connections menu, and then click Dial-Up Server. </LI><LI>In the Dial-Up Server properties, click the option named Allow Caller Access, and then click Add. </LI><LI>In the Add Users dialog box, specify the users who will have permission to access the dial-up server, and then click OK. </LI><LI>In the Dial-Up Server properties, click the Server Type button, and make sure Require Encrypted Password is checked if your Dial-Up client supports encrypted passwords. 
<P>Clicking the Require Encrypted Password option requires the client to send an encrypted as opposed to a text password. Some clients support only text passwords; however, encrypted passwords are preferred. Clearing this option doesn't disable password protection.</P></LI></OL><H4><A NAME="sec1"></A>To configure the dial-up server to use share-level security </H4><OL><LI>Disable user-level security, if it is enabled, by clicking the Access Control tab in the Network option in Control Panel, or by using System Policy Editor to edit the Registry. For information, see Chapter 15, "User Profiles and System Policies."</LI><LI>In the Network option in Control Panel, enable File and Printer Sharing services for Microsoft Networks and enable share-level security by clicking the Access Control tab. For information, see Chapter 11, "Logon, Browsing, and Resource Sharing." Notice that share-level security is not available on NetWare networks. </LI><LI>From the Connections menu in Dial-Up Networking, click Dial-Up Server. </LI><LI>In the Dial-Up Server dialog box, click Allow Caller Access, and then click Change Password to provide password protection for the Dial-Up server. </LI><LI>Optionally, to require password encryption, click the Server Type buttion.</LI><LI>In the Server Types dialog box, make sure Require Encrypted Password is checked, and then click OK.</LI></OL></FONT></BODY></HTML>
