<h2>Preparing for Microsoft Network Monitor</H2><P>The Windows&nbsp;95 compact disc includes a protocol driver and agent for Microsoft Network Monitor. The protocol driver provides performance counters that can be viewed by using System Monitor if you want to assess certain network traffic statistics for NDIS&nbsp;3.1 protected-mode network adapters. The Network Monitor agent, which runs as a Windows&nbsp;95 service, works with the protocol driver for use with the Microsoft Network Monitor application. You can use this application to detect and troubleshoot problems on LANs, WANs, and Microsoft Remote Access Service (RAS) connections.</P>
<P><b>Note</b></P>
<P>The Network Monitor application is provided with Microsoft Systems Management Server, which is a client-server system that allows administrators to perform key management functions for distributed computers from a central location. For more information, see Appendix E, "Microsoft Systems Management Server." </P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
