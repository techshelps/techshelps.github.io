<h3>Using Windows NT to Connect to NetWare Servers</H3><P>If your site includes both a Novell NetWare network and a Windows&nbsp;NT Server network, computers using Microsoft networking will need to communicate and share resources with the NetWare network. This section summarizes several options using Windows NT.</P>
<P><B>Windows NT Gateway Service for NetWare.</B></P>
<P>For Microsoft networking clients that cannot use multiple protocols, you can configure a computer running Windows&nbsp;NT Server&nbsp;3.5 as a file or print gateway using Windows NT Gateway Service for NetWare to connect to and share NetWare resources. Notice that a Microsoft Windows NT Client Access License is required if the computer will be connecting to servers running Windows NT Server. For information, contact your Microsoft reseller.</P>
<P>As shown in the following illustration, Windows&nbsp;NT Gateway Service for NetWare acts as a translator between the SMB protocol used by Microsoft networks and the NCP protocol used on NetWare networks. </P>
<P><img src="RK11_28.gif"></P>
<P>The file gateway uses a NetWare account on the Windows&nbsp;NT Server computer to create a validated connection to the NetWare server, which then appears on the Windows&nbsp;NT Server computer as a redirected drive. When the administrator shares the redirected drive, it looks similar to any other shared resource on the Windows&nbsp;NT Server computer. A print gateway functions in much the same way as the file gateway: the NetWare printer appears on the Windows&nbsp;NT network as if it were any other shared printer.</P>
<P>Because access over the gateway is slower than direct access from the client for computers running Windows&nbsp;95 that require frequent access to NetWare resources, Client for NetWare Networks is a better solution. For information about setting up a Windows&nbsp;NT Server computer with Gateway Service for NetWare, see <I>Windows&nbsp;NT Server Services for NetWare Networks</I> in the Windows&nbsp;NT Server 3.5 documentation set. </P>
<P><B>Microsoft File and Print Services for NetWare.</B></P>
<P>This utility for Windows&nbsp;NT Server provides users running a NetWare-compatible client with access to basic NetWare file and print services and to powerful server applications on the same Windows NT Server-based computer. You can use Microsoft File and Print Services for NetWare to add a multipurpose file, print, and application server to your NetWare network without changing users' network client software. </P>
<P><B>Microsoft Directory Service Manager for NetWare.</B></P>
<P>This utility for Windows&nbsp;NT Server allows you to maintain a single directory for managing mixed Windows&nbsp;NT Server and NetWare 2.x and 3.x server network.</P>
<P>For more information about these features or how to obtain Microsoft File and Print Services for NetWare, or the Microsoft Directory Service Manager for NetWare, contact your Microsoft sales representative.</P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
