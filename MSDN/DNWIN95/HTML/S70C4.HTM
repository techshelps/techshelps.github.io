<h2>Plug and Play Support in Windows 95</H2><P>Plug and Play is an independent set of computer architecture specifications that hardware manufacturers use to produce computer devices that can be configured with no user intervention. </P>
<P>For Plug and Play-compliant devices, installation consists of plugging in the device and turning on the computer. For example, a user can do the following:</P>
<UL><LI>Insert and remove Plug and Play-compliant devices such as PCMCIA cards with automatic configuration.</LI><LI>Connect to a docking station or network without restarting the computer or changing configuration parameters. </LI><LI>Add a new monitor by plugging it in and turning it on.</LI></UL><P>The Plug and Play capabilities in Windows&nbsp;95 have been widely described as key benefits to moving to Windows&nbsp;95, because of the related reduction in hardware and software support costs. When Windows&nbsp;95 detects the presence of a Plug and Play-compliant device, its device driver can be loaded and configured dynamically, requiring little or no user input. After the device and driver are installed, the driver reacts to system messages when a device is inserted or removed.</P>
<P>Microsoft recommends adding Plug and Play-compliant devices on legacy computers rather than adding non-Plug and Play devices. To use all Plug and Play features, however, your system must include a Plug and Play BIOS (the motherboard), devices (buses), and an operating system (Windows&nbsp;95). </P>
<P>The following describes Plug and Play requirements and benefits.</P>
<P>The following table compares the Plug and Play implementation in the Windows&nbsp;95 operating system against other implementations.</P>
