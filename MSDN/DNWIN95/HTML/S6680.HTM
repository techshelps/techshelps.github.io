<h3>Correcting Modem Access Problems with Applications </H3><H4><A NAME="sec0"></A>You cannot send or receive binary files by using HyperTerminal.</H4><UL><LI>Make sure that both computers are using the same file transfer protocol (that is, Xmodem, 1K Xmodem, Ymodem, Ymodem-G, Zmodem, or Kermit).</LI><LI>If you are using the Ymodem-G file transfer protocol, ensure that your modem supports hardware error control. If it doesn't, try using Ymodem instead.</LI><LI>If you are trying to use an alternative protocol (such as Kermit) and you encounter transmission errors, try Xmodem instead. Most communications packages, bulletin boards, and online services support Xmodem. </LI></UL><H4><A NAME="sec1"></A>You cannot dial with Phone Dialer.</H4><UL><LI>In the Dialing Properties dialog box, make sure your area code and country code are correct.</LI><LI>For each access number you want to use for calling out, specify, at a minimum, the country code, area code, and telephone number.</LI><LI>Verify basic modem and port configurations.</LI></UL><H4><A NAME="sec2"></A>Win16-based applications cannot access the modem, but MS-DOS  – based or Windows&nbsp;95-based applications can.</H4><P>Make sure the communications driver for Windows&nbsp;3.1-based applications is COMM.DRV in the SYSTEM.INI file. Some applications replace this driver for various reasons.</P>
<H4><A NAME="sec3"></A>MS-DOS – based applications cannot access the modem (especially PCMCIA modems), but all Windows-based applications can. </H4><UL><LI>If possible, adjust the IRQ setting in the MS-DOS – based application according to the application's documentation.</LI><LI>If the MS-DOS – based application's IRQ settings cannot be adjusted, adjust the IRQ settings for the modem COM port as described earlier in this section.</LI></UL><H4><A NAME="sec4"></A>MS-DOS – based and Windows&nbsp;3.1-based applications cannot access the modem, but applications created for Windows 95 can.</H4><P>Make sure that Microsoft Exchange Remote Mail, Microsoft Fax, and Dial-Up Networking are not waiting for incoming calls. If they are, older applications cannot access the modem.</P>
<H4><A NAME="sec5"></A>Errors occur during MS-DOS – based applications communications sessions, especially file transfers.</H4><P>Increase the COMxBuffer setting in [386enh] section of SYSTEM.INI. The default value is 128 bytes.</P>
