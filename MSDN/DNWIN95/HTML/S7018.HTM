<h3>Using Bindery Emulation for Pass-Through Security</H3><P>File and Printer Sharing for NetWare Networks grants access to printers and directories on a per-user basis, which requires the name of the server to retrieve the names of users on a network. For NetWare versions 2.15 and 3.x servers, all the information for users, groups, passwords, and rights is stored in a database on the server called the bindery. NetWare version 4.x servers can appear to have a bindery using bindery emulation, which is enabled by default. Windows&nbsp;95 can use the bindery of one NetWare server.</P>
<P>Usually, companies have multiple NetWare servers for different departments, and individual users log on to a different server by department. Problems can occur when the list of accounts differs between NetWare servers. For example, assume that AnnieP and YusufM log on to the SALES server, and KrisI is on the R&amp;D server. AnnieP can select only one server for pass-through validation, so she must select the SALES server, because that's where this account is located for logon. She can grant access to YusufM, but not to KrisI.</P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
