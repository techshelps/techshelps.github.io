<h3>Defining a Dial-Up Networking Connection</H3><P>Windows&nbsp;95 guides you through making a new remote connection when you first run Dial-Up Networking. Before creating a new Dial-Up Networking connection, you should install a modem. The Make New Connection wizard prompts you to do so, or you can install it separately by using the Install New Modem wizard in the Modems option in Control Panel. For information, see Chapter 25, "Modems and Communications Tools."</P>
<H4><A NAME="sec0"></A>To create a Dial-Up Networking connection using the Make New Connection wizard</H4><OL><LI>From My Computer, double-click the Dial-Up Networking folder.</LI><LI>In the Dial-Up Networking window, double-click the Make New Connection icon. </LI><LI>The Make New Connection wizard prompts you for the information needed to define a connection, including a name for the computer you are dialing, modem type, area code, telephone number, and country code. 
<P>The new icon for your connection appears in the Dial-Up Networking window. You need to provide this information only once for each connection you define. </P></LI></OL><P><B>Note</B>   You can adjust the dialing string in Dialing Properties, which is accessible from the Connect To dialog box that appears when you double-click a connection icon. </P>
<P>When a user connects to a remote server, a terminal window can be displayed to support an interactive logon session with the server. After a connection is established, remote network access becomes transparent to the user. </P>
<H4><A NAME="sec1"></A>To make sure a network connection has been established</H4><UL><LI>Double-click Network Neighborhood, click Map Network Drive, and then type a path name to a network server. </LI></UL><H4><A NAME="sec2"></A>To display a terminal window before or after dialing</H4><OL><LI>Click a connection icon, click the File menu, and then click Properties.</LI><LI>In General properties, click the Configure button, and then click the Options tab. </LI><LI>In the Options dialog box, click the option named Bring Up Terminal Window Before Dialing or the option named Bring Up Terminal Window After Dialing. </LI></OL><H4><A NAME="sec3"></A>Tip for Using Dialing Properties to Change Location Information</H4><P>Dial-Up Networking is a TAPI-enabled application. This means that Dial-Up Networking can offload the work of matching the correct phone dialing string from the location to the TAPI components designed for that role. When you attempt a Dial-Up Networking connection, you can choose to edit your calling location by using Dialing Properties. </P>
<P>With Dialing Properties, you can specify area code, special numbers needed to reach an outside line, and calling card information you may need for the connection number. The Windows&nbsp;95 TAPI services will then automatically adjust the dial string it sends to your modem. For more information, see Chapter 25, "Modems and Communications Tools."</P>
<P></P>
<P>The configurations you set up for each connection are stored in the Registry under </P>
<P><BR></P>
<pre><code>Hkey_Current_User\RemoteAccess\Addresses\<I>My Connection</I> </code></pre>
<P>You can predefine Dial-Up Networking connections for users by including them as part of system policies. If you enable user profile, different users sharing the same computer can use separate dialing configurations. For more information, see Chapter 15, "User Profiles and System Policies."</P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
