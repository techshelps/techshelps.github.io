<h3>Managing User Lists </H3><P>Windows&nbsp;95 user-level security depends on a list of accounts and groups located on a security provider. You cannot add or remove users and groups from the security provider list by using Windows&nbsp;95 tools. However, you can do this by running User Manager for a Windows&nbsp;NT domain, SYSCON for NetWare 3.x, and NETADMIN for NetWare 4.x. in a NetWare bindery environment. You can use these tools on a computer running Windows&nbsp;95. These tools are provided by the respective vendors and not by Windows&nbsp;95. </P>
<P>Under Windows&nbsp;95, you specify what rights users have to specific resources on the local computer as described in the preceding section. For more information about changing a user's access rights, see "Specifying Directory Access Rights in User-Level Security " earlier in this chapter.</P>
<P><b>Note</b></P>
<P>Although Windows&nbsp;NT networks allow multiple domains, a computer running Windows&nbsp;95 can specify only one domain for user-level security. To use a trust relationship to access multiple domains, you should consult the <I>Windows&nbsp;NT Server 3.5 Concepts and Planning Guide</I> that is part of the Windows&nbsp;NT Server documentation set.</P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
