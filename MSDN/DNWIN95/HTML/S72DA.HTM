<h3>Architecture for Peer Resource Sharing</H3><P>Windows&nbsp;95 includes components to support file and printer sharing on Microsoft networks and NetWare networks. </P>
<P></P>
<P>When File and Printer Sharing for Microsoft Networks is installed, the Windows&nbsp;95 SMB server (VSERVER.VXD) is added to the computer's configuration. This component supports all Microsoft networking products that use the SMB file-sharing protocol. The following illustration shows the basic supporting files for File and Printer Sharing for Microsoft Networks in the Windows&nbsp;95 networking architecture.</P>

<P>When File and Printer Sharing for NetWare Networks is installed, the Windows&nbsp;95 NCP server (NWSERVER.VXD) is added to the computer's configuration. Client for NetWare Networks is used to get NetWare server connection information and to enable user-level security based on a NetWare server's user accounts. The following illustration shows the supporting files for File and Printer Sharing for NetWare Networks in the Windows&nbsp;95 networking architecture.</P>

<P>For File and Printer Sharing services with user-level security, the security provider (MSSP.VXD or NWSP.VXD) assists in validating user access when sharing a resource and in retrieving a user list when administrating the server. The network address book (MSAB32.DLL or NWAB32.DLL) translates the account lists from the server and provides the Add Users dialog box for selecting which users get access rights. The file security component (FILESEC.VXD) provides access control based on information in the Registry. Notice that these same security components support features such as remote Registry access even when File and Printer Sharing services are not present.</P>
