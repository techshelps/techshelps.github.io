<h2>Multiple Network Support</H2><P></P>
<P>The Windows&nbsp;95 modular network provider interface, as described in this section, supports concurrent communication with several different networks. For example, a computer can have connections to computers running Windows&nbsp;95 peer resource-sharing services, to servers for Windows NT and NetWare networks, and to the Internet, all at the same time. </P>
<P>In addition to the Windows&nbsp;95 network client and peer sharing components, Windows&nbsp;95 includes built-in support for the following network clients from other vendors:</P>
<UL><LI>Artisoft&reg; LANtastic&reg; version 5.0 and later</LI><LI>Banyan&reg; VINES&reg; version 5.52 and later</LI><LI>DEC&trade; PATHWORKS&trade; (installed as a protocol)</LI></UL><P></P>
<UL><LI>Novell&reg; NetWare&reg; version 3.11 and later</LI><LI>SunSoft&trade; PC-NFS&reg; version 5.0 and later</LI></UL><P></P>
<P>Most of these network clients can be installed along with protected-mode Windows 95 networking components. Windows&nbsp;95 does not include the supporting files for these networks; you must obtain them from the network vendor. For information about these network clients, see Chapter 10, "Windows 95 on Other Networks."</P>
<P></P>
<P>Multiple network support in Windows&nbsp;95 consists of these components, as described in the following sections:</P>
<UL><LI>Win32 WinNet API </LI><LI>Multiple provider router and service provider interface</LI><LI>Network providers (including the WinNet16 interface)</LI></UL><P><B>Components of multiple network support in Windows&nbsp;95</B></P>
