<h3>Features for Users with Low Vision</H3><P>This section describes the specific accessibility features that Windows&nbsp;95 provides to users with limited vision, including:</P>
<UL><LI>Scalable user interface elements</LI><LI>Customizable display for mouse pointer</LI><LI>High-contrast mode</LI></UL><H4><A NAME="sec0"></A>Scalable User Interface Elements</H4><P>Users who have limited vision or who suffer eyestrain during normal use of a video display can now adjust the sizes of window titles, scroll bars, borders, menu text, and other standard screen elements. These sizes are completely customizable using Appearance properties in the Display option of Control Panel. Users can also choose between two sizes for the built-in system font.</P>
<H4><A NAME="sec1"></A>Customizable Display for Mouse Pointer</H4><P>Users who have difficulty seeing or following the mouse pointer can now set the following characteristics, to improve visibility of the mouse pointer:</P>
<UL><LI>Pointer size</LI><LI>Pointer color</LI><LI>Speed of the pointer</LI><LI>Visible trails of pointer movement</LI><LI>Animation of the pointer</LI></UL><P>Customizable mouse pointer display schemes are loaded automatically when you install Windows&nbsp;95 from the compact disc, using Typical setup. If another setup type is used, install the schemes after Setup is run, using the Add/Remove Programs icon in Control Panel. After installation, the user can select, through the Mouse option in Control Panel, a small, medium, or large mouse pointer scheme on a monochrome display. </P>
<P>In addition, with the Windows&nbsp;95 compact disc, the user can install color schemes and select from red, gray, yellow, green, or violet 16-color schemes for the mouse pointer. Settings for pointer speed and for showing pointer trails (of user-specified lengths) are also available.</P>
<P><b>Note</b></P>
<P>Not all displays support mouse pointer color schemes.</P>
<P>Windows&nbsp;95 features an animated hourglass pointer for better viewing. </P>
<H4><A NAME="sec2"></A>High-Contrast Color Schemes</H4><P>Windows&nbsp;95 color schemes allow users to choose from several well designed sets of screen-color options, designed both to match users' individual tastes and to meet their visual needs. The new color schemes in Windows&nbsp;95 include high-contrast colors, such as white text on a black background, or black text on a white background. These high-contrast color schemes optimize the visibility of screen objects, making it easier for users with visual impairments. </P>
<H4><A NAME="sec3"></A>High-Contrast Mode</H4><P>Many users with low vision require a high degree of contrast between foreground and background objects, in order to distinguish the objects. For example, some users may not be able to easily read black text on a gray background, or text drawn over a picture. By setting a global flag, users can now instruct Windows&nbsp;95 and applications to display information with a high degree of contrast. Activating high-contrast mode automatically selects the user's preferred color scheme.</P>
<P>Users can activate high-contrast mode using Accessibility Options in Control Panel, or using an emergency hot key sequence (pressing left alt, left shift, and print screen keys simultaneously). </P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
