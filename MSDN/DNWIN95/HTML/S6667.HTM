<h3>Correcting Problems with Modem Installation</H3><P>This section describes situations that can interfere with installation of a modem, and how to fix them.</P>
<H4><A NAME="sec0"></A>The Install New Modem wizard detected the modem as a standard modem.</H4><P>This does not indicate a problem. Rather, it means that Windows&nbsp;95 was unable to detect the exact make and model of a modem. Most communications applications work correctly with the Standard Modem option, that is, connections can be made successfully using the modem's factory default settings. However, advanced control of some features, such as speaker volume, error control (for example, V.42 protocol), and compression (for example, V.42bis protocol) will be disabled in the modem's properties.</P>
<P>If you do not want to use the Standard Modem option, you can run the Install New Modem wizard to select a specific type of modem that is similar to the modem you are using. If you specify another, similarly named model from the same manufacturer — for example, if you configure the modem as a Practical Peripherals PM9600HC when a Practical Peripherals PM9600FX modem is actually installed — Windows&nbsp;95 usually treats the models as being identical and the specified configuration will probably work well. To determine if other modem models are compatible with the one you are using, check the modem manual. Many modems are compatible with Hayes&reg;, Microcom&reg;, Rockwell, or U.S. Robotics models.</P>
<H4><A NAME="sec1"></A>The Install New Modem wizard did not detect any new modems.</H4><UL><LI>Make sure the modem does not already appear in the list of installed modems. Windows&nbsp;95 will not redetect modems that are already installed.</LI><LI>Make sure no other programs are running that might be using the modem or its COM port.</LI><LI>If the modem is external, check the connection between it and your computer, and reset it by turning it off and on again.</LI><LI>If the modem is internal, make sure that its built-in COM port has been configured properly in Device Manager in the System option in Control Panel. If it does not appear, run the Add New Hardware wizard to allow Windows&nbsp;95 to detect and configure it.</LI><LI>Make sure the modem's COM port is active and has a correct IRQ by checking its Resources configurations in Device Manager in the System option in Control Panel. Make sure the IRQ does not conflict with one in use by another device. For details, see Chapter 19, "Devices."</LI></UL><P>If the Install New Modem wizard still does not detect a modem, then there is probably a problem with the port, the cable, or the modem itself. Try the modem with an MS-DOS – based communications program, or with another computer, if possible.</P>
<H4><A NAME="sec2"></A>The Install New Modem wizard does not detect a PCMCIA modem. </H4><P>If the Windows&nbsp;95 PCMCIA drivers are loaded, then Windows&nbsp;95 should automatically detect and configure a PCMCIA modem when it is installed. Use the PCMCIA option in Control Panel to check the configuration of a PCMCIA socket driver.</P>
<P>If the Windows&nbsp;95 PCMCIA drivers are <I>not</I> being used, then the modem card must be configured as a COM port before the Install New Modem wizard can detect and configure it as a modem. </P>
<H4><A NAME="sec3"></A>To detect and configure a PCMCIA modem when Windows&nbsp;95 PCMCIA drivers are not used</H4><OL><LI>Configure the modem according to the instructions that came with your original PCMCIA driver software. </LI><LI>Run the Add New Hardware wizard to detect and configure the card as a COM port. </LI><LI>Run the Install New Modem wizard to detect and configure the card as a modem.</LI></OL><P>For more information about PCMCIA devices, see Chapter 19, "Devices."</P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
