<h3>Key Features of the Ideal Configuration</H3><P>This section provides detailed discussions of the features which might be included in an ideal network client configuration.</P>
<H4><A NAME="sec0"></A>Using a 32-bit, Protected-Mode Network Client</H4><P>For best performance, select a network client that uses a 32-bit redirector for accessing servers. Windows&nbsp;95 includes the 32-bit Microsoft Client for NetWare Networks and the Client for Microsoft Networks; each of these has a 32-bit redirector. The benefits of using a 32-bit, protected-mode client include the following:</P>
<P></P>
<P></P>
<UL><LI>Provides for easy installation and configuration using built-in Windows&nbsp;95 tools</LI><LI>Uses no real-mode memory</LI><LI>Provides faster data I/O across the network</LI><LI>Offers greater stability than real-mode redirectors</LI><LI>Allows more than one redirector to be run at one time, and thereby enables access to servers for multiple networks without having to reload the operating system for a new network client</LI><LI>Makes networking seamless in the Windows&nbsp;95 user interface; users can browse the server for multiple networks in Network Neighborhood, all within the same namespace — users don't need to know which type of network they are browsing</LI></UL><P></P>
<P>If you are using another type of network, contact your network vendor regarding the availability of a 32-bit, protected-mode network client. If a protected-mode client is unavailable, you can run a protected-mode Windows&nbsp;95 client such as Client for Microsoft Networks in conjunction with a real-mode network client. </P>
<H4><A NAME="sec1"></A>Using a 32-bit, Protected-Mode Protocol</H4><P>If you select a 32-bit, protected-mode network client, then by default Windows&nbsp;95 also sets up a 32-bit, protected-mode protocol. Even if you are running a real-mode client such as the Novell&reg; 3.x workstation shell (NETX) with a real-mode implementation of IPX/SPX to access NetWare&reg; servers, you can still load the 32-bit version of the Microsoft IPX/SPX-compatible protocol. The benefits of adding the protected-mode protocol are better performance and better stability for network communications to servers that are not running NetWare (for example, computers running Windows&nbsp;95 or Windows&nbsp;NT).</P>
<P>In addition, for protocols such as TCP/IP, the Microsoft 32-bit version enables additional functionality such as the ability to use DHCP and WINS servers that dynamically set the IP addresses and resolve computer names for client computers on the network. Each protocol has a number of benefits, as discussed in Chapter 12, "Network Technical Discussion."</P>
<H4><A NAME="sec2"></A>Using the Latest Network Adapter Drivers</H4><P>For best performance, use the latest network adapter drivers available. These should be NDIS 3.1-compatible drivers which provide Plug and Play capabilities. Such drivers take up no real-mode memory and can be loaded or unloaded dynamically as required. </P>
<P>The only instances in which you wouldn't use the latest drivers are:</P>
<UL><LI>The newest driver isn't available for your network adapter.</LI><LI>Your site requires ODI cards and drivers.</LI></UL></FONT></BODY></HTML>
