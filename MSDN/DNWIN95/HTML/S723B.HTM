<h3>Microsoft Mail IBM PROFS and OfficeVision Gateway </H3><P>With this gateway, PROFS and OfficeVision users send mail to Microsoft Mail users using standard PROFS and OfficeVision or CMS NOTE addressing formats. Users on PROFS and OfficeVision systems can respond to a message from either system using the Reply option and receive automatic acknowledgment of registered mail delivery.</P>
<P>Microsoft Mail IBM PROFS and OfficeVision Gateway includes the following features: </P>
<UL><LI>Flexible and reliable architecture to improve connectivity. A mainframe component creates a virtual machine (VM) and identifier for the Remote Spooling Communication Subsystem (RSCS). A standard Network Job Entry (NJE) RSCS link connects Mail to the VM. Multiple LANs can be connected to single or multiple VM nodes.</LI><LI>Transparent exchange of scheduling information. When PROFS and OfficeVision users receive meeting requests or meeting notes from Microsoft Schedule+, they appear as familiar PROFS and OfficeVision meeting requests and vice versa. Free and busy times of PROFS and OfficeVision users can be periodically downloaded to the LAN for scheduling purposes.</LI><LI>Extensive file support between systems to help mainframe and personal computer users work together more effectively. VM users can send files to Microsoft Mail users using SENDFILE, DISK DUMP, PUNCH, and PRINT formats. In addition, Microsoft Mail attachments appear as files in the VM user's Virtual READER.</LI><LI>Generic Routing Facility (GRF) to make the gateway easy to administer and troubleshoot. All Microsoft Mail users appear to PROFS and OfficeVision users as if they are on a single VM node. (The ability to define a VM node per Microsoft Mail workgroup postoffice still exists, even if GRF is being used.) Using message size restrictions, administrators can limit the size of messages transmitted.</LI><LI>Distribution Manager adds document-exchange features and links Microsoft Mail to a variety of host systems. It offers the ability to exchange messages and documents with other messaging systems that use the Document Interchange Architecture (ZIP packet protocol), such as OfficeVision/MVS, OfficeVision/400&trade;, PS/CICS, System/36, remote PROFS and OfficeVision using DISOSS, and (through gateways) DEC&reg; All-In-1, WANG Office, and Verimation Memo.</LI></UL></FONT></BODY></HTML>
