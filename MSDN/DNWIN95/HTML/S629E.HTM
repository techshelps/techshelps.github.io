<h3>Installing Windows 95 over Windows 3.x</H3><P>If you have Windows 3.x or Windows for Workgroups 3<I>.</I>x, you can either upgrade the current installation to Windows&nbsp;95 (the preferred method) or install this version of Windows&nbsp;95 in a new directory. </P>
<P>If you choose to upgrade your existing Windows installation, Windows&nbsp;95 Setup uses existing configuration information to set installation defaults and to set other configuration options. Windows&nbsp;95 Setup converts all Windows 3.x Program Manager groups to folders inside the Programs directory, so they appear on the Windows&nbsp;95 Start menu. These folders can be opened or explored to find the applications previously contained in them. Windows&nbsp;95 automatically creates a shortcut for each original icon you had under the previous version of Windows. </P>
<P>Windows&nbsp;95 Setup checks for the following files to determine whether the current installation is an upgrade to Windows 3.x: WINVER.EXE, USER.EXE, WIN.COM, SYSTEM.INI, and WINI.INI, plus PROTOCOL.INI for Windows for Workgroups 3.x. When searching for these files, Windows&nbsp;95 Setup also checks the files for version information. (False files with the same name won't work.)</P>
