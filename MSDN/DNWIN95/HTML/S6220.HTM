<h3>Copying Files and Completing Setup</H3><P>After hardware detection is complete and Windows&nbsp;95 Setup has obtained all required information, the next phase of Windows&nbsp;95 Setup begins. During this phase, the Windows&nbsp;95 files are copied to the destination drive and directory.</P>

<P><img src="RK03_22.gif"></P>
<P>If you chose to have Windows&nbsp;95 Setup create a startup disk, Setup asks you to insert a floppy disk into drive A. The disk does not need to be formatted or empty, but any information you have stored on the disk will be permanently deleted. After you insert the disk, click OK to create the startup disk. Windows&nbsp;95 Setup formats the disk and copies the appropriate files.</P>
<P>When the basic installation steps are completed, Windows&nbsp;95 Setup asks you to remove any disks from the floppy disk drives. After you click OK, the computer is restarted, and the final phase of the installation process begins, which includes converting Windows Program Manager groups and migrating various system configuration settings to the Registry.</P>
<P>Near the end of the installation process, Windows&nbsp;95 Setup asks you to complete several configuration options. These configuration options are referred to as Run-Once options, because after you have completed the installation steps for these options, that particular set of activities is not repeated again when you choose the related option in Control Panel. Some Run-Once installation procedures are described in the following sections.</P>
<P>For more information about this phase, see Chapter 6, "Setup Technical Discussion."</P>
<H4><A NAME="sec0"></A>Setting the Local Time Zone</H4><P>Setup prompts you to set the time zone for your location. This is an important step for network computers that need to keep time stamps synchronized.</P>

<H4><A NAME="sec2"></A>Installing and Configuring a Printer</H4><P>If you are installing Windows&nbsp;95 in a new directory or on a computer that did not have a previous version of Windows, Windows&nbsp;95 Setup automatically runs the Add Printer wizard the first time that Windows&nbsp;95 is started after the basic installation is complete. </P>

For information about installing and managing printers in Windows&nbsp;95, see Chapter 23, "Printing and Fonts."</P></li>
<P>If you are installing Windows&nbsp;95 in the same directory as an earlier version of Windows, then your previous printer configuration is incorporated into Windows&nbsp;95 and the wizard for installing printers does not run during Setup.</P>
<H4><A NAME="sec4"></A>Configuring Microsoft Exchange</H4><P></P>
<P></P>
<P>During the final stages of Windows&nbsp;95 Setup, the Inbox Setup wizard runs automatically if you selected Microsoft Exchange in the Select Components screen.</P>
<P>If the administrator has already created a postoffice, added users to it, and shared it with all users on the network, the postoffice name and location appear in the dialog box automatically without requiring you to type this information. This makes setting up the Microsoft Exchange client with the Microsoft Mail workgroup postoffice easy for all users in the workgroup. For information about setting up a Microsoft Mail workgroup postoffice, see Chapter 26, "Electronic Mail and Microsoft Exchange."</P>
<H4><A NAME="sec5"></A>To configure the Microsoft Exchange client</H4><OL><LI>When the Inbox Setup wizard appears, follow the instructions on the screen for configuring the Microsoft Exchange client on your computer. </LI><LI>If you also selected Microsoft Mail Services in addition to Microsoft Exchange, the wizard prompts you for the path name for the postoffice location, your Microsoft Mail user name, and Microsoft Mail password. </LI></OL><H4><A NAME="sec6"></A>Completing Windows 95 Setup</H4><P>Depending on the options you selected during Setup, the hardware devices you have, or the computer you have, additional Run-Once options might need to be completed, such as the wizard for configuring MIDI devices. After all the Run-Once options are completed, all of the files are installed, and the computer is configured to run your applications.</P>
