<h2>System Configuration Overview</H2><P>Windows&nbsp;95 includes several tools and built-in features that make it easy to configure the hardware and software you use on your computer. </P>
<P><B>Automatic hardware detection.</B></P>
<P>Hardware designed to work with Windows&nbsp;95 is virtually self-configuring. When you run Windows&nbsp;95 Setup, an automatic hardware detection routine searches your computer to determine the hardware components that are installed. Whether your system includes Plug and Play-compliant or legacy components, Windows&nbsp;95 can automatically detect and configure them. Windows&nbsp;95 Plug and Play features are described in "Plug and Play Support in Windows 95" later in this chapter. For more information about hardware detection during Setup, see Chapter 6, "Setup Technical Discussion."</P>
<P><B>Transfer of Windows 3.x or Windows for Workgroups settings.</B></P>
<P>When you upgrade to Windows&nbsp;95 from an earlier version of Windows, Windows 95 Setup automatically updates system configuration settings (such as those in SYSTEM.INI and CONFIG.SYS) and moves them to the Registry. For information, see Chapter 6, "Setup Technical Discussion."</P>
<P><B>Configuration wizards.</B></P>
<P>Windows&nbsp;95 includes online wizards for installing new hardware, adding modems, adding printers, and installing applications. These tools lead you through all the steps you need to configure the new component on a computer.</P>
<P><B>Point and print.</B></P>
<P>When you copy a printer icon from the server's window to your own Printers window or desktop, Windows&nbsp;95 automatically installs the correct printer driver and configures the network connection to a network printer.</P>

<P><B>Control Panel options for system configuration.</B></P>
<P>The Control Panel includes several tools for configuring various parts of your system. The following table describes some of the Control Panel tools for system configuration.</P>
