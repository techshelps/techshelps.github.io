<h3>Security for Windows 95 in NetWare Bindery Environments</H3><P>NetWare 3.x servers store all the information about users, groups, passwords, and rights in a database stored on the server called the bindery. NetWare 4.x servers can appear to have a bindery through bindery emulation, a feature which is enabled by default. There is a separate bindery for each NetWare server. Windows&nbsp;95 can use the bindery of only one NetWare server as the security provider. </P>
<P>It is common for a company to have one or more NetWare servers per department, where users log on to the server for their department. This scenario can pose a problem when the list of accounts differs from one NetWare server to another. </P>
<P>For example, Sue and Bob log on to the Sales server and Fred logs on to the R&amp;D server. Because Sue is running Windows&nbsp;95 and can specify only one server for pass-through validation, she specifies Sales (the server she uses for logon). She can now grant access to shared resources on her computer to Bob but cannot grant access to Fred.</P>
<P>The only way to solve this problem is to include all user accounts for all servers on one NetWare server. This server should be specified as the security provider for every computer running Windows&nbsp;95 with File and Printer Sharing for NetWare Networks.</P>
<P><b>Note</b></P>
<P>User-level security in Windows&nbsp;95 does not support the use of NetWare domains and the NetWare Name Service (NNS), an Add-On service for NetWare&nbsp;4.x servers to obtain user lists. Windows&nbsp;95 does support NetWare 4.x with bindery emulation to obtain user lists.</P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
