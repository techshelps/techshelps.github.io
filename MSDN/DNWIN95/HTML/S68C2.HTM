<h3>Features for Users Who Are Deaf or Hard-of-Hearing</H3><P>ShowSounds and SoundSentry provide visible feedback in place of audible signals or speech, to users who have hearing disabilities or who work in extremely noisy conditions.</P>
<H4><A NAME="sec0"></A>ShowSounds</H4><P>This is a global flag that instructs applications to provide visible feedback—in effect asking the applications to be "closed-captioned."</P>
<H4><A NAME="sec1"></A>SoundSentry</H4><P>SoundSentry tells Windows to send a visual cue, such as a blinking title bar or a screen flash whenever there is a system beep. This allows users to see the message that may not have been heard.</P>
<H4><A NAME="sec2"></A>WinChat</H4><P>You can use the WinChat utility to have an electronic conversation with up to seven other people who are using Windows&nbsp;95. Unlike an electronic mail message that you compose, save, and then send to another person, a WinChat message is visible to others as you type it. The WinChat utility is provided in the OTHER\CHAT directory on the Windows&nbsp;95 compact disc.</P>
<P>This utility is appropriate to install on all computers running Windows&nbsp;95 in an environment that includes users who are deaf or hard-of-hearing. WinChat is the best alternative form of communication when an interpreter or a text telephone (called a "TT" or "TDD") is not available. </P>
<P>If Windows&nbsp;95 is installed on a computer that did not previously have Windows for Workgroups installed, you can install WinChat from the Windows&nbsp;95 compact disc.</P>
<P></P>

In the Install From Disk dialog box, supply the path to the OTHER\CHAT directory on the Windows&nbsp;95 compact disc.</LI><LI>In the Have Disk box, click the WinChat entry in the Components list, and click the Install button.</LI></OL><P>If Windows&nbsp;95 users previously ran WinChat under Windows for Workgroups, and upgraded to Windows&nbsp;95 in their previous Windows directory, WinChat is still available on their computers. </P>

The bottom window displays what the other person is typing. Each time you add a person to your conversation, a new window opens. If there are six people in a conversation, there are six windows open. </P>
<P>Only the person who initiates the call can add another person to the conversation or end the conversation. </P>
