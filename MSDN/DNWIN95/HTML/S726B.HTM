<h2>Overview of Windows 95 Mobile Computing Features</H2>
<P>Windows&nbsp;95 eliminates many of the hardware and software configuration steps previously required when switching to or from a portable computer. Windows&nbsp;95 uses hardware profiles to determine which drivers to load if the system hardware changes when you move to a new site. For more information, see Chapter 19, "Devices."</P>
