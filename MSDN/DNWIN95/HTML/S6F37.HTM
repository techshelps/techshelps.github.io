<h3>Loading Hardware Profiles and Real-Mode Drivers</H3><P>After BIOS initialization, the operating system attempts to determine the current configuration, including whether the computer is a docking station. This is done by using a hardware profile that Windows&nbsp;95 selects before CONFIG.SYS is processed. The hardware profile is built by a detection process that collects information about interrupt usage, BIOS serial and parallel ports, BIOS computer identification, Plug and Play BIOS docking-station data, and, if possible, docking-station data that is unique to each OEM. Then the detection process builds a 2-byte value known as the current hardware profile (or the current configuration).</P>
<P>Each hardware profile has a name that matches a top-level menu item in a multiconfigured CONFIG.SYS file (that is, the long text in the menu, not the section name enclosed in square brackets). Windows&nbsp;95 automatically selects that multiconfiguration menu item and processes the corresponding section of CONFIG.SYS. </P>
<P>CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT are processed at this point. Although these files are not required for Windows&nbsp;95, they are used for backward compatibility with applications created for MS-DOS or Windows 3.x. In Windows&nbsp;95, CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT are processed much like they are processed under MS-DOS&nbsp;6.x. Drivers and TSRs specified in these files are loaded in real mode. </P>
<P>For more information, see "System Startup Files" later in this chapter.</P>
<P><B>Note</B>   The real-mode MS-DOS errors are standard, as documented in the <I>MS-DOS&nbsp;6.0 Programmer's Reference.</I></P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
