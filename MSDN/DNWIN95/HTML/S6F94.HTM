<h3>Microsoft Client for NetWare Networks: The Benefits</H3><P><B>Architecture for Client for NetWare Network</B></P>
<P><img src="RK09_13.gif"></P>
<P>If you are installing Windows&nbsp;95 to run on a NetWare network, Microsoft recommends that you use the Microsoft Client for NetWare Networks, which provides a 32-bit, protected-mode redirector. Client for NetWare Networks can be installed to coexist with Client for Microsoft Networks or a 16-bit network client, or it can be used as the sole network support for Windows&nbsp;95. For technical information about these optional configurations, see Chapter 32, "Windows 95 Network Architecture."</P>
<P>Using Client for NetWare Networks provides the following benefits.</P>
<P><B>A high-performance system using no conventional memory.</B></P>
<P>Client for NetWare Networks uses only 32-bit protocols, drivers, and supporting files. This client is designed to be used in a multitasking environment and provides the robust performance available for all protected-mode components in Windows&nbsp;95, using no conventional memory space. On large block transfers over the network, Client for NetWare Networks is up to 200 percent faster than Windows 3.x with the VLM client. For most network operations that are a mix of reading and writing, Client for NetWare Networks is 50 to 200 percent faster, depending upon the mix of I/O operations.</P>
<P><B>Protected-mode peer resource sharing services.</B></P>
<P>This includes the ability to share resources such as a CD-ROM drive as a network resource. To use Microsoft File and Printer Sharing for NetWare Networks, the computer must be running Client for NetWare Networks. For more information, see Chapter 11, "Logon, Browsing, and Resource Sharing."</P>

<P><B>Interoperation and logon with NetWare 2.15, 3.x, and 4.x servers.</B></P>
<P>This includes support for running NetWare login scripts. Client for NetWare Networks can access servers running NetWare 2.15 and above, NetWare 3.x servers (which are bindery-based), and NetWare 4.x servers using bindery emulation. Windows&nbsp;95 provides a script processor for running login scripts.</P>
<P><B>Support for packet-burst protocol for faster data transfer.</B></P>
<P>Client for NetWare Networks with peer resource sharing supports burst-mode NCPs, a sliding window implementation. This feature can also be disabled, as described in Chapter 11, "Logon, Browsing, and Resource Sharing."</P>
<P><B>Automatic reconnection for lost server connection</B></P>
<P>When servers are available again after the loss of a NetWare Core Protocol (NCP) connection, Windows&nbsp;95 reconnects automatically and rebuilds the user's environment, including connection status, drive mappings, and printer connections. (Novell-supplied AUTO.VLM only reconnects servers.) This also means that the client is not affected if the server is down or the network cable is not working.</P>
<P><B>Large Internetwork Packet (LIP) protocol support.</B></P>
<P>LIP works to increase the speed of data transmission when communication occurs over a router. Previously, if a server identified a router between itself and the client, the packet size was set to 576 bytes (including 64 bytes of header information). Using LIP, the client and server can negotiate the packet size used when communication occurs through a router. With LIP, the packets can be set to a maximum of 4202 bytes, based on the maximum physical packet size of the server. LIP is enabled between computers running Client for NetWare Networks and NetWare 3.12 – 4.x servers or any computer running Microsoft File and Printer Sharing for NetWare Networks. </P>

<P><B>Support for all documented MS-DOS and NetWare APIs defined by Novell.</B></P>
<P>This includes support for all NetWare 3.x APIs defined in <I>Novell NetWare Client SDK</I>. NetWare-aware applications that use only these documented APIs are compatible with Client for NetWare Networks. For more information, see "Client for NetWare Networks Technical Notes" later in this chapter. </P>
<P><B>Enhanced performance and new networking features.</B></P>
<P>These features, which are made available when using protected-mode networking components, are described in detail elsewhere in the <I>Windows&nbsp;95 Resource Kit</I>:</P>
<UL><LI>Client-side caching for network information and complete Plug and Play support, as described in Chapter 7, "Introduction to Windows 95 Networking." </LI><LI>Remote network access to NetWare networks, as described in Chapter 28, "Dial-Up Networking and Mobile Computing." </LI><LI>User profiles for system configuration<B>, </B>as described in Chapter 15, "User Profiles and System Policies."</LI><LI>Long filenames on the local computer, on computers running File and Printer Sharing Services for NetWare Networks, and on NetWare 3.x and 4.x volumes configured to use the OS/2 namespace. For information, see "Configuring NetWare Servers to Support Windows 95" later in this chapter.</LI></UL></FONT></BODY></HTML>
