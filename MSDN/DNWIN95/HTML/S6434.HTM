<h2>Enabling User Profiles</H2><P>You can enable user profiles after Windows&nbsp;95 is installed, either locally on a single computer or for multiple computers. You can avoid having to go to each computer to enable user profiles by creating a system policy that can be downloaded automatically when the initial Windows&nbsp;95 installation is complete. For information about enabling user profiles centrally on multiple computers, see "System Policies Overview" later in this chapter.</P>
