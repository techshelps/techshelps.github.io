<h3>Controlling Audio Input Levels</H3><P>Windows&nbsp;95 includes a Volume Control tool that provides audio line routing services to manage the different audio lines installed on a computer. An audio line consists of one or more channels of waveform-audio data coming from one origin or system resource. For example, a stereo audio line has two data channels, yet it is considered a single audio line. Each audio line also has zero or more mixer controls associated with it. A mixer control can take on a number of different characteristics (such as controlling volume) depending on the characteristics of the associated audio line.</P>
<P>The number of lines users can mix by using Volume Control depends on the number of audio source lines the computer has, and whether they are using Volume Control for input or output.</P>
<P>For more information about mixing sounds, see online Help.</P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
