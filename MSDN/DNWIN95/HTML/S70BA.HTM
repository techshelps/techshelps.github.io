<h2>Optimizing Network Performance</H2><P>Windows&nbsp;95 automatically adjusts system parameters to accommodate user demands and various network configurations. For example, it alters the size of the system paging file and cache buffer as memory requirements change and automatically tunes network time-out values to fit varying LAN topologies. </P>
<P>With a few exceptions, manual tuning of operating system parameters is not required to improve network performance. However, you can take several other measures that can increase file-sharing performance, such as reconfiguring or changing hardware components. This section summarizes these measures.</P>
<UL><LI>Use a 32-bit, protected-mode network client.
<P>For example, the Microsoft Client for NetWare Networks significantly out-performs the VLM or NETX version of the NetWare client. On large block transfers over the network, Client for NetWare Networks is up to twice as fast as Windows 3.x with the VLM shell, based on benchmarks performed by beta testers. The protected-mode networking client can take advantage of caching and other automatic tuning features. With a real-mode client, you are limited to the same performance tuning capabilities that were available under Windows&nbsp;3.x.</P></LI><LI>Use the new NDIS 3.1 network adapter drivers provided with Windows&nbsp;95.</LI><LI>Install a new network adapter. The adapters currently available provide markedly better performance than earlier models. If possible, select an adapter that matches the computer bus. For more information, see Chapter 12, "Network Technical Discussion."
<P>Network adapters have become exceptionally reliable and inexpensive. The low costs of Ethernet adapters, including new Plug and Play hardware, means that usually the most cost-effective way to improve network performance is to replace an older network adapter with a new model. The cost for the new hardware is offset almost immediately by savings in support time and improved performance.</P></LI></UL><P>The following measures can help you obtain the best performance from computers that provide File and Printer Sharing services:</P>
<UL><LI>Let Windows&nbsp;95 determine the right size for the swap file. </LI><LI>Make sure the computer has enough memory, depending on the size of your network and the number of users who will be accessing the peer server.</LI><LI>In the System option in Control Panel, set the typical role of the computer to Network Server, as described in "Optimizing File System Performance with Profiles" earlier in this chapter.</LI><LI>Install a high-performance network adapter on the peer server. If the computer uses an 8-bit adapter, you can increase performance significantly by replacing it with a high-performance 16-bit or 32-bit adapter. </LI><LI>Disable rarely used network adapters. This improves overall network performance by decreasing the number of broadcast packets on the network. Each broadcast packet must be processed by every active adapter on the network. High broadcast rates adversely affect LAN performance by increasing network connection time. You can disable a network adapter by disabling its binding to protocols in the Network option in Control Panel.</LI><LI>Install faster hard disks or disk controllers (or both). Typically, when setting up peer servers, you will want to choose computers configured with the best-performing hardware.</LI><LI>On a computer running File and Printer Sharing for NetWare Networks, set the read-only attribute on shared files wherever possible. The network client can take better advantage of file caching with read-only files, which will improve network performance and reduce the load on the server. </LI></UL></FONT></BODY></HTML>
