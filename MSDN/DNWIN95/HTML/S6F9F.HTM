<h2>Setting Up Windows 95 for NetWare Networks: an Overview</H2><P>If you are administering a NetWare network, the move to Windows&nbsp;95 will involve incremental planning, testing, and gradual implementation of Windows&nbsp;95 on many computers on the network. Typically, the administrator will take awhile to complete the following tasks:</P>
<OL><LI>Install Windows&nbsp;95 on a single workstation, and experiment with various configuration alternatives, including the following:

<UL><LI>Windows&nbsp;95 protected-mode network client vs. Novell real-mode client</LI><LI>Protected-mode NDIS 3.1-compliant MS-DOS vs. real-mode Open Datalink Interface (ODI) drivers</LI><LI>Protected-mode IPX/SPX-compatible protocol vs. existing IPX</LI><LI>Using a sole client vs. adding Client for Microsoft Networks</LI></UL><P>This task includes experimenting with the typical applications used at your site and working over the network to assess the performance, reliability, and robustness available under Windows&nbsp;95.</P></LI><LI>Prepare an implementation strategy, as summarized in Chapter 1, "Deployment Planning Basics."</LI><LI>Test the selected configuration of network clients, protocols, and drivers on a small network. This could include any combinations of the following:

<UL><LI>Windows&nbsp;95 installed over an existing 16-bit, Novell-supplied workstation client, using ODI drivers</LI><LI>Windows&nbsp;95 added to an existing Windows 3.x-and-NetWare installation, using Client for NetWare Networks and protected-mode network components</LI><LI>Windows&nbsp;95 as a new installation using all protected-mode components, including both Client for NetWare Networks and Client for Microsoft Networks, plus peer resource sharing support</LI></UL></LI><LI>Create default user profiles, system policies, and setup scripts, and perform other customization tasks for automatic installation and configuration, based on the inventory and implementation strategy.</LI><LI>Test automatic installation on a small network.</LI><LI>Prepare and implement the strategy for rollout on the larger network.</LI></OL><P>To support Novell NetWare integration with Windows&nbsp;95, any computer on which you are installing Windows&nbsp;95 should be connected to a NetWare server when you start Windows&nbsp;95 Setup. This requires that the computer be configured with either an ODI driver (recommended) or the monolithic IPX driver, in addition to either NETX or VLM to access resources on a NetWare server. </P>
<P>Windows&nbsp;95 Setup detects whether a Novell NetWare workstation shell is running on the computer. If Setup finds at least version 3.26 of NET*.COM, it automatically configures networking for NetWare networks. During the detection phase, Windows&nbsp;95 Setup also tries to determine whether the computer is using real-mode TSRs that cannot be replaced (such as DOSNP.COM, TCP/IP client software, or 3720 emulators). </P>
<P>After detection is complete, Windows&nbsp;95 Setup prepares to install protected-mode networking support based on Client for NetWare Networks, unless detection has found incompatible software components or the user specifies that network support should be based on Novell-supplied components. The new Windows&nbsp;95 protected-mode components are not installed automatically if detection finds the following:</P>
<UL><LI>The computer is using VLM with NetWare 4.x NDS. In this case, Setup leaves all existing networking components in place.</LI><LI>Certain TSRs are present that require ODI. In this case, Setup installs Client for NetWare Networks, but configures it to run over ODI.</LI><LI>Certain TSRs are present that are not compatible with the protected-mode client, but can use the new implementation of the IPX/SPX-compatible protocol. In this case, the real-mode network client and adapter drivers are left in place, but Setup installs the new protocol. </LI><LI>Certain TSRs are present that are not compatible with Client for NetWare Networks or other protected-mode components. In this case, Setup leaves all existing real-mode networking components in place.</LI></UL><P>To install Client for NetWare Networks and other protected-mode networking components, Setup might perform the following actions:</P>
<UL><LI>Comment out NetWare-related TSRs in AUTOEXEC.BAT that are not required with Client for NetWare Networks or other Windows 95 components</LI><LI>Move certain TSRs from AUTOEXEC.BAT to WINSTART.BAT so that this software can be loaded at the appropriate time during system startup</LI><LI>Install new 32-bit, protected-mode versions of networking components such as protocols and network adapter drivers</LI><LI>Comment out entries from SYSTEM.INI that are not required when using protected-mode networking components</LI><LI>Configure settings in the Registry related to support for NetWare networks</LI></UL><P>The actions for software detection and installation of new networking components are defined in a file named NETDET.INI in the Windows directory. Installation actions are defined in NETDET.INI for the software listed in the following table. For a complete and current list, see NETDET.INI in your Windows directory.</P>

<P>Windows&nbsp;95 Setup automatically configures settings for network adapters and protocols. The specific issues for configuring drivers and protocols depend on whether the computer is using Client for NetWare Networks or a Novell-supplied workstation shell.</P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
