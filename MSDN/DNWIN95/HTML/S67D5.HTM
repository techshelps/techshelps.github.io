<h2>Specifying International Settings </H2><P></P>
<P>During Windows 95 Setup, the operating system is configured for a default locale, either based on settings that Setup detects from the previous operating system or based on options that the user chooses. Windows&nbsp;95 Setup also copies most international information for all other supported locales onto the user's hard disk drive, where applications can access them. You can specify international settings during Windows&nbsp;95 Setup or change the default settings afterward in Control Panel. </P>
<P>During Setup, you can specify the following settings in the Computer Settings screen:</P>
<UL><LI>Regional settings, for specifying the local language and, in turn, the local conventions for other settings such as date, time, and currency formats. This also sets the MS-DOS code page and MS-DOS country settings. </LI><LI>Keyboard layout, for specifying the default keyboard layout to be used with Windows&nbsp;95, based on local requirements. This also sets the MS-DOS keyboard layout.</LI></UL><P></P>
<UL><LI>Language support, for selecting one of the following combination of languages: 

<UL><LI>English/Western European </LI><LI>English/Western European and Greek</LI><LI>English/Western European and Cyrillic</LI><LI>English/Western European and Central European</LI></UL><P>Windows&nbsp;95 selects the English Western European option by default.</P></LI></UL><P>After Setup, you can specify or modify the following settings in Control Panel:</P>
<UL><LI>Add languages and corresponding keyboard layouts using the Keyboard option, as described in "Using Alternate Keyboards" later in this chapter.</LI><LI>Modify the local language default for settings such as date, time, and currency using the Regional Settings option.</LI><LI>Add or remove language support (Greek, Cyrillic, or Central European) in the Add/Remove Programs option.</LI></UL><P>You can configure each of these settings by defining options in custom setup scripts, as described in the following sections. If user profiles are enabled (as described in Chapter 15, "User Profiles and System Policies"), the international settings preferences in Windows&nbsp;95 can be saved in each user's profile. In this case, if a single computer is used by multiple users, each user can select a different default locale. </P>
