<h2>Devices: The Issues</H2><P>For information related to the specific devices you are responsible for administering, check the lists of supported hardware in the Add New Hardware wizard and the README.TXT file provided with Windows&nbsp;95.</P>
<P>If you try to install device drivers that were created to run in 32-bit mode in Windows&nbsp;3.x, you can damage your Windows&nbsp;95 configuration, because these particular drivers add VxD information to the SYSTEM.INI file. If the device is supported under Windows&nbsp;95, the best way to recover and install the device is to do the following.</P>
