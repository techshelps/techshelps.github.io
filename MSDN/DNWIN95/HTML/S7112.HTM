<h2>Using Microsoft Backup</H2><P>Microsoft Backup, a Windows&nbsp;95 utility for backing up data, provides options for backing up files to floppy disks or tapes, restoring from disks or tapes, and comparing backup file sets to files on the hard disk. Microsoft Backup supports the QIC 113 backup tape specification, which includes support for long filenames.</P>
<P>For users familiar with the Windows&nbsp;3.1 Backup utility, the following list describes important differences in Backup under Windows&nbsp;95:</P>
<UL><LI>This version of Microsoft Backup does not support restoring backup sets created by MS-DOS version 6.x backup utilities.</LI><LI>The recommended method for creating a complete backup file set for the computer is the Full System Backup option. This option automatically selects the files required for a system backup
<P>If you decide to modify the default selections (by clearing the check boxes for some folders), be sure that you select at least the Windows directory; otherwise, the Registry will not be backed up.</P></LI><LI>When using the Backup tab in the Settings Options dialog box, notice that selecting Differential under the Type Of Backup option causes the utility to back up only files that have changed since the last time Backup was run. With this setting, new files will not be added to the file set and deleted files will not be removed.</LI></UL><P>For information about the Arcada&reg; and Cheyenne&reg; network backup agents, see Chapter 16, "Remote Administration." For information about how to use Backup, see online Help, which includes a list of the tape drives that are supported under Windows 95 and compatible with Windows 95.</P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
