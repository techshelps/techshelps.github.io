<h3>Installing the Network Monitor Agent and Driver</H3>
<P>When you install the Network Monitor agent, the protocol driver is also installed automatically. You must have both the agent and the driver installed if you want to use the agent with Network Monitor to conduct remote captures of network traffic to and from a computer running Windows&nbsp;95.</P>
<P>However, if you want only to view the performance counters in System Monitor and you want to prevent anyone from accessing the local computer by way of the Network Monitor agent, you can choose to install only the protocol driver. </P>
<P><b>Note</b></P>
<P>The Network Monitor application uses NetBIOS to control the remote-capture computer. If you are using the IPX/SPX-compatible protocol to connect the agent and manager computers, you must enable NetBIOS support for IPX/SPX, as described in Chapter 12, "Network Technical Discussion."</P>
