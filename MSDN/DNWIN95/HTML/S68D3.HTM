<h3>Using Accessibility Features in Windows 95</H3><P><img src="RKI_04.gif"></P>
<P>To see how the accessibility features in Windows&nbsp;95 make it easy to customize the appearance and behavior of the computer, try them out, using the following procedures.</P>
<H4><A NAME="sec0"></A>To perform mouse actions from the keyboard</H4><UL><LI>Press the left alt, the left shift, and the num lock keys simultaneously. You'll be able to drag and drop, and click or double-click both the primary and secondary mouse buttons by using your keyboard's numeric keypad. 
<P>For more information, see "MouseKeys" earlier in this appendix.</P></LI></UL><H4><A NAME="sec1"></A>To perform an ALT+TAB action with a pencil</H4><OL><LI>Press a shift key five consecutive times to start StickyKeys. When StickyKeys is activated, press the alt key and see what happens. Press tab and you'll have just typed two keys at once with a single finger. </LI><LI>Press the alt key twice, then press tab a few times to see the alt+ tab window and cycle through all the tasks you have running. When you're satisfied, press alt one more time to release it. </LI><LI>When you're ready to move on, turn off this feature by pressing two keys at the same time. Don't forget to watch the status indicator on the system taskbar.

These features are available whenever you need them, regardless of what you may be doing, even when you're running MS-DOS–based applications. </LI></UL><H4><A NAME="sec3"></A>To improve on-screen readability</H4><UL><LI>Press left alt + left shift + print screen and try to find a screen appearance that's better suited to your needs.
<P>This feature is useful for individuals who can't read black text on a gray background because all the lines blur together. </P></LI></UL></FONT></BODY></HTML>
