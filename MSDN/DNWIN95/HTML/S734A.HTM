<h2>Windows 95 Device Information Files Overview</H2><P>Device information (INF) files provide information used by Windows&nbsp;95 to install software that supports a given hardware device. When hardware manufactures introduce new products, they must create INF files to explicitly define the resources and files required for each class of device.</P>
<P>The format of the INF files is based on Windows 3.x INF files:</P>
<UL><LI>Section names are enclosed in brackets ([ ]) and must be unique within an INF file.</LI><LI>Keys within a section do not have to be unique, but the order of keys within a section is significant. </LI><LI>Private sections in an INF file are not evaluated by Windows&nbsp;95. </LI></UL><P>The operating system detects the unique ID of each device installed. For the device identified, a specific section of the INF file provides information on that class of device; the following describes the information contained in a typical INF file section. </P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
