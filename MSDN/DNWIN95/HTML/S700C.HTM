<h3>Overview of Security for Peer Resource Sharing</H3><P>For File and Printer Sharing for Microsoft Networks (but not NetWare), Windows&nbsp;95 supports share-level security similar to the security provided with Windows for Workgroups.<B><I> </I></B>This level of security associates a password with a shared disk directory or printer.<B><I> </I></B>Share-level security for peer resource sharing can be implemented in a Windows&nbsp;95-only peer-to-peer network or on a network supported by Windows&nbsp;NT or other Microsoft Windows network-compatible servers.</P>
<P>For File and Printer Sharing services on both Windows&nbsp;NT and NetWare networks, Windows&nbsp;95 supports user-level security by linking a peer server directly to another server for user account validation.<B><I> </I></B>For network administrators, the user account list is centrally controlled at the Windows&nbsp;NT domain controller or NetWare server; on a Windows&nbsp;NT network, the user account list on a single server can also be used for validation. The resources on the Windows&nbsp;95 peer server can be accessed only by users with accounts in the central database. Users can also be assigned specified access rights in Windows&nbsp;95 for particular resources.<B><I> </I></B>For information about using and managing security, see Chapter 14, "Security."</P>

<P>The 32-bit, protected mode network client and the File and Printer Sharing service are separate network processes, but they share connection information and pass requests to each other when validating a user-level security request.</P>
<P>For user-level security on a computer running either version of File and Printer Sharing service, you specify the server that contains the database of user accounts that are allowed to connect to this peer resource sharing server. You can do the following to customize access to a shared resource:</P>
<UL><LI>You can use the Windows&nbsp;95 user interface to specify which users can access the shared resources, and which rights they have. For details, see "Controlling Access to Peer Server Resources on NetWare Networks" later in this chapter.</LI><LI>For File and Printer Sharing on NetWare Networks, you can set up user rights remotely on the computer running Windows&nbsp;95 by using NetWare utilities such as FILER.</LI><LI>For File and Printer Sharing on Microsoft Networks, you can set up user rights remotely by using User Manager for Windows&nbsp;NT.</LI><LI>You can use Net Watcher to monitor, add, and remove shared resources, as described in Chapter 16, "Remote Administration."</LI></UL><P>When a user requests access to a shared resource under user-level security, Windows&nbsp;95 checks for the user's logon name against the list of user accounts maintained on the server.<B><I> </I></B>If this is a valid user logon name, Windows&nbsp;95 then checks whether this user has access privileges for this resource.<B><I> </I></B>If the user has access privileges, then the requested operation is allowed.</P>
<P>For an example of how pass-through validation works with peer resource sharing, see Chapter 14, "Security."</P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
