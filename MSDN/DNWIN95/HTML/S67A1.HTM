<h3>Network Providers</H3><P>Windows&nbsp;95 uses an open, modular network provider interface to allow multiple network support simultaneously. Key benefits of the network provider interface architecture are the following:</P>
<UL><LI>An open interface allowing any network vendor to supply tightly integrated support for Windows&nbsp;95.</LI><LI>Identical access to and management of network resources and components through the Windows&nbsp;95 user interface, including Network Neighborhood and the Network option in Control Panel.</LI></UL><P>The network provider API calls are used by applications to request network services. Windows&nbsp;95 passes a network provider call to the appropriate network provider, which then supplies the requested network service.</P>
<P></P>
<P>The network provider is a network-specific driver that implements the service provider interface call from the multiple provider router. The functions provided include authenticating users when they access a network server, managing passwords, adding or removing server connections, and browsing network resources. </P>
<P>Windows&nbsp;95 includes the following network providers:</P>
<UL><LI>MSNP32.DLL for Microsoft networks </LI><LI>NWNP32.DLL for NetWare networks </LI><LI>WINNET16.DLL to support a single 16-bit network provider that uses WinNet16 APIs </LI></UL><P>Windows&nbsp;95 also supports any number of other 32-bit network providers. Such network providers must be supplied by other network vendors. </P>
<P>The Windows&nbsp;95 system logon is an example of a network service provided by the network provider interface. Each network provider can provide a unique logon dialog box to suit the needs of its network server security model. After the logon is validated by the requested server, this is passed back to Windows&nbsp;95, which can then use this password to unlock any network resource linked to the logon validation. In this way, Windows&nbsp;95 can accommodate the various ways that network servers provide their services, yet still offer a consistent user interface.</P>
<P>The following summarizes the internal processes when, for example, a user double-clicks the Entire Network icon in Network Neighborhood:</P>
<OL><LI>The Windows&nbsp;95 user interface generates a Win32-based network API call to enumerate servers and resources on the network.</LI><LI>The multiple provider router receives the API call and submits a service provider interface call to all the available network providers.</LI><LI>Each network provider browses its individual networks and returns the list to Windows&nbsp;95, which displays all the networks and their hierarchies in the Entire Network window.</LI></OL><P>Because of the network provider support in Windows&nbsp;95, users can specify server name strings in a drive connection dialog box using the syntax to which they are accustomed. A network provider knows how to correctly interpret the syntax of its own server name strings. The server name string is the syntax used by a particular network operating system to specify a shared disk resource. Microsoft network-compatible networks use the UNC format (<I>\\server_name\share_name</I>).</P>
<P>However, because the network provider knows how to interpret server name strings, users who are accustomed to using the NetWare server syntax (<I>server_name/volume_name:directory_name</I>) can type such server names wherever required in Windows&nbsp;95 to access NetWare server resources. The Windows&nbsp;95 user interface and the <B>net</B> command also support UNC names for connecting to NetWare resources.</P>
<H4><A NAME="sec0"></A>Network Provider for NetWare Networks</H4><P>The network provider that supports NetWare networks (NWNP32.DLL and its support library, NWNET32.DLL) provides access to NCP-based NetWare network resources using Windows Explorer, Network Neighborhood, and Control Panel, and other Windows-based applications.</P>
<P></P>

<P>The network provider supports these functions on NetWare networks:</P>
<UL><LI>Browsing NetWare networks. Bindery-based NetWare networks (versions 2.15 and above, 3.x, and 4.x with bindery emulation) use a Server-Volume-Directory hierarchy.</LI><LI>Logging onto and off of a NetWare network, providing dialog boxes for network logon, and performing attachments to bindery-based servers.</LI><LI>Adding and removing connections, allowing remote drive and printer connections using the NetWare format (<I>server/volume</I>:) and the UNC connections to NCP-based network resources (mapped drive or printer port, and \\s<I>erver\share</I>).</LI></UL><H4><A NAME="sec1"></A>Network Provider for Microsoft Networks </H4><P>The network provider that supports Microsoft networks (MSNP32.DLL) provides access to SMB-based Microsoft network resources using the Windows&nbsp;95 user interface, such as Windows Explorer, Network Neighborhood, and Control Panel, and other Windows-based applications. </P>
<P></P>
<P>MSNP32.DLL provides the Microsoft network-specific dialog boxes (such as the Windows NT domain logon dialog box) and code to resolve a service provider interface call from the multiple provider router to a call to Client for Microsoft Networks.</P>

<P>Notice that there are two arrows, one going through IFS Manager and one going directly to Client for Microsoft Networks.</P>
<UL><LI>When a network request is for a generic function such as adding a connection, the call is submitted to the IFS Interface.</LI><LI>When a network request is specific to a redirector, such as logging on or browsing a server, the call is sent to Client for Microsoft Networks.</LI></UL><P>The network provider supports these functions in Windows networks:</P>
<UL><LI>Browsing Microsoft networks.</LI></UL><P></P>
<UL><LI>Logging onto and off of a Windows&nbsp;NT or LAN Manager domain. The Microsoft network provider provides authentication services for validation by a domain controller, plus the ability to change the domain password using the Passwords option in the Windows&nbsp;95 Control Panel.</LI><LI>Adding or removing connections. The Microsoft network provider allows mapped drive and printer connections plus UNC connections to SMB-based network resources.</LI></UL></FONT></BODY></HTML>
