<h3>Technical Notes on Browsing on Microsoft Networks</H3><P>This section presents some brief notes related to browsing on Microsoft networks.</P>

<UL><LI>The Windows&nbsp;95 browser has been updated to support browsing across TCP/IP subnetworks. To take advantage of this, the network must use a WINS server or you must use #DOM entries in LMHOSTS files. For information about creating LMHOSTS files, see Appendix G, "HOSTS and LMHOSTS Files for Windows 95."</LI><LI>Microsoft LAN Manager-compatible networks such as IBM&reg; LAN Server and Microsoft LAN Manager for UNIX&reg; support browsing of servers and shared directories using the Windows&nbsp;95 user interface or <B>net view</B>. </LI><LI>DEC&trade; PATHWORKS&trade; is an example of a Microsoft LAN Manager-compatible network that does not support browsing. AT&amp;T&reg; StarLAN is an example of a Microsoft Network-compatible network that is not based on Microsoft LAN Manager and that does not support remote browsing of servers and shared directories. These servers do not appear in Network Neighborhood; with Windows&nbsp;95, however, users can still access the servers and shared directories through a network connection dialog box.</LI></UL>
<UL><LI>When a known slow network connection is used (for example, the remote access driver), Windows&nbsp;95 is automatically configured not to designate that computer to be a browse server for the network connection. The <B>SlowLanas</B> parameter in the Registry identifies the network LANA numbers for which the local computer will not serve as a master browse server. However, the user can still request a list of available workgroups and computers on the network across the slow network connection.</LI></UL></FONT></BODY></HTML>
