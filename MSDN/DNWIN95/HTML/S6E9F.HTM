<h2>Deciding on the Preferred Client Configuration: An Overview</H2><P>With the Planning and Installation teams assembled and educated about Windows&nbsp;95 capabilities, the next task for these teams is to determine the preferred configuration for client computers on the network. (For the purposes of this discussion, "client computer" refers to any computer running Windows&nbsp;95, including computers that act as peer servers by running File and Printer Sharing services.) The teams will use this configuration for evaluation and testing, prior to full implementation of Windows&nbsp;95 in your organization.</P>
<P>The tables in this section summarize options to consider in planning your preferred configuration. Using the information in these tables, evaluate the available features and the related alternatives before making a decision. Microsoft recommends that you begin your evaluation with the "ideal" configuration, that is, a configuration that uses all of the most powerful features of Windows&nbsp;95. Then gradually modify this configuration, adding or removing features, until you achieve a configuration that more closely fits your company's needs. When you have identified the preferred configuration, document the configuration layout and the selected features to make sure you install and test the correct configuration. </P>
<P>To learn more about product features as they relate to your system configuration, see Chapter 2, "Deployment Strategy and Details," or the related chapters of the Resource Kit. </P>
<P>The following table presents an overview of configuration layout decisions and feature options for the ideal network client. An additional table lists features which Microsoft recommends for implementation by all organizations; these features define how Windows&nbsp;95 will be installed and administered in your organization. The final table shows optional features that may be useful in some organizations.</P>

<P>Options:</P>
<P> <FONT FACE="symbol"></FONT>  Run Windows&nbsp;95 on the client computer for best performance and reduced network traffic.</P>
<P> <FONT FACE="symbol"></FONT>  Run Windows&nbsp;95 from the server to save hard disk space on client computers and make it easier to upgrade components or drivers later, especially for multiple computers.</P>
<P> <FONT FACE="symbol"></FONT>  Run completely from the server for the highest degree of security or for diskless workstations.</P>

<P><I>To provide the best network performance and functionality</I></P></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP"><P>Depends on the compatibility of your required applications. Options vary based on your network. For example, for Novell&reg; NetWare&reg; networks:</P>
<P> <FONT FACE="symbol"></FONT>  Protected-mode Client for NetWare Networks is the preferred client, because of the performance and increased functionality, and because it's easy to install and configure.</P>
<P> <FONT FACE="symbol"></FONT>  Real-mode Novell NETX or VLM clients may offer slightly better compatibility with some network utilities.</P>
<P> <FONT FACE="symbol"></FONT>  A real-mode network client for another network can also be used with Client for NetWare Network.</P>
<P>For information, see Part 3, "Networking."</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP"><P>Use 32-bit, protected-mode protocols </P>
<P><I>To provide the best network performance and functionality</I></P></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP"><P>Depends on compatibility with your choice of client. Options depend on your choice of protocol. For example, for IPX/SPX:</P>
<P> <FONT FACE="symbol"></FONT>  Microsoft IPX/SPX-compatible protocol is preferred (with or without IPX over NetBIOS).</P>
<P> <FONT FACE="symbol"></FONT>  Keep real-mode IPXODI for use with a real-mode Novell-supplied client.</P>
<P> <FONT FACE="symbol"></FONT>  Both the real-mode and Microsoft protected-mode implementations can be used if some of your applications (such as TSRs) require the real-mode protocol.</P>
<P>For information, see Chapter 12, "Network Technical Discussion."</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP"><P>Use the latest network adapter drivers</P>
<P><I>To provide improved performance and the ability to both load and unload the network and notify the rest of the system, use NDIS 3.1 drivers, which support Plug and Play</I></P>
<P></P></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP"><P>Depends on the availability and compatibility of the new driver. The 32-bit, protected mode drivers offer vastly improved performance and reliability over older versions. For PCMCIA cards, the 32-bit drivers are extremely easy to manage. </P>
<P>Options:</P>
<P> <FONT FACE="symbol"></FONT>  Always use the newest drivers available; implemented by default.</P>
<P> <FONT FACE="symbol"></FONT>  Manually choose to keep using an older driver, including ODI drivers, if new drivers are not available.</P>
<P>For information, see Chapter 12, "Network Technical Discussion."</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP"><P>Use the new Windows&nbsp;95 user interface</P>
<P><I>To provide ease of use and maximum functionality in accessing Windows&nbsp;95 features</I></P></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP"><P>Depends on timing or preference rather than functionality because the new user interface is significantly more functional and efficient. But, if a rapid migration is required, and training is not immediately available, the Windows 3.1 user interface can be used temporarily.</P>
<P>Options:</P>
<P> <FONT FACE="symbol"></FONT>  Use the new user interface; this is preferred and installed by default.</P>
<P> <FONT FACE="symbol"></FONT>  Install the Windows 3.x File Manager and Program Manager.</P>
