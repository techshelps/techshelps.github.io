<h3>Using NetBIOS over IPX</H3><P>NetBIOS is an interface used by network applications to communicate with other NetBIOS-compliant applications. The NetBIOS interface is responsible for the following:</P>
<UL><LI>Establishing logical names on the network</LI><LI>Establishing connections (called sessions) between two computers by use of their logical names on the network</LI><LI>Transmitting data between networked computers</LI></UL><P>Windows&nbsp;95 provides a 32-bit, protected-mode driver to support NetBIOS services over IPX (VNETBIOS.386). This implementation is compatible with the Novell NetBIOS support driver. Performance enhancements include acknowledgment of previous frames in response frames (called PiggyBackAck), plus a "sliding window" acknowledgment mechanism. </P>
<P>These NetBIOS enhancements are used only when the computer is communicating with other computers using IPX over NetBIOS, such as other computers running Windows&nbsp;95, Windows&nbsp;NT, or NetWare when running Lotus Notes or other NetBIOS applications. NetBIOS over IPX is not necessary for computers running Windows&nbsp;95 to be able to communicate with each other. The redirector and server networking components in Windows&nbsp;95 communicate with the IPX protocol directly without NetBIOS.</P>
<P>Novell provides a TSR NetBIOS driver named NETBIOS.EXE, which is a Level 1 NetBIOS provider that consumes about 40K of conventional memory. This driver acknowledges each frame received, thus increasing the amount of traffic generated when NetBIOS is used. With the Microsoft implementation of NetBIOS over IPX, you can remove the real-mode NETBIOS.EXE TSR.</P>
<P><B>Note</B>   A computer running Windows&nbsp;95 that uses IPX without NetBIOS can connect to a Windows&nbsp;NT 3.5 server that uses IPX without NetBIOS. However, the Windows&nbsp;NT 3.5 workstation service (not Windows NT Workstation) can only connect to a computer running File and Printer Sharing for Microsoft Networks when the computer running Windows&nbsp;95 is using NetBIOS over IPX.</P>
