<h3>Changing Mouse Drivers</H3><P>The Mouse option in Control Panel provides customization options, including setting the behavior of the mouse buttons and the mouse pointer. You can use either the Mouse option or Device Manager to change drivers for a pointing device. For information, see online Help. </P>
<P>For pointing device drivers that do not appear in the Select Device dialog box (that is, those that are not provided with Windows&nbsp;95), the Windows Driver Library (WDL) provides support for additional drivers from other vendors. For information about the WDL, see Appendix J, "Windows 95 Resource Directory."</P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
