<h3>Config Subtree in Hkey_Local_Machine</H3><P></P>
<P>The Hkey_Local_Machine\Config subtree contains information about alternate hardware configurations for the computer. For example, it can contain information about multiple configurations to be used when the computer is connected to a network, when it is undocked from a docking station, and so on. Each alternate configuration is assigned a unique identifier, and this configuration ID has a subkey under the Config key. Each configuration appears in the list of hardware profiles in the System option in Control Panel.</P>
<P>When Windows&nbsp;95 checks the hardware configuration at system startup, one of three things occurs:</P>
<UL><LI>In most situations, the configuration ID is mapped to a unique configuration and Windows&nbsp;95 selects the appropriate one automatically, and the settings for the related Config subkey are used for system configuration.</LI><LI>If the user is starting the computer for the first time with new hardware components, Windows&nbsp;95 creates a new configuration for the new configuration ID, and a new Config subkey is added to the Registry.</LI><LI>If the configuration ID is mapped to more than one configuration (for example, because Windows&nbsp;95 cannot distinguish between two configurations), the user is prompted to choose which configuration to use.</LI></UL></FONT></BODY></HTML>
