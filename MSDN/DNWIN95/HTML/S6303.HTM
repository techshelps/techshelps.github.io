<h3>Running Windows 95 with Windows NT</H3><P>Microsoft Windows&nbsp;NT Server networks provide both client-server and peer networking with user-level security using a domain structure. You can run Windows&nbsp;95 on a Windows&nbsp;NT network, and you can install Windows&nbsp;95 for dual-booting on computers running Windows&nbsp;NT 3.1 or Windows&nbsp;NT 3.5. </P>
<P>The following notes summarize important issues for this configuration: </P>
<UL><LI>Windows&nbsp;95 and Windows&nbsp;NT versions 3.1 or 3.5 can be installed on the same computer, but not in the same directory.</LI><LI>You cannot run Windows&nbsp;95 Setup from within Windows&nbsp;NT. You must run Setup from MS-DOS, Windows&nbsp;3.1, or Windows for Workgroups.</LI><LI>If your computer has any Windows&nbsp;NT file system (NTFS) partitions, they will not be available locally while the computer is running Windows&nbsp;95. </LI></UL><P>For a description of the support for running login scripts from Windows NT Server, see Chapter 11, "Logon, Browsing, and Resource Sharing." For information about installing Windows&nbsp;95 as a dual-boot operating system with Windows&nbsp;NT, see Chapter 6, "Setup Technical Discussion."</P>
<H4><A NAME="sec0"></A>Running Windows 95 in a Mixed Environment with Windows NT</H4><P>In Windows 95, computers are grouped logically in workgroups, where each computer in the workgroup maintains its own security system for validating local user logon and access to resources. Computers in workgroups do not share security with other computers, and they do not rely on other computers to provide security. On Windows&nbsp;NT networks, computers can be grouped in domains, which allow multiple servers and workstations to be grouped for unified administration. With Windows&nbsp;NT domains, centralized user accounts are used to validate user logon and access to resources. </P>
<P>Windows&nbsp;95 and Windows&nbsp;NT use the same workgroup model for browsing network resources, so computers running File and Printer Sharing for Microsoft Networks can appear in the same workgroup as computers running Windows&nbsp;NT. Computers running Windows&nbsp;NT will be favored in Browse Master elections because of the higher version number of the browser software.</P>
<P>Users running Client for Microsoft Networks can access the shared resources on a computer running Windows NT if both computers are using a common protocol. For resources protected with user-level security, the user running Windows&nbsp;95 must have been granted access to those resources. Conversely, a user running Windows&nbsp;NT can connect to the shared resources on a computer running Windows&nbsp;95 if the same conditions are met.</P>
<H4><A NAME="sec1"></A>Notes on Windows NT Server Benefits</H4><P>The Microsoft Windows&nbsp;NT Server operating system is the high-end member of the family of Microsoft Windows operating systems, providing a powerful, reliable, and scalable operating system to support the demands of client-server computing. </P>
<P>Windows&nbsp;NT Server provides the ideal platform for the server backbone in a mixed-network environment. It is especially versatile and powerful for enterprise networks made up of LANs that use a variety of network types and require dial-in support for network access. Also, on a peer-to-peer network where the computers are running Client for Microsoft Networks, you can add Windows&nbsp;NT to the network without changing the networking software on the existing computers.</P>
<P>Windows&nbsp;NT Server is designed to support complex business applications and administrative requirements. The following list summarizes important features.</P>
<P><B>Networking and workgroup support.</B></P>
<P>Windows&nbsp;NT Server provides built-in file and printer sharing capabilities for workgroup computing, and an open network system interface that includes built-in support for IPX/SPX, TCP/IP, NetBEUI, and other protocols. Windows&nbsp;NT Server provides administrative tools for controlling network services, auditing system events, changing hardware configuration and system performance, managing and backing up disks, and more. Windows&nbsp;NT also provides robust support for server-based and client-server applications.</P>
<P><B>Interoperability.</B></P>
<P>Windows&nbsp;NT Server is compatible with networks such as Windows&nbsp;95, Banyan&reg; VINES&reg;, Novell&reg; NetWare&reg;, UNIX&reg;, LAN Manager 2.x, and Microsoft Windows for Workgroups. Windows&nbsp;NT Server can add value to your current network environment without disruption. Even though networks and interoperability are complicated, a Windows&nbsp;NT network is easy to use and reliable, with automatic configuration provided wherever possible, and remote administration available for most administration tasks.</P>
<P><B>A single network logon.</B></P>
<P>Users can access network resources, including client-server applications, using one user account and one password per user.</P>
<P><B>Centralized management of user accounts.</B></P>
<P>The administrator can work from a single computer across divisions, departments, and workgroups.</P>
<P><B>Advanced data-protection features.</B></P>
<P>These include disk mirroring, disk striping with parity (RAID 5), and uninterruptible power supply support.</P>
<P><B>Remote Access Service (RAS).</B></P>
<P>Users can access network resources even when they are off-site, traveling, or working at home. Users can dial in over asynchronous telephone lines or Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) lines to access the network from computers running Windows&nbsp;95, MS-DOS, Windows for Workgroups, or Windows&nbsp;NT operating systems. Windows&nbsp;NT RAS also supports X.25 networks.</P>

<P><B>Access to Apple</B><B>&reg;</B><B> Macintosh</B><B>&reg;</B><B> resources.</B></P>
<P>When Services for Apple Macintosh is installed on a Windows&nbsp;NT Server, Macintoshes and computers running Windows&nbsp;95 can work together to share files, printers, and client-server applications. Macintosh users can access resources on a computer running Windows&nbsp;NT Server, similar to any other AppleShare&reg; server.</P>
<H4><A NAME="sec2"></A>Client Access Licenses for Windows NT Server</H4>
<P>Windows NT Server and Windows NT Workstation are licensed separately from Microsoft, allowing you to purchase only the components you need to build a network solution for your organization. For Windows NT Server, you must have a <I>Server License for Microsoft Windows NT Server</I> for each server on the network. In addition to a Server License, a <I>Client Access License for Windows NT Server</I> is required for computers that will access or otherwise use the following basic network services:</P>
<UL><LI>File services (sharing and managing files and disk storage)</LI><LI>Printing services (sharing and managing printers)</LI><LI>Remote access services (accessing the server from a remote location through a communications link)</LI></UL><P>Microsoft offers two licensing options for Windows NT Server:</P>
<UL><LI>"Per Seat" licensing. In this case, the Client Access License applies to a specific workstation ("seat"). Using this alternative, an unlimited number of computers or workstations can access Windows NT Server, provided each one is licensed with a Client Access License. After a workstation has been licensed, it has permission to access all Windows NT Server products installed throughout your organization.
<P>A Client Access License is required whether you use client software supplied by Microsoft or software from another vendor. In particular, for each computer running Windows&nbsp;95, Windows for Workgroups, Windows&nbsp;NT Workstation, or any client software Windows NT Server supports, a separate Client Access License is required.</P></LI><LI>"Per Server" licensing. In this case, each Client Access License is assigned to a particular server and allows one connection to that server for basic network services. Under this option, you designate during setup the number of licenses that apply to this server.</LI></UL><P>You can convert a Per Server license to a Per Seat license at no cost and without notifying Microsoft. You cannot, however, switch from a Per Seat option to a Per Server option. Also, all the servers in your environment are not required to be licensed using the same option — some servers can be licensed on a Per Server basis and others on a Per Seat basis.</P>
<P>You do not need a separate Client Access License if you access or run server applications only from Microsoft or other vendors on Windows NT Server. Examples of such server applications include Microsoft SQL Server, Microsoft SNA Server, Microsoft Systems Management Server, Lotus&reg; Notes&reg;, Btrieve&reg; for Windows NT and ORACLE&reg; Server. A Client Access License is required, however, when using utilities such as Windows NT File and Print Services for NetWare that use the basic networking services of Windows&nbsp;NT Server.</P>
<P><B>Note</B>   It is a violation of the terms of the Server License to access Windows NT Server without an appropriate number of Client Access Licenses. For more information, see your Server License.</P>
<P>Client Access Licenses are available in single-client and 20-client configurations and in volume quantities through the Microsoft Select licensing program. For more information, contact your Microsoft reseller. If you have questions, in the United States, contact the Microsoft Sales Information Center at (800) 426-9400. In Canada, contact the Microsoft Canada Customer Support Centre at (800) 563-9048. For other locations, contact your local Microsoft subsidiary.</P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
