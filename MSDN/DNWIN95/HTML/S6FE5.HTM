<h3>Using TCP/IP for Host Connectivity</H3>
<P>Many utilities and terminal emulation programs from other vendors allow direct communication with a mainframe or host computer using a TCP/IP protocol stack. The protected-mode version of Microsoft TCP/IP included with Windows&nbsp;95 relies on the Windows Sockets version 1.1 interface. Any terminal emulation program or utility that you use to connect to a mainframe or host computer over Microsoft TCP/IP must support Windows Sockets 1.1.</P>
<P>If you want to connect to a host computer using Telnet or TCP/IP and you are running an application that emulates an IBM 3270 or 5250, or a DEC VT xx computer terminal, you can use Microsoft TCP/IP. Before configuring Windows 95 for Microsoft TCP/IP, make sure that the emulation application supports Windows Sockets 1.1 as a TCP/IP interface option. </P>
<P>If your emulation software requires a TSR to communicate with another vendor's TCP/IP protocol stack, you must remove the TSR and reconfigure the emulation software for Windows Sockets in order to communicate using Microsoft TCP/IP in Windows&nbsp;95. To determine the proper configuration with Windows Sockets, see the documentation for the emulation software. If the application does not support Windows Sockets 1.1, contact the application vendor to obtain a version that does; otherwise, do not use Microsoft TCP/IP.</P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
