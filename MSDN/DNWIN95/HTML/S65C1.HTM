<h3>Setting Paths for MS-DOS - Based Applications</H3><P>You can set the path for a specific MS-DOS - based application that runs in MS-DOS Mode by carrying out the following procedure. </P>
<H4><A NAME="sec0"></A>To specify a path for MS-DOS - based applications that run in MS-DOS mode</H4><OL><LI>Right-click the application's executable file, and then click Properties.</LI><LI>Click the Application tab, and then click Advanced.</LI><LI>Make sure MS-DOS Mode is checked.</LI><LI>In the AUTOEXEC.BAT For MS-DOS Mode area, specify the correct path. </LI></OL><P><B>Note</B>   For MS-DOS - based applications that do not run in MS-DOS Mode, you can set only a working directory.</P>
<P>You can set a global path for all MS-DOS-based applications by adding a path statement to AUTOEXEC.BAT. </P>
<P>You can write a batch file that sets a path for an MS-DOS - based application; for example:</P>
<P><BR></P>
<pre><code>path=%path%;c:\utils;c:\norton</code></pre>
<P>After you write the batch file, carry out the following procedure to ensure that Windows runs it before starting your MS-DOS - based application.</P>
