<h3>Setting LAN Adapter Numbers</H3><P>NetBIOS defines the interface between the network client and the protocol layers using a set of function calls that allow an application to use the protocol services. Because many network applications use NetBIOS to send commands to the protocol driver, the NetBIOS interface is supported by all protocols provided with Windows&nbsp;95.</P>
<P>Each combination of a NetBIOS network protocol and a network adapter forms a logical network over which computers can communicate with each other. For example, a computer can have a token ring adapter and an Ethernet adapter, and might use NetBEUI on the token ring network and both NetBEUI and TCP/IP on the Ethernet network. In this case, the computer is connected to three logical networks, each of which is assigned a NetBIOS LAN adapter (LANA) number that Windows&nbsp;95 uses for communication.</P>
<P>When Windows&nbsp;95 uses multiple protocols, it transmits data first using one protocol, then again using the next protocol, and so on. When multiple protocols are installed on a computer, the first protocol to be used is called the primary protocol.</P>
<P>On a computer running Windows&nbsp;95, each binding of a protocol to a network adapter has a LAN adapter number assigned to it. (For example, one protocol bound to two network adapters requires two LAN adapter numbers; two protocols each bound to two adapters requires four LAN adapter numbers.)  </P>
<P>In Windows&nbsp;95, LANA numbers are assigned dynamically in sequence of binding order for the protocols, beginning with 7 and then 0, 1, and so on. This accommodates dynamic Plug and Play events such as removing a network adapter while the computer is running. If you are running Windows&nbsp;95 in such a dynamic environment, Windows&nbsp;95 cannot guarantee that a given protocol will receive the same LANA number each time the system is started. Although if the computer's network hardware never changes, the LANA numbers may not change at each startup. However, the default protocol is always LANA 0.</P>
<P>You need to change a LAN adapter number only if you have a NetBIOS application that needs to know the LANA number. For example, Lotus Notes&reg; requires that you enter the LANA number that Lotus Notes will use. To configure Windows&nbsp;95 to use Lotus Notes, set the default protocol to be the NetBIOS-based protocol on which you want to run Lotus Notes. (Setting the default protocol makes it LANA 0.) This protocol can be NetBEUI, IPX/SPX-compatible with NetBIOS support, or TCP/IP. </P>
<H4><A NAME="sec0"></A>To select a default protocol for LANA settings</H4><OL><LI>In the Network option in Control Panel, click the Configuration tab.</LI><LI>Double-click the protocol you want to be the default.</LI><LI>In the protocol's properties, click the Advanced tab.</LI><LI>Click the option named Set This Protocol To Be The Default Protocol so that the check box is checked. Then click OK, and shut down and restart the computer for the changes to take effect.</LI></OL></FONT></BODY></HTML>
