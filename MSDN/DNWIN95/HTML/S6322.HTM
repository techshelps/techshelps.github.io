<h3>Setting Up Microsoft Client for NetWare Networks</H3><P>When using Client for NetWare Networks, you do not need to load any Novell-supplied drivers or components. This client runs with the Microsoft IPX/SPX-compatible protocol and NDIS-compliant, protected-mode drivers, which Windows&nbsp;95 Setup installs automatically when you select this client. </P>
<P>When Windows&nbsp;95 is installed with Client for NetWare Networks, Windows&nbsp;95 Setup automatically moves any relevant NET.CFG settings to the Windows&nbsp;95 Registry. You can configure the related settings using the Network option in Control Panel. You can also configure the MS-DOS and the IPX/SPX-compatible protocol, as described in Chapter 12, "Network Technical Discussion." </P>
<P>If you did not install Client for NetWare Networks during Windows&nbsp;95 Setup, you can switch to this client any time after Windows&nbsp;95 is installed, as described in the following procedure. You can also install Client for NetWare Networks and configure related options when installing Windows&nbsp;95 using custom setup scripts, as described in Chapter 5, "Custom, Automated, and Push Installations." </P>
<P><B>Tip</B>   To display the Network option without opening Control Panel, right-click the Network Neighborhood icon on the desktop. Then click Properties on the context menu.</P>
<H4><A NAME="sec0"></A>To add Client for NetWare Networks after Windows 95 is installed</H4><OL><LI>In the Network option in Control Panel, examine the list of installed components.
<P>If the computer currently has NETX or VLM installed, then select that NetWare Workstation Shell client in the list of installed components, and click Remove. Also, select and remove the IPXODI protocol if it appears in the list.</P></LI><LI>Click Add, and then double-click Client in the Select Network Component dialog box.</LI><LI>In the Select Network Client dialog box, click Microsoft in the Manufacturers list, and then click Client for NetWare Networks in the Network Clients list. Then click OK.</LI></OL><P>You must shut down and restart the computer for the changes to take effect.</P>
<P>Setup automatically installs and configures all related components. Windows&nbsp;95 Setup also adds the value <B>lastdrive=32</B> to the parameters for the network client in the Registry. This value makes room for entries in a table to store drive information. For Microsoft networking, the last drive would be set to Z (or 26), but NetWare allows six additional entries in its drive table. The extra drives are used only by NetWare-aware applications; these drives are not available to users. </P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
