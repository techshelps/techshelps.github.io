<h2>Microsoft Download Service</H2><P>Microsoft Download Service (MSDL) operates in the same manner as any MS-DOS – based computer bulletin board system (BBS). MSDL contains Application Notes, driver files, and other types of support files you might want to download.</P>
<P>To use MSDL, you must have a modem and a terminal package such as Microsoft Works, Windows Terminal, Procomm, or Crosstalk&trade;. If you experience difficulty while you are working with the MSDL, try calling a local BBS so you can avoid paying long-distance charges while trying to determine the cause of the problem. Technical support is not available on the MSDL.</P>
<P>MSDL supports 1200, 2400, 9600, and 14,400 baud rates (V.32 and V.42), with 8 data bits, 1 stop bit, and no parity. After you have chosen these settings, you can begin the session as follows.</P>
