<h3>Troubleshooting Windows 95 Using Novell NetWare Clients</H3><P>This section describes some common problems that might occur when running a Novell-supplied client with Windows&nbsp;95. </P>
<P>As a general troubleshooting step, make sure that the NETWARE.DRV file version 3.03.94.280 or later for VLM is present, plus version 2.02 or later for NETX. If necessary, restore this file from the Novell-supplied installation source.</P>
<UL><LI>Check the version numbers of all Novell-supplied NetWare workstation shell components, including IPX, NETX, VLM, LSL, IPXODI, and the ODI driver files. Make sure the latest versions are being used.
<P>To get the version number for the Novell-supplied software you are using, run <I>driver_name</I> <B>i</B> or <I>driver_name</I> <B>? </B>at the command prompt. For example, type <B>netx i</B> to get the version number for the Novell-supplied NET*.COM or NET*.EXE file.</P>

<P>If you are not using the latest software, upgrade as described in "Obtaining Current Novell-Supplied Files" earlier in this chapter.</P></LI><LI>Check for multiple instances of the NetWare files, specifically the ODI driver and NET.CFG. If there are multiple instances, remove all but the most recent version.</LI><LI>Verify that IPXODI is binding to the network adapter by running the NetWare NVER utility, using the same settings as NET.CFG and the same [<B>link driver</B> <I>ODI_driver</I>] name. If IPXODI is not bound to the network adapter, change the entries in NET.CFG to correct this problem.</LI><LI>For a monolithic configuration, verify that the configuration does not use the <B>/o#</B> switch on IPX.COM or the <B>config option=</B> statement in SHELL.CFG. </LI><LI>If the user is running a shared copy of Windows&nbsp;95, verify that the home directory and shared Windows directory are the first two items in the path. </LI></UL><H4><A NAME="sec0"></A>Setup requires Novell Workstation Shell Installation Program.</H4><P>If, during installation, Setup fails to load Novell drivers and displays a message that it requires the Novell Workstation Shell Install Program for installing the VLM network client with Windows&nbsp;95, follow the instructions presented in "VLM Technical Notes" earlier in this chapter.</P>
<H4><A NAME="sec1"></A>You cannot attach to the NetWare file server after installing Windows&nbsp;95.</H4><P>Verify the frame type being used by the NetWare server. If the NetWare server is using a different frame type from the one configured for the computer running Windows&nbsp;95, the user cannot see the server. The Novell-supplied IPXODI protocol binds only to the first logical board, which is the first frame type in the <B>link driver</B> <I>ODI_driver</I> section in NET.CFG. </P>
<P>To correct this problem, manually edit NET.CFG so that the correct frame type is first in the <B>link driver</B> <I>ODI_driver</I> section. </P>
<H4><A NAME="sec2"></A>You cannot see other computers running Windows&nbsp;95 or NetWare server.</H4><UL><LI>Determine which frame type is used at your site, and then verify that the correct frame type you want to use on the network are listed in NET.CFG. The frame type that IPXODI will use must be first or must be set explicitly.</LI><LI>Verify that the correct NET.CFG is being processed by LSL.COM. To do this, check the local drive for other NET.CFG files. There should be only one, and it should be in the same directory as the NetWare driver files. If you are loading these files from AUTOEXEC.BAT or another batch file, modify the batch file to change to this directory, run the necessary ODI drivers, and change back to the directory you want. This ensures that the current directory is the same as the location of the LSL.COM file when it is being loaded.</LI><LI>Verify that NET.CFG contains the correct settings for the network adapter. If necessary, restore this file from a correct backup version, or edit it to include correct settings.</LI><LI>Verify that you are running the latest version of the Novell-supplied ODI drivers and support files. Check with your network adapter manufacturer to determine whether a newer ODI driver is available. </LI><LI>Verify that both client computers are running the same protocols. If the client computers are on different sides of a router, make sure that an IPX/SPX-compatible protocol is being used on both computers. </LI></UL><H4><A NAME="sec3"></A>You cannot access the login drive after installing Windows&nbsp;95.</H4><P>A common misconception is that users must log on to their NetWare server using the drive letter F. However, this is not true. For a client computer using the NETX workstation shell, the NetWare login drive is the next drive letter available after the <B>LastDrive=</B> statement in the Registry. </P>
<P>You can alter the <B>LastDrive=</B> statement to change the login drive, but you must leave enough drives before the <B>LastDrive=</B> that Windows&nbsp;95 can use for its own connections. </P>
<H4><A NAME="sec4"></A>Computer doesn't run after installing VLM support under Windows&nbsp;95.</H4><P>If a message says that the system cannot find a device file needed to run Windows, make sure that the VLM client has been installed using the Network option in Control Panel. This step ensures that the correct VLM information is placed in SYSTEM.INI. (The Novell-supplied installation program for VLM sets the path in SYSTEM.INI to the Windows SYSTEM directory rather than to VMM32.)</P>
