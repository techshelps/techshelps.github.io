<h3>IO.SYS: The Real-Mode Operating System</H3><P>Windows&nbsp;95 uses a new system file, IO.SYS, which replaces the MS-DOS system files (IO.SYS and MSDOS.SYS). This real-mode operating system file contains the information needed to start the computer. Your computer no longer needs CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT to start the Windows&nbsp;95 operating system (although these files are preserved for backward compatibility with certain applications and drivers).</P>
<P><B>Note</B>   The Windows&nbsp;95 IO.SYS file is automatically renamed to WINBOOT.SYS if you start the computer using your previous operating system.</P>
<P>The drivers loaded by default in IO.SYS include the following, if these files are found on the hard disk:</P>
<UL><LI>HIMEM.SYS </LI><LI>IFSHLP.SYS </LI><LI>SETVER.EXE</LI><LI>DBLSPACE.BIN or DRVSPACE.BIN </LI></UL><P>Most of the common functionality provided by the various CONFIG.SYS file entries are now provided by default in IO.SYS. The following table lists the common entries in CONFIG.SYS that are now incorporated into IO.SYS for Windows&nbsp;95. </P>
