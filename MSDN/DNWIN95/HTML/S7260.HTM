<h3>Connecting to a Windows NT Remote Access Server</H3><P>Connecting to a Windows&nbsp;NT remote access server is the same as connecting to a Windows&nbsp;95 Dial-Up Networking server. All you need is the phone number of the Windows&nbsp;NT server when creating a connection. Dial-Up Networking negotiates the proper protocols and server connection type. You don't need to specify a default server type.</P>
<P>Windows NT 3.5 Server supports PPP, RAS, and SLIP clients. PPP is the recommended protocol. Windows NT 3.5 supports IPX/SPX, NetBEUI, and TCP/IP network protocols and can function as a NETBIOS gateway, IPX router, and IP router simultaneously. Windows NT 3.5 is not a SLIP server.</P>
<P><b>Note</b></P>
<P>Windows&nbsp;NT 3.1 supports only the RAS protocol, which is a proprietary protocol that supports only NetBEUI. It is a fast connection type, but does not allow for multiple protocols over the connection. RAS in Windows&nbsp;NT 3.1 cannot support the IPX/SPX or TCP/IP protocols. </P>
<P>Microsoft recommends that you upgrade from Windows&nbsp;NT Remote Access Server to Windows&nbsp;NT Server 3.5, which provides many additional benefits, including PPP support.</P>
<P>A Windows&nbsp;NT 3.1 or 3.5 remote access server provides several features that a Dial-Up Networking server does not. For an explanation of these differences, see "Configuring a Windows 95 Dial-Up Server" earlier in this chapter.</P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
