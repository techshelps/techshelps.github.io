<h3>Making a Dial-Up Networking Connection </H3><P>After you have defined a remote connection by using the Make New Connection wizard, you can make a connection in two ways:</P>
<UL><LI>Double-click a connection icon in Dial-Up Networking. </LI><LI>Connect to a remote network resource when you are working in an application other than Dial-Up Networking. If you cannot find the resource on the current network, Windows&nbsp;95 responds by automatically activating Dial-Up Networking.</LI></UL><P>After you establish or end a connection, you do not need to restart the computer or restart Windows&nbsp;95. When you attempt to perform the following tasks, Windows&nbsp;95 starts Dial-Up Networking:</P>
<UL><LI>When you try to access a network resource and your computer is not connected to any network</LI><LI>When your application specifies a UNC name (which uses the form \\<I>servername</I>\<I>sharename</I>) that can't be accessed by using the local area network</LI><LI>When you double-click a link that points to a remote network object; for example:

<UL><LI>When an application attempts to connect to a file on a network server</LI><LI>When you reconnect to a remote OLE object</LI></UL></LI></UL><P>When you choose a remote connection, Windows&nbsp;95 retrieves the server information from the addresses stored in the Registry. If the information is not available, you are asked to select a server from the connection icons in Dial-Up Networking, or to type a new server name. </P>
<P>If Dial-Up Networking cannot find the network resource, it displays a net error message. If the connection is successful, Windows&nbsp;95 remembers the connection for future use. </P>
<P>You can disable the prompt that asks if you want to use Dial-Up Networking when you are attempting to connect to a network resource.</P>
<H4><A NAME="sec0"></A>To disable the Dial-Up Networking prompt</H4><OL><LI>In Dial-Up Networking, click the Connection menu, and then click Settings.</LI><LI>Click the option named Don't Prompt To Use Dial-Up Networking.</LI></OL></FONT></BODY></HTML>
