<h3>Deciding Between Local and Shared Installation</H3><P>Windows&nbsp;95 can run on the local hard disk of a computer or as a shared copy on the server for network workstations.</P>
<P>Windows&nbsp;95 files are distributed in the following three forms for installation on computers that already have other operating systems in place:</P>
<UL><LI>Windows&nbsp;3.0 (or higher) upgrade on CD-ROM</LI><LI>Windows&nbsp;3.0 (or higher) upgrade on 3.5-inch high-density disks</LI><LI>MS-DOS upgrade on 3.5-inch high-density disks</LI></UL><H4><A NAME="sec0"></A>To install Windows&nbsp;95 on a local computer</H4><UL><LI>Insert the first floppy disk or compact disc into the drive, and make that the active drive. Then double-click SETUP.EXE in File Manager, or type <B>setup</B> at the command prompt.
<P>For a step-by-step description of the installation process, see "Starting Windows 95 Setup" later in this chapter.</P></LI></UL><P>Depending on the license agreement at your site, you can also copy the Windows&nbsp;95 source files to a shared network directory. Users can connect to this directory and run Windows&nbsp;95 Setup.</P>
<P>You can also configure servers to support installing and running shared installations of Windows 95 in one of the following three ways:</P>
<UL><LI>On a computer with a local hard disk, with system files stored on and running from the server</LI><LI>On a computer with only a floppy disk drive, with system files stored on and running from the server</LI><LI>From a Novell NetWare&reg; server to support diskless workstations that remote boot from a startup disk image on the server</LI></UL><P>In these cases, most or all of the Windows&nbsp;95 program files reside on the server instead of the workstation. For more information, see Chapter 4, "Server-Based Setup for Windows 95."</P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
