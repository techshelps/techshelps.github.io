<h2>Removing Windows 95 from a Computer</H2><P>Windows&nbsp;95 can be removed from a computer by using the procedures described in the following section. If the computer is configured for dual booting, you will be left with the previous versions of MS-DOS and Windows 3.x intact. If you upgraded Windows 3.x, then you will need to reinstall Windows 3.x after Windows 95 is removed.</P>
<P>The recommended method for removing Windows&nbsp;95 is to start the computer and use the F8 key to get to a command line, as described in the following procedure. When this is done, real-mode Windows&nbsp;95 operating system files start the computer. If you encounter problems starting Windows&nbsp;95 in this way, start your computer from the previous operating system (which may require using a floppy disk).</P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
