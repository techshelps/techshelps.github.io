<h3>Remote Management and Troubleshooting</H3><P>Systems Management Server provides the Help Desk and Diagnostics features which offer the ability to directly control and monitor remote clients running MS-DOS, Windows 3.1, Windows for Workgroups, and Windows&nbsp;95.</P>
<H4><A NAME="sec0"></A>Help Desk</H4><P>The Help Desk utilities provide direct access to a client, allowing you to troubleshoot and support individual remote computers, with obvious cost savings to the organization. </P>
<P>Using the Windows NT Server and Windows NT Workstation management tools from a Systems Management Server administration console, an administrator or technician can take control of a remote computer running Windows or MS-DOS to perform management or troubleshooting tasks. From one central location, across either a LAN or WAN, the administrator or technician can:</P>
<UL><LI>Monitor the state of the remote computer, including details of dynamic system resource utilization</LI><LI>View the remote computer's screen and guide the user through a difficult task </LI><LI>Use Remote Chat for two-way text messaging between the administrator and the client computer</LI><LI>Perform a task directly, with or without the user being present</LI><LI>Remotely carry out commands</LI><LI>Check the memory map, the status of interrupts, and other operating system parameters</LI><LI>Transfer files and install software</LI><LI>Restart the remote computer</LI></UL><P>When the Help Desk option is run, Systems Management Server verifies that the client computer is running and attached to the network. Help Desk attempts connection using various protocols installed on the server until the server successfully connects to the client computer. The Help Desk feature works across X.25, ISDN, and standard asynchronous phone lines, and any normal routed network.</P>
<P>Users can control the degree of remote access they want by setting the following options:</P>
<UL><LI>Remote viewing</LI><LI>Remote take-over</LI><LI>Remote file transfer</LI><LI>Remote boot</LI><LI>Remote performance of commands</LI></UL><P>Notice that the use of these help desk utilities requires the knowledge and permission of the remote user. Remote file transfer and remote execution of commands must be enabled for the client to participate in software distribution through Systems Management Server.</P>
<H4><A NAME="sec1"></A>Diagnostics</H4><P>The Diagnostics utilities allow you to view the current hardware and software configuration of a workstation. The following table shows diagnostic utilities for Windows&nbsp;95 clients.</P>
