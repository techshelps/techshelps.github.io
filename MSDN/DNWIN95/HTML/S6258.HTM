<h3>Customizing Setup for Accessibility Requirements</H3><P>Users who require accessibility aids to work with Windows can experience problems with Windows&nbsp;95 Setup, because their accessibility aids are not available while Setup is running.</P>
<P>As the system administrator, you can assist users in such cases by creating setup scripts that define all options so that Setup can run without user intervention. In such cases, be sure to include the Windows&nbsp;95 Accessibility Options among the optional components to be installed with Windows&nbsp;95.</P>
<P>The following suggestions can help individuals who require accessibility aids but do not have a system administrator to create a setup script. In such cases, you have two options, depending on whether you want to create the script while running Windows 3.x or MS-DOS:</P>
<UL><LI>If you are running Windows 3.1 or Windows for Workgroups, use BATCH.EXE to create a setup script </LI><LI>If you are running MS-DOS, create or edit the AUTOMATE.INF setup script provided with the <I>Windows&nbsp;95 Resource Kit</I> utilities</LI></UL><P>When you install Windows&nbsp;95 over an earlier version of Windows, Setup automatically moves your Startup group and other Program Manager groups for use under Windows&nbsp;95. So any accessibility options in your previous Startup group will start automatically under Windows&nbsp;95 after Setup is completed.</P>
<P>Whichever method you choose for creating the script, you can use it to control Windows&nbsp;95 installation automatically, by using it with the <B>setup</B> command, as described in "Running Custom Setup Scripts" later in this chapter. For information about the accessibility options that can be installed automatically with Windows&nbsp;95, see Appendix I, "Accessibility."</P>
<H4><A NAME="sec0"></A>To use Batch Setup to create a hands-free setup script</H4><OL><LI>Run Batch Setup, as described in "Using BATCH.EXE to Create Setup Scripts" earlier in this chapter.</LI><LI>In the Windows&nbsp;95 Batch Setup window, type the Setup Identification information.</LI><LI>Click the Installation Options button.</LI><LI>In the Windows&nbsp;95 Installation Options dialog box, click the Type Of Installation list and select Custom.
<P>You can make any other changes you want. However, the recommended method is to accept all the default settings and let Windows&nbsp;95 Setup complete the actions automatically. </P></LI><LI>Click the Set button.</LI><LI>In the Batch Setup Administrative Options dialog box, make sure the option named Don't Stop During Setup is selected. Then click OK.</LI><LI>In the Windows&nbsp;95 Batch Setup window, click the Optional Components button.</LI><LI>In the Available Areas list in the Windows&nbsp;95 Optional Components dialog box, click Accessories. Then in the Available Components list, click Accessibility Options so that it is checked.
<P>You can use the same method to add any additional components to be installed with Windows&nbsp;95. Then click OK.</P></LI><LI>When you finish setting all the options you want, click the Done button. In the Save As dialog box, specify the path and filename for saving this script.
<P>For networking components, the recommended method is to allow Windows&nbsp;95 Setup to install and configure components automatically.</P></LI></OL><H4><A NAME="sec1"></A>To edit AUTOMATE.INF to create a hands-free setup script</H4><OL><LI>Use any text editor to edit a copy of the AUTOMATE.INF sample script provided in the SAMPLES directory with the <I>Windows&nbsp;95 Resource Kit</I> utilities. You can also create this script by typing the entries in the sample script following this procedure.</LI><LI>Change entries to specify your correct time zone, product identification number, and user name. To make these changes, delete the semicolon at the start of the line, and type the correct text between quotation marks.
<P>For a list of correct values for time zones, see Appendix D, "MSBATCH.INF Parameters."</P>

<P>Your product identification number is the CD Key number on the Windows&nbsp;95 compact disc case or the number provided ono your Certificate of Authenticity.</P></LI><LI>Under the [Optional Components] section, include this entry:</LI></OL><UL><LI>"Accessibility Options"=1</LI></UL><P>The following shows an example of the entries defined in AUTOMATE.INF:</P>
