<h2>Running Custom Setup Scripts</H2><P>The following procedure describes how to run Windows&nbsp;95 Setup from a setup script. </P>
<H3><A NAME="sec0"></A>To run Windows&nbsp;95 Setup using a setup script with minimal user action</H3><OL><LI>Start the computer running the existing network client software.</LI><LI>Connect to the server or drive that contains the Windows&nbsp;95 source files.
<P>The network administrator can include this step in the login script to avoid user action.</P></LI><LI>Change to the directory where the Windows&nbsp;95 Setup files are located. </LI><LI>At the command line, run Windows&nbsp;95 Setup by specifying the batch file that contains the setup script, using this syntax:</LI></OL><UL><LI>setup msbatch.inf
<P>If MSBATCH.INF exists in the Windows directory on the server containing the Windows&nbsp;95 source files, Setup uses it by default. Otherwise, for example, you would type <B>setup e:\mybatch.inf</B> to run Setup using a setup script named MYSCRIPT.INF on drive E. To use a script in the SCRIPTS directory on a server named NTSVR1, you would type <B>setup \\ntsvr1\scripts\mybatch.inf</B> (provided, of course, that your operating system software can interpret UNC path names).</P>

<P> – Or –</P>

<P>Include the entire statement for running Windows&nbsp;95 Setup in the login script, so that the user does not have to type anything at the command prompt.</P></LI></UL><P>When you run Windows&nbsp;95 Setup in this way, Setup takes all settings from the custom script. For information not defined in the setup script, Windows&nbsp;95 Setup migrates settings from an earlier version of Windows 3.x on the computer, uses built-in defaults, or prompts the user to provide information.</P>
<P>After copying files, Windows&nbsp;95 Setup restarts the computer and begins the Run-Once setup operations (printer setup, program group conversions, and so on). When these operations are finished, Windows&nbsp;95 is completely installed.</P>
<P>When the user quits Windows&nbsp;95 Setup at this point, Setup writes all changes to the Registry. The user can restart the computer and log on with the usual logon name and password.</P>
<P>The network administrator can automate this process by providing each user with a floppy disk that contains the necessary files for starting the computer, connecting to the network, and running Windows&nbsp;95 Setup with a custom setup script.</P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
