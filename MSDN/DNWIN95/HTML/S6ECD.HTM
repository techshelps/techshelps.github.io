<h3>Quick Start for Windows 95 Setup</H3><P>The following are the basic tasks you perform when installing Windows&nbsp;95 on a computer for the first time:</P>
<P></P>
<OL>
<LI>Check that the computer's hardware is supported and meets the minimum requirements for Windows&nbsp;95. Close all applications and disable unnecessary TSRs. Check and defragment the hard drive, and back up key files. These tasks are described in "Before Starting Windows 95 Setup" later in this chapter. </LI>
<LI>Start Windows&nbsp;95 Setup.<br>
How you start Setup depends on whether you are running Setup from floppy disks, a CD-ROM compact disc, or a shared network directory. For information, see "Starting Windows 95 Setup" later in this chapter.</LI>
<LI>Choose the directory where you want the Windows&nbsp;95 system files to be installed on the computer. If you want to preserve your existing Windows and MS-DOS operating system, you must install Windows&nbsp;95 in a new directory, as described in "Gathering Information" later in this chapter.</LI>
<LI>Choose the type of setup: Typical, Compact, Portable, or Custom. For most users, Microsoft recommends the Typical Setup, which installs standard options with default settings. For information, see "Deciding to Use Typical, Portable, Compact, or Custom Setup" later in this chapter.</LI>
<LI>Provide identification information about your user name, computer name, and other identifiers. For information, see "Providing User Information" later in this chapter and "Specifying Computer Identification" later in this chapter.</LI>
<LI>If you choose Custom Setup, you must specify the options you want to install and make other choices about the system components, including networking. For information, see "Selecting Software Components" later in this chapter, "Selecting Network Components in Custom Setup" later in this chapter, and "Changing Computer Settings in Custom Setup" later in this chapter.</LI>
<LI>Create a startup disk for emergency recovery, as prompted by Windows&nbsp;95 Setup. This is a highly recommended step. For information, see "Creating a Startup Disk" later in this chapter.</LI>
<LI>Restart the computer after Setup copies the required files. Then, depending on the type of installation, select the local time zone and complete other tasks for configuring certain devices and software. For information, see "Copying Files and Completing Setup" later in this chapter.</LI>
</OL>
<P>Windows&nbsp;95 Setup automatically guides you through each of these tasks and provides Help for any step if you need it before proceeding.</P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
