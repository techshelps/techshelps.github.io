<h3>Using Multilingual Fonts with Win32-Based Applications</H3><P>For users who create or edit multilingual content in their documents, a Win32-based application that uses the international services in Windows&nbsp;95 can automatically activate the correct fonts and corresponding keyboard layouts for editing specific text within a document. </P>
<P>Win32-based applications can indicate the language used in text in a document by tagging the text with a locale identifier. For example, such applications can automatically use spell checking, thesaurus, hyphenation engine, and grammar checking applications associated with the language of the text it is checking, if they are available. They can also format dates according to the language of the text. Applications that use locale identifiers can determine date, time, currency, and number formats, and sorting behavior, and they can use these identifiers to determine which keyboard layout and fonts to use for typing and displaying text in a particular language.</P>
<P>To take advantage of the multilingual font capabilities in Windows&nbsp;95:</P>
<UL><LI>Make sure your application uses the Win32 NLS API. For information, check the documentation that comes with the application or contact the software manufacturer.</LI><LI>Install multilingual support under Windows&nbsp;95, as described in this section.</LI><LI>Use the application's dialog boxes for selecting language-related font attributes and for specifying the language attributes of selected information. </LI></UL></FONT></BODY></HTML>
