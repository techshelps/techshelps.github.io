<h2>Connecting to a Novell NetWare Connect Server</H2><P>Windows&nbsp;95 Dial-Up Networking supports connecting to Novell NetWare resources in two ways:</P>
<UL><LI>Connecting directly to a Novell NetWare Connect server</LI><LI>Using a computer running Windows&nbsp;95 or Windows&nbsp;NT 3.5 as a gateway into a local area network, where NetWare servers are connected</LI></UL><P>NetWare Connect allows a Windows&nbsp;95 client to dial in to a NetWare server running NetWare Connect 1.0. </P>
<P><B>Note</B>   Windows&nbsp;95 can act only as a client for connecting to a NetWare Connect server. NetWare Connect clients themselves cannot dial up a Windows&nbsp;95 Dial-Up Server. </P>
<P>The NetWare Connect connection type allows a Windows&nbsp;95 client to connect directly to a NetWare Connect server and to connect to NetWare servers on the connected local area network.</P>
<P>To use Dial-Up Networking to connect to a NetWare Connect server, you must specify NetWare Connect as the server type in the properties for a Dial-Up Networking connection. You also need to use the Network option in Control Panel to make sure the following are enabled on a Windows&nbsp;95 dial-up client or server: </P>
<UL><LI>Microsoft Client for NetWare Networks</LI><LI>IPX/SPX-compatible protocol bound to the Microsoft Dial-Up adapter driver</LI></UL><P>If you use Dial-Up Networking to access NetWare Connect servers, you can access data remotely, but you cannot control a computer remotely as you can with the NetWare Connect client software supplied by Novell.</P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
