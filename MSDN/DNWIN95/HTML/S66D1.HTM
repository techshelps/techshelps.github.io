<h2>Sending Faxes</H2><P>You can use Microsoft Fax to send and receive faxes by using a fax modem attached to your computer or on a network. Faxes are mail messages that are sent over the phone lines. Microsoft Fax shares the Personal Address Book with Microsoft Exchange and other MAPI providers. </P>
<P>The only difference between a mail message and a fax, from a Microsoft Exchange user's perspective, is the format of the recipient's address. Each Microsoft Exchange service provider, such as the Microsoft Network or Microsoft Fax, has its own format for a recipient's address. </P>
<P>You can send faxes from within Windows&nbsp;95 in the following ways:</P>
<UL><LI>Use Microsoft Exchange to create an electronic mail message and fax its contents to a recipient as described in the following procedures. If the message recipient is also using Windows&nbsp;95, the message can include binary files and editable documents. Otherwise, the message will be rendered and sent as a fax. </LI><LI>Print a document to the fax printer driver. If you select Microsoft Fax as the target printer for the document, and then click the Print option in the File menu, the Compose New Fax wizard will run. 
<P><img src="RK27_03.gif"></P></LI><LI>Run the Compose New Fax wizard by double-clicking the Fax icon in the Accessories menu.</LI><LI>Use Windows Explorer to drag and drop a document onto a Microsoft Fax printer icon on the Windows&nbsp;95 desktop.</LI><LI>Right-click a document icon in My Computer to display the context menu. In the context menu, select the Send To option, and then select the Fax Recipient option to run the Compose New Fax wizard. The application that created the original document starts so that the document can be rendered (printed). After it is rendered, the application closes.</LI><LI>Use the Send option in the File menu of a MAPI mail-enabled application such as Microsoft Word or Microsoft Excel to activiate Microsoft Exchange. </LI></UL><P></P>
<P><B>Note</B>   You can create a shortcut to the Microsoft Fax printer by right-clicking the Microsoft Fax printer icon and then dragging it to the Windows&nbsp;95 desktop. </P>

The predefined cover pages are named Urgent!, Confidential!, For Your Information, and General Purpose (default). You can also customize predefined cover pages as described in the following procedure. </P>
<P>With the Microsoft Fax Cover Page Editor, you can also design a unique cover page for each recipient. The Cover Page Editor allows you to incorporate rich text, graphics, logos, and information from the Microsoft Exchange Personal Address Book into a cover page. </P>
<P><b>Note</b></P>
<P>All cover pages contain recipient information that you first entered in the Microsoft Exchange Personal Address Book. Microsoft Fax inserts this information each time you send a fax.</P>
