<h3>Using the Personal Address Book</H3><P>The Microsoft Exchange client creates a Personal Address Book for each user when the Inbox Setup wizard is run for the first time. The Personal Address Book contains the names and addresses of people to whom users commonly send electronic mail and fax messages. Users can add names and addresses to the Personal Address Book from other electronic address books, such as the Postoffice Address List that comes with the Microsoft Mail workgroup postoffice. Users can also modify the Personal Address Book (they cannot modify address books from other service providers, such as The Microsoft Network). </P>
