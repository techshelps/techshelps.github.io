<h2>Modems and Communications Tools: The Basics</H2><P>Windows&nbsp;95 simplifies using modems by allowing you to install and configure a modem once to work for all communications applications, just as you do for a printer. This provides the following benefits: </P>
<UL><LI>Centralized modem and COM port configuration through the Modems option in Control Panel for all communications applications created for Windows 95 </LI><LI>Support for hundreds of brand-name modems, including automatically detecting them</LI><LI>Modem connections and configuration using point-and-click instead of AT commands</LI></UL><P><B>Note</B>   For applications created for Windows 3.1 or MS-DOS, you still need to define the serial port, modem type, and other modem settings within each application.</P>
<P>Windows&nbsp;95 includes three tools for expanding communications capabilities: </P>
<UL><LI>HyperTerminal allows you to connect two computers through a modem and telephony application programming interface (TAPI) for transferring files, and it also automatically detects data bits, stop bits, and parity. </LI><LI>Phone Dialer allows you to use a computer to dial phone numbers for voice telephone calls. It includes a telephone dial pad, user-programmable speed dials, and a call log. </LI><LI>Microsoft File Transfer allows you to send and receive files while talking on the phone.</LI></UL><P>With Windows&nbsp;95, you can do the following:</P>
<UL><LI>Set up a modem in the Modems option in Control Panel, or in a communications application created for Windows&nbsp;95 (such as HyperTerminal) when you run it for the first time. Windows&nbsp;95 provides an Install New Modem wizard that automatically detects the modem type and sets its default settings. </LI><LI>Send and receive faxes over a modem using Microsoft Fax. For more information, see Chapter 27, "Microsoft Fax."</LI><LI>Configure HyperTerminal to predefine computers to which your computer can connect. </LI><LI>Configure Phone Dialer to make voice telephone calls. </LI><LI>Define the location you are calling from just once in Dialing Properties. All communications tools and applications created for Windows 95 reference that location when dialing out. </LI><LI>Manually dial a phone call or display a terminal window before or after dialing. For information, see "Setting Modem Properties" later in this chapter.</LI><LI>Connect to a remote computer by using Dial-Up Networking. For information, see Chapter 28, "Dial-Up Networking and Mobile Computing."</LI></UL></FONT></BODY></HTML>
