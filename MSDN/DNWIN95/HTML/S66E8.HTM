<h2>Installing Dial-Up Networking</H2><P>When you install Dial-Up Networking, you are installing all the components you need to connect to a network. For example, installing Dial-Up Networking also installs the Microsoft Dial-Up adapter, and connection and network protocols. </P>
<P>Before you dial up a remote connection using a modem and Dial-Up Networking, you need to make sure all the appropriate network protocols are bound to the Microsoft Dial-Up adapter or a network adapter. The easiest way to install Dial-Up Networking is during installation of Windows&nbsp;95. If you didn't choose it during Setup, you can install it afterward.</P>
<P><b>Note</b></P>
<P>If you are currently using Windows for Workgroups 3.11 with RAS, Dial-Up Networking will automatically be installed when you upgrade to Windows&nbsp;95.</P>
