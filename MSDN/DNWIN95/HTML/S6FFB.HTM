<h3>Connecting to Drive and Printer Resources</H3><P><img src="RK11_05A.gif"></P>
<P>The toolbar is available in every window and includes the Map Network Drive button. If you click this button, the Map Network Drive dialog box appears. In this dialog box, you can type the name of a network server and shared directory using the UNC name. For example, the UNC name for the server CORP and the shared directory DOCS is \\CORP\DOCS. On NetWare networks, you can also type any remote computer name understood by the network (for example, TRIKE/SYS:public).</P>
<P>You can make a persistent connection to any drive (that is, you can store its name and automatically reconnect to it at startup) by clicking the Reconnect At Logon check box in the Map Network Drive dialog box. Persistent connections are restored to the same drive letters each time Windows&nbsp;95 is started.</P>
<P><B>You can display this dialog box by right-clicking the Network Neighborhood icon.</B></P>

<P>When installing a new printer, you can specify a shared printer resource by using the UNC name or the Point and Print method. For example, for the shared printer named HP_III on the server CORP, the name UNC is \\CORP\HP_III. For more information about Point and Print, see Chapter 23, "Printing and Fonts." </P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
