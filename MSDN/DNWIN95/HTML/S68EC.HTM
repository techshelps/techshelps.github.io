<h2>Obtaining Drivers Electronically</H2><P>The Windows Driver Library (WDL) is a collection of new and updated printer, display, sound, and network drivers for use with Microsoft Windows. Network drivers on the WDL include NDIS 2 and NDIS 3 drivers for network adapters not included in the Windows&nbsp;95 retail product. As new and updated files become available, they are added to the WDL.</P>
<P>If you have a modem, the drivers are available electronically for downloading at no charge on services such as Microsoft Download Service (using the File index option in the main menu), CompuServe (using <B>go msl</B>), and GEnie (using Software Libraries in the IBM PC/Tandy roundtables menu). However, notice that standard connect-time fees and long-distance telephone charges, if any, apply when you download files. When you connect to any of these services, please read the WDL.TXT for a complete list of the devices the WDL supports.</P>
<P>If you do not have access to a modem, you can obtain an individual driver from the WDL on a disk by calling Microsoft Product Support Services at (425) 637-7098.</P>
<P>When searching for a WDL driver (or a WNTDL driver for Windows NT), you can use any of these keywords:</P>

<P><BR></P><H3><A NAME="sec0"></A>To download a file from the Windows Driver Library</H3><OL><LI>Locate the device in the WDL.TXT file. Make note of the name of the file listed next to the device. You need to download this file from your download service.</LI><LI>If you are downloading to a floppy disk, you need to have a formatted blank disk. If you are downloading to your hard disk, create a new subdirectory in which you will place the files.
<P><B>Important</B>   Do not download files directly into your Windows directory. Doing so could overwrite files essential to the proper operation of your system.</P></LI><LI>Follow the downloading procedure used by your downloading service. The file you download is the executable (.EXE) file that you identified in step 1. This file contains all the files you need to support your device.
<P>Download the .EXE file to your floppy disk or to the new subdirectory you created on your hard disk.</P></LI><LI>Change to the floppy disk drive (or the subdirectory on your hard disk) that contains the .EXE file. At the MS-DOS prompt, type the filename and then press enter.</LI></OL><P>When the .EXE file finishes running, all the files you need to support your device, such as a .DRV (Windows Driver Library) file and the OEMSETUP.INF file, are set up. You also have a .TXT file that contains instructions for installing the device drivers (or other software) and a licensing agreement.</P>
<P>If you have problems extracting files, try downloading the files again.</P>
