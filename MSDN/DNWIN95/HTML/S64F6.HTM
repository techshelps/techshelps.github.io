<h3>Mouse and Pointing Device Driver Overview</H3><P>Windows&nbsp;95 provides the following improvements in mouse and pointing device support:</P>
<UL><LI>Supports Plug and Play for easy installation of pointing devices. For example, the VMOUSE driver interface supports Plug and Play. </LI><LI>Provides smooth, reliable input when using the new protected-mode drivers.</LI><LI>Supports multiple simultaneous devices; for example, when using PS/2&reg; and serial devices at the same time.</LI><LI>Eliminates the need to use separate MS-DOS – based mouse drivers.
<P>Windows 3.1 required that an MS-DOS – based mouse driver be loaded before starting Windows to use a mouse in an MS-DOS – based application running in a window or running in a full screen.</P></LI></UL><P>The protected-mode Windows&nbsp;95 VxD mouse driver provides mouse support for Windows-based applications, MS-DOS – based applications running in a window, and MS-DOS – based applications running in a full screen. These improvements result in zero use of conventional memory for mouse support in the Windows&nbsp;95 environment. (However, most legacy real-mode drivers will run in Windows&nbsp;95.)</P>
<P>In addition to better mouse services, Windows&nbsp;95 allows the use of serial ports COM1 through COM4 for connecting a mouse or other pointing device. </P>
<H4><A NAME="sec0"></A>To see the improvements in mouse driver support </H4><OL><LI>Be sure the real-mode mouse driver from such entries as MOUSE.COM or MOUSE.SYS has been removed from CONFIG.SYS or AUTOEXEC.BAT.</LI><LI>Restart the computer, and start an MS-DOS – based application that supports the use of a mouse. 
<P>For example, use an application such as Edit, and try the MS-DOS – based application both in a window and in a full screen. Notice that the mouse is available in both modes.</P></LI></OL></FONT></BODY></HTML>
