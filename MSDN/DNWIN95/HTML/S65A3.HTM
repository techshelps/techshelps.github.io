<h2>Application Support: The Basics</H2><P>Windows&nbsp;95 optimizes the performance of new Win32-based applications and existing applications created for MS-DOS and earlier versions of Windows. They perform more smoothly because Windows&nbsp;95 significantly increases system resources available to them and more efficiently manages how they use system memory. Windows&nbsp;95 also supports new and existing versions of OLE technology, including OLE Controls and OLE Automation for new Windows-based applications. </P>
<P><B>Increased system resources.</B></P>
<P>Windows&nbsp;95 increases system resources for all applications by using 32-bit heaps to store applications' data structures, making more resources available for the remaining data elements. In addition, Windows&nbsp;95 increases the number of timers, COM and LPT ports, Windows menu handles, and other resources available to applications. For more information, see Chapter 17, "Performance Tuning." </P>
<P><B>Improved memory management.</B></P>
<P>The Virtual Machine Manager, an integral part of Windows&nbsp;95 architecture, manages the memory that each application needs. A virtual machine (VM) is an environment in memory that seems to function as a separate computer for each application. All Win32-based and Win16-based applications run in the System VM, in which all system processes also run. Each MS-DOS – based application runs in its own VM. For more information, see Chapter 31, "Windows 95 Architecture."</P>
<H3><A NAME="sec0"></A>Win32-Based Applications</H3><P>Win32-based applications receive the full benefit of the performance enhancement features in Windows 95. Because each Win32-based application runs in a separate memory space, it can take complete advantage of the preemptive multitasking capabilities of Windows&nbsp;95.</P>
<P></P>
<P><B>Requirements for Windows&nbsp;95 Logo.</B></P>
<P>To get the best possible performance, upgrade to versions of applications that were designed for Windows&nbsp;95 whenever possible. Applications written specifically for Windows&nbsp;95 carry the "Designed for Windows&nbsp;95" logo. To qualify for a Windows&nbsp;95 logo, applications must meet the following requirements:</P>
<UL><LI>Use Win32 APIs executable in the PE (Portable Executable) format</LI><LI>Support Windows&nbsp;95 user interface (shell), including the following:

<UL><LI>Use system metrics for sizing </LI><LI>Use system colors (recommended)</LI><LI>Use the right mouse button for context menus and not for anything else (recommended)</LI><LI>Use Windows&nbsp;95 Setup guidelines to make the application visible in the shell </LI></UL></LI><LI>Use long filenames</LI><LI>Be aware of Plug and Play events (recommended)</LI><LI>Run successfully on Windows&nbsp;NT 3.5 or later </LI></UL><P>There are modified requirements for file-based applications, utilities such as anti-virus software, and compilers and other development tools. For more information, contact the Microsoft Developer Network (MSDN). In Canada or the United States, call (800) 759-5474, or in Europe call +31 10 258 88 64. </P>
<H3><A NAME="sec1"></A>Win16-Based and MS-DOS – Based Applications</H3><P>Win16-based applications designed for Windows 3.1 run under Windows&nbsp;95 without modification, but these applications run in a shared memory space and cannot take advantage of preemptive multitasking. However, they do benefit from improvements incorporated into the Windows&nbsp;95 subsystem. For Win16-based and MS-DOS – based applications that are known to need special parameters to run, Windows&nbsp;95 includes an APPS.INF file that defines parameters for each application. </P>
<P>Because of default settings and other support in Windows&nbsp;95, you do not need to have CONFIG.SYS, AUTOEXEC.BAT, and INI files to run Win16-based and MS-DOS – based applications, although you can still use settings from existing files. When you upgrade by replacing Windows 3.1 with Windows&nbsp;95, Windows automatically moves the current settings for your installed applications to the Registry for use with Windows&nbsp;95. </P>
<P>MS-DOS – based applications can take advantage of the improved memory management and increased system resources that are made possible by the new system architecture. Most applications can now run in a window. MS-DOS – based applications that do not run well under Windows can run the application in exclusive MS-DOS Mode, which makes all system resources available to that application, as described in "Changing Memory Settings for MS-DOS – Based Applications " later in this chapter. </P>
<P>When running under Windows&nbsp;95, MS-DOS – based applications also benefit from the following:</P>
<UL><LI>Improved robustness, including better virtualization for computer resources, such as support for timers and sound devices.</LI><LI>Improved support for highly graphical MS-DOS – based applications. This allows you to run video-mode style applications in a window rather than in a full screen.</LI><LI>Improved memory protection. Windows&nbsp;95 includes a global memory-protection attribute in the properties dialog box for executable files. This attribute allows the MS-DOS system area to be protected from errant MS-DOS – based applications.</LI><LI>Improved printing performance and font support, including user-scalable windows with support for TrueType&reg; fonts in virtual machines (VMs).</LI><LI>Local environmental settings for VMs. You can also customize the VM environment by specifying a batch file in an executable file's properties dialog box.</LI></UL></FONT></BODY></HTML>
