<h2>Using User-Level Security</H2><P>For each network resource or service governed by user-level security, there is a list of users and groups that can access that resource. </P>
<H3><A NAME="sec0"></A>To share a directory or printer with user-level security</H3><OL><LI>In Windows Explorer or My Computer, right-click a resource and, in the context menu, click Sharing.</LI><LI>In the resource's properties, click Add.</LI><LI>In the Add Users dialog box, click a user or group, and then assign access rights as described in the following section.</LI></OL><P>For each user, there is a set of rights assigned for a resource. The kinds of rights that you assign depend on the kind of resource you are securing: </P>
<UL><LI>For shared directories, you can allow a user to have read-only access, full access, or custom access. Within custom access, you can grant the user any or all of the following rights: read, write, create, list, delete, change file attributes, and change access rights. </LI><LI>For shared printers, a user either has the right to access the printer or not.</LI><LI>For remote administration, a user either has the right to be an administrator or not as defined in the Passwords option in Control Panel.</LI></UL><P>Permissions are enforced for a resource as follows: </P>
<UL><LI>If the user has explicit rights to the resource, then those rights are enforced. </LI><LI>If the user does not have explicit rights to the resource, then the permissions are determined by taking all of the rights of each group to which the user belongs. </LI><LI>If none of the groups to which the user belongs has any rights to that resource, then the user is not granted access to the resource.</LI></UL><P>When you do not explicitly assign access rights to a file or directory, Windows&nbsp;95 uses implied rights. Implied rights are those assigned to a file or directory's nearest parent directory. If none of the parent directories (up to and including the root directory of the drive) have explicit rights, no access is allowed.</P>
<P><b>Note</b></P>
<P>Implied rights are displayed automatically in the properties dialog boxes of the shared file or directory.</P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
