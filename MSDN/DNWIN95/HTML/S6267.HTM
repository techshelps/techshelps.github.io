<h3>Setting Up a Windows NT Server for Push Installations</H3><P>This section summarizes the procedures for running login scripts from a Windows&nbsp;NT server for push installations.</P>
<H4><A NAME="sec0"></A>To prepare the server for push installations on a Windows NT network</H4><OL><LI>Run Server-based Setup, and install the Windows&nbsp;95 source files in the shared directory on the Windows NT Server, as described in Chapter 4, "Server-Based Setup for Windows 95."</LI><LI>Create an MSBATCH.INF file to meet your installation requirements, and copy this file into the Windows&nbsp;95 source directory on the server. </LI><LI>Using User Manager for Domains on a computer running Windows NT Server, create a user account named Upgrade, and specify <B>upgrade</B> as the password. Also, make sure the following options are selected for the Upgrade user account:

<UL><LI>User Cannot Change Password</LI><LI>Password Never Expires</LI></UL><P>By default, the user account is created in the domain where you logged on to the network. To create the user account in another domain, you must select that domain before creating the account. If your users log on to multiple domains, create the Upgrade user account in each domain.</P></LI><LI>Create the login scripts that run Windows&nbsp;95 Setup. For examples that use the Upgrade user account, see "Preparing Login Scripts for Push Installations" earlier in this chapter.</LI><LI>Assign the login script to the Upgrade user account. The login script must be placed in the <I>winnt</I>\SYSTEM32\REPL\EXPORT\SCRIPTS directory on the computer running Windows NT Server.
<P>The replication service replicates this from the export server to the import server, so the file is copied to <I>winnt</I>\SYSTEM32\REPL\IMPORT\SCRIPTS on the server.</P></LI></OL></FONT></BODY></HTML>
