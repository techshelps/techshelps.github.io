<h2>Windows NT Services for Macintosh</H2><P>Microsoft Windows&nbsp;NT Server Services for Macintosh is a thoroughly integrated component of Microsoft Windows&nbsp;NT Server, making it possible for computers running Windows&nbsp;95, MS-DOS, Windows, Windows for Workgroups, Windows&nbsp;NT, and Apple Macintosh to share files and printers. After Services for Macintosh is set up, that computer can function as an AppleTalk&reg; router. Routing capability is supported for AppleTalk Phase 2.</P>
<P>With Services for Macintosh, Macintosh computers need only the Macintosh operating system software to function as workstations; no additional software is required. You can, however, set up the optional user authentication module, which provides a secure logon to the computer running Windows&nbsp;NT Server.</P>
<P>When you set up Services for Macintosh on a computer running Windows&nbsp;NT Server, the AppleTalk Protocol, File Server for Macintosh, and the Print Server for Macintosh are started, or enabled. An explanation for each of these follows:</P>
<UL><LI>The AppleTalk Protocol is the layer of AppleTalk Phase 2 protocols that delivers data to its network destination. The AppleTalk Protocol can be configured through the Network icon in the Windows&nbsp;NT Server Control Panel. </LI><LI>File Server for Macintosh, also called MacFile, allows you to designate a directory as a Macintosh-accessible volume, ensures that Macintosh filenames are valid Windows NT file system (NTFS) names, and handles permissions. When set up, File Server for Macintosh commands appear in the Windows&nbsp;NT Server File Manager and Server Manager under the MacFile menu. </LI><LI>Print Server for Macintosh, also called MacPrint, allows all network users to send print jobs to a spooler on the computer running Windows&nbsp;NT Server and continue to work, rather than wait for their print jobs to complete. Windows-based users can also review the print jobs in Print Manager. </LI></UL><P>Setting up Services for Macintosh creates an icon in Control Panel on the Windows&nbsp;NT Server computer, which gives you the same server administration capabilities as the MacFile menu, excluding volume management. For complete information, see the <I>Windows&nbsp;NT Server Services for Macintosh</I> documentation.</P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
