<h3>Changing Memory Settings for MS-DOS - Based Applications </H3><P>Windows&nbsp;95 provides a flexible environment for running MS-DOS - based applications, even those applications that must have exclusive access to system resources. Almost all MS-DOS - based applications should run under Windows&nbsp;95. For MS-DOS - based applications that need sole access to computer resources, Windows&nbsp;95 offers MS-DOS Mode. </P>
<P>When an MS-DOS - based application starts in MS-DOS Mode, Windows&nbsp;95 removes itself from memory (except for a small stub) and provides the application with full access to all the computer's resources. Before running an application in this mode, Windows&nbsp;95 ends all running tasks, loads a real-mode copy of MS-DOS, and uses customized versions of the CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files to run the application. After you quit the MS-DOS - based application, Windows&nbsp;95 restarts and returns to the Windows&nbsp;95 user interface.</P>
<P><B>Caution</B>   Running an MS-DOS<FONT FACE="Symbol">-</FONT>based application in MS-DOS Mode does not necessarily improve its performance, but it does allow you to run it when it might not otherwise run in Windows&nbsp;95.</P>
<H4><A NAME="sec0"></A>To configure an MS-DOS<FONT FACE="Symbol">-</FONT>based application to run in MS-DOS Mode</H4><OL><LI>In My Computer, right-click the application's executable file, and then click Properties.</LI><LI>In the application's properties, click the Program tab, and then click Advanced.</LI><LI>In the Advanced dialog box, click MS-DOS Mode.</LI></OL><P>If an MS-DOS - based application, such as a game, performs badly because of insufficient memory or a lack of appropriate drivers, you can try the following: </P>
<UL><LI>Run the application in MS-DOS Mode.</LI><LI>Adjust the amount of memory available.</LI><LI>Create a custom startup configuration by modifying the contents of the CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files, either at the command prompt or in the application's properties.</LI></UL><H4><A NAME="sec1"></A>To adjust the amount of memory available to an MS-DOS - based application</H4><OL><LI>In My Computer, right-click the application's executable file, and then click Properties. </LI><LI>In the Application's properties, click the Memory tab, and then increase or decrease the amount of memory available to the application. For more information about the types of memory, see "Setting Properties for MS-DOS - Based Applications" later in this chapter. </LI></OL><H4><A NAME="sec2"></A>To create a custom startup configuration </H4><OL><LI>In My Computer, right-click the application's executable file, and then click Properties. </LI><LI>In the application's properties, click the Application tab, and then click Advanced. </LI><LI>In the Advanced dialog box, click MS-DOS Mode, click the option named Specify A New MS-DOS Configuration, and then create a custom startup configuration.</LI></OL><P><B>Note</B>   Windows&nbsp;95 automatically provides expanded memory for MS-DOS - based applications that require it to run. Windows cannot provide this memory, however, if you include a statement in CONFIG.SYS that loads EMM386.EXE with the <B>noems</B> parameter. When you include EMM386.EXE in CONFIG.SYS, use the <B>ram</B> parameter or use the <B>x=</B><I>mmmm-nnnn</I> statement to allocate enough space in the upper memory area for Windows&nbsp;95 to create an EMS page frame. For more information, see Appendix A, "Command-Line Commands Summary."</P>

<H4><A NAME="sec3"></A>Tip for Running MS-DOS-Based Games</H4><P>In most cases, MS-DOS - based games run under Windows&nbsp;95 with no special adjustments. Most popular games are listed in the Windows&nbsp;95 APPS.INF file. Games that include a Windows 3.1 PIF file should also continue to perform well. Certain PIF settings are now obsolete, however, because Windows&nbsp;95 manages them automatically. These settings include foreground and background priorities, exclusive priority, video memory usage, and video port monitoring.</P>
<P>If you run a game that uses graphics modes and Windows&nbsp;95 fails to run it in a full screen, press ALT+ENTER. To run the game in a full screen every time you start it, right-click the game's executable file, and then click Properties. Click the Screen tab, and then click Full Screen. You can also use the Properties dialog box to adjust other settings that improve performance. For more information, see "Setting Properties for MS-DOS - Based Applications" later in this chapter. </P>
