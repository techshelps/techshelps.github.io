<h2>System Performance Overview</H2><P>Windows&nbsp;95 greatly reduces the system resource limitations that many users experienced with Windows 3.1. Windows&nbsp;95 also cleans up resources that have not been freed to help reduce system resource limitations. When Windows&nbsp;95 determines that an application that owned certain resources no longer needs those resources in memory, it deallocates remaining data structures, freeing the resources for use elsewhere in the system.</P>
<P>Wherever possible, Windows&nbsp;95 is self-tuning, adjusting cache sizes or other elements of the system environment to provide the best performance for the current configuration. Windows&nbsp;95 can also detect when the drivers loaded or other performance-related components are not providing the optimal performance. </P>
<H3><A NAME="sec0"></A>To see a report of performance problems</H3><UL><LI>In the System option in Control Panel, click the Performance tab.
<P>Windows&nbsp;95 reports the current performance status, including whether 32-bit, protected-mode components are being used.</P></LI></UL><P><img src="RK17_05.gif"></P>
<P>If the performance status shows that real-mode components are being used for any device — and especially for disk drivers — you need to solve all the problems that prevent protected-mode drivers from loading. For information, see Chapter 19, "Devices." This chapter describes methods for optimizing or solving problems related to virtual memory, file system, or graphics performance.</P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
