<h3>Setting Network Logon Options with System Policies</H3><P>The network administrator can define system policies to enforce requirements for network logon. For example, you may want to ensure that users cannot access the local computer without network validation, or you may want to disable password caching.</P>
<P>For network logon in general, use these policies:</P>
<UL><LI>Logon Banner, to specify a caption and other text, such as a legal notice, to be displayed before the logon dialog box appears.</LI><LI>Require Validation By Network For Windows Access, to specify that each logon must be validated by a server before access to Windows is allowed.</LI></UL><P>For Microsoft Client for NetWare Networks, use this policy:</P>
<UL><LI>Disable Automatic NetWare Login, to specify that when Windows 95 attempts to connect to a NetWare server, it does not automatically try to use the user's network logon name and password and the Windows logon password to make the connection.</LI></UL><P>For Client for Microsoft Networks, use these policies: </P>
<UL><LI>Log On To Windows NT, to specify that this computer can participate in a Windows&nbsp;NT domain. </LI><LI>Display Domain Logon Validation, to display a message when the domain controller has validated user logon.</LI><LI>Disable Caching Of Domain Password, to specify that no caching is used for the network password. However, do not enable the Quick Logon feature when password caching has been disabled using system policies. The Quick Logon feature requires password caching to function properly.</LI></UL><P>For information about these policies and others that enforce password requirements, see Chapter 15, "User Profiles and System Policies." which also describes how to implement system policies. </P>
<P>If a computer has the Microsoft Remote Registry agent installed, you can use System Policy Editor to remotely set network logon options on individual computers without using system policies. This is useful in cases in which you have not previously enforced logon requirements using system policies but you want to ensure that network logon is configured properly on a specific computer.</P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
