<h2>User Profiles Overview</H2><P>In Windows&nbsp;95, user profiles contain configuration preferences and options for each user. They are particularly useful when users are encouraged to customize their computing environment, yet are forced to share computers with others who are also customizing their environments. User profiles are also beneficial to network administrators or help desk personnel who typically roam around, accessing the network from a variety of locations. Such users can work anywhere as if they were sitting at their own desks.</P>
<P>User profile settings include everything in the Hkey_Current_User section of the Windows&nbsp;95 Registry, such as the following:</P>
<UL><LI>Control Panel settings and preferences for the Windows&nbsp;95 user interface, including settings for desktop layout, background, font selection, colors, shortcuts on the desktop, the Start menu, and so on. </LI><LI>Settings for persistent network connections, plus information for recently used resources, including documents, Find Computer results, installation locations for setup, and printer ports.</LI><LI>Application settings (for applications that can write directly to the Windows&nbsp;95 Registry), including settings for the accessories and applications installed with Windows&nbsp;95, menu and toolbar configurations, fonts, and so on.</LI></UL><P>Each user profile includes several parts: a USER.DAT file, a backup USER.DA0 file, a Desktop folder, a Recent folder, and a Start Menu folder, plus the Programs folder under Start Menu. These folders are in the directories for each user, which are in the Windows Profiles directory, as shown in the following illustration. </P>

<P>When user profiles are enabled, users get their own configuration when they log on to a computer. Users can define their own preferences by customizing their desktops. Alternatively, you can define a standard user profile for use across the network or for a set of specific users.</P>
<P>Each user's preferences are saved to a user profile that Windows&nbsp;95 uses to configure the desktop each time that user logs on. When a second user logs on to the same computer with a different user name, Windows&nbsp;95 creates a separate user profile for that user. A roving user's profile is stored on a network server and downloaded to any computer on the network to which the user logs on. This occurs automatically on a NetWare and a Windows NT network. However, although Windows&nbsp;95 offers the ability for roving users to move from one computer running Windows&nbsp;95 to another, it does not offer the ability to move between a computer running Windows&nbsp;NT and one running Windows&nbsp;95.</P>
<P><b>Important</b></P>
<P>Although a user profile is based on the USER.DAT file that makes up part of the Windows&nbsp;95 Registry, this file cannot be edited with a text editor. To define and manage user profiles, you must use the Windows&nbsp;95 tools such as Control Panel for setting configuration options, and perform the procedures described in the following sections.</P>
<P>In the PROFILES subdirectory of the Windows directory, a folder is created for each user who has a profile on that computer. Each of these folders contains the following:</P>
<UL><LI>A USER.DAT file that contains the user portion of the Registry</LI><LI>A USER.DA0 file that contains the backup for USER.DAT</LI><LI>A Desktop folder that contains the contents of Desktop</LI><LI>A Recent folder that contains the contents of the Documents option on the Start menu</LI><LI>A Start Menu folder that contains the contents of the Start menu, and includes the Programs folder</LI></UL><H3><A NAME="sec0"></A>How Do User Profiles Work?</H3><P>Each time the user logs on to a computer, Windows&nbsp;95 searches the Registry under the following key to determine whether the user has a local profile:</P>
<P><BR></P>
<pre><code>Hkey_Local_Machine\Software\Microsoft\Windows\Current&nbsp;Version\Profile List</code></pre>
<P>Windows&nbsp;95 also checks for the user profile in the user's home directory on the server. If the user profile on the server is the most current, Windows&nbsp;95 copies it to the local computer for use during the current session, and then it loads the settings in this local copy into the Registry. If no local user profile exists, Windows&nbsp;95 copies the server version to the local computer. If no profile is found, Windows&nbsp;95 creates a new user profile on the local computer using default settings. If the user doesn't log on, then Windows&nbsp;95 automatically uses the default user profile.</P>
<P>Both the local and network copies of the user profile are automatically updated with current settings when the user logs off. </P>
<P>If the user is logged on at more than one computer at the same time, any changes made to the profile on the computer where the user first logs off will be overwritten when the user logs off the other computer. In other words, the last logoff is saved, and no merging of changes occurs.</P>
