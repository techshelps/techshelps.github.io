<h3>Choosing Protocols on NetWare Networks</H3><P>The Microsoft 32-bit IPX/SPX-compatible protocol is an NDIS 3.1-compliant, routable protocol that conforms to the IPX specification, which requires routable datagram packets. This protocol can use Novell NetWare servers configured as routers (and other IPX routers) to transfer packets across LANs to access resources on other computers running any IPX/SPX protocol. With the Microsoft IPX/SPX-compatible protocol, it is not necessary to load the Novell-supplied VIPX.386 driver.</P>
<UL><LI>The Microsoft IPX/SPX-compatible protocol is installed automatically if you install Client for NetWare Networks. However, if you configure Windows&nbsp;95 to maintain the existing NetWare client and protocol software, you can later try using the protected-mode protocol provided with Windows&nbsp;95. For details about installing and configuring the IPX/SPX-compatible protocol and NetBIOS over IPX, see Chapter 12, "Network Technical Discussion."</LI><LI>You can install both protected-mode and real-mode IPX drivers on the same adapter with ODI drivers. Notice, however, that you cannot install or use the IPX/SPX-compatible protocol to run over an IPX monolithic configuration or over ArcNet.</LI></UL><P>Client for NetWare Networks does not support NetWare IP. Microsoft TCP/IP, which is fully compliant with the standard RFCs specifying TCP/IP, cannot be used to provide TCP/IP support on NetWare networks. NetWare IP uses other protocol implementations for IP functionality, so that the two protocol suites cannot communicate with each other. </P>
<P>Although Microsoft TCP/IP cannot be used as the supporting protocol for Client for NetWare Networks or for Novell-supplied networking clients, Microsoft TCP/IP can be installed to support other networking clients on the same computer. Use this configuration when TCP/IP-based communications are used on the internetwork. To connect to the Internet using Microsoft TCP/IP, you do not have to install another network client in addition to Client for NetWare Networks.</P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
