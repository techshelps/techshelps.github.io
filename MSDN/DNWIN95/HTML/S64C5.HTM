<h2>Windows 95 Device Classes</H2><P>Devices and buses are grouped as classes in Windows&nbsp;95, for purposes of installing and managing device drivers and allocating resources. The Registry contains a subkey for every class of device supported, and the hardware tree (as described in the following section) is organized by device class. Windows&nbsp;95 uses class installers to install drivers for all hardware classes. Device Manager, for example, sends messages to the various class installers to tell them to add, remove, or configure specific hardware. </P>
<P>The following are some examples of class names defined in Windows&nbsp;95: </P>

<P><BR></P><P>The Windows&nbsp;95 hardware tree is a record of the current system configuration, based on the configuration information for all devices in the hardware branch of the Registry. The hardware tree is created in RAM each time the system is started or whenever a dynamic change occurs to the system configuration. </P>
<P>Each branch in the tree defines a device node with the following requirements for configuration:</P>
<UL><LI>Unique identification code, or device ID</LI><LI>List of required resources, including the resource type (such as IRQ and memory range) and constraints on specific resources (such as a COM port that requires IRQ3)</LI><LI>List of allocated resources</LI><LI>Indication that the device node is a bus, if applicable (each bus device has additional device nodes under it in the tree)</LI></UL><H3><A NAME="sec0"></A>Tip for Viewing the Hardware Tree</H3><P>Most information in the Windows&nbsp;95 hardware tree can be seen by using Device Manager, which you can display by choosing the System option in Control Panel. Device Manager is described in Chapter 19, "Devices."</P>
<P>You can also see the information in the hardware tree in the Hkey_Dyn_Data\Dynamic\Enum section of the Windows&nbsp;95 Registry.</P>
<P></P>
<P>The configuration process in Windows&nbsp;95 uses the device nodes to identify the devices and resource requirements for establishing the working system configuration. For information about the components that work together in Windows&nbsp;95 to configure the system, see Chapter 31, "Windows 95 Architecture."</P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
