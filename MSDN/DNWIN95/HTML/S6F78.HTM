<h3>Starting the Network During System Startup</H3><P></P>
<P>If your computer uses 32-bit, protected-mode networking components exclusively, you do not need statements in AUTOEXEC.BAT or other startup batch files to start the network when you start the computer. The installation of the correct protected-mode network client, protocol, and network adapter driver, as shown in the Network option in Control Panel, is all you need to ensure that networking is available whenever you start Windows&nbsp;95.</P>
<P>If your computer uses any real-mode components for the client, protocol, or network adapter driver, then you must include commands to start the network in AUTOEXEC.BAT or a batch file that is called from AUTOEXEC.BAT. This is because real-mode components must be inserted properly in the startup sequence to be available to other parts of the system. </P>
<P>For real-mode components on NetWare networks, the NET.CFG or similar file is used to start and configure networking during system startup. The user or network administrator must maintain this file. For Microsoft networks, the <B>net start </B>statement in AUTOEXEC.BAT is used to start any real-mode networking components. If this statement is required for any components, the operating system automatically places the <B>net start </B>statement at the beginning of AUTOEXEC.BAT. If you (or another user) removes this statement, the system replaces it so that the real-mode networking component is available the next time the computer is started. </P>
<P>The PROTOCOL.INI file stores settings for real-mode networking components. The only sections that might be read are [PROTMAN$], [<I>netcard</I>], and [NDISHLP$]. For information about the content of PROTOCOL.INI, see Chapter 8, "Windows 95 on Microsoft Networks."</P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
