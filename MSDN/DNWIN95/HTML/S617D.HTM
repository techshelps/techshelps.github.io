<h3>Hardware Profiles</H3><P>Hardware profiles are known configuration states for a specific computer— such as docked or undocked, in the case of a portable computer. Hardware profiles enable Windows 95 to adjust system capabilities to match the current state of the hardware. For example, when a portable computer is undocked, Windows 95 removes the system's printing and networking capabilities.</P>

A 32-bit network client is required to support user profiles.</LI><LI>You can also define mandatory user profiles in a file called USER.MAN for all users who log on to a specific home directory of a network server. This mandatory user profile protects novice users from inadvertently making changes to their environment. </LI></UL></FONT></BODY></HTML>
