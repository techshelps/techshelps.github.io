<h3>Installing Plug and Play Printers </H3>
<P>For Plug and Play-compliant printers, all you need to do is plug the printer cable into a port and start Windows&nbsp;95. The printer reports its device ID to Windows&nbsp;95, which searches INF files to find the ID that matches the values reported by the printer and then proceeds with installation in the following ways: </P>
<UL><LI>If an exact match is found, Windows&nbsp;95 automatically installs the correct printer support. </LI><LI>If an exact match is not found, but a compatible driver is found, Windows&nbsp;95 displays a dialog box showing the device was found and a compatible driver is available. You can then provide a disk containing a Windows&nbsp;95 driver that is an exact match, ask Windows&nbsp;95 to install the compatible driver it has found, or ask Windows&nbsp;95 not to install a driver at all. Windows&nbsp;95 automatically determines the best driver to use. </LI></UL></FONT></BODY></HTML>
