<h3>Installing Networking Components</H3><P>The recommended method for installing networking components for Windows&nbsp;95 is to ensure that the existing real-mode networking components are running when you start Windows&nbsp;95 Setup. In this case, Setup detects the existing components and installs corresponding support for Windows&nbsp;95 automatically and, wherever possible, migrates configuration settings to the Registry. For more information about how to do this, see Chapter 3, "Introduction to Windows 95 Setup."</P>
<P>This section summarizes how to install networking support by using the Network option in Control Panel after Windows&nbsp;95 is installed. Specific issues for installing various network components are discussed in the other chapters in this part of <I>Windows&nbsp;95 Resource Kit</I>. The following procedures describe the general steps that are required for installing networking components. </P>
