<h3>Using the Windows 3.x Program Manager with Windows 95</H3><P>Some users may not feel comfortable moving to the new Windows&nbsp;95 interface immediately after you upgrade their computers from Windows 3.x. To ease their transition, you can use the a Windows 3.x Program Manager. </P>
<P>When you replace Windows 3.x with Windows&nbsp;95, you can choose to include Program Manager on the Windows&nbsp;95 desktop. Program Manager does not support the following Windows&nbsp;95 functionality:</P>
<UL><LI>You cannot copy an item from a Program Manager group to the Windows&nbsp;95 desktop, and you cannot copy My Computer, Network Neighborhood, Control Panel, or the Printers folder to a Program Manager group. 
<P>The folders that were created when you installed Windows&nbsp;95 are not designed to work with Program Manager. Program Manager recognizes files only. </P></LI><LI>When you copy a shortcut to a Program Manager group, the shortcut's name is truncated to eight characters.
<P>In this case, Program Manager uses the filename (minus the extension) for the shortcut's name. For example, if you copy the MS-DOS Prompt shortcut from My Computer to a Program Manager group, the MS-DOS Prompt description is shortened to MS-DOSPR. This occurs because the MS-DOS Prompt shortcut uses the MS-DOS name MS-DOSPR.LNK. To rename the shortcut, click it, click the File menu in Program Manager, and then click Properties. In the Description field, type a new name.</P></LI><LI>When you copy a shortcut or other item to Program Manager, the item's icon is lost.</LI></UL>
<P>This occurs because the icon created in the Program Manager group references a file with an .LNK extension. Because Program Manager does not recognize this extension, a generic icon appears. To change the icon, click it, click the File menu in Program Manager, and then click Properties. Click Change Icon, and then select a different icon.</P>
<UL><LI>You cannot quit Windows&nbsp;95 by quitting Program Manager. To quit Windows&nbsp;95 or restart your computer, click the Start button, and then click Shut Down.</LI></UL><P><B>Tip</B>   For a comparison of Windows&nbsp;95 and Windows&nbsp;3.x features, see "If You've Used Windows Before" in online Help. </P>
<P>If you want to run Windows 3.1 Program Manager, it must be installed during Windows&nbsp;95 Setup.</P>
<H4><A NAME="sec0"></A>To install the Windows 3.1 Program Manager during Windows&nbsp;95 Setup</H4><OL><LI>In Windows&nbsp;95 Setup, choose Custom as the Setup Option type.</LI><LI>In the Computer Settings dialog box, click User Interface, and then click Change.</LI><LI>Click Windows 3.1 (Program Manager), and then click OK.</LI></OL><P>After Setup, a shortcut for Program Manager appears in the StartUp folder. This causes Program Manager to start every time Windows&nbsp;95 is started. </P>
<P>After users grow familiar with the Windows&nbsp;95 interface, they will probably prefer to use it to run applications and manage files. At this point, you can remove the shortcut to Program Manager from the StartUp folder. </P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
