<h3>Using Terminal Emulation Applications</H3>
<P>Terminal emulation applications offer several different connectivity options for connecting to a host IBM AS/400, or DEC VAX computer. This section describes configuration and other issues related to using terminal emulation programs.</P>
<P><B>Connecting to a NetWare for SAA gateway. </B></P>
<P>For most emulation applications, configuring Windows&nbsp;95 with the Microsoft IPX/SPX-compatible protocol enables connectivity to a NetWare for SAA gateway or to any gateway supporting IPX/SPX connectivity. If you are using a token-ring network with source routing, use the Network option in Control Panel to make sure that Microsoft IPX/SPX-compatible protocol appears in the list of network components. In Advanced properties for the protocol, set the Source Routing property to a 16-entry cache size.</P>
<P>If this configuration does not work well, configure Windows 95 to use a Novell-supplied real-mode NetWare client.</P>
<P><B>Connecting to a Windows NT SNA 2.0 or 2.1 server.</B></P>
<P>Windows 3.x client software supports connectivity to a Windows NT SNA 2.0 or 2.1 server. The Windows&nbsp;NT 32-bit client for SNA should not be used; it was designed to work only with client computers running Windows&nbsp;NT Workstation.</P>
<P><B>Connecting to an AS/400 with IBM PC Support software.</B></P>
<P>You can use Windows&nbsp;95 to connect to an AS/400 using the IBM PC Support software. To do so, configure the PC Support application for Basic Mode; do not use Extended Mode. If the PC Support application was configured to connect using DLC, make sure that Microsoft DLC or IBM LanSupport is already installed on the computer.</P>
<P>You can also use Windows&nbsp;95 to connect to an AS/400 using the NetWare for SAA gateway and the IBM PC Support application. Configure the PC Support application for Basic Mode; do not use Extended Mode. The IBM-supplied DOS16M.386 file is not compatible with Windows&nbsp;95.</P>
<P>If Windows&nbsp;95 is configured to use the IPX/SPX-compatible protocol, then you must create a WINSTART.BAT batch file in the Windows directory and add entries in this file to run PCSWIN.COM and STRNRTR.EXE (the Novell-compatible router). If you encounter problems using the protected-mode IPX/SPX-compatible transport with the Novell-compatible PC Support router, then configure Windows&nbsp;95 to use the Novell-supplied NETX or VLM client with IPXODI, as described in Chapter 9, "Windows 95 on NetWare Networks."</P>
<P><B>Connecting to host computer using a coaxial adapter.</B></P>
<P>If you are using a coaxial connection with a coaxial adapter (CUT/DFT) supplied by IBM or another vendor, use the real-mode drivers provided with the adapter or emulation software for setting up hardware. No 32-bit drivers are available for connectivity with this type of adapter. </P>
