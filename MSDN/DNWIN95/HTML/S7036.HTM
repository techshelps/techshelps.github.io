<h3>IPX/SPX Technical Notes on NetWare Networks</H3>
<UL><LI>There is no need to enable Source Routing on token ring networks if the communication is on the same ring, even if one computer has it enabled. </LI><LI>SPX-II is a protocol definition for windowing and transmitting large packets over SPX. You can run any SPX-II application under Windows&nbsp;95 using the IPX/SPX-compatible protocol. The related Novell-supplied file TLI.DLL must be available on the computer to support SPX-II.</LI><LI>The IPX/SPX-compatible protocol in Windows&nbsp;95 uses NET.CFG parameters for NetBIOS over IPX on NetWare networks. However, it should not be necessary for you to configure these parameters, because most parameters are dynamic and self-adjusting. (When you install Windows&nbsp;95 with protected-mode networking components, NET.CFG and SHELL.CFG parameters are moved to the Registry.)</LI><LI>To determine the network address in IPX packets, Windows&nbsp;95 checks the wire for RIP packets and chooses the most likely address. The network address is dynamic and changes when a new network address becomes more prevalent.</LI><LI>All Transport Layer Interface (TLI) libraries can run on the IPX/SPX-compatible protocol in Windows&nbsp;95. TLI is similar to TDI in Microsoft networking as a layer between the protocol and network adapter driver; this implementation is similar to STREAMS and provides a STREAMS environment for NetWare, but Windows&nbsp;95 uses Windows Sockets instead. </LI></UL></FONT></BODY></HTML>
