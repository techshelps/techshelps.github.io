<h3>Microsoft Mail Gateway to X.400</H3><P>Microsoft Mail Gateway to X.400 offers transparent backboning using an X.400 network. It links geographically dispersed local area networks into a single mail network. It connects local area networks, mainframes, minicomputers, and microcomputers with X.400. This gateway uses the X.400 gateway to connect to an unlimited number of message transfer agents (MTAs) and functions as a relay between them. This gateway also provides X.400 over an 802.x LAN.</P>
<P>Microsoft Mail Gateway to X.400 includes the following features:</P>
<UL><LI>Provides OSI LAN connectivity, eliminating the need for costly additional software, hardware, or communications lines. </LI><LI>Supports multiple simultaneous active sessions for higher overall throughput and accepts up to two incoming calls while sending a message. </LI><LI>Accepts local area and wide area network connections simultaneously for more flexibility.</LI><LI>Uses encapsulation, or "tunneling," to exchange messages containing text, multimedia objects, binary files, and directories with other Microsoft Mail users across X.400 backbones without losing information or data integrity.</LI><LI>Provides easy configuration and maintenance with a new full-screen utility, which administrators can use to view and print log files and configuration parameters. </LI><LI>Assign users arbitrarily — even multiple X.400 addresses — without shutting down the gateway with Advanced Address Mapping. </LI><LI>Adds a new address simply by filling out the address template provided. Reads friendly names on mail from other X.400 systems instead of lengthy X.400 O/R addresses. X.400 addresses can be added to the Microsoft Personal Address Book. </LI></UL><P>Microsoft Mail Gateway to X.400 complies with international X.400 standards in the following ways:</P>
<UL><LI>Acts as a fully functional CCITT 1984 X.400 MTA and being able to communicate with 1988-compliant MTAs</LI><LI>Supports NIST, ENV 41202 (A/311) X.400 profiles</LI><LI>Conforms to OSTC</LI><LI>Has Afnor Certification</LI></UL><P>The gateway offers the following bodypart support:</P>
<UL><LI>Supports bodypart 0 (IA5), including translation tables for Norwegian, German, and Swedish, in addition to standard International Reference Version (IRV) for improved interoperability between European X.400 systems.</LI><LI>Supports bodypart 5 (T.61/Teletex) for extended character support.</LI><LI>Includes new bodypart 13 support (ISO 6937) to seamlessly carry text in attached files with accented characters not supported through the standard IA5 text character set.</LI><LI>Supports binary attachments using bodypart 14, so attachments can be sent to other systems without losing any information.</LI></UL></FONT></BODY></HTML>
