<h3>Browsing in Common Dialog Boxes</H3><P>The new common dialog boxes (such as File Open and File Save) are standard in programs that use the Windows&nbsp;95 user interface. They provide a consistent way to open or save files on network resources and local drives. Also, you can browse Network Neighborhood and you can perform most basic file management tasks by using a common dialog box.</P>
<P><b>Note</b></P>
<P>Windows-based applications created for earlier versions of Windows do not use the new common dialog boxes.</P>
<P>In Windows&nbsp;95, you can create new directories (also called folders) when you are saving a document (unlike Windows 3.1 in which you had to start File Manager or exit to the MS-DOS command prompt). This means that you can also create a new directory on a shared network resource when saving documents, as shown in the following procedure. This procedure can be used in any application that uses the Window 95 common dialog boxes.</P>
