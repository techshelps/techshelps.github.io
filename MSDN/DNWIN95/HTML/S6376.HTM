<h2>IBM OS/2 LAN Server</H2><P><img src="RK10_08.gif"></P>
<P>Windows&nbsp;95 can be installed and run with these versions:</P>
<UL><LI>IBM OS/2 LAN Server version 1.3 CSD</LI><LI>IBM OS/2 LAN Server versions 1.2, 1.3, 2.0, and 4.0</LI></UL><P><B>Note</B>   If OS/2 LAN Server is installed using an OS/2 LAN Server LAN driver, Windows&nbsp;95 can support OS/2 LAN Server as a primary network only. In this case, you cannot also install Client for Microsoft Networks as an additional network client. </P>
<P>Users can connect to servers using the Map Network Drive dialog box or command prompt. For OS/2 LAN Server servers to appear in Network Neighborhood for browsing, at least one computer in the LAN Server domain must be running File and Printer Sharing for Microsoft Networks and acting as the Browse Master (as described in Chapter 11, "Logon, Browsing, and Resource Sharing"). Also, the workgroup name for the computer running File and Printer Sharing for Microsoft Networks must match the LAN Server domain name. </P>
<P>When support for OS/2 LAN Server is installed for use with Client for Microsoft Networks, aliasing is not supported.</P>
<P>If you are using custom setup scripts to install Windows&nbsp;95 on multiple computers, make sure that at least one computer running Windows&nbsp;95 in the LAN Server domain is already configured as the Browse Master. Also, make sure that the [Network] section of the custom setup script includes a correct value for <B>workgroup=</B><I>LANServer_domain</I>.</P>
<H3><A NAME="sec0"></A>To set up Windows&nbsp;95 with IBM OS/2 LAN Server real-mode network client support</H3><UL><LI>Make sure that the OS/2 LAN Server client is already installed. The network should be running when you follow the steps in "Installing Support for Other Networks: An Overview" earlier in this chapter. No other steps are required. However, you probably want to specify the LAN Server domain name as the workgroup name under Windows&nbsp;95.</LI></UL></FONT></BODY></HTML>
