<h3>Support for Multimedia Devices</H3><P>Windows&nbsp;95 includes built-in support for common multimedia authoring devices such as laser discs and video-cassette recorders (VCRs). This makes it easy to set up a computer for <I>step capture</I>, a process in which a user captures digital-video data one frame at a time; the data is usually compressed later. This is a slow process, but it is the best way to get the best possible quality of digital video.</P>
<P>To play the contents of a videotape on a computer, users must connect the video and audio outputs from the VCR to the video-capture or overlay and to the audio inputs of the computer. Users might also need to install an MCI digital-video device driver.</P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
