<h3>Other Notes on Shared Installations</H3><P><B>MS-DOS Mode is disabled.</B></P>
<P>When the user starts a program that runs in MS-DOS Mode, Windows&nbsp;95 shuts down and uses real-mode MS-DOS to run the program. When the program quits, Windows&nbsp;95 starts again. This mode is available as a last resort mode for compatibility with existing software. Computers that run a shared version of Windows&nbsp;95 lose their network when Windows&nbsp;95 shuts down. Because of the related problems, MS-DOS Mode is not available for computers running Windows&nbsp;95 over the network. When a user tries to run a program in this mode, Windows&nbsp;95 warns that the mode has been disabled. </P>
<P><B>Hot docking for network adapters is not supported.</B></P>
<P>When Windows&nbsp;95 starts over the network, real-mode drivers control the network adapter. If the network adapter is a Plug and Play card, the driver is responsible for setting the card to the active state. (You can use the setup program provided with the card to do this.) Computers that run over the network do not support hot Plug and Play disconnects, because the operating system is on the network.</P>
<P><B>Users cannot log off and log on as a different user.</B></P>
<P>For another user to log on to a shared installation, the computer must be shut down and restarted.</P>
<P><B>Safe Mode startup always runs configuration files.</B></P>
<P>To perform a Safe Mode system startup for a shared installation, the network must be started, so IO.SYS always runs AUTOEXEC.BAT, CONFIG.SYS, and NETSTART.BAT. Information in the machine directory controls how and when to perform a Safe Mode startup. </P>
