<h2>Hkey_Current_Config and Hkey_Dyn_Data</H2><P>The Hkey_Current_Config key points to the current system configuration in the collection of configurations stored in Hkey_Local_Machine\Config.</P>
<P></P>
<P>Some information in Windows&nbsp;95 must be stored in RAM because it requires fast modification and retrieval that cannot wait for the Registry to flush to the hard disk. All this data can be found under Hkey_Dyn_Data.</P>
<P>The Hkey_Dyn_Data\Configuration Manager subkey, sometimes referred to as the hardware tree, is a record in RAM of the current system configuration. The information is drawn from the devices currently installed and loaded, or that failed loading. The hardware tree is created every time the system starts and updates whenever a change occurs to the system configuration. The information that appears in Registry Editor is provided when this key is displayed, so it is never out of date.</P>
<P>Hkey_Dyn_Data also contains statistics gathered for various network components in the system. These reside under Hkey_Dyn_Data\PerfStats.</P>
<P>VxDs from other vendors can provide dynamic data to this area too. For more information, see the <I>Win32 Software Development Kit for Windows 95 and Windows NT</I>.</P>
