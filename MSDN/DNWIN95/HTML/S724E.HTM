<h3>Connection Protocols</H3><P>Connection protocols control the transmission of data over the wide-area network (WAN). A Windows&nbsp;95 dial-up client can use the following connection protocols to connect to a remote access server:</P>
<UL><LI>Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP)</LI><LI>Novell NetWare Connect</LI><LI>Windows NT 3.1 or Windows for Workgroups RAS (Asynchronous NetBEUI)</LI><LI>Serial Line Internet Protocol (SLIP)</LI></UL><P>The type of connection protocol you choose depends on the server you are connecting to. Some connection protocols support a subset of the common network protocols. For example, PPP allows you to connect to a network server or a computer running Windows&nbsp;95 with TCP/IP, IPX/SPX-compatible, or NetBEUI network protocols. </P>
<P>The following is a summary of connection protocols.</P>
<P><B>Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP).</B></P>
<P>PPP has become the standard for remote access. Microsoft recommends that you use PPP because of its flexibility and its role as an industry standard, and for future flexibility with client and server hardware and software. If a dial-up client is running PPP, it can connect to a network running IPX, TCP/IP, or NetBEUI protocols. PPP is the default protocol for the Microsoft Dial-Up adapter. For more information, see "PPP Dial-Up Sequence" later in this chapter.</P>
<P><B>Novell NetWare Connect.</B></P>
<P>NetWare Connect is a proprietary connection protocol. It allows a computer running Windows&nbsp;95 to directly connect to a NetWare Connect server and, if running a NetWare-compatible network client, connect to NetWare servers. Windows&nbsp;95 can only act as a client for connecting to a NetWare Connect server. NetWare Connect clients themselves cannot connect to a Windows&nbsp;95 dial-up server directly through dial-up. </P>
<P><B>RAS for Windows NT 3.1 and Windows for Workgroups 3.11 (Asynchronous NetBEUI).</B></P>
<P>This protocol is used to connect computers running Windows&nbsp;95 to remote access servers running Windows NT 3.1 or Windows for Workgroups 3.11, or to connect computers running Windows for Workgroups 3.11 or Windows&nbsp;NT 3.1 to a Windows&nbsp;95 dial-up server. The remote access server must be running NetBEUI.</P>
<P><B>Serial Line Internet Protocol (SLIP).</B></P>
<P>SLIP is an older remote access standard that is typically used by UNIX remote access servers. Use SLIP only if your site has a UNIX system configured as a SLIP server for Internet connections. The remote access server must be running TCP/IP.</P>
<P>Windows 95 does not provide SLIP server capabilities; SLIP is for dial-out only. Support for SLIP can be found on the Windows&nbsp;95 compact disc. </P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
