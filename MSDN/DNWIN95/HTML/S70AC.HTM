<h2>Removing Remote Agents and Services</H2>
<P>Any agent that runs as a network service and that appears in the Network option in Control Panel can be removed by selecting it and clicking the Remove button. </P>
<P>You can use System Policy Editor to turn off services by setting system policies, or by using Registry mode to modify a computer's Registry. To do this, in the computer properties, click System. Then delete the services that you no longer want under the Run and Run Services policies. </P>
<P>Some agents, such as the SNMP agent, can be removed only by modifying the Registry. For a single computer, you can do this by using either Registry Editor or System Policy Editor. The following Registry keys list the services running on the computer:</P>
