<h3>OSI Reference Model and Windows 95 Architecture</H3><P>The modular networking architecture of Windows&nbsp;95 is based on two industry standard models for a layered networking architecture, namely the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) model for computer networking, called the Open Systems Interconnect (OSI) Reference Model, and the Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers (IEEE) 802 model. Windows NT and Windows for Workgroups are also designed according to these standard models. The ISO OSI and IEEE 802 models define a modular approach to networking, with each layer responsible for some discrete aspect of the networking process. </P>
<P>The OSI model describes the flow of data in a network, from the lowest layer (the physical connections) up to the layer containing the user's applications. Data going to and from the network is passed layer to layer. Each layer is able to communicate with the layer immediately above it and the layer immediately below it. This way, each layer is written as an efficient, streamlined software component. When a layer receives a packet of information, it checks the destination address, and if its own address is not there, it passes the packet to the next layer.</P>
<P>When two computers communicate on a network, the software at each layer on one computer assumes it is communicating with the same layer on the other computer. For example, the Transport layer of one computer communicates with the Transport layer on the other computer. The Transport layer on the first computer has no regard for how the communication actually passes through the lower layers of the first computer, across the physical media, and then up through the lower layers of the second computer.</P>
<P>The OSI Reference Model includes seven layers: </P>

<UL><LI>The<B> </B><I>Application layer </I>represents the level at which applications access network services. This layer represents the services that directly support applications such as software for file transfers, database access, and electronic mail.</LI><LI>The<B> </B><I>Presentation layer </I>translates data from the Application layer into an intermediary format. This layer also manages security issues by providing services such as data encryption, and compresses data so that fewer bits need to be transferred on the network.</LI><LI>The<B> </B><I>Session layer </I>allows two applications on different computers to establish, use, and end a session. This layer establishes dialog control between the two computers in a session, regulating which side transmits, plus when and how long it transmits.</LI><LI>The <I>Transport layer</I> handles error recognition and recovery. It also repackages long messages when necessary into small packets for transmission and, at the receiving end, rebuilds packets into the original message. The receiving Transport layer also sends receipt acknowledgments. </LI><LI>The <I>Network layer </I>addresses messages and translates logical addresses and names into physical addresses. It also determines the route from the source to the destination computer and manages traffic problems, such as switching, routing, and controlling the congestion of data packets.</LI><LI>The <I>Data Link layer </I>packages raw bits from the Physical layer into frames (logical, structured packets for data). This layer is responsible for transferring frames from one computer to another, without errors. After sending a frame, it waits for an acknowledgment from the receiving computer.</LI><LI>The <I>Physical layer </I>transmits bits from one computer to another and regulates the transmission of a stream of bits over a physical medium. This layer defines how the cable is attached to the network adapter and what transmission technique is used to send data over the cable. </LI></UL><P>The following diagram shows the layered components that make up the Windows&nbsp;95 networking model.</P>
