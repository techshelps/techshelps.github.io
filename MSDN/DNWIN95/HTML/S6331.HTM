<h2>Using a Novell NetWare Client</H2><P>Windows&nbsp;95 can run with the NetWare NETX and VLM client software. Before installing Windows&nbsp;95, make sure that you have the necessary Novell-supplied files for Windows&nbsp;support, which can be obtained from Novell. </P>
<P><b>Caution</b></P>
<P>Novell-supplied components for using the NetWare client with Windows&nbsp;95 require that you log on to the appropriate NetWare server before starting Windows&nbsp;95. As with earlier versions of Windows, you should not log on to a NetWare server from within Windows&nbsp;95.</P>
<P>Instead, log on to the server from AUTOEXEC.BAT or from a batch file that is called from AUTOEXEC.BAT. You should also continue to load the necessary MS-DOS – based TSR programs using AUTOEXEC.BAT or STARTNET.BAT. </P>
<P>For information about where a logon command should be placed in system startup files, see Chapter 11, "Logon, Browsing, and Resource Sharing."</P>
<P>The following section describes how to set up and configure Windows&nbsp;95 with a Novell-supplied client.</P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
