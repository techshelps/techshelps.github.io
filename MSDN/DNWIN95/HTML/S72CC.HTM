<h3>Redirectors and IFS Manager </H3><P>A network redirector provides mechanisms to locate, open, read, write, and delete files and submit print jobs. It also makes available application services such as named pipes and mailslots. When an application needs to send or receive data from a remote device, it sends a call to the redirector. The redirector provides the functionality of the Application and Presentation layers of the OSI model. </P>
<P>The redirectors are included in the Windows&nbsp;95 network client software as the following file system drivers:</P>
<UL><LI>In Client for Microsoft Networks (VREDIR.VXD), the redirector supports all networks based on Microsoft networking, which use the Server Message Block (SMB) file sharing protocol.</LI></UL><P></P>
<UL><LI>In Microsoft Client for NetWare Networks (NWREDIR.VXD), the redirector supports NetWare networking products, which use the NetWare Core Protocol (NCP) file sharing protocol.</LI></UL><P>Windows&nbsp;95 also supports network redirectors from other network vendors.</P>
<P>Because each protected-mode redirector is implemented in Windows&nbsp;95 as a file system driver, the redirector is managed by Installable File System (IFS) Manager. The redirector works with IFS Manager to map local names into network devices and decides whether the application needs access to a local or remote device. IFS Manager controls file I/O transfers for all the installable file systems in Windows&nbsp;95. For more information about IFS Manager, see Chapter 31, "Windows 95 Architecture."</P>
<P>Client for Microsoft Networks (the redirector for Microsoft networks) formats an application's request into data packet SMBs and submits the packet to the protocol. Microsoft Client for NetWare Networks (the NetWare redirector) formats requests into NCP packets. The data packet is passed by the protocol to the adapter driver. </P>
<P></P>
<P>The Windows&nbsp;95 server side at this layer of the networking model supports peer resource sharing. Windows&nbsp;95 provides two server services for peer networking:</P>
<UL><LI>File and Printer Sharing for Microsoft Networks (the Windows&nbsp;95 SMB-based server, VSERVER.VXD), which supports resource sharing among all computers on the network that use the SMB file sharing protocol.</LI><LI>File and Printer Sharing for NetWare Networks (the Windows&nbsp;95 NCP-based server, NWSERVER.VXD), which supports resource sharing among all computers on the network that use the NCP file sharing protocol.</LI></UL><P></P>
