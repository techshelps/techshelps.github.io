<h3>Troubleshooting Client for NetWare Networks </H3><P>This section discusses some common problems that might occur while installing, configuring, or using Microsoft Client for NetWare Networks. </P>
<P>As a general troubleshooting step, make sure that the version of NETWARE.DRV is a size of about 2K. If it is much larger, remove Client for NetWare Networks in the Network option in Control Panel, and then reinstall it.</P>
<H4><A NAME="sec0"></A>No network is available after Windows&nbsp;95 starts.</H4><P>Verify that Client for NetWare Networks is installed. Use the Network option in Control Panel to view a list of installed clients, protocols, and services. Verify that the IPX/SPX-compatible protocol is in the list of installed components.</P>
<H4><A NAME="sec1"></A>The login script does not run.</H4><P>Make sure the correct preferred server is set and that Enable Login Script Processing is checked in the properties for Client for NetWare Networks.</P>
<H4><A NAME="sec2"></A>NetWare servers can't be found.</H4><P>You might not be able to see NetWare servers if you are using an incorrect frame type for the servers. To ensure that you are using the correct frame type for the server, verify the frame type set in the Advanced properties for the IPX/SPX-compatible protocol in the Network option in Control Panel. You can switch the setting from Auto to the specific frame type used on the server.</P>
<P>Client for NetWare Networks supports NetWare 4.x bindery emulation. Be sure that the bindery context you set for your NetWare server directory includes the Windows&nbsp;95 users who should have access to the servers. To view and set your bindery context on NetWare 4.x servers, load the SERVMAN NetWare loadable module (NLM) and then view and set the SET BINDERY CONTEXT parameter. Or, you can type <B>set</B> at the command prompt to view the miscellaneous SET parameters. For more information, see your NetWare 4.x server documentation.</P>
<H4><A NAME="sec3"></A>You are asked for a Windows 95 password and a NetWare password at each logon.</H4><P>Client for NetWare Networks asks for a Windows&nbsp;95 password after you log on to the network because the user name and password for your NetWare preferred server differs from your Windows&nbsp;95 password. If you don't want to be prompted for a second password, make the passwords the same for both the NetWare preferred server and Windows&nbsp;95.</P>
<H4><A NAME="sec4"></A>Access to NetWare servers is denied.</H4><P>By default, Client for NetWare Networks uses the credentials provided for preferred server authentication to access other NetWare servers. To see files on NetWare servers for which you have access, synchronize your credentials on all the NetWare servers, using the Novell SETPASS command at the command prompt. </P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
