<h3>Systems Management Agents</H3><P>In addition to System Policy Editor, Windows&nbsp;95 provides support for SNMP agents to query and manage the Registry on the client computer. As a result, you can write in-house system-management software or use software from other vendors for more powerful network management.</P>
<P>For more information, see Chapter 15, "User Profiles and System Policies," and Chapter&nbsp;16, "Remote Administration."</P>
<H4><A NAME="sec0"></A>Tips for the administrator</H4><UL><LI>System policies are a must for any network administrator who wants to manage access rights and permissions for system configuration. System policies are easily enabled and modified at any time. To add support for group policies, or change the default of the central policy file, enable them manually. System Policy Editor is located in the ADMIN\APPTOOLS directory on the Windows&nbsp;95 compact disc.</LI></UL></FONT></BODY></HTML>
