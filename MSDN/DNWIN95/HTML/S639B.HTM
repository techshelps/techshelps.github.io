<h3>Using Network Neighborhood</H3><P>When you use Network Neighborhood, you can access shared resources on a server without having to map a network drive. Browsing and connecting to the resource consists of a single step: clicking an icon. </P>
<P>For information about what happens internally when Network Neighborhood is used to browse multiple networks, see the description of the Multiple Provider Router in Chapter 32, "Windows 95 Network Architecture."</P>
<H4><A NAME="sec0"></A>Using Workgroups in Windows 95</H4><P>On Microsoft networks, computers are logically grouped in workgroups for convenient browsing of network resources. If share-level security is used, each computer in the workgroup maintains its own security system for validating local user logon and access to local resources. </P>
<P>NetWare networks do not use the workgroup concept, so computers running Windows&nbsp;95 with VLM or NETX clients cannot be members of workgroups. However, computers running File and Printer Sharing for NetWare Networks with Workgroup Advertising enabled can appear in workgroups.</P>
<P>To set the workgroup for a computer, click the Identification tab in the Network option in Control Panel and type a name.</P>
<P></P>
<P>For more information about using Network Neighborhood, see online Help.</P>
<H4><A NAME="sec1"></A>To browse a server quickly without mapping a drive</H4><OL><LI>From the Start menu, click Run, and then type the server name. For example:</LI></OL><UL><LI>\\nwsrv1</LI></UL><OL start =2><LI>To browse any shared directory in the window that appears, double-click its icon.</LI><LI>To browse this server's workgroup, press BACKSPACE. This is the equivalent of clicking the Up One Level button on the toolbar.</LI></OL><H4><A NAME="sec2"></A>To create a shortcut on the desktop to a network resource </H4><OL><LI>In Network Neighborhood, find the network resource for which you want to create a shortcut.</LI><LI>Using the right mouse button, drag the icon for that resource onto the desktop.</LI><LI>In the context menu, click Create Shortcut Here.</LI><LI>Double-click the shortcut icon to view the contents of the network directory in a new window. This shortcut is available every time you start Windows&nbsp;95. </LI></OL><P>As the network administrator, you can use system policies to create a custom Network Neighborhood for individuals or multiple users. You can create shortcuts using UNC names for any network connections, including Dial-Up Networking connections, as part of the custom Network Neighborhood provided when using system policies. However, do not place directories in the custom Network Neighborhood. Windows&nbsp;95 does not support this feature, and unpredictable results can occur. In System Policy Editor, enable the policy named Custom Network Neighborhood:</P>
<UL><LI>Use Registry mode to enable this option on a local or a remote computer</LI><LI>Use Policy mode to create or modify a policy file for one or more users</LI></UL><P>You can also set the following system policies to control users' access to built-in Windows 95 browsing features:</P>
<UL><LI>Hide Network Neighborhood, to prevent access to Network Neighborhood</LI><LI>No Entire Network In Network Neighborhood, to prevent access to the Entire Network icon in Network Neighborhood</LI><LI>No Workgroup Contents In Network Neighborhood, to prevent workgroup contents from being displayed in Network Neighborhood</LI></UL><P>For more information about specific policies and about using System Policy Editor, see Chapter 15, "User Profiles and System Policies."</P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
