<h3>Online Help</H3><P>Windows 95 Help is designed to make it easier for users to get the information they need to perform a specific task. Most procedures have moved out of documentation and into online Help, where they're easier to access while you're working.</P>
<P><img src="RK00_18.gif"></P>
<P>Also, Help is streamlined and task-oriented, so it is easier to remember and to use. </P>
<P>Whenever a user wants Help for a task, a Help window appears beside the window where the task is running, or, if no task is running, Help provides a single-click shortcut to the dialog box or feature that the user needs to use to complate the task.</P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
