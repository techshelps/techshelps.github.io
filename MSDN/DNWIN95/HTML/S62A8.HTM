<h3>Installing Windows 95 for Dual Booting with Windows NT</H3><P>You can install Windows&nbsp;95 to dual boot with Windows&nbsp;NT on a computer. This section provides some notes for installing Windows&nbsp;95 with Windows&nbsp;NT.</P>
<P><B>Important</B>   In order to take advantage of the Windows&nbsp;95 dual-boot capabilities, the entry <B>BootMulti=1</B> must be set in the Windows&nbsp;95 version of MSDOS.SYS file in the root directory of your startup drive. For more information, see "MSDOS.SYS: Special Startup Values" earlier in this chapter.</P>

<H4><A NAME="sec0"></A>To install Windows&nbsp;95 to dual boot with Windows&nbsp;NT</H4><OL><LI>Ensure that the computer is configured to dual boot between Windows&nbsp;NT and MS-DOS. Check your Windows&nbsp;NT documentation for details.</LI><LI>Start the computer by using the MS-DOS operating system.</LI><LI>Run Windows&nbsp;95 Setup as described in Chapter 3, "Introduction to Windows 95 Setup."</LI></OL><P>Remember that if your computer has any Windows NT file system (NTFS) partitions, they are not available locally from within Windows&nbsp;95.</P>
<P>If you run MS-DOS from a floppy disk in order to install Windows 95, you will not be able to start Windows NT afterward. You can restore the multi-boot configuration by starting the computer with your Windows NT emergency repair disk and selecting the Repair option.</P>
<P>To run MS-DOS after Windows 95 has been installed, you must select the MS-DOS option from the Windows NT multiboot menu. Then, from the Windows 95 Startup menu, select the Previous Version of MS-DOS option.</P>
<H4><A NAME="sec1"></A>To install Windows&nbsp;NT on a computer where Windows&nbsp;95 is installed</H4><UL><LI>At the command prompt, switch to the directory that contains the Windows&nbsp;NT source files, and then type <B>winnt</B> <B>/w</B></LI></UL><P>The WINNT program is an MS-DOS – based application that creates the Windows NT Setup startup files and copies the system files to the hard disk from the source files. The /<B>w</B> switch allows WINNT to run under Windows. Using this switch also causes Windows NT Setup to skip the CPU detection process and the automatic restart at the end of Setup. You can also include the /<B>b</B> switch to copy the required startup files for Setup so that you do not have to create floppy disks for Setup.</P>
<P>For more information about the Windows&nbsp;NT operating system and about running computers with Windows&nbsp;95 on a Windows&nbsp;NT network, see Chapter 8, "Windows 95 on Microsoft Networks."</P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
