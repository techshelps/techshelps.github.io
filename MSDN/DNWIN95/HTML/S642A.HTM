<h2>Using Windows 95 with NetWare Passwords </H2><P>To log on to a NetWare network, you must type the name of the preferred server on which the related user account is stored. After the user name and password are validated by the network server, you can use resources shared on that server. If you are not validated, you will be prompted to enter a password whenever connecting to a NetWare server during this work session.</P>
<P>The first time you attempt to connect to a NetWare server other than the preferred server, the NetWare server searches the Windows&nbsp;95 password list file for a user name and password to that server. If the user name and password pair are not valid, NetWare displays a dialog box and asks you to type a user name and password. If there is no NetWare user name and password in the password list file, NetWare tries using the Windows&nbsp;95 logon password. You can disable this automatic attempt to log on to NetWare resources.</P>
<H3><A NAME="sec0"></A>To avoid use of automatic NetWare logon</H3><UL><LI>Use system policies to enable the policy named Disable Automatic NetWare Login. For information, see Chapter 15, "User Profiles and System Policies."</LI></UL><H3><A NAME="sec1"></A>To change your password on a NetWare server</H3><OL><LI>At the command prompt, use the <B>net use</B> command to connect to the NetWare server's SYS volume. For example, for a server name NWSVR2, you would type: </LI></OL><UL><LI>net use * \\nwsvr2\sys</LI></UL><OL start=2><LI>At the command prompt, change to the drive for the NetWare server, and then make the PUBLIC directory the current directory. For example, if the drive is mapped to drive N, type:</LI></OL><UL><LI>n: 
<P>Then type:</P></LI><LI>mdcd \public 
<P><B>Note</B>   If you want to change your password on more than one server, connect to all affected servers before running the <B>setpass</B> command. Setpass is a utility provided by Novell and is not part of Windows&nbsp;95. </P></LI></UL><OL start=3><LI>At the command prompt, type: </LI></OL><UL><LI>setpass  
<P>If the server on which you want to change your password is different from the one on the current drive, type <B>setpass </B>and the server name.</P>

<P>For example, to change your password on the server named NWSERVE1, type:</P></LI><LI>setpass nwserve1</LI></UL><OL start=4><LI>When you are prompted, type your old password, then type and confirm the new password.</LI><LI>If you are connected to other NetWare servers that also use your old password, these servers are listed, and you are asked if you want to change your password on these servers also. </LI></OL></FONT></BODY></HTML>
