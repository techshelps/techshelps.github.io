<h3>Setting Up for Automatic Downloading of System Policies</H3><P></P>
<P>By default, Windows&nbsp;95 downloads system policies automatically. However, if you switch to manual downloading, the following procedures describe how to return to automatic downloading. </P>
<P>If you created a .POL file, Windows&nbsp;95 automatically downloads this file from the NETLOGON directory on a Windows NT network or from the PUBLIC directory on a NetWare network.</P>
<H4><A NAME="sec0"></A>To set up for automatic downloading on Windows&nbsp;NT networks</H4><OL><LI>In the Network option in Control Panel, make sure that Client for Microsoft Networks is specified as the Primary Network Logon client, and that the domain is defined.
