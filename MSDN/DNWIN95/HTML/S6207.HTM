<h3>Gathering Information</H3><P>Most information needed to install Windows&nbsp;95 is gathered automatically by Windows&nbsp;95 Setup before you are asked to do anything. The following series of tasks are presented by Windows&nbsp;95 Setup to guide you through providing the information needed to install and configure the new operating system:</P>
<UL><LI>Choosing the Windows directory</LI><LI>Selecting the setup type</LI><LI>Checking disk space for Windows&nbsp;95</LI></UL><H4><A NAME="sec0"></A>Choosing the Windows Directory</H4><P>This option is available for all setup types </P>
<P>If a previous installation of Windows&nbsp;3.1 or Windows for Workgroups 3.x exists, Windows&nbsp;95 asks you to confirm the directory where Windows&nbsp;95 is to be installed. By default, the directory containing the existing Windows installation is selected.</P>
<P>For information about deciding whether to install Windows&nbsp;95 in a new directory, see "Deciding to Run Setup from MS-DOS or Windows" earlier in this chapter.</P>
<H4><A NAME="sec1"></A>To install Windows&nbsp;95 in a new directory</H4><OL><LI>Click the Other Directory option, and then click the Next button.
<P>MSBATCH.INF<BR>[setup] <BR>InstallDir=<I>dirname<BR></I>sets this value and bypasses confirmation</P>

<P><img src="RK03_04.gif"></P></LI><LI>Type a new directory name, and then click the Next button.
<P>MSBATCH.INF<BR>[setup] <BR>InstallDir=<I>dirname<BR></I>bypasses this screen</P>

<P><img src="RK03_05.gif"></P></LI></OL><P>If you choose to install Windows&nbsp;95 in a new directory, you might need to reinstall Windows-based applications because Windows&nbsp;95 uses a different method from Windows&nbsp;3.x for storing configuration information, and because application support files such as DLLs will be missing from the Windows&nbsp;95 directory. Windows&nbsp;95 Setup cannot transfer this information automatically.</P>
<P><B>Note</B>   You cannot migrate system settings and groups under Windows&nbsp;3.1 and Windows for Workgroups 3.x by copying all the .GRP and .INI files into the new installation directory. This does not work with Windows 95, because .GRP files and .INI file entries cannot be used by Windows&nbsp;95 unless Windows&nbsp;95 Setup migrates this information to the Registry. You must run Windows&nbsp;95 Setup and install Windows&nbsp;95 in the existing Windows directory to migrate .GRP and .INI file information from Windows&nbsp;3.x.</P>
<H4><A NAME="sec2"></A>Selecting the Type of Setup</H4><P>Windows&nbsp;95 Setup asks you to select the type of setup you want. For a description of these options, see "Deciding to Use Typical, Portable, Compact, or Custom Setup" earlier in this chapter. By default, the Typical Setup option is selected.</P>
<P>MSBATCH.INF<BR>[setup] <BR>express=1<I><BR></I>bypasses this screen;<BR><BR>InstallType=0, 1, 2, <BR>or 3 selects Compact, Typical, Portable, or Custom, respectively</P>
<P><img src="RK03_03.gif"></P>
<H4><A NAME="sec3"></A>To specify Custom Setup</H4><UL><LI>In the Setup Options screen, click Custom, and then click the Next button.</LI></UL><H4><A NAME="sec4"></A>Checking Disk Space for Windows 95</H4><P>After you select the directory for Windows&nbsp;95, Setup checks the hard disk, prepares the directory, and verifies that there is enough free disk space for Windows&nbsp;95. If there is insufficient space on the destination drive, Windows&nbsp;95 Setup warns you about the lack of space, and displays the minimum and complete installation space requirements.</P>
<P>If Windows&nbsp;95 Setup detects that there is insufficient disk space for a normal upgrade of an existing version of Windows, you can choose to install a compact configuration of Windows&nbsp;95. If you continue even though there is insufficient disk space, the installation might be incomplete. If Setup runs out of disk space, it stops and displays an error message; you must free additional disk space and then run Setup again.</P>
<H4><A NAME="sec5"></A>Providing User Information</H4><P>This option is available for all setup types</P>
<P>The information requested during this part of Setup is required, no matter what setup type you specified.</P>
<P>After completing the disk-space check, Windows&nbsp;95 Setup asks you to type your name and company name. Windows&nbsp;95 uses your name and company name to identify you for various operations. You must type and verify a response for Setup to continue.</P>
<P>MSBATCH.INF<BR>[NameAndOrg] <BR>name=<I>value<BR></I>org=<I>company<BR></I>sets these values;<BR>display=0<BR>bypasses displaying this screen</P>
<P><img src="RK03_07.gif"></P>
<P>Windows&nbsp;95 Setup next requests a product identification number. You must type and verify a response for Setup to continue. The Product ID dialog box might not appear if you are installing Windows&nbsp;95 from the network, depending on the requirements at your site. The product ID number can be found on your Windows&nbsp;95 disks or your Certificate of Authenticity.</P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
