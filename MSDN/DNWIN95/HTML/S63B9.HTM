<h3>Installing Peer Resource Sharing</H3><P>If you use custom setup scripts or choose the Custom option as the Setup Type in Windows&nbsp;95 Setup, you can specify that File and Printer Sharing services be installed with Windows&nbsp;95. Otherwise, you can add the service later by using the Network option in Control Panel.</P>
<P><b>Tip</b></P>
<P>For a computer that will share resources with other users on the networks, choose which File and Printer Sharing service to install based on what other users require:</P>
<P>·   If most users who need to share these resources are running NETX, VLM, or Client for NetWare Networks, then install File and Printer Sharing for NetWare Networks.</P>
<P>·   If most users who need to share these resources are running Client for Microsoft Networks, Windows&nbsp;NT, Windows for Workgroups, or Workgroup Add-on for MS-DOS, then install File and Printer Sharing for Microsoft Networks.</P>
