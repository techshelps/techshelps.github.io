<h3>Running Windows 95 with Windows for Workgroups</H3><P>Windows&nbsp;95 uses the same workgroup model as Windows for Workgroups. Because of this, computers running File and Printer Sharing for Microsoft Networks can be seen by computers running Windows for Workgroups. The Windows&nbsp;95 computers will be favored in Browse Master elections because of the higher version number of the browser software.</P>
<P>A user running Client for Microsoft Networks can access the shared resources on a computer running Windows for Workgroups if both computers are using a common protocol. A user running Windows for Workgroups can connect to the shared resources on a computer running File and Printer Sharing for Microsoft Networks, if both computers are using a common protocol and the user has been granted access to the resources on the computer running Windows&nbsp;95.</P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
