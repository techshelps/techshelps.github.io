<h2>Using Briefcase for File Synchronization</H2><P>If you can use a portable computer and a desktop computer, or you are connected to a network, you must constantly work to keep the files synchronized. Windows&nbsp;95 Briefcase minimizes this task by keeping track of the relationships between files on two or more computers.</P>
<P>With Briefcase, you can do the following:</P>
<UL><LI>Create a Briefcase folder</LI><LI>Add files to Briefcase</LI><LI>Check the status of files in Briefcase and their related files</LI><LI>Update related files, either individually or all at once</LI><LI>Split related files to maintain them separately</LI></UL><P>Windows&nbsp;95 provides a set of OLE interfaces that allow applications to bind reconciliation handlers to it, track the contents of Briefcase, and define the outcome of any reconciliation on a class-by-class basis. For example, when both the file in Briefcase and its synchronized copy outside have changed, Windows&nbsp;95 calls the appropriate reconciliation handler to merge the two files. This could be handy when several users are simultaneously updating one large document.</P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
