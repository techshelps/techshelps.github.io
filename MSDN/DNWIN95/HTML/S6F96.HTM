<h3>Choosing the Network Client</H3><P>Microsoft Client for NetWare does not support the use of NetWare domains or the distributed name server called NetWare Naming Service (NNS). NNS is installed as an add-on product that is supported by NetWare 3.x servers. NNS uses a domain model for NetWare servers by grouping them and distributing the domain's account list to all servers in the domain. Users running NETX or VLM can log on to servers that run NNS, but cannot use NNS tools while running Windows&nbsp;95.</P>
<P>You might choose not to use Client for NetWare Networks in these cases:</P>
<UL><LI>If you want to take advantage of NetWare NCP Packet Signature for enhanced protection of servers and client computers using NCP, then you must use VLM, because Client for NetWare Networks does not support this feature. </LI><LI>If your site needs to use NetWare IP, you should use NETX or VLM. Client for NetWare Networks does not support NetWare IP, and you cannot use Microsoft TCP/IP to communicate with NetWare servers using NetWare IP.</LI><LI>If you use 3270 emulators that rely on DOS-helper TSRs or need 3270 emulation for applications in MS-DOS sessions, you should use NETX or VLM.</LI><LI>If you are using custom VLM components such as PNW or Novell utilities such as NWADMIN or NETADMIN, you should use VLM.</LI><LI>If your site needs to use NetWare Directory Services (NDS), you should use VLM. Microsoft Client for NetWare Networks does not support this feature in the first release of Windows&nbsp;95.</LI></UL><P>Conversely, you might choose not to use the Novell-supplied client and instead use Client for NetWare Networks in these cases:</P>
<UL><LI>If you want the performance advantages of 32-bit, protected-mode network clients and network adapter drivers, including complete Plug and Play support</LI><LI>If you want to take advantage of the Windows&nbsp;95 unified logon and user interface for navigating the network, plus the Windows&nbsp;95 network management tools</LI><LI>If you want to take advantage of long filenames, client-side caching, automatic reconnections, and other performance enhancements provided in Client for NetWare Networks</LI><LI>If you want to take advantage of user profiles to manage desktop configurations</LI><LI>If you want to take advantage of Windows&nbsp;95 peer resource sharing without running another network client</LI></UL></FONT></BODY></HTML>
