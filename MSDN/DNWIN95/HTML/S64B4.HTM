<h2>Setting Graphics Compatibility Options</H2>
<P>In Windows 95, graphics hardware acceleration features can be turned off when system performance indicates incompatibility problems. Specifically, problems can occur when Windows&nbsp;95 assumes a display adapter can support certain functionality that it cannot. In such cases, the side effects might be anything from small irregularities on the screen to system failure. You can disable hardware acceleration features of the display adapter so that the computer can still be used if there is a problem with the display adapter. If changing these settings fixes otherwise unexplained system crashes or performance problems, then the source of the problem is probably the computer's display adapter.</P>
<H3><A NAME="sec0"></A>To change graphics performance settings</H3><OL><LI>In the System option in Control Panel, click the Performance tab, and then click the Graphics button.</LI><LI>Drag the slider to change the hardware acceleration setting, as summarized in the following list. Then click OK.

<UL><LI>The default setting is Full, which turns on all graphics hardware acceleration features available in the display driver. </LI><LI>The first notch from the right can be set to correct mouse pointer display problems. This setting disables hardware cursor support in the display driver by adding <B>SwCursor=1</B> to the [Display] section of SYSTEM.INI.</LI><LI>The second notch from the right can be set to correct certain display errors. This setting prevents some bit block transfers from being performed on the display card and disables memory-mapped I/O for some display drivers. This setting adds <B>SwCursor=1</B> and <B>Mmio=0</B> to the [Display] section of SYSTEM.INI, and <B>SafeMode=1</B> to the [Windows] section of WIN.INI.</LI><LI>The last notch from the right (None) can be set to correct problems if your computer frequently stops responding to input, or has other severe problems. This setting adds <B>SafeMode=2</B> in the [Windows] section of WIN.INI, which removes all driver acceleration support and causes Windows&nbsp;95 to use only the DIB engine rather than bit block transfers for displaying images.
<P>For example, if you receive an error message at system startup stating that an application caused "an invalid page fault in module &lt;unknown&gt;," this indicates a problem between the display driver and the Windows&nbsp;95 DIB engine. In such cases, this setting should correct the problem.</P></LI></UL></LI></OL><P>For more information about the built-in graphics performance features in Windows&nbsp;95, see Chapter 19, "Devices," and Chapter 31, "Windows 95 Architecture."</P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
