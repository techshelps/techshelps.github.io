<h2>General INF File Format</H2><P>An INF file is organized in several sections which define information that Setup and the hardware detection process use to determine the resource needs of the hardware device and to install software for that device. An INF file is organized by hardware, with each class of device described in its own section. Within each device section, the following general organization applies.</P>
<P><B>[Version] section</B></P>
<P>Contains a simple header that identifies the INF and the class of device this INF supports.</P>
<P><B>[Manufacturer] and [<I>Manufacturer Name</I>] sections</B></P>
<P>Lists all the individual manufacturers of the devices identfied in this file and lists all the devices built by that manufacturer. These entries are displayed directly to the user and used to generate the appropriate Registry entries. There must always be at least one manufacturer section. </P>
<P><B>[<I>Install</I>] section</B></P>
<P>Describes the device driver and physical attributes of the hardware device. It also identifies the names of all the [<I>Install</I>] sections that contain information and instructions for installing this device.</P>
<P><B>[ClassInstall] section</B></P>
<P>Defines a new class for this device. Optional.</P>
<P><B>Miscellaneous control section</B></P>
<P>Specifies how a device is handled by the Windows 95 user interface.</P>
<P><B>[Strings] section</B></P>
<P>Defines all localizable strings used in the INF file.</P>
<P>Each section contains one or more entries. The typical entry consists of a key and a value separated by an equal sign. Keys within a section do not have to be unique, but the order of keys may be significant depending on the purpose of the section. An INF file can include comments — any string of text, up to the end of the line, that starts with a semicolon. A comment can start anywhere on a line. For example:</P>
<P><BR></P>
<pre><code>Key=value   ; comment</code></pre>
<P>For complete details about the syntax and use of statements in Windows&nbsp;95 INF files, see the <I>Win32 Software Development Kit for Windows 95 and Windows NT</I>.</P>
