<h3>Installing TCP/IP </H3><P>Connecting the millions of computer networks on the Internet would not be possible without a standard set of protocols. Each Internet standard is described in a document called a request for comment (RFC). TCP/IP is the standard on the Internet because it combines a number of different protocols that make it possible to communicate across interconnected networks that have diverse hardware and operating systems. </P>
<P>To connect to the Internet, you must install TCP/IP. Windows&nbsp;95 will automatically allow (bind) TCP/IP to work with a network adapter or Microsoft Dial-Up adapter. You can install TCP/IP when you run Custom Setup of Windows&nbsp;95, or if you choose a different Setup Type, you can install it after Setup by using the Network option in Control Panel. </P>
<H4><A NAME="sec0"></A>To install TCP/IP</H4><OL><LI>In the Network option in Control Panel, click the Add button.</LI><LI>In the Select Network Component Type dialog box, double-click Protocol. </LI><LI>In the Select Network Protocol dialog box, in the Manufacturers list, click Microsoft and then in the Network Protocols list, click TCP/IP. Click OK.</LI></OL><H4><A NAME="sec1"></A>To verify that TCP/IP is bound to the Microsoft Dial-Up adapter or a network adapter</H4><OL><LI>In the Network option in Control Panel, click the Configuration tab.</LI><LI>In Configuration properties, scroll through the list of network components to see if an arrow to the right of TCP/IP points to the Dial-Up adapter or other network adapter. 
<P>When you install Dial-Up Networking or another network adapter, Windows&nbsp;95 automatically binds TCP/IP to the adapters if TCP/IP has been previously installed. If your computer has multiple network adapters, an entry for TCP/IP is displayed for each one. You must configure each adapter with its own TCP/IP settings. </P></LI></OL></FONT></BODY></HTML>
