<h2>Telephony Drivers from Other Vendors</H2><P>There are several ways to add telephony drivers from other vendors, if necessary. Some telephony drivers work over the network and consist of software only. If this is the case, the software can be installed through the Add/Remove Programs option in Control Panel. </P>
<P>Hardware drivers can be installed through the Add New Hardware option in Control Panel, unless the hardware requires its own class installer. In this case, the hardware should come with a standard Setup program to install it. </P>
<P>You can also use the Telephony Control Panel, available in the <I>Win32 Software Development Kit for Windows 95 and Windows NT</I>, to install telephony drivers from other vendors. </P>
<P><B>Note</B>   If you previously installed the Telephony Control Panel on your Windows 3.1 system, and you upgrade to Windows&nbsp;95, the Windows&nbsp;95 Telephony Control Panel will be installed automatically. </P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
