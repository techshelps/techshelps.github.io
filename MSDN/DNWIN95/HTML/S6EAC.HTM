<P>When deciding where to place Windows&nbsp;95 files, consider how the computer will be used and evaluate the benefits of each placement option. If the computers are personal workstations, portable computers that occasionally connect to the network, or are used in workgroups that only share data and applications such as word processors (not operating system software), then you might want to install Windows&nbsp;95 executable files and applications on the local hard disk and run these locally. Swap files and TEMP files are also located on the local hard disk. The network is used only to store commonly used data. </P>
<P>On the other hand, if you want to run a shared copy of Windows&nbsp;95 to reduce the hardware requirements for the network computers, to allow users to access more than one computer, and to provide a central location for managing users' system configurations, then you would install Windows&nbsp;95 files so that all Windows&nbsp;95 executable files and applications run from the network. All data is saved on the network. Swap files and TEMP directories are placed on network drives.</P>
<P>Support for diskless workstations is available for NetWare networks with the initial release of Windows&nbsp;95. For information about support under Windows&nbsp;NT, contact your Microsoft sales support representative.</P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
