<h3>Running Login Scripts for Push Installations</H3><P>Push installations from login scripts are the same whether you are running a network client with MS-DOS, Windows&nbsp;3.1, or Windows for Workgroups. If you are using an Upgrade account, as described earlier, these are the requirements:</P>
<UL><LI>For computers running Windows for Workgruops, the Upgrade account has been created on the Windows&nbsp;NT domain or NetWare server, with a corresponding Upgrade login script, as described in the previous section.</LI><LI>The Upgrade login script contains these principal entries:

<UL><LI>The <B>net use </B>statements to connect to the appropriate shared directory for the Windows&nbsp;95 source files (or similar statement for starting the network and connecting to the server on a NetWare network).</LI><LI>Statements to start Windows&nbsp;95 Setup. These statements might involve renaming the user's Startup group and copying the alternate Startup group from the server, as described in "Preparing a STARTUP.GRP File" earlier in this chapter.</LI><LI>An <B>exit</B> statement that closes the login script so that Setup can continue.</LI></UL></LI></UL><H4><A NAME="sec0"></A>To run a login script for a push installation </H4><UL><LI>Tell users to log on to the network using the Upgrade user account and the <B>upgrade</B><B> </B>password. 
<P>When a user logs on, the Windows&nbsp;95 installation process begins automatically, using the settings in the MSBATCH.INF file specified in the login script.</P></LI></UL><P>After copying files, Windows&nbsp;95 restarts the computer and begins the Run-Once operations (group conversions, and so on). When the Run-Once operations are finished, Windows&nbsp;95 is completely installed. Notice that this stage requires the user to log on to the network, so all configuration values must be specified in the setup script to support correct logon and to allow Windows&nbsp;95 Setup to connect to shared resources containing Windows&nbsp;95 source files.</P>
<P>When the user quits Windows&nbsp;95 at this point, Setup writes all changes to the Registry. The user can restart the computer and log on using the usual logon name and password.</P>
