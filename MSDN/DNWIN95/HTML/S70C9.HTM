<h3>VL and PCI Devices</H3><P>The Video Electronic Standards Association (VESA) Local (VL) bus standard allows high-speed connections to peripherals. VL bus devices are not totally Plug and Play-compliant, but work similarly to ISA devices. The VL bus is used mostly to support high-performance video cards.</P>
<P>The Peripheral Component Interconnect (PCI) local bus is a standard used in most Pentium&trade; computers and in the Apple&reg; PowerPC&trade; Macintosh&reg; and is likely to be the successor to VL. Windows&nbsp;95 does not reconfigure PCI cards, instead it uses the information that hardware detection derives from the PCI nonvolatile RAM storage to know what resources are used. The PCI bus architecture meets most Plug and Play requirements, and PCI devices use standard mechanisms for identifying themselves and declaring resource requirements. </P>
<P><b>Note</b></P>
<P>PCI is usually a secondary bus. If its primary bus is not Plug and Play-compliant, the PCI bus cannot use Plug and Play functions.</P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
