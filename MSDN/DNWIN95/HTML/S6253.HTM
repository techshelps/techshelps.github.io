<h3>Using BATCH.EXE to Create Setup Scripts</H3><P>Batch Setup (BATCH.EXE) is a Windows-based program that makes it easy to create setup scripts that can be used to automate Windows&nbsp;95 installation. By running Batch Setup and completing the options, you create a file in MSBATCH.INF format that can be used to run Windows 95 Setup with minimal user intervention. </P>
<P>This tool is especially useful when you are testing alternate configurations and need to run Setup repeatedly. Batch Setup can be used to define all options in a setup script; however, unlike Server-based Setup, it cannot be used to install source files or create machine directories for a shared installation.</P>
<P>You can run Batch Setup from the ADMIN\RESKIT\APPTOOLS\BATCH directory on the Windows&nbsp;95 compact disc, or you can copy the files from this directory to your local hard disk. The following summarizes the suggested method for running and using Batch Setup.</P>
<H4><A NAME="sec0"></A>To use Batch Setup (recommended method)</H4><UL><LI>From the Start menu, click Run. Type <B>batch.exe</B> and then complete all the options to create a customized setup script.
<P>For assistance in completing any options, see the online Help for Batch Setup. </P></LI></UL><P>After you create the setup script, you can run Windows&nbsp;95 Setup by specifying the name of the script as a command-line parameter, as described in "Running Custom Setup Scripts" later in this chapter. Depending on how many options you completed in Batch Setup, you might not have to provide any additional input while installing Windows&nbsp;95. </P>
<P>For more information, see the BATCH.HLP and README.TXT files in the BATCH directory. For a description of the parameters in the file created by Batch Setup, see Appendix D, "MSBATCH.INF Parameters." If you want to modify the file that is created, follow the guidelines for editing setup scripts, as described in "Editing MSBATCH.INF for Custom Settings" later in this chapter.</P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
