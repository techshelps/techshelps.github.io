<h3>Setting Properties for MS-DOS - Based Applications</H3>
<P>In Windows&nbsp;95, the properties sheets replace PIF Editor, which was used in earlier versions of Windows to optimize settings for MS-DOS - based applications.</P>
<H4><A NAME="sec0"></A>To view or modify the properties settings for an MS-DOS - based program</H4><OL><LI>Right-click the icon for the program, and then click Properties. (If the program's icon is not on the Windows&nbsp;95 desktop, use Windows Explorer to find the program, then right-click the icon in Windows Explorer.) This displays the properties sheets for the program.</LI><LI>Click the tab you want to use and change the options as appropriate. (See the following section for information about all of these options.)</LI><LI>Do the same for all other options and tabs, and then click OK.</LI></OL><P>MS-DOS - based programs have six properties sheets - General, Program, Font, Memory, Screen, and Misc. </P>
<P>Use the General properties to see information about the type, size, and location of the MS-DOS - based application. From this properties sheet, you can turn on and off the Read Only, Archive, Hidden, and System attributes, which have the same meaning as they do in MS-DOS. </P>
<P><B>Caution</B>   Do not change file attributes unless you are absolutely sure of what you are doing.</P>

<P><BR></P><P>As shown in the preceding table, you can set the path for a specific MS-DOS - based application that runs in MS-DOS Mode in the AUTOEXEC.BAT box. For MS-DOS - based applications that don't run in MS-DOS Mode, you can only set a working directory. You can set a global path for all MS-DOS - based applications by adding a path statement in AUTOEXEC.BAT. You can also write a batch file that sets a path for an MS-DOS - based application; for example:</P>
<P><BR></P>
<pre><code>path=%path%;c:\utils;c:\norton</code></pre>
<P>After you write the batch file, create a shortcut to your MS-DOS - based application, and specify the batch file's path and name in the Batch File field of the Program properties.</P>

<P>From the Font properties, you can specify the font size and type to be used when the MS-DOS - based program runs. From Font properties, you can also preview how the program window and the font will appear.</P>

<P>From the Memory properties, you can define the following memory allocation options:</P>
<UL><LI>Conventional memory, which consists of the first 640K of memory available on your computer. </LI><LI>Expanded memory, which can be installed as an expanded memory card or emulated by an expanded memory manager (EMM). EMM software maps pages of expanded memory onto the system's upper memory area.</LI><LI>Extended memory, which is essentially a seamless upward extension of the original 1-MB address space available in the memory of 80286 and 80386 computers. Extended memory always starts at exactly 1024K, where the upper memory area ends.</LI><LI>MS-DOS protected-mode memory, which Windows&nbsp;95 automatically provides as expanded memory for MS-DOS - based applications that require it to run. It cannot provide this memory, however, if you include a statement in CONFIG.SYS that loads EMM386.EXE with the <B>noems</B> parameter. Use the <B>ram</B> parameter when loading EMM386.EXE in CONFIG.SYS, or use the <B>x=</B><I>mmmm-nnnn</I> statement to allocate enough space in the upper memory area for Windows&nbsp;95 to create an EMS page frame.</LI></UL><P>Using Upper Memory Blocks (UMBs) and High Memory Area (HMA) are two ways to free conventional memory for use by MS-DOS - based applications, and thus improve performance. In conventional memory, UMBs are the unused part of upper memory from 640K to 1 MB, where information can be mapped to free memory below 640K. HMA is the first 64K of extended memory, where drivers can be loaded to free conventional memory.</P>

<P>From the Misc properties, you can specify details about running your program in the foreground and in the background. You can specify whether your program must have exclusive access to the system when it is in the foreground and whether running a screen saver is allowed when the program is active. You can also specify whether the program must be suspended when it is in the background.</P>
<P>In addition, you can specify preferences for mouse, idle sensitivity, Windows hot keys, and other options.</P>
