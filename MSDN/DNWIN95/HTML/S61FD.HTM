<h2>Starting Windows 95 Setup</H2><P>The Windows&nbsp;95 Setup program (SETUP.EXE) is found on the Windows&nbsp;95 installation disks, or it can be stored on a shared network resource. For information about the installation media, see "Options for Windows 95 Installations" earlier in this chapter.</P>
<P>This section describes methods for starting Windows&nbsp;95 Setup on computers that will run Windows&nbsp;95 from the local hard disk after installation. For information about setting up a computer to run a shared copy of Windows&nbsp;95, see Chapter 4, "Server-Based Setup for Windows 95."</P>
<P><B>Caution</B>   Except for TSRs required for partition or hard disk control, network drivers, or device drivers such as CD-ROM, no TSRs or Windows-based applications should be running when you start Windows&nbsp;95 Setup. Close any such applications before continuing with Setup.</P>
<H3><A NAME="sec0"></A>To start Windows&nbsp;95 Setup from Windows&nbsp;3.1 or Windows for Workgroups </H3><OL><LI>Start your computer in the usual way, and run Windows.</LI><LI>If you are installing Windows&nbsp;95 from floppy disks, insert Disk 1 in the drive and make that the active drive in File Manager.

<P>If you are installing Windows&nbsp;95 from CD-ROM, put the compact disc in the drive and make that the active drive.</P>

<OL><LI>Log on to the network, running the existing network client.</LI><LI>Connect to the server that contains the Windows&nbsp;95 distribution files.</LI><LI>At the command prompt, run Windows&nbsp;95 Setup by specifying the batch file that contains the setup script, using this syntax:
<P><B>setup</B> <I>msbatch.inf</I></P>

<P>For example, type <B>setup \\ntserver\win95\mybatch.inf</B> to run Setup using a setup script named MYBATCH.INF that is stored in the WIN95 directory on a server named NTSERVER. For more information, see Chapter 5, "Custom, Automated, and Push Installations."</P></LI></OL><P><B>Note</B>   If Windows&nbsp;95 is installed from a server, the location of that network directory is stored in the Registry. When you add a device or require additional support files to run Windows&nbsp;95, Setup automatically attempts to retrieve the files from that same location on the server. This eliminates the need to maintain a permanent network connection on the computer and makes it easier to modify the configuration of a computer in a networked environment.</P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
