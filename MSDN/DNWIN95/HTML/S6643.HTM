<h2>Setting Up a Modem</H2><P>You can install a new modem in one of three ways:</P>
<UL><LI>Using the Modems option in Control Panel</LI><LI>Running a communications application, which causes Windows&nbsp;95 to prompt you to install a modem</LI><LI>Adding a modem through the Add New Hardware option in Control Panel</LI></UL><P>In all cases, the Install New Modem wizard appears, and asks if you want Windows&nbsp;95 to automatically detect the modem or if you want to manually select a modem from the list of known manufacturers and modem models. If you choose the detection option, the wizard detects and then queries the modem to configure it. If it cannot detect the modem, it prompts you to select one. </P>
<P>When the modem has been selected, you can, if necessary, adjust its properties, such as the volume for the modem speaker, the time to wait for the remote computer to answer the call, and the maximum speed to use. </P>
<P>Depending on the type of modem you have, installing and configuring it might vary slightly as follows: </P>
<UL><LI>If you install an internal legacy (non-Plug and Play) modem adapter, its built-in COM port must be configured by using the Add New Hardware wizard before it is installed by using the Modems option in Control Panel. In most cases, the Install New Modem wizard does this automatically for you. However, on some computers, you might also need to run the Add New Hardware wizard.</LI><LI>If you are using Windows 95 PCMCIA drivers, then Windows 95 will detect and configure PCMCIA modem cards automatically when they are first inserted. Otherwise, you might need to run the Add New Hardware wizard in Control Panel to configure the card's built-in COM port. Then, you should install the PCMCIA modem card by using the Modems option in Control Panel. For more information, see Chapter 19, "Devices."</LI></UL><P><B>Note</B>   Before you install a modem, check the Modems section in the Windows&nbsp;95 README.TXT for possible information.</P>

<H3><A NAME="sec0"></A>To install a new modem by using the Modems option in Control Panel</H3><OL><LI>In Control Panel, double-click the Modems icon. </LI><LI>If no modem is currently installed on your computer, the Install New Modem wizard starts automatically to lead you through the steps for installing a modem. Follow the online instructions.
<P>– Or –</P>

<P>If you are installing a second modem, click Add to start the Install New Modem wizard.</P></LI></OL><P><img src="RK25_08.gif"></P>
<P>In most cases, it's best to let the Install New Modem wizard detect the modem for you. If it cannot detect the exact manufacturer and model, the wizard picks a standard configuration that is usually compatible. Your modem will still function at its maximum speed and according to factory default settings. A few advanced features might be disabled, such as enabling and disabling compression, error control, and flow control. </P>
<P>For information about installing a modem if your modem is not detected or listed, or about finding a better match than the standard modem, see "Troubleshooting Communications Problems" later in this chapter. </P>
<P>Windows&nbsp;95 automatically assigns COM names to communications ports, internal modem adapters, and PCMCIA modem cards according to their base I/O port addresses as described in Chapter 19, "Devices." </P>
