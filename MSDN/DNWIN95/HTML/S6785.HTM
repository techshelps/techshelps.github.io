<h2>Virtual Machine Manager</H2><P>Just as Configuration Manager provides for all resources needed by each device on the computer, another component, Virtual Machine Manager, provides for resources needed for each application and system process running on the computer. Virtual Machine Manager creates and maintains the virtual machine environments in which applications and system processes run. </P>
<P>A <I>virtual machine</I> (VM) is an environment in memory that, from the application's perspective, looks as if it is a separate computer, complete with all of the resources available on the physical computer that an application needs to run. The Virtual Machine Manager provides each application with the system resources it needs. Virtual Machine Manager replaces WIN386.EXE in Windows 3.1.</P>
<P><img src="RK31_12.gif"></P>
<P>Windows&nbsp;95 has a single VM called the System VM, in which all system processes run. In addition, all Win32-based and Win16-based applications run in this VM. Each MS-DOS – based application runs in its own VM. (For information on VMs, see "Core System Components" later in this chapter.)</P>
<P>The Virtual Machine Manager is responsible for three key areas of services: </P>
<UL><LI>Process scheduling</LI><LI>Memory paging</LI><LI>MS-DOS Mode support for MS-DOS – based applications that must have exclusive access to system resources</LI></UL><P>The following sections discuss these three areas of service.</P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
