<h3>Printing Documents </H3><P>In Windows&nbsp;95 you can print documents in two ways.</P>
<H4><A NAME="sec0"></A>To print a document</H4><UL><LI>If the document is open, from the File menu, click Print. 
<P> – Or –</P>

<P>If the document is not open, drag and drop the document onto the printer icon for either a locally installed printer or a network printer. The printer icon can be in the Printers folder or on the desktop.</P></LI></UL><P>With the Microsoft protected-mode network clients and networks from other vendors supporting UNC paths, you no longer need a physical redirection to a network printer in order to print. </P>
<H4><A NAME="sec1"></A>To print a document to a network printer</H4><OL><LI>In Network Neighborhood, double-click a network printer to open its printer queue, or click an icon for a network printer in the Printers Folder.  </LI><LI>Drag and drop a document onto the printer queue or icon. </LI></OL><P>Some 16-bit applications do not work with UNC printer names. If you use a network client that does not support UNC connections, or if you need to have a redirected LPT port to support printing from a particular application, you can still make a connection to a printer by using the appropriate network commands (such as <B>net use lpt1: </B>\\<I>server</I>\<I>printer</I> or <B>capture lpt1:</B>). You can also redirect a port in the Add Printer wizard. </P>
<P><B>Tip</B>   You can quickly locate a printer on a particular server by choosing Run from the Start button, and then typing the server name (for example, \\<B>myserver</B>). You will be logged on to the server and prompted for a password, if needed. Then a Windows Explorer window appears so you can select the printer.</P>
<H4><A NAME="sec2"></A>To view documents waiting to be printed</H4><UL><LI>Double-click the icon for the printer. 
<P>This shows the print queue and the print jobs it contains. </P></LI></UL><P>If you have administrative privileges for the printer, you can use the print queue dialog box to manage the printer queue and print jobs remotely. For example, you can pause and purge printer queues.</P>
<P><B>Tip</B>   You can use WinPopup to receive a message from a printer that a print job is done. For information about how to use WinPopup, see Chapter 12, "Network Technical Discussion."</P>
<H4><A NAME="sec3"></A>To change printer settings</H4><UL><LI>Right-click the printer icon, and then in the context menu, click Properties.
<P>The settings you can change depend on the type of printer you have.</P></LI></UL><P><B>Tip</B>   For easy access to a printer, use the right mouse button to drag the printer's icon from the Printers folder to the desktop, and then click Shortcut on the popup menu that appears. Then you can quickly print a document by dragging the document icon onto the printer icon.</P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
