<h3>Training the Teams</H3><P></P>
<P>By reviewing specific portions of the <I>Windows&nbsp;95 Resource Kit</I>, the Installation and Planning teams can gain an extensive understanding of Windows&nbsp;95 features and functionality. A review of the "Guided Tour for Administrators" and of the chapters contained in Part&nbsp;1, "Deployment Planning Guide," can provide the teams with the information necessary to evaluate product features for system configuration.</P>
<P>Support team members must become familiar with all information in the Resource Kit to prepare for their role in the deployment process. Windows&nbsp;95 TrainCast instructional videotapes are also available from Microsoft (to obtain these, call (800) 597-3200). For more extensive training, team members can receive instruction at a Microsoft Authorized Technical Education Center and participate the Certified Professional program. Call (800) SOLPROV (or (800) 765-7768) for information about authorized training offered for Windows&nbsp;95 and the Certified Professional program, and for referral to a local Microsoft Solution Provider Authorized Technical Education Center (ATEC). </P>
<P></P>
<P>For additional information about Windows&nbsp;95, particularly the background of its design and the history of its development, team members can read <I>Inside Windows&nbsp;95 </I>from Microsoft Press. This book contains guidelines and tips for applications developers working with Windows&nbsp;95.</P>
