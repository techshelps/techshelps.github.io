You can also drag and drop files into Microsoft Exchange, or drag and drop files attached to messages to other drives, folders, or documents on a local or networked computer. To use this OLE functionality, you must be in double-pane view. A button is provided on the Microsoft Exchange client toolbar to switch between single and double-pane view.</P>
