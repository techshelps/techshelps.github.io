<H1>Appendix G HOSTS and LMHOSTS Files for Windows 95</H1><P>This appendix describes how to modify HOSTS and LMHOSTS files to support address-to-name resolution in Windows&nbsp;95 networking.</P>
<UL><LI>The HOSTS file is used as a local Domain Name System (DNS) equivalent to resolve host names to IP addresses. </LI><LI>The LMHOSTS file is used for name resolution when a Windows Internetwork Name Service (WINS) server is not available to resolve NetBIOS computer names to IP addresses. </LI></UL><P>Each of these files is also known as a <I>host table</I>. Sample versions of LMHOSTS (called LMHOSTS.SAM) and HOSTS files are added to the Windows directory when you install Windows&nbsp;95 with TCP/IP support. These files can be edited using any ASCII editor, such as WordPad or Edit.</P>
<P></P>
<P><b>Important</b></P>
<P>To use LMHOSTS or HOSTS files for name resolution, the Enable DNS option must be selected. To do this, use the DNS Configuration tab in TCP/IP properties in the Network option in Control Panel.</P>
