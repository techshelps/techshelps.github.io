For example, if you are searching for a particular document, but aren't sure of its name, you can use Quick View to look at individual documents. When you find the document you're looking for, you can click the File menu in Quick View, and then click Open File For Editing. For more information, see online Help.</P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
