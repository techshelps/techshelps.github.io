<h2>Setting Modem Properties</H2><P>In the Modems option in Control Panel, you can globally change default modem settings for all communications applications and tools created for Windows 95. For example, if you do not want to listen to the modem speaker, you can turn it off for all tools and applications that use that modem. Alternatively, you can adjust these settings within each application. </P>
<P><B>Note</B>   For Windows 3.1 – based or MS-DOS – based applications, you need to configure the modem settings within each application. </P>

Windows&nbsp;95 automatically assigns a port name (COM1, COM2, COM3, or COM4) to any device it detects. Usually, the name is adjusted only if you move an external modem from one COM port to another. For PCMCIA modem cards, the port cannot be changed.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP"><P>Speaker volume</P></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP"><P>Sets the volume for the telephone speaker, which broadcasts the dial tone, modem connection, and voices, if applicable, on the other end. To change the volume, move the slider bar to the right or left. </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP"><P>Maximum speed</P></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP"><P>This is the speed at which Windows&nbsp;95 communicates with the modem. It is limited by the CPU speed of the computer and the speed supported by the communications port. Windows&nbsp;95 selects a conservative default speed so that slower computers do not lose data during transfers. Set the speed lower if the faster rate causes data errors. Set it higher for faster performance if you are using a computer with an 80486 or a Pentium&trade; processor. For example, 57600 may work better than the Windows&nbsp;95 default setting of 38400 for v.32bis (14400 bps) modems on fast computers. If applications report data errors, then set a lower speed (for example, change it from 38400 to 19200 for v.32bis modems). </P></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>

<P><B>Tip</B>   If you have a slower, older computer and an external modem, you can purchase and install a 16550A UART-based COM port adapter to increase speeds. Some internal modems have an integrated 16550A UART adapter.</P>
