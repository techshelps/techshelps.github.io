<h2>Overview of Peer Resource Sharing</H2><P>When a computer is running File and Printer Sharing services, other users running a compatible network client can connect to shared printers, volumes, CD-ROM drives, and directories on that computer by using the standard techniques for connecting the network resources, as described in "Browsing on NetWare Networks" and "Browsing on Microsoft Networks" earlier in this chapter.</P>
<P>Using computers running Windows&nbsp;95 as peer servers allows you to add secure storage space and printing to the network at a low cost. The peer service is based on a 32-bit, protected-mode architecture, which means all the Windows&nbsp;95 benefits for robust, high performance are available. In addition, administrators can take advantage of features provided with Windows&nbsp;95, such as Net Watcher and system policies, to centrally administer peer servers. In addition, user-level security is available as an additional enhancement beyond the peer server capabilities built into Windows for Workgroups.</P>
<P><b>Tip</b></P>
<P>Using Net Watcher, a network administrator can remotely monitor and manage files on any computer running File and Printer Sharing services if remote administration has been enabled for that computer.<B><I> </I></B>Net Watcher allows an administrator to disconnect users, change access rights, and administer the file system on remote computers.<B><I> </I></B>For more information, see Chapter 16, "Remote Administration."</P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
