<h2>Switching from Macintosh to Windows 95 </H2><P>The following section offers tips to Apple Macintosh users who are new to Windows&nbsp;95. </P>
<P><B>How different is the Windows&nbsp;95 desktop?</B></P>
<P>Your drives are not on the desktop but are easily accessible by double-clicking My Computer. Then double-click the drive with contents you want to view.</P>
<P>You can put shortcuts to programs and documents directly on the desktop for easy access. Shortcuts are similar to aliases on the Macintosh. You can remove a shortcut from the desktop by deleting its icons. To create a shortcut, right-click a folder or file, and then choose the Shortcut option.</P>
<P>Deleted files are temporarily moved to the Recycle Bin. You can double-click the Recycle Bin icon to see its contents (and restore any contents). To permanently delete a file or program, open the File menu, and then click Empty Recycle Bin. </P>
<P><B>Why does the mouse have two buttons?</B></P>
<P>Use the left button — the main button — for most tasks unless the right button is specified in a Help procedure. If you click an item using the right button, a menu is displayed containing commands specific to the item.  </P>
<P><B>How do I find documents?</B></P>
<P>Documents are stored in folders. To view the folders on your computer, double-click My Computer, and then double-click a drive. Double-click a folder to see its contents.</P>
<P><B>How do I start a program?</B></P>
<P>All programs are on the Start menu. Click the Start button, point to Programs, point to the program folder, and then click the program name.</P>
<P><B>How can I switch between programs?</B></P>
<P>A program button is added to the taskbar at the bottom of the desktop each time you open a program. The taskbar works in a manner similar to the Apple Macintosh Application menu, but instead of opening a menu, you click the button on the taskbar to switch between programs. You can drag the taskbar to the top or to either side of the desktop.</P>
<P><B>How do I save a document?</B></P>
<P>You can save a document by using the Save command on the File menu. You can save it to any folder on any drive, and change which folder you save it to in the Save dialog box. Here are a few things you need to know when saving documents.</P>
<UL><LI>In Windows&nbsp;95, the hard disk drive and floppy disk drives are identified by a letter. Most hard disk drives are assigned the letter C. Usually, the floppy disk drives are A and B.</LI><LI>A path tells you where the document is located. It contains the drive letter and folder names in which the file is stored. For example, a path could be: C:\JUNE\WORK\SCHEDULE. This tells you that the SCHEDULE document is located on the C drive in a folder named WORK that is in the JUNE folder.</LI></UL><P><B>How do I open a menu?</B></P>
<P>Click once to open the menu, and then click your selection. You no longer need to press and hold the mouse button to keep the menu open. </P>
<P><B>How do filenames differ between systems?</B></P>
<P>In Windows&nbsp;95, you can now use long filenames (up to 256 characters). Each file has a three-character filename extension (<I>filename.ext</I>) to identify the file type (sometimes it also identifies the program that created the file). Filename extensions are not included when documents are listed on the Start menu or displayed in My Computer. </P>
<P><B>What are the three icons in the upper right corner?</B></P>
<P>The three icons in the upper right corner of the desktop window are used as follows:</P>
<P><img src="RKF_01.gif"></P>
<P>Use this icon to reduce the window to a button on the taskbar. Click the taskbar button to open the window again.</P>
<P><img src="RKF_02.gif"></P>
<P>Use this icon to enlarge the window so that it covers the entire desktop (except for the taskbar).</P>
<P><img src="RKF_03.gif"></P>
<P>Use this icon to close the window.</P>
<P><B>Where do I find the items from the Macintosh menu?</B></P>
<P>The following procedures are used to find programs and documents in Windows&nbsp;95:</P>
<UL><LI>Click the Start menu to see most menu items. </LI><LI>Customize system settings by pointing to Settings.</LI><LI>Point to Documents to see a list of the documents you recently opened.</LI><LI>Use Shut Down to exit Windows 95.</LI></UL><P><B>How can I use the Windows online Help to learn more?</B></P>
<P>To view a list of Help topics or search for a topic using the Help index, open Help from the Start menu.</P>
<P>For help on specific items in a window, click the question mark in the upper right corner of the dialog box, and then click the item to find out about it.</P>
