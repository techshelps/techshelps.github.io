<h2>Windows 95 on Other Networks: The Basics</H2><P>Integrated networking support is a key feature of Windows&nbsp;95. The new architecture that supports multiple network providers means that it's easier to install and manage support for a single network or multiple networks simultaneously using Windows&nbsp;95 than in earlier versions of Windows. Windows&nbsp;95 can support configuration on a single computer of as many 32-bit, protected-mode network clients as you want and one 16-bit, real-mode client using the network provider interface of Windows&nbsp;95.</P>
<P>Windows&nbsp;95 includes two protected-mode network clients (Client for Microsoft Networks and Client for NetWare Networks), plus built-in support for several types of 16-bit, real-mode network clients. In most cases, you also need to use supporting software from the network vendors in the following list:</P>
<UL><LI>Artisoft&reg; LANtastic&reg; version 5.0 and later</LI><LI>Banyan&reg; VINES&reg; version 5.52 and later</LI><LI>DEC&trade; PATHWORKS&trade; version 5.0 and later</LI><LI>IBM&reg; OS/2&reg; LAN Server</LI><LI>Novell&reg; NetWare&reg; version 3.11 and later</LI><LI>SunSoft&trade; PC-NFS&reg; version 5.0 and later</LI></UL><H3><A NAME="sec0"></A>Tip for Using Protected-Mode Network Clients from Other Vendors</H3><P>The network provider interface defines a set of APIs used by Windows&nbsp;95 to access the network for actions such as logging on to the server, browsing and connecting to servers, and so on. Microsoft has made this set of APIs widely available to network vendors so that they can develop new protected-mode network providers that are compatible with Windows&nbsp;95.</P>
<P>For example, when a Banyan VINES 32-bit network provider becomes available, then Windows&nbsp;95 can support Microsoft networks, Novell NetWare, and Banyan VINES connectivity at the same time through the Network Neighborhood.</P>
<P>Contact your network vendor to determine when protected-mode software for Windows&nbsp;95 will be available for your network.</P>
<P></P>
<P>Multiple network support in Windows&nbsp;95 consists of these components:</P>
<UL><LI>Win32 WinNet API</LI><LI>Multiple provider router and service provider interface</LI><LI>Network providers, including the WinNet16 interface, as described in "Using Real-Mode WinNet16 Drivers" later in this chapter</LI></UL><P>For information about the system components that provide multiple network support, see Chapter 32, "Windows 95 Network Architecture." For information about networking printing and support for printing when using a 16-bit network client, see Chapter 23, "Printing and Fonts."</P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
