<h2>Dial-Up Networking and Mobile Computing: The Issues</H2><P>To run Dial-Up Networking, the computer must have a protected-mode client, that is, one that can use the Windows&nbsp;95 protected-mode transports, or others that use NDIS and provide appropriate PPP drivers. This means that you cannot use a Novell real-mode client over Dial-Up Networking, but you can use Microsoft Client for NetWare Networks.</P>
<P>To use Dial-Up Networking to connect to the network, you need the following hardware: </P>
<UL><LI>One or more compatible modems as described in Chapter 25, "Modems and Communications Tools."</LI><LI>Enough available hard disk space to install Dial-Up Networking. Currently, about 2 to 3 MB of free disk space is required to install the client and server portions of Dial-Up Networking.</LI></UL><P>To use Dial-Up Networking to connect to the network, you will need to decide the following: </P>
<UL><LI>Which computers on the network will function as Windows&nbsp;95 dial-up servers.</LI><LI>What kind of remote access server, other than a Windows&nbsp;95 dial-up server, remote users will connect to. For example, a Windows&nbsp;95 dial-up server allows only one remote connection at a time, whereas a Windows&nbsp;NT 3.5 remote access server allows 256 connections. Depending on the size and needs of your network, you might configure a Windows&nbsp;95 dial-up client to connect to a Windows&nbsp;NT 3.5 server or other remote access server. For a list of the types of remote access servers that a Windows&nbsp;95 dial-up client can be configured to connect to, see "Dial-Up Clients and Servers" later in this chapter.</LI><LI>What type of connection protocol your dial-up client will use to connect to the remote access server. Windows&nbsp;95 provides support for Point-to-Point protocol (PPP), RAS for Windows for Workgroups 3.11 and Windows NT 3.1, NetWare Connect, and Serial Line Internet Protocol (SLIP). The dial-up client and the remote access server must both be running the same connection protocol. For a complete list of protocol types, see "Connection Protocols" later in this chapter.</LI><LI>What kind of local area network protocol to install on the dial-up client and server to connect the client to the network. Windows&nbsp;95 supports IPX/SPX, Microsoft TCP/IP, and Microsoft NetBEUI protocols. For more information about network protocols and Dial-Up Networking, see "Local Area Network Protocols" later in this chapter.</LI><LI>Whether you want to share the resources of a Windows&nbsp;95 dial-up server. To enable a dial-up client to access files and printing capabilities of a dial-up server, you must install File and Printer Sharing services in the Network option in Control Panel, and also enable Allow Caller Access when configuring either user-level or share-level security on the dial-up server. For more information, see "Configuring a Windows 95 Dial-Up Server" later in this chapter and "Using Security with Dial-Up Networking" later in this chapter.</LI><LI>What level of security you need for dial-up servers. You can enable either user-level or share-level security on a Windows&nbsp;95 dial-up server. Both types of security provide password protection for the dial-up process, but do not support callback authentication. A Windows&nbsp;95 dial-up client does support callback authentication when connected to other types of remote access servers, such as Windows NT Server, that supports callback authentication. For more information, see "Using Security with Dial-Up Networking" later in this chapter.</LI><LI>Whether you need additional security. Windows&nbsp;95 supports hardware security tools from other vendors for dial-up access, plus authentication protocols such as CHAP and SPAP. </LI></UL></FONT></BODY></HTML>
