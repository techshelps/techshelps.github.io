<h3>Using Network Neighborhood on NetWare Networks</H3><P>Network Neighborhood is the primary way you can browse the network. When you open Network Neighborhood on a computer running a NetWare-compatible networking client, all the NetWare bindery-based servers your computer is connected to are displayed. All computers running File and Printer Sharing for NetWare Networks that use Workgroup Advertising also appear in Network Neighborhood.</P>
<P>Clicking the Entire Network icon displays a list of all NetWare servers on the network. This list also contains a list of workgroups that include computers running File and Printer Sharing for NetWare Networks. You can view the contents of any server without having to map a network drive. </P>
<P>If your computer has both Client for Microsoft Networks and Client for NetWare Networks installed, then you will also see a list of computers running Windows for Workgroups, Windows&nbsp;95, and Windows&nbsp;NT. The list of NetWare servers is at the beginning of the list of workgroups or domains in the Entire Network window.</P>
<P>In both the Network Neighborhood and Entire Network views, you can open a server to access its contents without having to map a network drive. You will be asked for security information, if necessary, and you can choose to save your password in the password cache so that you will not have to type it again.</P>
<P>If the computer is running Client for NetWare Networks, drive mappings are limited to the available drive letters. However, Windows&nbsp;95 supports unlimited UNC connections. (If the computer is running NETX or VLM, it is limited to only eight server connections.)</P>
<H4><A NAME="sec0"></A>To connect to a NetWare server in Network Neighborhood</H4><OL><LI>In Network Neighborhood, right-click a NetWare server.</LI><LI>In the context menu, click Attach As. Then type a user name and password, and click OK.
<P><img src="RK11_12.gif"></P></LI><LI>If you want to map a directory on this server, double-click the server icon. Right-click the directory you want to map, and click Map Network Drive in the context menu. Fill in the Map Network Drive dialog box, and click OK.</LI></OL><P><B>Tip</B>   You can also create a shortcut to frequently used resources. For information, see "Using Network Neighborhood." When you double-click a shortcut, you have to supply only a password to connect to it.</P>
<P>The toolbar on every window includes the Map Network Drive button, which you can use to specify the name of a NetWare server and volume (or directory) that you want to map to a drive letter.</P>
<H4><A NAME="sec1"></A>To connect to a directory as the root of the drive</H4><OL><LI>In Network Neighborhood, right-click a directory on a NetWare server. In the context menu, click Map Network Drive.</LI><LI>In the Map Network Drive dialog box, make sure Connect As Root Of The Drive is checked, and then click OK.</LI></OL><P>With this option enabled, if you switch to this mapped directory in a VM windows, you will see the prompt as <I>drive</I>:\&gt; not <I>drive</I>:\<I>directory</I>&gt;). You cannot go further up the directory tree from the command prompt.</P>
<P>The context menu for a NetWare server shows everything you can do with the related server, volume, or directory. To view the context menu, in Network Neighborhood, right-click a NetWare server.</P>
<P>The following table describes the commands available on the context menu. </P>

<P><BR></P><P>If a computer running File and Printer Sharing for NetWare Networks has been configured to allow remote administration, and if you have the authority to administer that server, you can use the administration options in the computer's properties. To do this, in Network Neighborhood, right-click the computer's icon. In the context menu, click Properties, and then click the Tools tab. Use the buttons to run Net Watcher or System Monitor, or to administer the file system. </P>
