<h3>Managing Connections with Client for NetWare Networks</H3><P>Client for NetWare Networks is different from NETX and VLM in that it does not map the first network drive to the logon directory of the preferred server. All subsequent connections to NetWare servers must be made in the Windows&nbsp;95 user interface. </P>
<P>With Client for NetWare Networks, you can manage connections to the NetWare network by using Network Neighborhood and common network-connection dialog boxes such as the Open and Save dialog boxes. (These are the same techniques used for Microsoft networks.) </P>
<P>With Client for NetWare Networks, you can define persistent connections (which use the same drive letter each time the computer starts) to NetWare volumes and directories. Using persistent connections eliminates the need for NetWare MAP commands in login scripts; however, you can still use MAP, ATTACH, and other commands at the command prompt or in login scripts, as described in the following section.</P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
