<h2>The Microsoft Network: The Issues</H2><P>Before installing The Microsoft Network, consider the following issues:</P>
<UL><LI>When users double-click The Microsoft Network icon to sign up for an account, The Microsoft Network automatically dials a toll-free number to download price and billing information. After users fill out the billing information, The Microsoft Network automatically dials a second local number to provide access to services on The Microsoft Network. </LI><LI>If users have problems connecting, first try to resolve them by using the signup troubleshooting information in online Help. One troubleshooting topic tells you how to change the access number for a location
<P>If problems persist with signup, contact The Microsoft Network product support using the telephone numbers in online Help in The Microsoft Network or in <B>msn.hlp </B>in the Windows directory. If problems persist with using The Microsoft Network, post a message in the bulletin board in Member Assistance in The Microsoft Network. </P></LI><LI>Certain types of PBXs restrict users from accessing an outside telephone line or from dialing toll-free numbers, both of which are required to sign up for The Microsoft Network. If the user tries to sign up for The Microsoft Network from such a PBX, the user might see the error message "No carrier detected," or might hear a busy signal or operator message. To correct this problem, you must configure the PBX to allow users to dial toll-free numbers and access an outside line. </LI><LI>If you need to create more than one account with The Microsoft Network on a single computer, you must run Signup for each account. Click Start, click Run, and then type <B>signup.exe </B>to run the Signup utility.</LI><LI>Members should invent secure passwords to protect access to their accounts. They can use the same passwords as their network logon passwords or create a different ones. It is not possible to pass through an electronic mail name and password from the Windows&nbsp;95 Registry. Members who want to can invent a nickname that protects their identities on The Microsoft Network. </LI><LI>If your company decides to become an ICP on The Microsoft Network, you will need to provide a forum manager for your service area. Microsoft provides information about the responsibilities of a forum manager with other information about becoming an ICP. For more information, see "Becoming an Independent Content Provider (ICP)" later in this chapter.</LI></UL></FONT></BODY></HTML>
