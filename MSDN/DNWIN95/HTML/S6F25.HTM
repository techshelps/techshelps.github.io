<h3>Startup and Information Gathering Phase for Windows 95 Setup </H3><P>When you start Windows&nbsp;95 Setup, the following steps occur:</P>
<OL><LI>If you started Windows&nbsp;95 Setup from MS-DOS, Setup searches the local hard disks for previous versions of Windows. If a version of Windows is found, the program prompts you to quit and run Setup from Windows. You can, however, bypass this warning.</LI><LI>Setup runs ScanDisk and performs system checks to confirm that the computer is capable of running Windows&nbsp;95 (enough CPU, memory, and disk space; the correct version of MS-DOS; and so on). If there are insufficient resources, Setup informs you of the problem. For a description of system requirements, see Chapter 3, "Introduction to Windows 95 Setup."</LI><LI>If you started Windows&nbsp;95 Setup from MS-DOS, Setup checks for an extended memory specification (XMS) provider and installs one if one is not present. Windows&nbsp;95 Setup looks for existing disk caching and automatically loads SMARTDrive if no other caching is found. The cache size varies, depending on available XMS memory.</LI><LI>Setup checks for the existence of certain TSR applications and device drivers that are known to cause problems. If any of these applications are running, Setup warns you before proceeding.</LI><LI>If you started Windows&nbsp;95 Setup from MS-DOS, your Setup installs the minimal Windows 3.1 components and starts these components by using the <B>shell=setup.exe</B> command.
<P>The Windows graphical user interface appears. In a normal installation, this is the first thing you see. Up to this point, the processor is operating in real mode. </P></LI><LI>If you started Windows&nbsp;95 Setup from MS-DOS, Setup switches the processor to standard mode and makes extended memory available.</LI></OL><P>Windows&nbsp;95 Setup begins gathering installation information to determine the components to be installed, including the directory for Windows&nbsp;95 files, user information, and specifics about the devices and software to be installed. For more information, see Chapter 3, "Introduction to Windows 95 Setup." </P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
