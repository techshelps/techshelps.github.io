<h3>Correcting Problems with Printer Installation</H3><P>This section describes conditions that may interfere with installing a printer, and explains how to fix them.</P>
<H4><A NAME="sec0"></A>No printers are listed in the Print dialog box.</H4><P>If you cannot select a specific model because no list appears, verify that the printer INF file exists. The PRTUPD.INF file in the Windows INF directory stores the information displayed in the Manufacturer and Model lists.</P>
<H4><A NAME="sec1"></A>Setup is unable to find printer driver files.</H4><P>If the Add Printer wizard cannot find or access the needed printer driver files, it checks the installation drive and directory. If it cannot locate needed files, a dialog box prompts you to specify the path to the required printer driver files. You can either type the location of the printer driver files (installation source directory) or click Browse to search for the drive and directory location.</P>
<H4><A NAME="sec2"></A>File/copy error occurs during printer installation.</H4><P>If an error occurs with a file-copy operation during the installation process, the Add Printer wizard displays the specific error information, including the source and destination paths and filenames it was trying to copy when the error occurred. To continue, verify the location of the specified files, and then retry the installation.</P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
