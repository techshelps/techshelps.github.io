<h3>Updating Files with Briefcase</H3><P>When you update files by using Briefcase, Windows&nbsp;95 automatically replaces unmodified files with modified files. If both files have changed, Windows&nbsp;95 calls the appropriate application (if available) to merge the disparate files. Before you leave the office, you can copy files from your desktop to Briefcase, and then load Briefcase onto your portable computer. When you return, Briefcase will automatically update files when you dock your portable computer if you are using a Plug and Play BIOS docking station. </P>
<P>For information about updating files using Briefcase and a floppy disk, see Windows&nbsp;95 online Help.</P>
<P><b>Tip</b></P>
<P>For faster editing, you can move Briefcase files to a hard disk on a second computer; to do this, drag the files from the floppy disk to the second computer's hard disk. When you have finished editing the files on the desktop computer, choose Update All from Briefcase on the floppy disk. When you return to the original computer, choose Update again to replace the unmodified files on this first computer. </P>
<P>Instead of using a floppy disk with Briefcase, you can use Direct Cable Connection to connect two computers running Windows&nbsp;95, and then use Briefcase to synchronize their files. For example, you can connect your portable computer to your home or office computer with Direct Cable Connection, and then update the desktop computer files to match the portable files. </P>
<P>For more information about Direct Cable Connection, see "Direct Cable Connection" earlier in this chapter.</P>

<P>When you open the Briefcase folder, you can check the status of any file in Briefcase to find out if it has been synchronized with its original. You can also split files from their originals if you decide to maintain them separately. For more information on these topics, see online Help.</P>
<P><B>Tip</B>   To find the copy of a file that is outside Briefcase, click Find Original in the Update Status dialog box. </P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
