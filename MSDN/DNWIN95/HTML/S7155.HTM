<h3>What to Look for in Mixing Capabilities</H3><P>A good multimedia system for either a user or a developer should have mixing capabilities. Look for the following features:</P>
<UL><LI>The mixer should mix input from four sources (WAV, MIDI, Redbook, AUX) and present the output as a stereo, line-level audio signal at the back panel of the computer. Each input should have at least a 3-bit volume control (8 steps) with a logarithmic taper.</LI><LI>Make sure that all sources are within  – 10 dB and without attenuation. This will ensure that the mixer will not clip, meaning that if a sound peaks, the audio clicks instead of playing that sound. It also ensures that the mixer will output between 0 dB and +3 dB.</LI><LI>The preferred system should have individual audio source and master digital volume control registers and extra line-level audio sources.</LI></UL></FONT></BODY></HTML>
