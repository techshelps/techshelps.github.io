<h3>Notifying Users of the Rollout</H3><P>Another step at this stage is informing users about the pilot rollout plan. You can use a videotape presentation, an interoffice memo, or a company meeting as the means for communicating with users about the rollout. But, regardless of the form used, the message must explain to users the benefits of moving to Windows&nbsp;95, and describe the overall plan and process by which each group or department will make the move. This makes it easier for your users to plan for and accept the migration to Windows&nbsp;95 as part of their schedules.</P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
