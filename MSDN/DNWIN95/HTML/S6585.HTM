<h2>Playing and Recording Digital Video</H2><P>Windows&nbsp;95 video services provide the resources for capturing video clips, compressing the content, and controlling playback.</P>
<P>Displaying digital video involves moving and processing huge streams of data continuously and efficiently. In earlier versions of Windows, the process of displaying digital video relied on a series of 16-bit systems — from reading data from the disk, to decompressing the video data, to displaying it on the screen. With the Windows&nbsp;95 32-bit architecture, users can display bigger, smoother, and more colorful digital video than ever before, without adding any hardware.</P>
<P>Windows&nbsp;95 multimedia is fully compatible with 16-bit multimedia titles. Early testing has shown that the 32-bit improvements in file access speed and stream handling result in performance gains for 16-bit multimedia applications and especially for the new generation of 32-bit applications developed for Windows&nbsp;95.</P>
