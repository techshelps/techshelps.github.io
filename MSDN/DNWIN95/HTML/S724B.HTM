<h2>Dial-Up Networking and Mobile Computing: The Basics</H2><P>Dial-Up Networking allows mobile users to work as if they are connected directly to the network. Establishing a network connection by using Dial-Up Networking works the same as establishing a network connection in the office — you just double-click a network resource. </P>
<P><img src="RK28_26.gif"></P>
<P>The Windows&nbsp;95 Dial-Up Networking subsystem allows mobile users to designate a computer running Windows&nbsp;95 as a dial-up client or server. From a remote site, you can use Dial-Up Networking to connect the dial-up client to a Windows&nbsp;95 dial-up server or other remote access servers, such as Shiva&reg; NetModem or LanRover, Novell&reg; NetWare&reg; Connect, and Windows&nbsp;NT version 3.1 or 3.5 Remote Access Server (RAS). If the client and server are running the same network protocols, the dial-up client can connect to the network to access its resources. </P>
<P>Notice that a Microsoft Windows NT Client Access License is required if the computer will be connecting to servers running Windows NT Server. For information, see Chapter 8, "Windows 95 on Microsoft Networks" or contact your Microsoft reseller.</P>
<P><b>Note</b></P>
<P>Dial-up server capabilities are only available if you purchase Microsoft Plus! for Windows&nbsp;95. For information, please contact your Microsoft sales representative. </P>
<P>Windows&nbsp;95 provides the following tools to help users stay as functional as possible with the limited resources of a mobile site. </P>
<P><B>Remote mail.</B></P>
<P>With the Microsoft Exchange client and a Microsoft Mail workgroup postoffice, mobile users can dial in to the network to send and receive electronic mail, without requiring any additional client software or a special gateway server. To send and receive mail, mobile users make a Dial-Up Networking connection to another computer running Windows&nbsp;95 to another remote access server connected to their workgroup postoffice. After connecting, they use Microsoft Exchange to send and receive their mail.</P>
<P><B>Direct Cable Connection.</B></P>
<P>This tool allows you to quickly and easily establish a connection between two computers by using a parallel cable or null-modem serial cable. After the connection is established, Direct Cable Connection facilitates the transfer of files from the host computer to the guest computer. The host can act as a gateway to a IPX/SPX or NetBEUI network for the guest. </P>
<P><B>Windows&nbsp;95 Briefcase.</B></P>
<P>This file synchronization tool minimizes the task of keeping track of the relationships between files on a portable computer and on a desktop computer. With Briefcase, a user can simultaneously update related files. </P>
<P><B>Deferred printing.</B></P>
<P>Windows&nbsp;95 supports deferred printing, which allows mobile users to generate print jobs when they are not connected to a printer. The print jobs are stored until a printer becomes available. Windows&nbsp;95 detects the printer connection and automatically spools the print jobs in the background. </P>
<P><B>Dial-Up tools from other vendors. </B></P>
<P>This chapter describes how to use Dial-Up Networking with Windows&nbsp;NT, Shiva, and NetWare remote access servers. For information about using Windows&nbsp;95 Dial-Up Networking to dial in to other remote access servers, or using other remote access software to dial in to Windows&nbsp;95, contact your network vendor or software supplier. </P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
