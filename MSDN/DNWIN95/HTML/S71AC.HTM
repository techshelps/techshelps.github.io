<h2>Windows 95 Vector Fonts</H2><P>Vector fonts are a set of lines drawn between points, similar to a pen plotter drawing a set of characters. They can be scaled to virtually any size, but generally they are not as clear as raster fonts in the sizes that raster fonts are specifically designed for. </P>
<P>Windows&nbsp;95 provides one vector font, MODERN.FON, for compatibility with earlier applications. It is stored in the Windows SYSTEM\COLOR subdirectory. Although MODERN.FON uses the ANSI character set, it is marked internally as an OEM character set. </P>
<P>Vector fonts are stored as a collection of GDI calls that are time-consuming to generate. However, this font is useful for plotters and other devices with which bitmapped characters cannot be used. Before TrueType, vector fonts were also used in some applications to create large characters or characters that are rotated or distorted from the baseline.</P>
<P>Some applications created for Windows&nbsp;95 automatically use vector fonts at larger sizes. Some applications allow you to specify at what point size you want to use vector fonts. For example, the Vector Above setting in Aldus&reg; PageMaker&reg; specifies the point size at which PageMaker will switch to vector fonts. </P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
