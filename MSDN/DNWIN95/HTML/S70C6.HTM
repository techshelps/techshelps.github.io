<h3>EISA Devices</H3><P>Enhanced Industry Standard Architecture (EISA) is a bus design for x86-based computers, specified by an industry consortium. EISA devices use cards that are upwardly compatible from ISA. EISA devices use standard software mechanisms for identification and configuration. As such, they meet most of the Plug and Play requirements. Windows&nbsp;95 includes a bus enumerator that makes configuration information from these devices accessible to the operating system. This means that Windows&nbsp;95 does not reconfigure EISA cards, but instead uses the information that hardware detection derives from the EISA nonvolatile RAM storage to determine which resources are used.</P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
