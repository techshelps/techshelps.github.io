<h3>Windows Explorer</H3><P>Windows&nbsp;Explorer is a powerful way to navigate The Microsoft Network content tree. A Windows Explorer window in The Microsoft Network contains folders and works the same as any Windows Explorer window in Windows&nbsp;95 except in the following ways:</P>
<UL><LI>The files are read-only. Users can't create, edit, or drag and drop files in Windows Explorer in The Microsoft Network.</LI><LI>Windows Explorer by default does not open a new window for each folder that a user opens because MSN users typically open numerous folders while exploring MSN, which can reduce available system resources. You can change this option to open a separate window for each folder in Folder properties, which can be opened from the Options item in the View menu in Windows Explorer. </LI></UL><P>To use Windows Explorer in The Microsoft Network, right-click a folder or icon, and then click Explore. </P>
<P>In Windows Explorer users can find out the properties of a forum or folder, including the Name, Category, Rating, Go words, and price. A forum manager for The Microsoft Network can decide which properties can function as <I>key words. </I>Key words are a means of tagging content so that users can search for information within the service. </P>
<H4><A NAME="sec0"></A>To view the properties for each forum</H4><UL><LI>Right-click the icon for a forum or folder in it, and then click Properties.</LI></UL><H4><A NAME="sec1"></A>Shortcuts</H4><P>Shortcuts immediately take users to specific areas within The Microsoft Network. Users can drag and drop the shortcut to any Windows&nbsp;95 folder, a word processing file, a bulletin board message, or any other OLE-compatible application. Double-clicking the shortcut will launch The Microsoft Network, log users on, and take users to the service that their shortcut referred to. </P>
<P>For information on creating shortcuts in Windows&nbsp;95, see online Help.</P>
<H4><A NAME="sec2"></A>Favorite Places</H4><P>Favorite Places are similar to shortcuts in Windows&nbsp;95, but are a special feature of The Microsoft Network. Users can use Windows Explorer to add a Favorite Places icon for a folder or forum to the Favorite Places folder in MSN Central. Unlike shortcuts, users can use Favorite Places icons only for services in The Microsoft Network, and can place them only the Favorite Places folder.  </P>
<H4><A NAME="sec3"></A>To add a service to the Favorite Places folder</H4><UL><LI>From The Microsoft Network toolbar, click an icon, and then click the Add to Favorite Places button. 
<P> – Or –</P>

<P>Right-click an icon, and click Add To Favorite Places. </P></LI></UL></FONT></BODY></HTML>
