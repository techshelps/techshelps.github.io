<h3>Selecting the Server</H3><P>In the Server-Based Setup dialog box, the Set Server Install Path box shows the mapped drive or the UNC path for the selected server. </P>
<H4><A NAME="sec0"></A>To define the path where source files will be installed</H4><OL><LI>In the Server-Based Setup dialog box, click Set Path (or Change Path, if a path has already been set).</LI><LI>In the Server Path dialog box, type the drive letter for a mapped drive or the UNC path to the server where you want to install Windows&nbsp;95 source files. Then click OK.
<P>For example, if the server where you want to install the files is named NWSVR1 and the share is WIN95SRC, type:</P></LI></OL><UL><LI>\\nwsvr1\win95src
<P>Notice that you can specify a UNC path for a NetWare server if you are already attached to that server.</P></LI></UL><P>If you specify a subdirectory on the server and that directory does not already exist, Server-based Setup asks if you want to create the directory, and then completes this action if you confirm the message. </P>
<P>If you have insufficient privileges for connecting to or creating a directory on the specified server, a message warns you. You can specify another server, or quit Server-based Setup and log on using an account that has sufficient privileges on the specified server.</P>
<P>When Server-based Setup is set to a new path, it looks for the Registry file (NETSETUP.POL) that it uses to track which computers have been set up. Each time you use Server-based Setup to create a machine directory, an entry is added to this file. No entry is added when a user runs Windows&nbsp;95 Setup from that shared directory.</P>
<P><B>Note</B>   NETSETUP.POL is read only by Server-based Setup to create MSBATCH.INF. You cannot run System Policy Editor to read or modify NETSETUP.POL. Also, you cannot edit MSBATCH.INF using Server-based Setup; you must edit setup scripts using a text editor. </P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
