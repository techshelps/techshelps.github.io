<h3>Changing MS-DOS - Based Application Properties (PIF Files)</H3>
<P>You can set unique properties for individual MS-DOS - based applications. You may want to do this to customize the way an application runs or if the default properties that Windows&nbsp;95 uses do not work correctly.</P>
<P>An application's settings are recorded in its application information file (PIF). Windows&nbsp;95 has no separate PIF Editor. To configure an application, right-click the application's executable file, and then click Properties. Any settings you change in the Properties dialog box are recorded in the PIF file.</P>
<P>When you replace Windows 3.1 with Windows&nbsp;95, PIFs are upgraded to the Windows 95 format. All existing settings should be preserved, but you may want to verify that they have been. </P>
<P>Windows 95 first searches for a PIF in the directory that contains the executable file you are starting. If Windows 95 cannot find a PIF there, it searches the Windows PIF directory. If there is no PIF in the Windows PIF directory, Windows&nbsp;95 searches the path specified in the AUTOEXEC.BAT file. If no PIF is found, Windows&nbsp;95 searches the APPS.INF file for a match.</P>
<P>If Windows 95 does not find an entry for an application in the APPS.INF file, it uses default settings for the application. If you replace Windows 3.1 with Windows&nbsp;95, a _DEFAULT.PIF file remains in the directory. In this case, Windows&nbsp;95 uses information in the _DEFAULT.PIF file to create a PIF for the application. </P>
<P>If you do not have a _DEFAULT.PIF file and want to create one, you can do so by copying the DOSPRMPT.PIF to _DEFAULT.PIF. </P>
<P>Regardless of how the settings for an application are initially established, you can change them by right-clicking the application's executable file, and then clicking Properties. For more information, see the section "Understanding the APPS.INF File" later in this chapter.</P>
<P><b>Note</b></P>
<P>You can run a batch file using that batch file's settings by typing its name directly at the command prompt or in the Run dialog box. To run a batch file using the settings of the command prompt (COMMAND.COM), precede the name of the batch file with <B>command /c</B>; for example, <B>command /c myfile.bat</B>. </P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
