<h2>Windows 95 on Other Networks: The Issues</H2><P>Although you can run any number of 32-bit network clients simultaneously, you can only run a single 16-bit, real-mode network client.</P>
<P>The network software should be installed and running on the workstation when you start Windows&nbsp;95 Setup to install Windows&nbsp;95, so that Setup can detect the network and install support for it automatically.</P>
<P>If your network vendor does not provide a 32-bit, protected-mode client that is compatible with Windows&nbsp;95, and if you don't (or can't) run Client for Microsoft Networks in addition to your other network client, you cannot take advantage of the protected-mode networking features of Windows&nbsp;95. For example:</P>
<UL><LI>You won't gain the performance advantages of 32-bit, protected-mode network components, including Plug and Play networking support, long filenames, client-side caching, automatic reconnections, and other performance enhancements.</LI><LI>You can't use the Windows&nbsp;95 unified logon and user interface for navigating the network, or use the Windows&nbsp;95 network management tools.</LI><LI>You can't use user profiles for management of desktop configurations.</LI></UL><P>Specific issues for particular 16-bit network clients— including whether support for a particular network includes browsing in Network Neighborhood and whether you can also use a 32-bit, protected-mode client such as Client for Microsoft Networks simultaneously with that network — are presented in the section describing that network.</P>
<P>If support for your network's 16-bit client is not included with Windows&nbsp;95, contact your network vendor to obtain a Windows&nbsp;95 INF file.</P>
<P>Support for FTP NFS protocols can be installed by using the Network option in Control Panel. The required components (client, network provider, and so on) must be obtained from FTP.</P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
