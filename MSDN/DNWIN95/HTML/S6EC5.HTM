<h3>Developing the Support Plan</H3><P>Similar to the training plan, the support plan must be ready to go online the first day you begin performing Windows&nbsp;95 installations. Because the quality of support that's available during the pilot rollout will be seen as an indicator of the quality of the rollout as a whole, it is important that you plan carefully to make sure effective support is available.</P>
<P>Staff the Support team for your pilot rollout with some of your best technicians dedicated solely to the pilot group for the first few weeks. The assigned technicians should carry pagers or be available by phone at all times, to give immediate assistance to users. </P>
<P>And, to help users help themselves, add to the Windows&nbsp;95 Help with company-specific information on applications or features. To do this, add an OEM.CNT file in the Windows directory together with your specific Help file. For information about creating Help files, see <I>Win32 Software Development Kit for Windows&nbsp;95 and Windows NT</I>.</P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
