<h2>Installing New Devices</H2>
<P>When you need to install a new device, you should first rely on Windows&nbsp;95 to detect and configure it. For Plug and Play-compliant devices, this means inserting the device into the computer. For legacy devices, this means running the Add New Hardware wizard. </P>
<P><B>Note</B>   Before you install a new device, check the Modems section in the Windows&nbsp;95 README.TXT file for possible information.</P>

If no driver is provided on the system, it asks you to insert a disk that contains a driver that was developed for Windows&nbsp;95. </LI><LI>For PCMCIA cards, after Windows&nbsp;95 identifies and loads the appropriate driver, the computer emits a beeps when the new device is configured.
