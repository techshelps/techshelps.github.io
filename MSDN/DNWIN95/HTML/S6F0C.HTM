<h3>Configuring Shared Installations for Real-Mode Clients</H3><P></P>
<P>All three types of shared installations can be used on computers that run real-mode network clients such as the Novell-supplied NETX or VLM workstation shells.</P>
<P>When a shared installation is created for a real-mode network, the system startup does not include a transition to 32-bit networking. After the initial connection to the network server, the networking software continues to run in real mode. This means that many performance and feature enhancements for Windows&nbsp;95 are not available, but it also ensures that you can create shared installations on networks where 32-bit, protected-mode networking solutions are not yet available.</P>
<P>As for local installation of Windows&nbsp;95, you should make sure that the real-mode networking software is installed and running correctly when you start Windows&nbsp;95 Setup. Then run Windows&nbsp;95 Setup, specifying the machine directory and other information required to create a shared installation.</P>
<P>The configuration settings created for shared installations using real-mode network clients does not include <B>snapshot</B> or <B>net</B> commands. Other configuration issues are described in the following notes.</P>
<P><B>Hard-disk computers with real-mode networking.</B></P>
<P>For computers that start from the hard disk, the configuration and system startup process are similar to that for computers that use protected-mode clients, except there is no transition to protected mode.</P>
<P><B>Floppy-disk computers with real-mode networking.</B></P>
<P>For computers that start from the floppy disk, Setup first asks for the old boot disk for the network, and then copies the information from the root directory on this disk to a temporary directory. Then Setup copies the required Windows&nbsp;95 components to that directory. Finally, Setup copies the directory contents to the new startup disk for Windows&nbsp;95. The startup disk still contains the original real-mode network software. This configuration uses <B>setmdir</B> (in the same way as configurations for protected-mode networking) in AUTOEXEC.BAT to find the correct machine directory, but the path is specified on the command line rather than in a MACHINES.INI file.</P>
<P><B>Remote-boot computers with real-mode networking.</B></P>
<P>This configuration uses <B>setmdir</B> (in the same way as configurations for protected-mode networking) in AUTOEXEC.BAT to find the correct machine directory, but the path is specified on the command line rather than in a MACHINES.INI file.</P>
<P></P>
<P>To prepare for running a remote-boot workstation using a NETX or VLM client with Windows&nbsp;95, you must complete the following additional tasks:</P>
<UL><LI>You must include the entry <B>SaveSuBoot=1</B> in the [Setup] section of the setup script.</LI><LI>You must manually copy the Novell-supplied files to the <I>machine_dir</I>\SUBOOT directory and then run RPLIMAGE again, as described in "Creating the Disk Image for RIPL" later in this chapter. For information about the required files, see your Novell documentation.</LI></UL></FONT></BODY></HTML>
