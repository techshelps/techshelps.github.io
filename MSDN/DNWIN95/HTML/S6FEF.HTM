<h3>Configuring Logon for Client for Microsoft Networks</H3><P>When the computer is configured to use Client for Microsoft Networks as the Primary Network Logon client, you can specify Microsoft Windows&nbsp;NT logon options in the Network option in Control Panel. This section describes how to configure these options. </P>
<P>Network logon automatically validates the user on the specified Windows&nbsp;NT domain during the process of logging on to Windows&nbsp;95. If this option is not configured, the user cannot access most network resources. If this option is configured and the user does not provide a correct password, Windows&nbsp;95 operation might seem normal, but the user will not have access to most network resources.</P>
<P>When you configure network logon options, you can specify whether you want to automatically establish a connection for each persistent connection to a network resource or verify whether to reestablish connections at system startup. You can also specify basic network logon options in custom setup scripts used to install Windows&nbsp;95. </P>
<P>For complete procedures for configuring network logon and persistent connections for Client for Microsoft Networks, see Chapter 8, "Windows 95 on Microsoft Networks." For information about defining network logon options in custom setup scripts, see Chapter 5, "Custom, Automated, and Push Installations." For information about controlling network logon by using system policies, see Chapter 15, "User Profiles and System Policies."</P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
