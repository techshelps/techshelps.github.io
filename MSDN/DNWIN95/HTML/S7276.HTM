<h2>The Microsoft Network: The Basics</H2><P>For anyone with a modem and phone line, The Microsoft Network offers access at any time to the rapidly expanding world of electronic information and communication. With The Microsoft Network, users can conduct business transactions, communicate with individuals and organizations around the world, and find out information on subjects they're interested in — all from the Windows&nbsp;95 desktop. </P>
<P>The following are benefits of signing up and using The Microsoft Network.</P>
<P><B>Minimal setup requirements.</B></P>
<P>A connection to The Microsoft Network is built into Windows&nbsp;95. If users already have a modem and phone line, all they have to do is install The Microsoft Network during or after Setup, and click The icon on the desktop to connect to The Microsoft Network and become a member. After setting up an account, users can connect to The Microsoft Network by clicking its icon. </P>
<P><B>Familiar user interface.</B></P>
<P>With a user interface consistent with Windows&nbsp;95 and a navigational tool similar to the Windows Explorer, users will find it easy to navigate services in The Microsoft Network. Users can create Windows&nbsp;95 shortcuts to specific areas within The Microsoft Network and store those shortcuts on the desktop or any other folder in My Computer. Actions such as downloading files are as simple as using drag and drop to copy the files. And users can open Microsoft Exchange within The Microsoft Network to send and receive mail. </P>
<P><B>Multitasking.</B></P>
<P>The Microsoft Network takes advantage of the multitasking and multithreaded design in Windows&nbsp;95 so that several different tasks in The Microsoft Network can run at the same time. For example, while a file is downloading, users can browse, read electronic mail, participate in a chat room, or do anything else on The Microsoft Network. </P>
<P><B>Worldwide access.</B></P>
<P>Local dial-up access is available to The Microsoft Network in over 40 countries, and The Microsoft Network application will be available in many different languages. In the United States, nearly 100 percent of users can access a network Point of Presence (POP) server; outside of the United States, between 60 percent and 100 percent of users will have access by a local phone call, depending on the country. </P>
<P>In the release with Windows&nbsp;95, The Microsoft Network offers the following features. </P>
