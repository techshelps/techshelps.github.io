<h2>Windows 95 Printing and Fonts: The Basics</H2><P>Windows&nbsp;95 significantly improves the printing and font capabilities of Windows version 3.x by including the following features. </P>
<P><B>32-bit printing subsystem with bidirectional communication.</B></P>
<P>The Windows&nbsp;95 printing subsystem is compatible with the Windows&nbsp;NT printing subsystem, including monitors that facilitate bidirectional communication with printers.</P>
<P><B>Quicker "return to application" time.</B></P>
<P>Background spooling and the use of enhanced metafile (EMF) spooling significantly decreases the time it takes to return control to the application, depending on job content.</P>
<P><B>Better conflict resolution. </B></P>
<P>Spooling from MS-DOS – based applications solves conflicts when multiple applications, or applications based on both MS-DOS and Windows, are trying to print at the same time.</P>
<P><B>Point and Print support.</B></P>
<P>Point and Print support allows users to automatically install a driver for a network printer and print to a network printer. Point and Print support is available for Windows&nbsp;95, Windows&nbsp;NT, and Novell&reg; NetWare&reg; printers.</P>
<P><B>Microsoft Print Services for NetWare.</B></P>
<P>This feature allows you to direct print jobs from a NetWare server to printers attached to computers running Windows&nbsp;95.</P>
<P><B>Image Color Matching.</B></P>
<P>Image Color Matching (ICM) allows applications to better match the color of images displayed on the screen with those generated by an output device.</P>
<P><B>Deferred printing support.</B></P>
<P>Deferred printing allows mobile and other users to generate print jobs when they are not connected to a printer. The print jobs are stored on the computer until a printer becomes available. Windows&nbsp;95 detects the connection and automatically spools the print jobs as a background process. </P>
<P><B>Extended capabilities port.</B></P>
<P>Support for parallel extended capabilities ports (ECP) allows Windows&nbsp;95 to print at high speeds and work with ECP devices. Even if you do not have an ECP device, using an ECP parallel port will improve I/O performance. </P>
<P><B>Greater font flexibility.</B></P>
<P>Because the fonts are stored in the Registry, you can install an unlimited number of TrueType&reg; fonts. In addition, you can print almost 1000 fonts in any document. </P>
<P><B>Support for raster, vector, and TrueType fonts.</B></P>
<P>As with earlier versions of Windows, Windows&nbsp;95 supports raster, vector, and TrueType fonts. </P>
<P><B>Improved font handling.</B></P>
<P>Windows&nbsp;95 handles downloadable soft fonts and font substitutions, and better integrates font handling with the Windows&nbsp;95 user interface, which is optimized for the 32-bit environment. Windows&nbsp;95 also includes an enhanced rasterizer for more accurate rendering and generating of TrueType fonts. </P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
