<h2>Conducting the Pilot Rollout: An Overview</H2><P>The goal of the pilot program is to test your automated installation in everyday use among a limited group of users (for example, between 15 and 50). This process helps to identify problems that may impede or delay the deployment process, and helps to determine what resources you'll require for the final, company-wide rollout. It's important to make the pilot rollout as successful as possible because it sets the tone for the rest of the deployment process. If pilot users are satisfied, their enthusiasm can influence others to cooperate, which in turn helps the rest of the process to move smoothly. </P>
<P>The following checklist outlines the tasks in conducting the pilot rollout. Use the same pilot user group and follow the same tasks when rolling out 32-bit applications.</P>
