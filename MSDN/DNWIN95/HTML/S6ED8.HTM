<h2>Before Starting Windows 95 Setup</H2><P>You should consider the following questions before proceeding with Windows&nbsp;95 Setup on an individual computer:</P>
<P><B>Is the hardware supported?</B></P>
<P>Check the Windows&nbsp;95 README file and SETUP.TXT on the installation disks<I> </I>for any notes related to your computer hardware. If any specific computer component is not supported, Windows&nbsp;95 selects a generic driver or uses the existing driver installed on the computer. If you install support manually for a hardware component that doesn't appear in the installation dialog boxes, select the model that your hardware can emulate or that is of the closest type. (All supported hardware components are listed when you run the Add New Hardware wizard, as described in Chapter 19, "Devices.")</P>
<P><B>Do the computer components meet the minimum requirements?</B></P>
<P>Read "Installation Requirements" earlier in this chapter, and check your computer hardware and software components. Verify that all components meet the minimum requirements.</P>
<P><B>Are all unnecessary TSRs and time-out features disabled?</B></P>
<P>Disable all TSRs and device drivers loaded in CONFIG.SYS or AUTOEXEC.BAT (or in any batch files called from AUTOEXEC.BAT), except those required for partition or hard disk control, network drivers, or any driver required for operation of a device such as video, CD-ROM, and so on.</P>
<P>Some portable computers (such as the IBM ThinkPad&reg;) automatically suspend operation after a specified time-out interval, or when the cover is closed. You should disable this feature while Windows&nbsp;95 Setup is running. </P>
<P><B>Is the installation drive checked and defragmented?</B></P>
<P>Windows&nbsp;95 Setup automatically runs ScanDisk to check the integrity of the drive where Windows&nbsp;95 is to be installed. However, you might want to check and defragment the hard disk drive thoroughly before beginning Setup, using your usual defragmentation software.</P>
<P>Also, be sure to defragment all compressed drives, because a highly fragmented compressed drive reports more available disk space than is available. If you use disk compression software other than DriveSpace or DoubleSpace, be sure to run the disk-checking utility provided with your compression software. For information, see the documentation provided with the compression software. </P>
<P><B>Tip</B>   When you run Windows&nbsp;95 Setup, ScanDisk performs a quick check of the hard disk. You can skip this quick check (for example, if the computer uses disk compression software from another vendor) by using the <B>/iq </B>or <B>/is</B> switch with the <B>setup</B> command, as described in "Using Setup Command-Line Switches" later in this chapter. If you choose to skip automatically running ScanDisk, be sure to use another utility to check the integrity of the hard disk before running Setup.</P>
<P><B>Are all key system files backed up?</B></P>
<P>Any time you upgrade an operating system, backing up critical business or personal data is a prudent precaution. The files you should back up before installing Windows&nbsp;95 include the following:</P>
<UL><LI>All initialization (.INI) files in the Windows directory</LI><LI>All Registry data (.DAT) files in the Windows directory</LI><LI>All password (.PWL) files in the Windows directory</LI><LI>All Program Manager group (.GRP) files in the Windows directory</LI><LI>All critical real-mode drivers specified in CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT</LI><LI>CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT in the root directory</LI><LI>Proprietary network configuration files and login scripts</LI></UL><P><B>Does the networking software work correctly?</B></P>
<P>Make sure that the network software is running correctly before you start Windows&nbsp;95 Setup. Windows&nbsp;95 uses the settings from the existing network configuration to set up the new configuration. Check the Windows&nbsp;95 README file for additional notes related to your networking software.</P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
