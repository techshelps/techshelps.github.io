<h2>Windows 95 Architecture Components</H2><P>Windows&nbsp;95 features a new device driver model, a new file system, a new 32-bit graphics engine, and new 32-bit print, communications, and multimedia subsystems. Windows&nbsp;95 is a 32-bit operating system with built-in connectivity support. It provides high performance, robustness, and complete backward compatibility.</P>
<P>All of these features are supported by the modular design shown in the following diagram.</P>

<P>This chapter describes the key components that make up the Windows&nbsp;95 architecture beginning with its central information store, the Registry, and proceeding from bottom to top. </P>
<H3><A NAME="sec0"></A>Summary of Improvements over Windows 3.1 </H3><P>Although its architectural design is based on Windows version 3.1, Windows&nbsp;95 includes several improvements over the earlier operating system:</P>
<UL><LI>A fully integrated 32-bit, protected-mode operating system, which eliminates the need for a separate copy of MS-DOS.</LI><LI>Preemptive multitasking and multithreading support, which improves system responsiveness and offers smooth background processing.</LI><LI>32-bit installable file systems including VFAT, CDFS, and network redirectors. These support better performance, use of long filenames, and an open architecture to support future growth.</LI><LI>32-bit device drivers, available throughout the system, which deliver improved performance and intelligent memory use.</LI><LI>A complete 32-bit kernel, including memory management and process scheduling and management.</LI><LI>Improved system-wide robustness and cleanup after an application ends or fails. This delivers a more stable and reliable operating environment.</LI><LI>More dynamic environment configuration, which reduces the need for users to adjust their systems.</LI><LI>Improved system capacity, which allows multiple applications and system tasks to run well concurrently.</LI></UL><P></P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
