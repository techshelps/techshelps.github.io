<h3>Developing User Training </H3><P>The first steps in developing a training plan are to acquire a training lab, set up computers in the lab, and appoint a team member as instructor. (If in-house resources are not available, use a vendor to develop and conduct the training.) The instructor will be responsible for creating and testing the training program.</P>
<P>There are a number of training approaches and a variety of tools you can use. A recommended approach is to divide the training into sessions corresponding to three distinct topics: The Basics, Corporate-Specific Applications, and Customization.</P>
<P>The session entitled "The Basics" includes the top 10 functions any user needs to know to accomplish daily work, such as the following:</P>

<P><BR></P><P>The Windows 95 online Help and <I>Introducing Microsoft Windows&nbsp;95</I> supplied with the product disks provide the information you need to train your users in the basics<I>.</I> Schedule training sessions of no more than 30 minutes each; in each session, users receive information that is <I>just enough </I>to be productive using Windows&nbsp;95. </P>
<P></P>
<P>The "Corporate-Specific Applications" session varies by the environment and the types of applications run on the network. This session should focus on the top 5 to 10 functions that will change because of the upgrade to Windows&nbsp;95.</P>
<P>The "Customization" session is intended for more experienced users. The purpose of this session is to provide information and guidance that will help these users learn on their own after the training, and teach them how to work more productively with Windows&nbsp;95. Some of these topics could include:</P>
<UL><LI>Adding items to the Start button</LI><LI>Adding items to the desktop (move, copy, shortcut)</LI><LI>Using options of the right mouse button</LI><LI>Adding a new device (for example, a printer)</LI><LI>Changing the desktop (for example, screen saver settings)</LI></UL><P>After creating and testing the program, schedule training sessions to occur immediately before the rollout so that the instruction is <I>just in time, </I>ensuring that users retain most of what they learn by putting it to use right away.</P>
