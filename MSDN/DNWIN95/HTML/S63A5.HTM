<h3>Designating a Browse Master for Microsoft Networks</H3><P>The Windows&nbsp;95 browse service uses the concept of a master browse server and a backup browse server to maintain the browse list. There is only one master browse server for a given Windows&nbsp;95 workgroup for each protocol used in the workgroup; however, there can be one or more backup browse servers for each protocol for a given workgroup.</P>
<P>The master browse server is responsible for maintaining the master list of workgroups, domains, and computers in a given workgroup. To minimize the network traffic that the master browse server can be subjected to when handling browsing services, backup browse servers can be designated in a workgroup to help off-load some query requests. Usually, there is one browse server for every 15 computers assigned to a given workgroup.</P>
<P>When Windows&nbsp;95 is started on a computer, the computer first checks to see if a master browse server is already present for the given workgroup. If a master browse server does not exist, an election creates a master browse server for the workgroup.</P>
<P>If a master browse server already exists, Windows&nbsp;95 checks the number of computers in the workgroup, and the number of browse servers present. If the number of computers in the workgroup exceeds the defined ratio of browse servers to computers in a workgroup, an additional computer in the workgroup might become a backup browse server.</P>
<P>The Browse Master parameter in the Advanced properties for File and Printer Sharing for Microsoft Networks provides a mechanism for controlling which computers can become browse servers in a workgroup. If this parameter is set to Automatic, the master browse server can designate that computer as a backup browse server when needed, or that computer can be elected as master browse server. For information about configuring this parameter, see "Using File and Printer Sharing for Microsoft Networks" later in this chapter.</P>
<H4><A NAME="sec0"></A>Tip for Using the Net View Command to Check the Browse Server</H4><P>The <B>net view</B> command is a valuable troubleshooting tool if you suspect the browse list maintained by a browse server is incomplete or inaccurate. You can use <B>net view</B> <B>/WORKGROUP</B>: <I>workgroupname</I> at the command prompt to get the list of known computers directly from the master browse server. The request is not handled by a backup browse server.</P>
<P>If the list of computers returned by a master browse server is inaccurate, you could reset this computer by quitting Windows&nbsp;95. Another computer will then be promoted to master browse server for the workgroup.</P>
