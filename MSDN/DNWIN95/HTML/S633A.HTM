<h3>Configuring Network Adapter Drivers for Novell NetWare Clients</H3><P>This section presents some technical information related to the network adapter drivers used when configuring Windows&nbsp;95 to run with Novell-supplied network clients. The topics include configuring Windows&nbsp;95 with ODI drivers, monolithic IPX, or ArcNet network adapters, and setting options in NET.CFG.</P>
<P>NET.CFG, the Novell NetWare configuration file, is an ASCII text file that specifies various settings for the adapter, protocol, and client. For information about the format and contents of NET.CFG, consult your Novell documentation.</P>
<H4><A NAME="sec0"></A>Configuring Windows 95 with ODI Drivers</H4><P>The Open Datalink Interface (ODI) specification was defined by Novell and Apple&reg; Computer to provide a protocol and a consistent API for communicating with a network adapter driver and to support the use of multiple protocols by a network adapter driver. </P>
<P><B>Note</B>   Microsoft recommends that you use ODI drivers when running Windows&nbsp;95 with a Novell-supplied network client. Novell also recommends using ODI-based client software rather than monolithic IPX drivers. </P>
<P><B>Architecture for ODI driver.</B></P>
<P><img src="RK09_15.gif"></P>
<P>ODI consists of the following components.</P>
<P><B>An ODI-compliant version of the IPX/SPX protocol.</B></P>
<P>This component provides the network protocol for communicating between NetWare clients and servers. With NETX or VLM clients, this must be the Novell-supplied IPXODI.COM (you can also use the Microsoft IPX/SPX-compatible protocol for other network clients). </P>
<P><B>The Link Support Layer (LSL).</B></P>
<P>This component, provided in the Novell-supplied LSL.COM file, sets the foundation for network adapter drivers to communicate with multiple protocol drivers, and vice versa.</P>
<P><B>The ODI driver.</B></P>
<P>Also called the Multiple Link Interface Driver (MLID), the ODI-compliant network adapter driver is created by the adapter manufacturer. This component usually identifies the name of the supported adapter in the filename, such as NE2000.COM for the Novell NE-2000 adapter, 3c5x9.COM for the 3Com&reg; EtherLink&reg; III adapter, and EXP16ODI.COM for the Intel&reg; EtherExpress&trade; 16 adapter. Windows&nbsp;95 supports using such drivers, but these drivers are not included with Windows&nbsp;95. </P>
<P>For information about required files, see "Obtaining Current Novell-Supplied Files" later in this chapter.</P>
<H4><A NAME="sec1"></A>Tips for Installing Windows&nbsp;95 with ODI Drivers</H4><P>Before you install Windows&nbsp;95 on a computer, the real-mode IPXODI network should be configured and working properly using your Novell-supplied installation program. Test to confirm that there are no errors when loading the Novell-supplied files LSL.COM, IPXODI.COM, the ODI driver, and NETX.EXE, or when accessing resources on NetWare servers. If these components are running on the computer when Windows&nbsp;95 is installed, Windows&nbsp;95 Setup detects the drivers, identifies the network adapter, and automatically configures Windows&nbsp;95 to run with the ODI drivers.</P>
<P>If Windows&nbsp;95 Setup cannot identify the ODI driver being used, you might have to configure the network adapter driver manually. In this case, click Have Disk in the Select Network Adapter dialog box in the Network option in Control Panel. You must provide a file for the correct IPXODI support driver to match the type of network adapter used, using a file supplied by Novell or the adapter manufacturer. </P>
<P></P>
<H4><A NAME="sec2"></A>Setting Network Adapter Options in NET.CFG</H4><P>Because a computer using ODI drivers can have multiple ODI drivers and multiple protocols loaded and bound, the networking software uses NET.CFG to identify the network adapters, protocol configuration, and binding information. NET.CFG is responsible for configuring the network environment for a Novell-supplied client, and is used to configure custom parameters for NETX, IPX, NetBIOS, or the general NetWare environment. To configure any options, edit NET.CFG as described in your Novell documentation.</P>
<P>Monolithic IPX (IPX.COM) does not require a settings file because there is only one protocol and one network adapter driver bound together in a specific way. The IPX.COM file contains all network adapter configuration information.</P>
<P>NetWare began using SHELL.CFG as the configuration filename with monolithic IPX and is now using NET.CFG for ODI. NET.CFG is the preferred file to use and has some specific uses for ODI. Neither SHELL.CFG nor NET.CFG is required for a NetWare client computer. If these files do not exist, default settings are used. If both SHELL.CFG and NET.CFG exist, both are processed (first SHELL.CFG, then NET.CFG).</P>
<P>If you are using ODI drivers, the Novell-supplied LSL.COM file uses information from NET.CFG to configure the ODI driver before the NETX workstation shell does. For the LSL driver to load and initialize information from NET.CFG, the proper NET.CFG file should reside in the same directory as LSL.COM and the Novell-supplied NETX.EXE network client. To verify that there is not more than one NET.CFG file present on a computer, type <B>dir /s net.cfg</B> at the command prompt (or from the Start button, click Find and search for NET.CFG).</P>
<P>Network adapter configuration information is contained in a <B>Link Driver</B> section in NET.CFG, where you can specify the network adapter's interrupt, I/O address, memory address, frame types, and protocols. For example, the following example shows NET.CFG entries for an SMC&reg; Ethercard Plus Elite 16 adapter:</P>
<P><BR></P>
<pre><code>show dots=on
file handles=60
preferred server=nw_311
link driver smc8000
   int 5
   port 240
   mem d000
   frame ethernet_802.3</code></pre>
<P>The following table describes selected information commonly found in NET.CFG under the <B>Link Driver</B> section. For information not found in NET.CFG, default settings for the network adapter are assumed. For more information, consult your Novell documentation.</P>

<P><BR></P><H4><A NAME="sec3"></A>Configuring Windows 95 for Monolithic IPX</H4><P>Although the monolithic IPX legacy configuration is supported in Windows&nbsp;95, Novell recommends that the ODI client software be used instead of dedicated IPX drivers. Notice particularly the following exceptions for monolithic IPX:</P>
<UL><LI>If you want to install Windows&nbsp;95 with monolithic support, all networking components must be installed and working before you install Windows&nbsp;95. </LI><LI>If you want to use Client for NetWare Networks with ODI drivers, you should first upgrade your Novell-supplied networking software to a recent version of the ODI client software.</LI><LI>You cannot install any Windows&nbsp;95 protected-mode networking components if you are using the IPX monolithic configuration.</LI><LI>You cannot install monolithic support under Windows&nbsp;95 if the workstation has Novell-supplied VLM software installed.</LI></UL><P><b>Caution</b></P>
<P>Microsoft strongly recommends upgrading to 32-bit, protected-mode software for a computer running Windows&nbsp;95 on NetWare networks. </P>
<P>If you must use Windows&nbsp;95 on monolithic IPX, then configure the real-mode monolithic IPX network and verify that it is working properly before installing Windows&nbsp;95. Test to confirm that there are no errors when loading IPX.COM and NETX.EXE or when accessing resources on NetWare servers. </P>
<P><B>Architecture for monolithic IPX.</B></P>
<P><img src="RK09_16.gif"></P>
<P>The monolithic implementation of the IPX protocol, IPX.COM, includes a single driver file that contains both the IPX/SPX protocol stack and the network adapter driver for communicating with the network adapter. IPX.COM must be configured for each computer based on the network adapter and its hardware configuration (IRQ, I/O address, RAM address in the upper memory area, and DMA channel). IPX.COM is generated from the IPX.OBJ file and a particular network adapter driver file (<I>netcard</I>.OBJ) using the NetWare SHGEN or WSGEN programs. </P>
<H4><A NAME="sec4"></A>To add monolithic IPX after Windows 95 is installed</H4><OL><LI>In the Network option in Control Panel, select all installed networking components, and then click Remove.</LI><LI>Click Add, and then double-click Adapter in the Select Network Component Type dialog box.</LI><LI>From the Manufacturers list in the Select Network Adapters dialog box, click Novell. From the Network Adapters list, click Novell IPX Monolithic Driver. Then click OK.</LI><LI>Shut down and restart the computer for the changes to take effect.</LI></OL><P>An entry will appear for Novell IPX Monolithic Driver in the list of installed components in the Network option in Control Panel. For information about required files, see "Obtaining Current Novell-Supplied Files" later in this chapter.</P>
<H4><A NAME="sec5"></A>Configuring Windows 95 with ArcNet Network Adapters</H4><P>Windows&nbsp;95 supports connectivity to Novell NetWare servers and other computers running Windows&nbsp;95 over an ArcNet network. To configure Windows&nbsp;95 to support NetWare over ArcNet, you must use NETX or VLM with real-mode IPX drivers on ArcNet network adapters, with NetBIOS support. This is true whether you are using a monolithic IPX driver or an ODI ArcNet driver. </P>
<P>You cannot use the Windows&nbsp;95 IPX/SPX-compatible protocol or Client for Microsoft Networks with ODI drivers. If you are running Client for Microsoft Networks to connect to other Microsoft networking computers on an ArcNet network, you must also install NDIS 2 network adapter drivers and another protocol used in the network, such as NetBEUI. (Notice that in this configuration, you cannot also access a NetWare network.)</P>
<P>If the ArcNet driver and NetWare workstation shell are running when Windows&nbsp;95 is installed, Windows&nbsp;95 Setup detects the configuration and automatically installs the proper components. However, if the computer is using a generic ArcNet driver or if Windows&nbsp;95 is unable to detect an ArcNet driver, you might have to configure Windows&nbsp;95 manually to run on an ArcNet configuration. You will also need to install the ODI ArcNet Support transport with NetBIOS. If Windows&nbsp;95 Setup can detect the configuration properly, this network protocol is installed automatically for an ODI ArcNet driver.</P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
