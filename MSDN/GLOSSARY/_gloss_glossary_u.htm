<h3><a name="_gloss_unary_operator"></a>unary operator</h3>
<p>
An operator that takes only one operand — for example, the increment (<b>++</b>) operator. See also binary operator, ternary operator.</p>

<h3><a name="_gloss_underflow"></a>underflow</h3>
<p>
Or loss of precision. A condition in which a mathematical calculation produces a result too near to zero to be represented by the range of binary digits available to the computer for holding that value in the specified precision. See also loss of significance.</p>

<h3><a name="_gloss_underhang"></a>underhang</h3>
<p>
The amount of white space between the edge of a character cell and the black part of the glyph. See also ABC width, overhang.</p>

<h3><a name="_gloss_undo_flag"></a>undo flag</h3>
<p>
A value, maintained by the edit control, that indicates whether an application can reverse the most recent operation on the edit control (to undo a text deletion, for example).</p>

<h3><a name="_gloss_unicode"></a>Unicode</h3>
<p>

<h3><a name="_gloss_uniform_resource_identifier"></a>Uniform Resource Identifier</h3>
<p>
A variant of Uniform Resource Locator (URL).</p>

<h3><a name="_gloss_uniform_resource_locator"></a>Uniform Resource Locator</h3>
<p>
The address of a resource on the Internet. URL syntax is in the form <code>protocol://host/localinfo</code>, where <code>protocol</code> specifies the means of fetching the object (such as HTTP or FTP), <code>host</code> specifies the remote location where the object resides, and <code>localinfo</code> is a string (often a file name) passed to the protocol handler at the remote location. Also called Universal Resource Locator, Uniform Resource Identifier (URI).</p>

<h3><a name="_gloss_union"></a>union</h3>
<ol>
<li>
In C/C++, a user-defined data type that can hold values of different types at different times. It is similar to a structure except that all of its members start at the same location in memory. A union variable can contain only one of its members at a time. The size of the union is at least the size of the largest member.<br><br></li>
<li>
The keyword used to define union variables.<br><br></li>
<li>
Two or more objects joined into one.</li>
</ol>

<h3><a name="_gloss_universally_unique_identifier"></a>universally unique identifier</h3>
<p>
Or globally unique identifier (GUID).&nbsp; A 128-bit value that uniquely identifies objects such as OLE servers, interfaces, manager entry-point vectors, and client objects. Universally unique identifiers are used in cross-process communication, such as RPC, and OLE.</p>

<h3><a name="_gloss_unmarshaling"></a>unmarshaling</h3>
<p>
In OLE, the process of unpacking parameters that have been sent across process boundaries.</p>

<h3><a name="_gloss_unresolved_external"></a>unresolved external</h3>
<p>
An error report that results from the linker not being able to identify and link to a data type or function that is used in source code. Unresolved externals usually mean that a DLL or object file was missing during linking.</p>

<h3><a name="_gloss_unsigned_integer"></a>unsigned integer</h3>
<p>
A data type that can only hold a whole number with a value greater than, or equal to, zero. In this implementation, the maximum value that an unsigned integer can hold is 0xFFFFFFFF (4,294,967,295).</p>

<h3><a name="_gloss_update_handler_function"></a>update handler function</h3>
<p>
A function that administers changes made to an object or data file to make it more current.</p>

<h3><a name="_gloss_update_option"></a>update option</h3>
<p>
A choice that is made about when and how a system, object, or data file will be changed to make it more current. For example, OLE linked objects, or items, can be automatically updated whenever possible, when the source document is saved, or only on request from the client application.</p>

<h3><a name="_gloss_update_region"></a>update region</h3>
