<ol>
<li>
In Visual C++, a dynamic-link library that extends the development environment.<br><br></li>
<li>
In Java, a group of classes declared with the <b>package</b> keyword. Classes are generally packaged together when they are related in a significant way. In Java, the default level of data access is at the package level. In C++, the default level of data access is at the class level.</li>
</ol>

<h3><a name="_gloss_packaged_function"></a>packaged function</h3>
<p>
A function created by the compiler when function-level linking is enabled. A packaged function is visible to the linker in the form of a COMDAT record placed in the object (.OBJ) file by the compiler. Functions that are not packaged can be linked only at the object level.</p>

<h3><a name="_gloss_pap"></a>PAP</h3>
<p>
In ISDN, a type of authentication accomplished by sending user ID/password pairs between two devices.</p>

<h3><a name="_gloss_parameter"></a>parameter</h3>
<p>
Or argument. A value or an expression used with an operator or passed to a subprogram (subroutine, procedure, or function). The program then carries out operations using the arguments. Parameters are also used with templates; such parameters can include classes as well as values and expressions.</p>

<h3><a name="_gloss_parameter_data_member"></a>parameter data member</h3>
<p>
In recordsets, a data member that accepts parameter information at run time. Parameter data members can be used in a query to select records from a database based on the value of the parameter obtained or calculated at run time. See also field data member.</p>

<h3><a name="_gloss_parameter_passing"></a>parameter passing</h3>
<p>
The sending of variables as parameters (arguments) to a subroutine, procedure, or function. You can pass parameters by value or by reference. Passing by value copies the variable’s value into the subroutine’s formal argument. Passing by reference copies the variable’s memory address into the subroutine’s formal argument. In C++, parameters may be passed by value or by reference. In C, all parameters are passed by value, except for arrays, which are translated into the address of the first member and reference of type, as in <b>int&amp;</b><i>ri</i>. However, you can force a pass by reference by using pointers or references. In Java, parameter passing is by value only for simple types, by reference only for instances.</p>

<p>
A logically related group of properties that is associated with a persistently stored object. See also persistent property.</p>

<h3><a name="_gloss_property_sheet"></a>property sheet</h3>
<p>
A special kind of dialog box that is generally used to modify the attributes of some external object, such as the current selection in a view. A property sheet has three main parts: the containing dialog box, one or more property pages shown one at a time, and a tab at the top of each page that the user clicks to select that page. An example of a property sheet is the Project Settings dialog box in the Microsoft Visual C++.</p>

<h3><a name="_gloss_proxy_server"></a>proxy server</h3>
<p>
Or firewall. A way to protect your local area network from being accessed by others on the Internet. The proxy server acts as a security barrier between your internal network and the Internet, keeping others on the Internet from accessing confidential information on your internal network.</p>

<h3><a name="_gloss_pseudotarget"></a>pseudotarget</h3>
<p>
In a makefile, a label used in place of a filename in a dependency line. The Microsoft Program Maintenance Utility (NMAKE) interprets the label as a file that does not exist and executes the commands in the dependency line.
