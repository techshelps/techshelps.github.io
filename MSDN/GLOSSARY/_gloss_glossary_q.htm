<h3><a name="_gloss_qualified_name"></a>qualified name</h3>
<p>
In C++, a name used with the binary scope-resolution (<b>::</b>) operator to disambiguate names that are reused within classes, structures, or unions. The name specified after the scope-resolution operator must be a member of the class specified on the left of the operator or a member of its base class(es).</p>

<h3><a name="_gloss_query"></a>query</h3>
<p>
A request for records from a data source. For example, a query can be written that requests, essentially, "all invoices for Joe Smith," where all records in an invoice table with the customer name "Joe Smith" would be selected. See also recordset.</p>

<h3><a name="_gloss_queue"></a>queue</h3>
<p>
A data structure in which elements are added to the end of a list and removed from the head of the list. A priority queue typically removes elements from the list according to some priority value assigned to each element. The system message queue, for example, holds mouse and keyboard input waiting to be processed.</p>
