Bitwise-AND operator. Two ampersands (<b>&amp;&amp;</b>) denote the logical-AND operator. <br><br></li>
<li>
In C++, the reference operator, as in <code>void AddIt(int&amp;x)</code>. This indicates that the address of <i>x</i> is used directly, and changes in value affect the original variable. Java does not allow reference operators. See also parameter passing.<br><br></li>
<li>
In C/C++, the address-of operator, as in <code>pPtr = &amp;nArray[2]</code>. Java does not allow address-of operators.<br><br></li>

<h3><a name="_gloss_..dll"></a>.DLL</h3>
<p>
A file that contains one or more functions that are compiled, linked, and stored separately from the processes that use them. In Win32, the operating system maps the dynamic-link libraries (DLLs) into the address space of a process when the process is starting up or while it is running.
