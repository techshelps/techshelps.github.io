<p>
The first time you build an AppWizard-generated project with Help support, Help project files are built for you. Thereafter, if you change the Help files, you must recompile them just as you would any other project file. As described earlier in this lesson, in <a href="_gs_compiling_your_help_files.htm">Compiling Your Help Files</a>, there are two ways to do this; you can either run a batch file from the command prompt, or compile the Help Project file from within the development environment.</p>
<p>
To compile Scribble’s Help Project file from within the development environment, you must first perform two steps:
<ul type=disc>
<li>
Add Scribble.hpj and the HLP directory to the Scribble project<br><br></li>
<li>
Specify Custom Build settings</li>
</ul>
<p>
Both of these steps are optional: you can compile Scribble’s Help files from the command line without any further customizations. (Note that AppWizard performs these steps for you automatically when you choose the context-sensitive Help option.)</p>
