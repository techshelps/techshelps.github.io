<p>
In Step 5, Scribble changes to <b>MM_LOENGLISH</b> mapping mode, which treats each logical unit as 0.01 inches. In this mode, a stroke that is 100 logical units long is drawn as 1 inch long, no matter which device is used; each device driver determines how many device units are needed to draw a 1-inch stroke. </p>
<p>
Once Scribble uses <b>MM_LOENGLISH</b> mode, all coordinates used for GDI drawing are in hundredths of an inch, not pixels. As a result, the images that Scribble displays on the printer are the same size as the ones it displays on the screen. Recall that in <a href="_gs_add_scrolling_to_scribble.htm">Add Scrolling to Scribble</a>, in Lesson 8, Scribble drawing was defined to be 800 logical units across and 900 logical units high; once you change the mapping mode, a drawing is 8 inches across and 9 inches high.</p>
<p>
Another feature of <b>MM_LOENGLISH</b> mode (as well as the other metric mapping modes) is that its y-axis runs in the opposite direction to that in <b>MM_TEXT</b> mode. In <b>MM_TEXT</b> mode, y-coordinates increase when you move down, but in all the metric mapping modes, y-coordinates increase when you move up. </p>
<p>
After you change the mapping mode, you need to make several adjustments to the existing Scribble code. These changes are described in the procedure <a href="_gs_compensating_for_the_reversal_of_the_y.2d.axis.htm#_gs_to_compensate_for_the_reversal_of_the_y.2d.axis">To compensate for the reversal of the y-axis</a>. For an explanation of the modifications, see <a href="_gs_compensating_for_the_reversal_of_the_y.2d.axis.htm">Compensating for the Reversal of the Y-Axis</a> later in this lesson.</p>
