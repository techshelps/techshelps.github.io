<p>
In this lesson, you’ll learn to use WizardBar to bind commands to message-handler functions. </p>
<p>
When you use WizardBar to create a message-handler function, ClassWizard writes an entry for the command in the chosen class’s message map and adds a function declaration to the class. Also, ClassWizard writes a function template — a complete member function definition with an empty function body — in the source file that contains the class. WizardBar jumps you directly to the text editor to fill in the function template. </p>
<p class=indent>
<B><b>Important</b></B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you delete a command binding with ClassWizard, its message-map entry is deleted, but the message-handler function, and any references to it in your other code, are not deleted. You must delete those items by hand. This is for your safety; the message-handler function code, which you probably wrote, is preserved until you delete it.</p>
