<p>
The following procedure describes how to view the new recordset class, <code>CSectionSet</code>, in the text editor. After examining <code>CSectionSet</code>, you’ll use the text editor to examine the source files for classes <code>CSectionForm</code> and <code>CEnrollDoc</code>.</p>
<p class=label>
<b>To examine the new recordset class</b>
<ol>
<li>
In ClassView, expand Enroll classes by clicking the plus sign next to the icon.<p class=tl>
Examine the set of classes AppWizard created for you automatically to support the Enroll application.</P></li>
<li>
From the list of classes, expand CSectionSet.<p class=tl>
ClassView displays all of the member variables that AppWizard created for you, including a variable for each of the Section table’s columns. You can use ClassWizard to view how AppWizard has bound the Section table’s columns to these member variables.</P></li>
<li>
From the <b>View</b> menu, click <b>ClassWizard</b>.<br><br></li>
<li>
Click the <b>Member Variables</b> tab.<br><br></li>
<li>
In the <b>Class Name</b> box, select CSectionSet.<p class=tl>
What you see in this tab corresponds to the variables displayed in ClassView. AppWizard has bound all of the table’s columns to member variables of the <code>CSectionSet</code> class. These member variables are called “field data members.” AppWizard names the data members automatically, based on the column names from the data source. AppWizard also assigns the correct C++ or class library data type to the data members, based on the column type. In this example, all of the columns are text columns, mapped to type <b>CString</b>, except the Capacity column, which is an <b>int</b>.</P></li>
<li>
Once you’ve finished examining the <code>CSectionSet</code> recordset class, click <b>OK</b> to exit ClassWizard.</li>
</ol>
<p>
The figure below shows what you see in ClassWizard’s Column Names box.</p>

<B><b>Tip</b></B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For this tutorial, you will need all of the column bindings. However, in your own application, if you don’t want all of a table’s columns bound to your recordset, you can delete the recordset field data members for those columns you don’t want; from within ClassWizard, select the data member and click the <b>Delete Variable</b> button. </p>
<p class=indent>
<B><b>Caution</b></B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Don’t delete any fields that are part of the table’s primary key (in this case, the SectionNo and CourseID fields). </p>
<p>
In your own application, if you want to change the name of a field data member, use ClassWizard to delete the member and add it again with the new name.</p>
<p>
In the next procedure, you’ll examine the <code>CSectionForm</code> record view class from inside the text editor.</p>
