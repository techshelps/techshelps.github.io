<p>
The next task is to pass the hint to the document’s <b>UpdateAllViews</b> member function. You must pass a hint each time a stroke is completed. </p>
<p class=label>
<b>To pass the hint after modifying the document</b>
<ul type=disc>
<li>
From ClassView, jump to the <code>OnLButtonUp</code> member function of class <code>CScribbleView</code> and add the following code, just before the <code>ReleaseCapture</code> function call:<pre><code>// Tell the stroke item that we're done adding points to it.
// This is so it can finish computing its bounding rectangle.
m_pStrokeCur-&gt;FinishStroke();&nbsp; 

// Tell the other views that this stroke has been added
// so that they can invalidate this stroke's area in their
// client area.
pDoc-&gt;UpdateAllViews(this, 0L, m_pStrokeCur);
</code></pre>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
The <code>OnLButtonUp</code> member function is called when a stroke is finished, so you call <b>UpdateAllViews</b> from there. In this function, the view gets the hint information that it will send to the document. It does this by calling the <code>FinishStroke</code> member function for <code>m_pStrokeCur</code>; <code>FinishStroke</code> computes the bounding rectangle for the current stroke. Then the view calls <b>UpdateAllViews</b>, passing two arguments: the <b>this</b> pointer, which identifies this view as the one that performed the modification to the document, and <code>m_pStrokeCur</code>, whose bounding rectangle is the hint. (The function sends a pointer to the entire <code>CStroke</code> object rather than just the bounding rectangle because the hint must be a <b>CObject</b> pointer, and <b>CRect</b> isn’t derived from <b>CObject</b>.) The view doesn’t need to send any more hint information, so it passes nothing (0) in the <b>LPARAM</b> parameter.</p>
<p>
The <b>UpdateAllViews</b> function iterates through the list of views attached to the document; for each view (except the one that performed the modification), the function calls its <b>OnUpdate</b> function and passes the hint as a parameter. </p>
