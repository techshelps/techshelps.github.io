<p>
Try Step 2 out now, if you like, by running it from the Samples directory on the distribution CD. (For information about how to do this, see <a href="_gs_previewing_the_sample_applications.htm">Previewing the Sample Applications</a> in Scribble, Lesson 1.) </p>
<p class=indent>
<B><b>Note</b></B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you are running the DaoEnrol tutorial, you will first need to set up the data source. See the section <a href="_gs_setting_up_the_student_registration_data_source.htm">Setting Up the Student Registration Data Source</a> in Enroll, Lesson 1.</p>
<p>
Enroll’s database form now displays a list of course names in the combo box. The other controls are filled from the first Section record for that course name.</p>
<p>
Use the First Record, Next Record, Previous Record, and Last Record commands on the Record menu (or the equivalent toolbar buttons) to move through the different class sections for the same course name. </p>
<p class=indent>
<B><b>Note</b></B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The <code>CSectionForm</code> record view detects the end of a recordset only if the user has moved past it. The user must move beyond the last record before the record view can tell that it must disable any user-interface objects for moving to the next or last record.</p>
<p>
Select a new course name from the Course combo box. The application then requeries the <code>CSectionSet</code> recordset for the new course name. Move through the class sections for the new course name.</p>
<p>
Exit Enroll Step 2 when you finish exploring.</p>
