<p>
The starter files AppWizard creates contain starter code for several C++ classes:
<ul type=disc>
<li>
An application class <br><br></li>
<li>
A document class <br><br></li>
<li>
A view class <br><br></li>
<li>
A frame window class </li>
</ul>
<p>
Details about these files are available in a text file (ReadMe.txt) that is created along with the starter files. </p>
<p>
Without adding a line of code, you can build the starter application you created with AppWizard and run the resulting program, which exhibits much of the standard functionality you expect from a program written for Windows. See <a href="_gs_building_the_starter_application.htm">Building the Starter Application</a> and <a href="_gs_running_the_starter_application.htm">Running the Starter Application</a>, later in this lesson. </p>
<p>
If you’re working along, adding code as you read, follow all directions in this lesson. When you finish, you’ll have a full set of starter files in your own project directory. If you’re reading along without adding any code, work through this lesson to familiarize yourself with AppWizard. </p>
