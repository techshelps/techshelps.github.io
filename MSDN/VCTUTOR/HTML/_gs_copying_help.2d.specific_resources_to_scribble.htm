<p>
In the following procedures, you値l copy menu items, accelerator keys, and status-bar prompt strings from HelpApp (the project you created with AppWizard help support) to Scribble. As you do this, you値l not only learn about adding help to an application after the fact, you値l also learn how easy it is to copy resources from one resource file to another. Finally, you値l add a toolbar button to Scribble痴 toolbar resource, just as you did in Lesson 5, <a href="_gs_constructing_the_user_interface.htm">Constructing the User Interface</a>.</p>

<B><b>Note</b></B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you have not already created HelpApp, refer to the procedure <a href="_gs_the_context.2d.sensitive_help_option.htm#_gs_to_generate_appwizard_application_help_support">To generate AppWizard application help support</a>, earlier in this lesson. This is the first step in implementing help support in Scribble. </p>

In the following procedures, you値l use the menu editor, accelerator editor, string editor, and toolbar editor</p>
