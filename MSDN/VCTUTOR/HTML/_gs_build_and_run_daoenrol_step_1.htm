<p>
Build and run DaoEnrol Step 1. For information on building, see <a href="_gs_build_scribble.2c_.step_1.htm">Build Scribble, Step 1</a> in Scribble Lesson 4.</p>
<p>
When the <code>CSectionSet</code> recordset opens, it selects records from the Section table in the Student Registration database. The first record becomes the “current record” in the recordset. DaoEnrol’s database form displays the controls you designed, now filled with data from the current record. </p>
<p>
Here are some things to try:
<ul type=disc>
<li>
Take a look at the <b>Record</b> menu, which has <b>First Record</b>, <b>Previous Record</b>, <b>Next Record</b>, and <b>Last Record </b>commands. (The toolbar has buttons that correspond to the menu commands.) Try using the commands to scroll through the records in the recordset. <br><br></li>
<li>
Try updating some of the fields. The new values are accepted into the database when you move to another record. As mentioned earlier, the key fields Course and Section are read-only. <p class=atl>
<B><b>Important</b></B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You must have write access to the database in order to update records. You can use Windows Explorer to view the database properties and, if necessary, clear the <b>Read-Only</b> check box.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>
When you finish, exit the program. </p>
<p>
This completes Step 1 of DaoEnrol. To continue with this tutorial, see the next topic, <a href="_gs_completing_the_daoenrol_tutorial.htm">Completing the DaoEnrol Tutorial</a>.</p>
