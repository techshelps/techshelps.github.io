<p>
After you build the starter application, you can run either a Debug or a Release version, so long as you have first built the version of the project you want to run. See the previous topic, <a href="_gs_building_the_starter_application.htm">Building the Starter Application</a>.</p>

<ul type=disc>
<li>
From the <b>Build</b> menu, click <b>Execute Scribble.exe</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p>
When the starter application runs, an MDI application window appears with a default toolbar and a menu bar that contains <b>File</b>, <b>Edit</b>, <b>View</b>, <b>Window</b>, and <b>Help</b> menus. The application window contains one open document window, as shown below.</p>

<b>The Starter Application</b></p>
<p>

<p>
The document window is empty because you’ve added no application-specific code yet. But there is already a great deal of functionality built into Scribble. Try out your new application to see what works and what still needs to be implemented.</p>
<p>
In this lesson, you’ve created, built, and run a starter application that lays the foundation for Scribble and displays much of the standard behavior you expect in an MDI application written for Windows. </p>
