<p>
Documents in Scribble store the lines, or “strokes,” that make up a drawing. Because a drawing is typically made up of many strokes, the document stores a list of all the strokes the user has drawn. The following figure shows a single stroke drawn in a Scribble document’s view.</p>

Documents in Scribble are objects of class <code>CScribbleDoc</code>, which is derived from <b>CDocument</b>. <code>CScribbleDoc</code> has a member variable named <code>m_strokeList</code> for storing a list of strokes and member functions to manage the stroke list. You can view this member variable in the ClassView pane by expanding the icon for class <code>CScribbleDoc</code>.</p>
