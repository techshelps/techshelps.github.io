<p>
Build and run Enroll Step 1. For information on building, see <a href="_gs_building_the_starter_application.htm">Building the Starter Application</a> in Scribble Lesson 2.</p>
<p>
When the <code>CSectionSet</code> recordset opens, it selects records from the Section table in the Student Registration database. The first record becomes the “current record” in the recordset. Enroll’s database form displays the controls you designed, now filled with data from the current record. </p>
<p>
Try a few things:
<ul type=disc>
<li>
Take a look at the <b>Record</b> menu, which has <b>First Record</b>, <b>Previous Record</b>, <b>Next Record</b>, and <b>Last Record</b> commands. (The toolbar has buttons that correspond to the menu commands.) Try using the commands to scroll through the records in the recordset. <br><br></li>
<li>
Update some of the fields. The new values are accepted into the data source when you move to another record. As mentioned earlier, the key fields Course and Section are read-only.<p class=atl>
<B><b>Note</b></B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to make changes to the fields, you must have write access to the data source.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>
This completes Step 1 of the database tutorial. In the next lesson, you will learn how to add a second recordset and use it to fill a combo box control on the form.</p>
