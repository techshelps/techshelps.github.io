The Project Workspace has three views with which to examine and manipulate the contents of your project files:
<ul type=disc>
<li>
Use ClassView to jump quickly into existing code. Without having to think about which file to open, you can jump to existing class definitions, member function declarations and definitions, and member variable definitions.<br><br></li>
<li>
Use ResourceView to create, open, examine, and manipulate your project’s resources, including the accelerator table, cursor, dialog boxes, icons, menus, toolbars, and the string table.<br><br></li>
<li>
Use FileView to open a file that you can’t jump to directly. FileView lets you edit a file without going through a menu.</li>
</ul>
