<p>
Before you work through the steps of implementing Container, you might want to try out the completed application. This will help you appreciate OLE container functionality from a user’s point of view.</p>
<p>
Other example container applications are provided on the Visual C++ distribution CD-ROM. Some of these samples were written using MFC, and others were written using the SDK. You can easily install the files needed to build and examine these sample applications.</p>
<p>
Finally, the best examples are those world-class applications that support OLE and ActiveX today. These are the applications you will ultimately want to test your application against.</p>
