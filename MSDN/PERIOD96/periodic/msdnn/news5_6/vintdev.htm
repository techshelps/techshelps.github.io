<p><b>A new integrated environment for Web application development</b></p>
<p>
Gregory Leake</p>
<p>
<i>Gregory Leake is a product manager in Microsoft’s Internet Platform and Tools Division, and is thinking of changing his name.</i></p>
<p>
The Web’s evolution from a document-publishing platform to a platform for networked-applications has introduced a variety of development issues—including integration of client-side components and server-side processing, such as database connectivity, to create dynamic Web applications. However, because the underlying technology for Web applications is fundamentally different from traditional client-server technology, developers of Internet and intranet sites are not finding integrated Web application development tools. </p>
<p>
To meet the needs of Web application developers, Microsoft is introducing a system codenamed “Internet Studio” (now called Visual InterDev), an integrated development system for building dynamic Web applications for corporate intranets and the Internet.</p>
<p>
<p><img src="visualfig1.gif"></p>
<b>Figure 1.  The integrated development environment in Visual InterDev enables developers to have Visual C++, Visual J++, and Visual InterDev projects open simultaneously within a single workspace.</b></p>
<p>
A new member of the Microsoft visual tools family, Visual InterDev was designed from the ground up for developing HTML-based Web applications. It features the same easy-to-use Developer Studio Integrated Development Environment (IDE) as Microsoft Visual C++ and Visual J++ and fully interoperates with Microsoft FrontPage 97, enabling teams of developers and nonprogrammers to work together on Web sites.</p>
<p>
Visual InterDev consists of the following core components:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Integrated visual tools</b> presented within a single IDE.<p>
</li>
<li>
<b>Robust development support</b> using client-side scripting in Visual Basic Scripting Edition (VBScript) and JavaScript, ActiveX controls, Java applets, and server-side components and scripting via Microsoft Active Server Pages.<p>
</li>
<li>
<b>Database connectivity</b> for scalable Internet- and intranet-based access to any database supporting Open Database Connectivity (ODBC), including Microsoft SQL Server, Oracle, Sybase, and IBM DB/2, as well as desktop databases such as Microsoft Access, Microsoft Visual FoxPro, and Borland dBASE.<p>
</li>
<li>
<b>Web site management</b> compatible with Microsoft FrontPage 97, including a unique site-visualization tool for site management tasks.</li>
</ul>
<p><font size=4><b>Active Server Pages and Database Connectivity</b></font></p>
<p>
Visual InterDev leverages a Web application development framework known as Active Server Pages. A new feature for the Microsoft Internet Information Server, Active Server Pages enable server-side scripting to be embedded in Web pages (native support is provided for both VBScript and JavaScript, and compatible third-party scripting engines can also be used).</p>
<p>
Visual InterDev employs the new Active Data Object (ADO), an ActiveX server component that provides scalable, Web-based data access to any ODBC datasource. Visual tools such as Data View and Query Designer automatically generate much of the server-side script required to display database information or to process data-bound HTML forms. For users of Microsoft SQL Server, Visual InterDev includes an advanced Database Designer—a sophisticated graphical administration and management tool for SQL Server databases—integrated directly within the IDE.</p>
<p><font size=4><b>Design-time ActiveX Controls</b></font></p>
<p>
Design-time ActiveX controls provide the same benefits of component software as standard ActiveX controls—such as plug-and-play functionality and visual editing at design time. Unlike standard controls, this new class has no run-time component; instead, it generates HTML-based content and scripting that is viewable on any platform by any browser. Design-time ActiveX controls can also serve as visual helper components, automatically generating server-side or client-side scripting. Visual InterDev includes several integrated design-time ActiveX controls, which provide easy-to-use, visual mechanisms for constructing complex database connectivity logic within a Web site—with the control doing the hard work of generating the HTML and scripting necessary for the run-time processing of the application.</p>
<p>
Microsoft plans to supply a growing set of design-time ActiveX controls on the Visual InterDev Web site. In addition, we expect that independent software vendors will soon provide hundreds of design-time ActiveX controls compatible with Visual InterDev, which also supports standard ActiveX controls.</p>
<p><font size=4><b>Availability</b></font></p>
<p>
A beta version of Visual InterDev will be available for free download from the Microsoft <i>Site Builder Workshop</i> Web site soon. Commercial release is targeted for the first quarter of 1997. For more information, stay tuned to <b>http://www.microsoft.com/workshop</b>.</p>
