<h2><font size="2" face="verdana,arial,helvetica">Dear Dr. GUI:</font></h2>

<p><font size="2" face="verdana,arial,helvetica">We are developing a
Windows 95-based application using MFC30.DLL and would like to
not have to ship the MFC30.DLL if possible. MFC30.DLL always
seems to be installed with Windows 95. Is this true, and can we
count on it always being true? </font></p>

<h2><font size="2" face="verdana,arial,helvetica">Dr. GUI replies:</font></h2>

<p><font size="2" face="verdana,arial,helvetica">Absolutes scare me. If I
don't have food poisoning today, does that mean I will never have
it? If I am happy today, will I always be happy? If I missed that
deer in the road, will I always miss deer in the road? If I quit
saying these silly things, will I never say another silly thing? </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="verdana,arial,helvetica">Our very own Microsoft
Foundation Class Library (MFC) guru seems to have problems with
absolutes as well. The bottom line is no, you cannot count on
MFC30.DLL (or future versions such as MFC40.DLL, in my opinion)
being there. The supporting rationale behind this is as follows: </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="verdana,arial,helvetica">· MFC30.DLL is not
installed if you don't install applications that use it. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="verdana,arial,helvetica">· MFC30.DLL does not
exist on Windows NT 3.51. To qualify for the Windows 95 logo,
your application needs to work on Windows NT. Thus you need to
ship the DLL. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="verdana,arial,helvetica">· You must ship all the
MFC DLLs as a set. Otherwise you run the chance of breaking an
application that has already been installed. This means that
MFC30.DLL, MFCO30.DLL, MFCD30.DLL, and MFCN30.DLL need to be
shipped and installed.</font></p>
