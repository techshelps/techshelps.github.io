<p><font color="#000000" size="5" face="verdana,arial,helvetica">&quot;Activate
the Internet?&quot; What's that mean?</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="2" face="verdana,arial,helvetica">Since
the Internet uses quite a collection of technologies, there are
lots of ways to make use of the Internet from your applications. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="2" face="verdana,arial,helvetica">First,
some considerations. Always remember that, unless you're writing
apps that will only be used on internal &quot;intranets,&quot;
most users connect at 28.8 Kbps or less. You'll want to take
pains to make sure that the data and code you send to your users
is as small as possible. Doing so will greatly reduce the pain
for your users.) </font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="2" face="verdana,arial,helvetica">Dr.
GUI recommends making your app an ActiveX document, ActiveX
control, or both. If it's an ActiveX document, users will be able
to browse in-place and edit your documents using Web browsers,
the Nashville Explorer shell, and any other ActiveX document
container, such as the Microsoft Binder. When people start using
Nashville later this year, apps that aren't ActiveX documents
will look old&#151;rather like Win 3.1 apps look today. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="2" face="verdana,arial,helvetica">If
your app is an ActiveX control, users will be able to embed it in
Web pages or in any ActiveX control container, such as Visual
Basic, Visual C++, Visual FoxPro, or Microsoft Access. This will
make your app very usable. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="2" face="verdana,arial,helvetica">There
are other ways to take advantage of the Internet. It's possible
to integrate Web browsing capabilities into your app&#151;as
TurboTax does&#151;but even tighter integration is possible with
ActiveX. Available technologies (and more are coming) allow
client/server apps to communicate over the Internet. </font></p>

<h3><font color="#000000" size="2" face="verdana,arial,helvetica">Plug-ins,
Java applets, ActiveX controls, or ActiveX documents?</font></h3>

<p><font color="#000000" size="2" face="verdana,arial,helvetica">There
are four basic technologies for providing active components for
the Internet: Netscape Plug-ins, Java applets, ActiveX controls,
and ActiveX documents. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="2" face="verdana,arial,helvetica">Netscape
claims that you can convert your application to a plug-in in as
little as thirty minutes. All you have to do is remove menus and
so forth and change all the memory allocation calls to call
Navigator's allocator rather than <b>malloc</b>, <b>new</b>, <b>LocalAlloc</b>,
or <b>GlobalAlloc</b>. (To be fair, they don't require that you
use their memory allocator, but they do recommend it.) Dr. GUI is
skeptical about converting an application that quickly. Oh, and
plug-ins aren't cross-platform, since they're compiled to native
code. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="2" face="verdana,arial,helvetica">But
the real problem arises when you consider the result of that
conversion: An app that won't run anywhere except when hosted in
a Web browser. That means that the primary user interface and
branding your user sees is the Web browser&#151;not your
application. In other words, you've converted your branded
application into a generic component for another company's Web
browser. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="2" face="verdana,arial,helvetica">Dr.
GUI is less than excited about this. </font></p>
