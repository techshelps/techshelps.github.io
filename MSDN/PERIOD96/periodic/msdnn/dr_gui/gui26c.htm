<h2><font size="2" face="verdana,arial,helvetica">Dear Dr. GUI:</font></h2>

<p><font size="2" face="verdana,arial,helvetica">I am trying to write a
common gateway interface (CGI) program for use with an HTML form
that I have created for the Web. I really want to use Visual
Basic to write the application but have found that it doesn't
seem to work. Any suggestions? </font></p>

<h2><font size="2" face="verdana,arial,helvetica">Dr. GUI replies:</font></h2>

<p><font size="2" face="verdana,arial,helvetica">There is a growing
number of third-party solutions that provide the means for
accomplishing what you are trying to do. The Development Library
also has some help for you. I quote from &quot;CGISPAWN: A
Utility for Use with HTML Forms,&quot; a technical article found
in the Development Library: </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="verdana,arial,helvetica">&quot;The only way for a
CGI application to return data to the client is by way of writing
to standard out (STDOUT). Some programming languages do not
support standard input or output. A good example of this is
Visual Basic. Ironically, Visual Basic provides a rich and highly
abstracted environment that would make it ideal for writing
useful CGI applications. On the other hand, if Visual Basic did
provide a means of conveniently reading and writing standard I/O,
it would be a very powerful and convenient tool for creating CGI
applications. One way to rectify this problem is to have an
application that handles all standard I/O issues on behalf of
applications written in Visual Basic or any other language that
does not support standard I/O.&quot; </font></p>

application that permits you to write CGI applications in Visual
Basic. The following figure illustrates how CGISPAWN works.</font></p>
