other options make a whole lot more sense. Which options are best
for you? </font></p>

applets, since they're compiled to Java byte codes, will run
anywhere there's a Java Virtual Machine. But they run quite
slowly, unless your JVM uses just-in-time compilation (which Dr.
GUI thinks is cool beyond belief). More importantly, Java applets
currently have no standard way of communicating with each other
and have limited communication with the page in which they're
hosted. And they have to be written from scratch in a new
language using a new class library. Still, Dr. GUI likes
Java&#151;and not just the kind that comes in a cup. Someday
it'll probably be the good doctor's favorite language&#151;since
Java interfaces and COM interfaces are semantically equivalent,
Java will be a great language for creating and using COM objects.</font></p>
