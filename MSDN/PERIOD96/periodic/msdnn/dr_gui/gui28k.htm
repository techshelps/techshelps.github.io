about Macs and UNIX?</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="2" face="verdana,arial,helvetica">Dr.
GUI thinks that standards are very important, so he notes with
joy that a big part of Microsoft's strategy is to embrace
platforms other than Windows in a number of important ways. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="2" face="verdana,arial,helvetica">First,
Microsoft works closely with standards committees, including the
World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). Because we work within the
standards process to extend HTML, it will be easier for other Web
browsers to support these extensions. The result will be
great-looking Web applications that anyone can use. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="2" face="verdana,arial,helvetica">Dr.
GUI's also delighted that Microsoft supports Java. Today, if you
need to write a Web application that can run on a wide variety of
client platforms, you can use HTML and Java to produce very
serviceable applications. (And if the client has just-in-time
compilation of the Java byte codes, the speed of the app should
be reasonable, if not great.) </font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="2" face="verdana,arial,helvetica">Finally,
Dr. GUI notes with pride that Microsoft is working to bring
ActiveX technologies to the Macintosh and has agreements with
third parties to bring ActiveX technologies to UNIX. This will be
a major advance in the capabilities of Internet applications on
all these platforms&#151;a major step toward activating the
Internet! </font></p>
