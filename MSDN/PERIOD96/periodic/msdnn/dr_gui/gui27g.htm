<h3><font size="2" face="verdana,arial,helvetica">Dear Dr. GUI:</font></h3>

<p><font size="2" face="verdana,arial,helvetica">Every quarter, the MS
Development Platform CD-ROMs arrive with more and more CDs.
Though it&#146;s fun looking at all the characters of the Korean
Hangeul distribution, we need only about a quarter of all the
discs. Of course we could use the other three quarters to
decorate the walls, but in the end it&#146;s a waste of
polycarbonate. As we are aware of environmental issues, we would
like to have a more individual set of CD-ROMs. Is that possible? </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="verdana,arial,helvetica">Christian Treber </font></p>

<h3><font size="2" face="verdana,arial,helvetica">Dr. GUI replies:</font></h3>

<p><font size="2" face="verdana,arial,helvetica">My, you <i>DO</i> have
interesting ears&#151;with CD-ROMs spilling out of them. But Dr.
GUI has just the thing to keep some of the CD-ROMs from coming
out of your ears. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="verdana,arial,helvetica">Recently, the Developer
Network started shipping the MSDN Platform in three packages.
Pack 1, the U.S. Pack, contains all of the SDKs and U.S. versions
of the operating systems. Pack 2, the International Pack,
contains all of the non-U.S. operating systems, drivers,
extensions, and SDKs, including Far East versions. Pack 3, the
DDK Pack, contains device driver kits for all Microsoft operating
systems. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="verdana,arial,helvetica">Contact the Developer
Network to change the packs you receive. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="verdana,arial,helvetica">In your situation, you
probably want European, but not Far Eastern, operating systems,
since you&#146;re in Germany. We don&#146;t have a way to do that
today, but we&#146;re working to figure out a distribution system
that will better match customers&#146; exact needs. </font></p>
