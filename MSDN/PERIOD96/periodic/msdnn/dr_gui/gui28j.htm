<p><font color="#000000" size="5" face="verdana,arial,helvetica">What
about my client/server applications?</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="2" face="verdana,arial,helvetica">Dr.
GUI knows of a number of ways to do client/server applications
over the Internet today and of more great ways coming up. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="2" face="verdana,arial,helvetica">If
your needs (and your UI) are simple, Dr. GUI prescribes an HTML
form on the client end along with some server extensions on the
server end. If you write to the standards, your application will
be able to run on any client that supports forms. Although the
client end will be simple, you can do any sophisticated
processing you need on the server end to return the result you
need. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="2" face="verdana,arial,helvetica">If
you've been to medical school, you might want to write programs
for the client and server ends that communicate with each other
using your own communications protocol based on TCP/IP sockets.
(You might be able to work within HTTP to do what you need, but
it's tricky.) If you didn't finish med school, there are a number
of companies that provide libraries for custom protocols that are
callable from Visual C++, Visual Basic, and so forth. Or you
could use distributed COM when it becomes available&#151;the demo
of Scribble running over the net that Dr. GUI saw at the
Professional Developers Conference was quite cool. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="2" face="verdana,arial,helvetica">Don't
despair about the current state of client/server applications,
though. As more ActiveX controls are available, client/server
applications will become easier because the communications will
be encapsulated into a control.</font></p>
