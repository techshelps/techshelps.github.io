<h3><font size="2" face="verdana,arial,helvetica">Dear Dr. GUI:</font></h3>

<p><font size="2" face="verdana,arial,helvetica">HELP!!!!!!!!!!! I am new
to Visual Basic (32-bit for Windows 95) and have been trying to
use rich text boxes but there isn&#146;t enough
&#147;how-to&#148; info in the documentation. I&#146;ve checked a
lot of books, called Microsoft tech support, even tried news
groups&#151;nothing! For instance, they tell you what RTF codes
are supported but don&#146;t tell you how to use them. I know
I&#146;m probably missing something real simple, but I sure wish
someone would point it out. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="verdana,arial,helvetica">Thanks. </font></p>

<h3><font size="2" face="verdana,arial,helvetica">Dr. GUI replies:</font></h3>

<p><font size="2" face="verdana,arial,helvetica">Interpreting and
producing RTF files is a rather advanced and mysterious topic,
rivaling brain surgery in its complexity. To take full advantage
of the Visual Basic <b>RichTextBox</b> control, you may instead
wish to employ the <b>LoadFile()</b> and <b>SaveFile()</b>
methods. These features allow the <b>RichTextBox</b> control to
handle the interpretation for you, while hiding all of the ugly
details. However, if you absolutely must become an accomplished
RTF hacker, here are a couple of suggestions: </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="verdana,arial,helvetica">1. The RTF version 1.3
specification (Microsoft Product Support Services Application
Note 1/95-GC0165) is available on the MSDN Library CD (look under
Product Documentation, Applications, Word for Windows 6.0). This
specification contains a wealth of information about the minutiae
of RTF documents, and should satisfy your curiosity. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="verdana,arial,helvetica">2. Use an RTF-enabled
word processor (such as WordPad or Microsoft Word for Windows) to
produce a document with the desired formatting. WordPad is
especially handy since it&#146;s based on the same Windows 95
rich-text edit control used in the Visual Basic&#146;s
implementation of <b>RichTextBox</b>. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="verdana,arial,helvetica">Save the document in RTF
format, then view the document as an ASCII text file so that the
RTF tags are visible. By comparing the formatted document with
the underlying RTF tags, and referring to the aforementioned
specification, you should start to gain an understanding of how
the tags are actually employed in producing an RTF document. This
is a trial-and-error approach, but Dr. GUI has never been averse
to addressing complex problems through trial and error. After
all, this approach carried the good doctor through his surgical
residency with nary a complaint! </font></p>
