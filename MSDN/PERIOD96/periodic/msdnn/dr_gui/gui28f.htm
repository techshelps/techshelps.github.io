controls</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="2" face="verdana,arial,helvetica">ActiveX
controls, on the other hand, can be used in your other
applications as well as in a Web browser. So the ActiveX control
you write is much more reusable than any of the other
alternatives. ActiveX controls communicate just fine with the
VBScript code in the host page using the methods, properties, and
events you'd normally use. Finally, you write ActiveX controls in
the language of Dr. GUI's favorite development system: Visual
C++. (More languages will be available later.) </font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="2" face="verdana,arial,helvetica">ActiveX
controls are compiled to native code, so they're not
cross-platform. But what if the ActiveX control was written in
Java and compiled to Java byte codes? The best of both worlds:
the power of ActiveX and the interoperability of Java. Microsoft
is working on it. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="2" face="verdana,arial,helvetica">If
you have an existing application that doesn't need to be embedded
in a Web page, you should make it an ActiveX document. Once
you're an OLE in-place editing server, you can become an ActiveX
document by supporting just a few additional OLE
interfaces&#151;not trivial, but not all that hard, either. The
win for you is that users will be able to open your ActiveX
documents within their ActiveX document containers, including
Microsoft Internet Explorer 3.0, the Microsoft Office Binder, and
the new Windows shell that will ship with Nashville. Dr. GUI
thinks that's a lot of functionality for very reasonable effort. </font></p>
