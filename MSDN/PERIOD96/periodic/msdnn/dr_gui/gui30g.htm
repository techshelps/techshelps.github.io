<h2><font size="2" face="verdana,arial,helvetica">Dear Dr. GUI:</font></h2>

<p><font size="2" face="verdana,arial,helvetica">Occasionally I run
across a problem with one or another Microsoft product. So far, I
have always figured out a workaround and so calling support is
not the issue. What I'm looking for is a place to send e-mail to
alert the proper people to the problem. No, I 'm not looking for
a separate e-mail address for each product. Is there such an
e-mail address?? Sending e-mail to msdn@microsoft.com just gets
you a canned response, which becomes boring after the third or
fourth time. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="verdana,arial,helvetica">For example: Installing
BackOffice 1.5 SDK on a disk with more than 2 GB free space
fails, doing a backward search in MS Developer Studio after just
starting it causes an access violation (after you've been in it a
while and done lots of searches, this is not a problem). </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="verdana,arial,helvetica">What I'm looking to do
is to help the developers solve the problem so that in the next
release (of whichever product) I won't still have to use
workarounds. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="verdana,arial,helvetica">Thanks in advance, </font></p>

<h2><font size="2" face="verdana,arial,helvetica">Dear Dr. GUI:</font></h2>

<p><font size="2" face="verdana,arial,helvetica">What is the correct way
to report MSDN Library omissions? An e-mail message sent to
msdn@microsoft.com just generated an automated response. Whether
a real person will ever see it is unclear. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="verdana,arial,helvetica">For the past two cycles
(April 1996 and July 1996), the Windows NT Resource Kit
Networking Guide has been missing from the MSDN Library.
Fortunately, I still have the January 1996 MSDN Library, which
does contain it. </font></p>

<h2><font size="2" face="verdana,arial,helvetica">Dr. GUI replies:</font></h2>

<p><font size="2" face="verdana,arial,helvetica">These problems are both
symptoms of the same disease: I-Dunno-Who-Itis. With this
disease, the cure varies depending on the symptoms. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="verdana,arial,helvetica">For product bugs, call
Microsoft Product Support at the number shown in your product's
documentation. Naturally, we don't charge for bug reports. If you
like, you can also post in one of the Microsoft newsgroups. We
don't have an e-mail address for bug reports, but we do have a
wish-list mailing address: </font><a
href="mailto:mswish@microsoft.com"><font size="2"
face="verdana,arial,helvetica">mswish@microsoft.com</font></a><font
size="2" face="verdana,arial,helvetica">. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="verdana,arial,helvetica">For problems with MSDN,
either call the product support number listed in the MSDN Library
article &quot;Microsoft Developer Network Support Policy,&quot;
or e-mail </font><a href="mailto:msdn@microsoft.com"><font
size="2" face="verdana,arial,helvetica">msdn@microsoft.com</font></a><font
size="2" face="verdana,arial,helvetica">. We do indeed have a great (if
overworked) human who reads this mail, and, although he doesn't
have time to reply to each message, he deals with everything he
gets. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="verdana,arial,helvetica">Unfortunately, the
Windows NT Resource Kit Networking Guide will not be back on the
October Library CD, so hold onto your January CD while Dr. GUI's
crack medical staff looks into restorative surgery. </font></p>
