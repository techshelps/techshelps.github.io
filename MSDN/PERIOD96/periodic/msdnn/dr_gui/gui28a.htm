<p><font color="#000000" size="5" face="verdana,arial,helvetica">Hail!
Brave new world!</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="2" face="verdana,arial,helvetica">Some
say all this Internet stuff is just hype. But it's really
historic: We're witnessing the beginnings of a fundamental change
in how people perceive and use computers. Dr. GUI hasn't had this
much fun since, well, the advent of the GUI. In fact, he feels
sorry for recently retired friends who are missing out on all
this excitement. They've told him not to waste his pity. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="2" face="verdana,arial,helvetica">The
fundamental change, somewhat oversimplified, is this: In the old
world, computers were primarily for computing. In the new world,
computers are primarily for communicating. This is the day the
world changed. To quote Douglas Adams, &quot;When the ocean
arrives, the river rules don't apply anymore.&quot; A number of
things that didn't seem crucial yesterday are absolutely crucial
today. For instance, standards and interoperability have an
importance they never had before&#151;if you have a worldwide
publishing system, what good is it to publish Web applications if
everyone can't use them? </font></p>

<h3><font color="#000000" size="2" face="verdana,arial,helvetica">Can
you keep a secret?</font></h3>

<p><font color="#000000" size="2" face="verdana,arial,helvetica">Dr.
GUI hasn't revealed this before, but he attended not one, but two
Internet development conferences in recent months. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="2" face="verdana,arial,helvetica"> If you
were at the Microsoft Internet Professional Developers Conference in San Francisco, you may have seen Dr.
GUI: He was the kinda weird guy with the stethoscope around his
neck. As Oscar Wilde said, &quot;Everyone who disappears is said
to be seen at San Francisco.&quot; Clearly, that's not the
secret. The secret is&#151;promise not to tell your UNIX
friends&#151;that Dr. GUI earlier attended, incognito (i.e., sans
stethoscope), the Netscape Internet Developer Conference. </font></p>

<h3><font color="#000000" size="2" face="verdana,arial,helvetica">Programming:
A lot of new people are doing it</font></h3>

<p><font color="#000000" size="2" face="verdana,arial,helvetica">It
was at Netscape's conference that Dr. GUI first met a new breed
of person who programs: HTML designers. They're not traditional
programmers. They're not scientists or engineers or accountants.
They're creative types: Writers, musicians, artists, and so
forth. And they're doing programming&#151;in HTML. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="2" face="verdana,arial,helvetica">Since
the dawn of electronic computing, people have taken up
programming only when the effort of learning promises something
so compelling they must be able to do it themselves. People who
work a lot with numbers&#151;engineers, scientists, and
accountants&#151;took up programming to avoid tedious manual
calculations. For Dr. GUI, it was a power thing&#151;nothing else
in Dr. GUI's life would do what he wanted. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="2" face="verdana,arial,helvetica">For
HTML designers, the compelling reason to take up programming
isn't computing <i>pi</i> or databases or games. It's
communication. For people whose lives revolve around
self-expression, being able to publish cheaply and easily to the
whole world by programming in HTML is very compelling. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="2" face="verdana,arial,helvetica">True,
today's HTML isn't object-oriented, buzzword-compliant, or
otherwise cool. Neither is assembly language. HTML is about as
complicated as assembly language, at least in Dr. GUI's book. So
the way Dr. GUI figures it, it's a small step from HTML to Visual
Basic Scripting Edition. And another small step from there to
Visual Basic. It's not much harder to learn Java. And once you've
got HTML, VBScript, VB, and Java under your belt, you can program
most anything you like, short of device drivers and operating
systems. So Dr. GUI warmly welcomes these newcomers to the world
of programming&#151;and if you know any newcomers, Dr. GUI hopes
you'll welcome them, too. </font></p>

<h3><font color="#000000" size="2" face="verdana,arial,helvetica">Theme
from the PDC: Activate the Internet</font></h3>

<p><font color="#000000" size="2" face="verdana,arial,helvetica">The
major theme of Microsoft's Professional Developers Conference was
simple: &quot;Activate the Internet.&quot; In other words, make
Web pages (or applications) live, not dead. The really
interesting Web applications are those with which you can
interact, not those that are static. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="2" face="verdana,arial,helvetica">Microsoft's
name for the technologies that activate the Internet is
&quot;ActiveX.&quot; Dr. GUI will explain ActiveX later. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="2" face="verdana,arial,helvetica">But
wait! There's more! There's all sorts of cool technology for
security, Active VRML, distributed COM, standards-based
enhancements to HTML, and even great support for Java. It all
makes Dr. GUI's head spin. Can someone call a real doctor? </font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="2" face="verdana,arial,helvetica">Microsoft
Internet Explorer 3.0 will soon be available in beta. When it is,
download it and look at the demo pages. I think you'll agree that
this is a major step toward activating the Internet! Although Dr.
GUI certainly has a bias, his survey tells no lies: 4 out of 5
developers recommend Microsoft technology for their patients who
develop for the Internet. </font></p>

<h3><font color="#000000" size="2" face="verdana,arial,helvetica">And
finally, answers to your questions</font></h3>

<p><font color="#000000" size="2" face="verdana,arial,helvetica">Dr.
GUI was asked scores of questions about Microsoft and the
Internet during the conference. Unfortunately, he didn't get a
chance to write down exact questions nor the names of people who
asked them, so he's summarizing and paraphrasing questions that
y'all asked multiple times. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="2" face="verdana,arial,helvetica">Of
course, he was asked and asked and asked about ActiveX. More than
one person has suggested that it sounds like an ingredient in
something you'd take for heartburn. But after investigation, Dr.
GUI's happy to report that it is actually just what the doctor
ordered to relieve the pain of static content on the Internet. </font></p>
