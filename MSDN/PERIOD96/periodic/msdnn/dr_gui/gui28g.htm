code and safer computing</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="2" face="verdana,arial,helvetica">So
we're going to ship all this code around? How will it get to
users' computers? How will they get it installed? Most
importantly, how can users be protected from controls that do bad
things? </font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="2" face="verdana,arial,helvetica">There
are currently two approaches to safer computing: The sandbox
approach (&quot;I don't care who I'm computing with because I'm
using protection&quot;) and the code-signing approach (&quot;I
won't worry about protection too much because I know and trust
the author of the code&quot;). </font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="2" face="verdana,arial,helvetica">Java
applets and VBScript use the sandbox approach. This allows you to
run anonymous code safely&#151;provided there are no security
pinholes in the sandbox implementation. However, the limitations
you have to put on what the applet or VBScript program can do in
the sandbox are pretty severe (for instance: no file I/O), so
it's hard to write really interesting applets. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="2" face="verdana,arial,helvetica">For
most ActiveX controls, you'll want to use code-signing. This
allows you to determine who wrote the control and whether the
code has been modified since it was signed. The idea here is that
signed controls should be as safe as shrink-wrapped software is
today. There's a great set of papers on code signing and
automatic downloads in the Site Builder Workshop (</font><a

the MSDN Library. </font></p>
