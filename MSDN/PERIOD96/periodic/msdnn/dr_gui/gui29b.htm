<h3><font color="#000000" size="2" face="verdana,arial,helvetica">Dear
Dr. GUI:</font></h3>

<p><font color="#000000" size="2" face="verdana,arial,helvetica">The
factory where I have worked for 18 years will be closing in about
a year. I am the IS Manager, running a two-person shop,
supporting an AS/400 running homegrown business systems and a
Novell LAN consisting of desktop applications in a DOS/Windows
3.1 environment. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="2" face="verdana,arial,helvetica">For
the last 20 years I have developed, supported and enhanced COBOL
business systems. System development is my true love. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="2" face="verdana,arial,helvetica">I
have done some work with Microsoft Access; however, I have found
that, either due to lack of knowledge or the structure of
Microsoft Access, I have lost the program control that one gets
from development with COBOL. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="2" face="verdana,arial,helvetica">What
specific languages and/or development tools would you suggest I
learn to get into PC-based system development? </font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="2" face="verdana,arial,helvetica">Any
advice would be appreciated. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="2" face="verdana,arial,helvetica">Bob
Felton </font></p>

<h3><font color="#000000" size="2" face="verdana,arial,helvetica">Dr.
GUI replies:</font></h3>

<p><font color="#000000" size="2" face="verdana,arial,helvetica">The
most popular language for developing PC business applications is
Visual Basic. If you know it, you'll never starve. And Visual
Basic gets more and more powerful with every new version, so
there's less and less reason to use anything else. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="2" face="verdana,arial,helvetica">For
systems programming, Dr. GUI and friends use mostly Visual C++
with either Microsoft Foundation Class Library (MFC) or the
Windows SDK. MFC does a lot to make Windows programming easier,
so I'd recommend learning it. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="2" face="verdana,arial,helvetica">But
Dr. GUI recommends that you consider getting ahead of the curve,
and learn some languages that will help you program for the
Internet. While Visual Basic and Visual C++ are used for Internet
programming, more programming is done in HTML and in
Java&#151;not to mention scripting languages such as VBScript and
JavaScript. It's also wise to learn how to build dynamic Web
pages, especially using databases and tools, such as dbWeb. If
you can do some or all of this, you'll have a bright future.</font></p>
