<p><font color="#000000" size="2" face="verdana,arial,helvetica">What
an adventure it&#146;s been! Over the past few months, Dr. GUI
has gone through gender and species transformations. (Fixing
whole-wheat toast gets rather tiresome, although the crumbs did
keep me regular.) Then I went to Comdex but ended up lost in the
desert after being put in a taxi late one night as a party was
winding down. In the desert, I got really hungry and thirsty and
tired. Luckily, I found an odd, spineless, dome-shaped cactus to
eat. As I nibbled on its little buttons, my hunger and thirst
were satisfied. However, I did seem to be in an altered
state&#151;maybe it was that I was sleepy. The last thing I
remember was clicking my heels three times while chanting,
&#147;There&#146;s no place like cyberspace. . . there&#146;s no
place like cyberspace. . .&#148; </font></p>

<h3><font color="#000000" size="2" face="verdana,arial,helvetica">.
. . and into the GUI, GUI Swamp. . . </font></h3>

<p><font color="#000000" size="2" face="verdana,arial,helvetica">I
found myself in a familiar swamp (oops, I mean &#147;protected
wetland&#148;). As I waded and squished through it, I recognized
the shells of old 286 PCs that had been jettisoned from the
building above. It was then that I realized that I was near home:
I was outside one of Microsoft&#146;s Product Support buildings.
I hurried inside to borrow a computer to check my e-mail, and was
in for a huge surprise. </font></p>

<h3><font color="#000000" size="2" face="verdana,arial,helvetica">.
. . out of the Swamp, but Still Swamped. . .</font></h3>

<p><font color="#000000" size="2" face="verdana,arial,helvetica">I
discovered that instead of the usual two or three questions a day
from my devoted patients, I was getting between <i>30</i> and <i>70</i>!
Every day! I said to myself, &#147;It&#146;s a good thing I only
have to answer the ones that get published in the column. .
.&#148; </font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="2" face="verdana,arial,helvetica">When
I inquired as to what might have happened, my editor said,
&#147;Oh, we put you up on the Internet&#151;all they have to do
is click an eight ball to e-mail you.&#148; Never let them tell
you that no one pays attention to the Internet. </font></p>
