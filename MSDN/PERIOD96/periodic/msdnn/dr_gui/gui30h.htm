<font size="5" face="verdana,arial,helvetica">Buried in Meaningless
Links: Pitfalls of Automated Linking</font>

<h2><font size="2" face="verdana,arial,helvetica">Dear Dr. GUI:</font></h2>

<p><font size="2" face="verdana,arial,helvetica">Take a critical look at
the Dr. GUI entry for the July 1996 MSDN Library (&quot;Dr. GUI
Gets Webbed&quot;). Note all the little green links on it. Try
some. Enjoy the dada-esque hyperlinking. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="verdana,arial,helvetica">In the first sentence,
the word &quot;environment&quot; links to the C RTL documentation
for <b>getenv()</b>. Later on, in the section title &quot;Theme
from the PDC: Activate the Internet,&quot; &quot;Activate&quot;
is a link to activating embedded OLE objects. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="verdana,arial,helvetica">In &quot;The really
interesting Web applications are those with which you can
interact, not those that are static,&quot; the word
&quot;static&quot; takes you to an explanation of the C/C++
keyword. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="verdana,arial,helvetica">In &quot;4 out of 5
developers [...],&quot; the word &quot;out&quot; links to OLE
memory management. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="verdana,arial,helvetica">In &quot;Unfortunately,
he didn't get a chance to write down exact question nor the names
of people who asked them [...],&quot;, &quot;write&quot; links to
issues of porting to the Macintosh, and &quot;names&quot; links
to an explanation of C++ namespaces. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="verdana,arial,helvetica">I've worked on a
multimedia product where we automatically generated HTML, and of
course we had plenty of these juggernaut-automaton-gone-wild
hyperlinks. But we also hand-edited a lot of them out, and given
a chance to refine the process, we would have automated removing
a lot of them. And that was with only one full-time engineer
working on the problem. Surely the Microsoft Developer Network
has the ability to rein in some of its more spurious
hyperlinking? </font></p>

<h2><font size="2" face="verdana,arial,helvetica">Dr. GUI replies:</font></h2>

<p><font size="2" face="verdana,arial,helvetica">Dr. GUI has egg (no,
make that a dozen eggs) on his face. But they've all been
properly cooked, so the good doctor won't come down with
salmonella. He takes no comfort in the fact that his column isn't
the only article on the July CD that's been affected by this
problem. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="verdana,arial,helvetica">It's caused by a bug in
some internal link-management software. We discovered this bug
too late to make changes for the July CD. We know it'll be fixed
after October; we're currently doing everything we can to improve
the situation for the October CD. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="verdana,arial,helvetica">In the meantime, since
we have plenty of eggs, we're making omelettes. </font></p>
