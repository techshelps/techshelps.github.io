<p><font size="2" face="verdana,arial,helvetica">Here's a pair of related
questions: </font></p>

<h2><font size="2" face="verdana,arial,helvetica">Dear Dr. GUI:</font></h2>

<p><font size="2" face="verdana,arial,helvetica">Does Visual C++/MFC, or
some other easily available resource, provide a convenient way to
generate tabbed dialog boxes, such as those commonly used in most
of Microsoft's newer programs? </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="verdana,arial,helvetica">The Baxter Family </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="verdana,arial,helvetica">...and... </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="verdana,arial,helvetica">How do you implement
wizards in your applications? Are there APIs or any other method
employed by Microsoft that is available to developers in general?
</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="verdana,arial,helvetica">Israel Frankel </font></p>

<h2><font size="2" face="verdana,arial,helvetica">Dr. GUI replies:</font></h2>

<p><font size="2" face="verdana,arial,helvetica">Didn't know Windows
programming was a family activity! Cool! </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="verdana,arial,helvetica">These questions are
related (cousins, perhaps) because to implement either tabbed
dialog boxes or wizards you'll derive classes from the same MFC
classes: <b>CPropertySheet</b> and <b>CPropertyPage</b>. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="verdana,arial,helvetica">The property sheet is
the &quot;container&quot; for all the property pages. Each
property page (tabbed page or wizard page) has a separate class.
Associated with each property page class is a dialog box template
that specifies the controls on that page. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="verdana,arial,helvetica">Tabbed dialog boxes are
implemented as property sheets with tabs for selecting the
property pages. Wizards are implemented as property sheets with
&quot;Back&quot; and &quot;Next&quot; buttons for selecting the
property pages. (A call to <b>SetWizardMode</b> tells MFC to
handle the property sheet as a wizard rather than as a tabbed
dialog box.) There's a great article about creating property
sheets&#151;entitled, oddly enough, &quot;Property
Sheets&quot;&#151;in the MSDN Library and in the Visual C++
document set. The documentation on <b>CPropertySheet</b> and <b>CPropertyPage</b>
is helpful, as are the KnowledgeBase articles you'll find in the
MSDN Library. (If you want the Win32 SDK way to do it, check out
the article &quot;We're Off to See the Wizard.&quot;) </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="verdana,arial,helvetica">In addition, starting
with version 4.0, Visual C++ has a super-cool component in its
Component Gallery (choose &quot;Component&quot; from the
&quot;Insert&quot; menu), which allows you to easily add the
framework for a property sheet (either modal or modeless) or
wizard. When you select it, it invokes its own Property Sheet
Wizard, which guides you through the process of creating the
framework. (You still have to fill in the dialog box templates
and get data in and out of the property pages, though, and you
have to handle the logic for the Back/Next/Finish buttons.
Wizards can't do everything for you.) </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="verdana,arial,helvetica">While you're at it, call
up the Component Gallery to check out the other cool components
and OLE (ActiveX) controls provided with Visual C++. </font></p>
