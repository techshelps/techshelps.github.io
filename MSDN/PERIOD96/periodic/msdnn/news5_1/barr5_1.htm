<p><font size="6" face="verdana">Removing
Barriers: Microsoft Publishes Guidelines for More Accessible
Software</font></p>

<p><font size="2"><i>by Gregory C. Lowney</i></font></p>

<p><font size="2">In the November/December 1995 issue of <i>Developer
Network News</i>, we talked about one of the tips you can use to
make sure your application doesn&#146;t put up unnecessary
barriers for users with disabilities. This month we&#146;re
celebrating a major milestone in this effort&#151;publication of
the <i>Windows Guidelines for Accessible Software Design</i>,
which can be found in the January 1996 release of the Microsoft
Development Library.</font></p>

<p><font size="2">Microsoft is committed to making computers
easier for everyone to use. To achieve that goal requires
everyone&#146;s cooperation in addressing the needs of
individuals with disabilities.</font></p>

<p><font size="2">This goal is partly a reflection of
society&#146;s realization that people who have disabilities are
a valuable resource. Society as a whole benefits when we take
full advantage of every talented computer programmer, artist,
engineer, writer, accountant, or teacher. This has been proven
time and again, not only by such prominent examples as Stephen
Hawking, but by the millions of people who have acquired a
disability but continued to play important roles in their work.
Computers&#151;and specifically computer hardware and software
that is designed to be inclusive&#151;are making that possible in
new ways</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="verdana"><B>Accessibility at All
Levels</B></font></p>

<p><font size="2">Computer accessibility affects design at all
levels: hardware, operating system, and applications.</font></p>

<p><font size="2">The Windows 95 operating system sets a new
standard by incorporating more built-in functions designed to
create a level playing field than any previous operating system.
Some of these are easy to spot, such as the Accessibility Options
in Control Panel, but others are subtle because they don&#146;t
look like they&#146;re for people with disabilities. They look
like they&#146;re for everyone, and they are. Most technologies
designed to be more inclusive make things easier for everyone.</font></p>

<p><font size="2">In general, Windows 95 itself is pretty
accessible, but there is a lot of variability among applications.
The main reason is that almost all applications are designed
without considering the needs of people with disabilities. That
doesn&#146;t necessarily mean they&#146;re bad or inaccessible,
but it does increase the chances that design and implementation
details may put up barriers the designers never intended.</font></p>

<p><font size="2">Every application has some of these inadvertent
problems. Some recent examples of difficulties that people with
disabilities face include:</font></p>

<p><font size="2">&#149; Special characters in a list box are
always drawn in black. When the item is highlighted with the
normal dark blue, it&#146;s impossible to differentiate.</font></p>

<p><font size="2">&#149; A dialog box that can&#146;t be
traversed with the tab key, because every time you reach a
certain control you get &quot;trapped&quot; when another dialog
box pops up.</font></p>

<p><font size="2">&#149; A feature that can only be configured by
clicking the right mouse button. Not only is this a problem for
people who can&#146;t use a mouse and for people using one-button
pointing devices, but such a feature is almost impossible to
discover on your own.</font></p>

<p><font size="2">&#149; An application that shows important
instructions only in a bitmap. For users who are blind, it
presents a blank wall with no door, even though it&#146;s simple
to expose the underlying text without altering the visible user
interface.</font></p>

<p><font size="2">Problems like these are very common.
They&#146;re also very easy to remedy, once you have a basic
familiarity with the issues and the solutions.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="verdana"><B>The Accessibility
Guidelines</B></font></p>

<p><font size="2">It&#146;s often just as easy to implement a
solution that&#146;s accessible as one that imposes barriers.
That&#146;s why Microsoft is publishing the guidelines for
accessible software design.</font></p>

<p><font size="2">The accessibility guidelines represent the
first time a software company has attempted to formalize
recommendations that affect all types of users with a wide range
of disabilities. Much of the original research was done by the
Trace Research and Development Center at the University of
Wisconsin-Madison, with funding from the National Institute on
Disability and Rehabilitation Research (NIDRR).</font></p>

<p><font size="2">Microsoft has avidly participated in this
project, expanding on the original concepts and adding
recommendations specific to the Windows environment. These are
based on its experience, plus that of other mainstream software
developers, with developers of accessibility aids and with end
users.</font></p>

<p><font size="2">The guidelines introduce the various types of
disabilities and how people affected make use of the computer. It
also provides some of the economic reasons why accessible
programming makes sense to any business. The technical sections
describe the specific problems you may encounter and solutions
available. Areas discussed include:</font></p>

<p><font size="2">&#149; Basic principles of accessible software
design.</font></p>

<p><font size="2">&#149; How to provide good keyboard access for
users who cannot use a pointing device.</font></p>

<p><font size="2">&#149; How to expose the focus location so
accessibility aids can present relative information to the user
(the topic in the November/December 1995 issue of <i>Developer
Network News</i>).</font></p>

<p><font size="2">&#149; Using controls and menus so that
they&#146;re compatible with accessibility aids that need to
simulate input (such as voice recognition), or represent the
controls to the user who&#146;s blind or has low vision. These
steps also allow you to use automated tools to improve your
product testing process.</font></p>

<p><font size="2">&#149; How to draw text and graphics to the
screen while maintaining compatibility with blind-access
utilities.</font></p>

<p><font size="2">&#149; How to effectively identify windows to
the end user and to accessibility aids.</font></p>

<p><font size="2">&#149; How to avoid timing problems for people
with slow typing or reaction times, or that might trigger
seizures in users with epilepsy.</font></p>

<p><font size="2">&#149; How to use color effectively for all
users, including those with impaired vision, the 10 percent of
all males who are color blind, and those using monochromatic
devices.</font></p>

<p><font size="2">&#149; Making text and graphics scale well, so
that people can adjust the size to suit their vision, dexterity,
or screen resolution.</font></p>

<p><font size="2">&#149; Using sound so the application
won&#146;t become unusable by the tens of millions of people who
are deaf or hard of hearing, or those working in noisy
environments such as an airplane.</font></p>

<p><font size="2">&#149; Avoiding problems when laying out
windows and dialog boxes.</font></p>

<p><font size="2">&#149; Optional features you can use to go that
extra step and make your application especially friendly for
users with some types of disabilities.</font></p>

<p><font size="2">In addition, the document describes ways you
can measure how accessible your application is and identify areas
for improvement. There are also lists of resources for getting
more information on accessibility.</font></p>

<p><font size="2">Take a little bit of time to read these
guidelines in the January release of the Development Library
(search for &quot;Windows Guidelines for Accessible Software
Design&quot;). You should gain the tools you need to dramatically
reduce the barriers in your product without a major investment of
time.</font></p>
