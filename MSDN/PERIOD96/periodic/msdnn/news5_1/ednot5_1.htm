<p><font size="6" face="verdana">Inside the Curly Brackets</font></p>

<p><font size="2"><i>by Andrew Himes<br>
</i>Editor-in-chief, <i>Developer Network News</i></font></p>

<p><font size="2">On a singularly dull and dreary morning in late
November (apologies to Edgar Allan Poe), I was running through a
cold, drenching rain, about halfway through a half-marathon in
the company of several thousand wretches as miserable as myself.
My socks and shoes were soaked. I had aqueous rivulets running
down my face. My calf muscles were screaming. I chanted to
myself, over and over, &quot;You should have stayed in bed, you
fool, you should have stayed in bed, you fool, you should have
stayed in bed, you fool.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="2">All around me, my fellow sufferers were going
through their own private agonies. A pop-eyed woman in chartreuse
lycra and smeared mascara muttered and moaned as she plodded
through the puddles. An elderly gentleman with protruding, white
ear-hair breathed deeply and sonorously, his sizable orange
shorts billowing with each short hop forward. A skinny, blond boy
of 14 or so, his shirttail flying free, skipped past me
noiselessly, and I thought I detected in his silence a note of
contempt for my advanced years&#151;he probably held his breath
to give the impression of effortlessness.</font></p>

<p><font size="2">Just as I approached my apogee of athletic
despair, two young men deep in conversation trotted past me.
&quot;You see Bill Gates on the David Frost show last night
talking about the Internet? He was awesome! Pretty deep.&quot;
&quot;Yeah,&quot; said the second one. &quot;<i>The Road Ahead. </i>New
book. Very cool. Makes you think.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="2">Panting heavily with exhaustion, I realized
anew that I would never be able to escape the Internet. For 18
months, my waking hours at Microsoft have been consumed by the
Internet. My dreams have been inhabited by the Internet and its
acronymic acolytes&#151;HTML, CGI, FTP, and HTTP. The ads in my
daily newspaper have been invaded by URLs on the WWW. And my
father, a retired minister in Rome, Georgia, is eager to access
e-mail and cruise the Web researching his family tree&#151;just
as soon as I can get him set up with a modem when I go to visit
at Christmas.</font></p>

<p><font size="2">So, if I can&#146;t escape the Internet, I may
as well give it a friendly bear hug&#151;as we have done yet
again in December on <i>For Developers Only</i>, the developer
section of Microsoft&#146;s site on the World Wide Web
(http://www.microsoft.com/devonly). We&#146;ve engineered a major
redesign of our website, with a snazzy new front page and
glorious new graphics. You&#146;ll see more and deeper technical
and strategic information about Windows-based development
throughout our site.</font></p>

<p><font size="2">And be sure to check out a brand new area of
content, the <b>Microsoft Internet Developer Toolbox</b><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/intdev/">
(http://www.microsoft.com/intdev/)</a>, an online publication devoted
to the technologies, systems, and tools from Microsoft related to
building and delivering applications on the&#151;guess
what?&#151;Internet.</font></p>

<p><font size="2">Meanwhile, I&#146;ll try to stop breathing so
hard.</font></p>
