<p><font size="6" face="Arial">New Names for Some Old MSDN
Friends</font></p>

<p><font size="2"><i>by Jonathan King<br>
Editor in Chief, Developer Network News</i></font></p>

<p><font size="2">The offers from the Microsoft Developer Network
(MSDN) were beginning to look like an archaeological dig. First
there was just the Development Library, a.k.a. Level 1. Then we
added the Development Platform&#151;presto!&#151;Level 2. A
little while ago, we threw the BackOffice Test Platform into the
mix and brilliantly called it Level 3.</font></p>

<p><font size="2">So many levels would have made a guy like
Heinrich Schliemann very happy, but MSDN members weren&#146;t so
amused. In fact, lots of people told us the naming scheme was
downright labyrinthine.</font></p>

<p><font size="2">OK, maybe we&#146;re slow, but we&#146;re not
insensitive. So, beginning in April we will be making some
changes to MSDN. Our goal is to give you a better understanding
of what each membership level provides and which level of
membership best meets your individual (or corporate) needs.</font></p>

<p><font size="2">This means, starting with the April release,
that the name of your MSDN membership will become consistent with
the names of the Microsoft development tools you license. For
example, if you use the &quot;Enterprise&quot; edition of Visual
Basic, you&#146;d probably want to have an MSDN &quot;Enterprise
Subscription.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="2">Here&#146;s a rundown of what you get with each
level (oops, that word is out!) of the Microsoft Developer
Network:</font></p>

<blockquote>
    <p><font size="2"><b>MSDN Library Subscription</b> (formerly
    MSDN Level 1): The MSDN Library gives you product
    documentation, technical articles, sample code, the Developer
    Knowledge Base, and much more, plus you get bimonthly issues
    of the <i>Developer Network News</i>, two phone-support
    incidents, and a 20-percent discount on Microsoft Press
    books. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2"><b>MSDN Professional Subscription</b>
    (formerly MSDN Level 2): In addition to the MSDN Library and
    all the other benefits of the Library Subscription, the
    Professional Subscription gives you quarterly updates of the
    MSDN Development Platform, which contains all the SDKs, DDKs,
    Windows and Windows NT Workstation operating systems, plus
    premium shipments whenever there is an important
    &quot;off-cycle&quot; release.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2"><b>MSDN Enterprise Subscription</b>
    (formerly MSDN Level 3): With this level of membership, you
    get all the benefits of the Professional Subscription, plus
    quarterly updates of the BackOffice Test Platform, which
    contains the latest released versions of the six server
    components of Microsoft BackOffice, as well as special
    premium shipments of important off-cycle releases.</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="2" face="verdana"><b>Please? Pretty please????</b></font></p>

<p><font size="2">Now, a personal plea. I get numerous letters
from folks asking me to change their addresses or sign them up
for a subscription. I send these requests on to our operations
people who, in turn, send them somewhere else to be entered into
a database. (You can tell how much I understand about business
operations.)</font></p>

<p><font size="2">In the interest of streamlining, we ask you to
cut out these middle steps by sending change-of-address
notifications, renewal requests, and new subscription requests
directly to the address in the box on this page.</font></p>

<p><font size="2">Of course, you can keep sending me mail with
suggestions and criticisms. Years of therapy have made me strong
enough to withstand the blows to my ego.</font></p>
