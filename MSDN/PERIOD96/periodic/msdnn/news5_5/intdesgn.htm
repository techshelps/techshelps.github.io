<p><font color="#000000" size="2"
face="verdana, arial, helvetica">So you want to design great Web
pages? This article covers some basic design guidelines.</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="2"
face="verdana, arial, helvetica">&quot;Whoa,&quot; you say.The
Web is a public forum that allows for creative expression. What
place do design guidelines have here?</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="2"
face="verdana, arial, helvetica">Well, these recommendations are
not intended to define any form of formal acceptability or
conformance criteria. Nor do I propose to discourage creativity.
However, while the Web offers a great vehicle for creative
designs, there are fundamental design factors that characterize
great Web pages.</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="2"
face="verdana, arial, helvetica">A good starting reference is
&quot;The Windows Interface Guidelines for Software Design&quot; </font><a
href="http://www.microsoft.com/win32dev/uiguide/default.htm"><font
color="#000000" size="2" face="verdana, arial, helvetica">(<b>http://www.microsoft.com/win32dev/uiguide/default.htm</b>).</font></a><font
color="#000000" size="2" face="verdana, arial, helvetica">
Originally designed for more traditional desktop applications,
many of its conventions and recommendations can be applied to Web
page design, especially the information on basic design
principles and methodology, when to use various types of
controls, layout, labeling, and design considerations for
international audiences. For example, Web page design benefits
from an iterative design process that includes prototyping and
usability assessment. You can read the Guidelines online now or
order a printed copy from your local bookseller.</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="2" face="verdana"><b>Consistency</b></font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="2"
face="verdana, arial, helvetica">Consistency is one the
fundamental design principles outlined in <i>The Windows
Interface Guidelines for Software Design</i>. Although HTML pages
can be produced with a great variety of styles and expression,
consider the following aspects of consistency in your design:</font></p>

<blockquote>
    <p><font color="#000000" size="2"
    face="verdana, arial, helvetica">Consistency of identity,
    purpose, and audience. Consider what kind of identity you
    want to project. Is it, for instance, one of seriousness or
    playfulness? Are you communicating corporate information or
    entertainment?</font></p>
    <p><font color="#000000" size="2"
    face="verdana, arial, helvetica">Consistency with de facto
    industry conventions. For example, terms like
    &quot;home,&quot; &quot;back,&quot; and &quot;forward&quot;
    have accepted interpretations among users and should be
    employed accordingly.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#000000" size="2"
    face="verdana, arial, helvetica">Internal design consistency.
    Layout and navigational interfaces need to be consistent from
    page to page. Common elements, such as headers, footers,
    navigation aids, fonts, color, and general layout
    conventions, should be presented consistently.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#000000" size="2"
    face="verdana, arial, helvetica">Consistency of metaphor.
    Metaphors can be useful in presenting interactive documents.
    For example, a movie site might be presented as the entrance
    to a theater. To a reasonable extent, your design should be
    consistent with the metaphors you use. A user clicking on the
    image of the theater&#146;s marquee may likely expect to see
    a movie listing.</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font color="#000000" size="2"
face="verdana, arial, helvetica">Remember that the goal of
consistency is not to promote least-common-denominator uniformity
or to limit innovation, but to ensure ease of use and
predictability.</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="3"
face="verdana, arial, helvetica"><b>Visual and aesthetic design</b></font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="2"
face="verdana, arial, helvetica">In desktop applications, design
typically focuses on the creation or editing of content. But HTML
page design focuses on the presentation and interaction of
content. So fonts, color, and general layout need to be even more
carefully considered. As in print or other media, simplicity of
design and an appropriate limitation of choices aids the
user&#146;s ability to scan and parse the information you
present.</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="2" face="verdana"><b>Using
color</b></font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="2"
face="verdana, arial, helvetica"><i>The Windows Interface
Guidelines for Software Design</i> also describes the effects of
color and how it can have a powerful impact on communication.
Color can motivate and enhance a user&#146;s experience or
distract and confuse. Because HTML page designs typically include
a richer use of color, the guide&#146;s recommendations on
careful usage and appropriate color combinations apply. For
example, the background color of your page may affect the
readability of any overlaying text.</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="2"
face="verdana, arial, helvetica">Also, when selecting colors, for
page elements as well as for graphics, try to stay within a
216-color palette so that your page won&#146;t remap the colors
of other applications that may be running. It may also ensure
better presentation across multiple platforms. You especially
want to avoid changing the colors in the palette reserved for the
standard system color settings. Read Kate Knight&#146;s article,
&quot;Decreasing Download Time Through Effective Color
Management,&quot; at </font><a

color="#000000" size="2" face="verdana, arial, helvetica"><b>http://www.microsoft.com/workshop/design/</b>.</font></a></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="2" face="verdana"><b>Using
fonts</b></font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="2"
face="verdana, arial, helvetica">Just because you can use a large
mix of font styles in an HTML document doesn&#146;t mean you
should. Good basic visual design suggests the following minimal
guidelines:</font></p>

<blockquote>
    <p><font color="#000000" size="2"
    face="verdana, arial, helvetica">Use a small set of fonts and
    sizes. Too many fonts and sizes make it difficult for users
    to understand the interrelationships of the information you
    present. Use fonts to create a visual hierarchy of
    information, with larger, bold fonts introducing specific
    topics.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#000000" size="2"
    face="verdana, arial, helvetica">Limit your use of
    all-capital letters . Use ALL CAPS only when you want to draw
    attention to small runs of characters. While words displayed
    in all capital letters attract the eye, used to excess, they
    make text harder to read.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#000000" size="2"
    face="verdana, arial, helvetica">Limit your use of bold
    fonts. Imagine how difficult it would be to communicate if
    someone were continually or indiscriminately shouting at you.
    While bold text attracts attention, it loses its impact when
    everything is bold. Limit bold text to titles, headings, and
    specific items to which you want to direct the user&#146;s
    attention.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#000000" size="2"
    face="verdana, arial, helvetica">Limit your use of italics.
    Used in isolation, italics can attract attention; but overuse
    tends to decrease the emphasis of text. And, because of
    display resolution, italicized words may be harder to read on
    the screen.</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font color="#000000" size="2" face="verdana"><b>Using
graphics</b></font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="2"
face="verdana, arial, helvetica">When incorporating graphics in
your HTML page designs, always consider your audience and the
impression you intend to communicate. You also should consider
the impact that graphics may have on user access to the document.
Graphic elements, particularly color images, typically consume
large amounts of memory, potentially slowing a document&#146;s
load time. However, there are a variety of schemes to present
graphics, such as the use of thumbnail graphics, compressed
formats, or graphics stored with reduced color depth&#151;but be
aware of the tradeoffs in quality that such schemes exact. For
example, <i>JPEG</i> (Joint Photographic Experts Group) images
are in a compressed format that works well for blending; however,
the format is &quot;lossy&quot;&#151;that is, detail may be lost
when the image is displayed at particular sizes. <i>GIF</i>
(Graphics Interchange Format) images are in a format that works
better for line art. GIF also supports transparency, better for
layering over existing graphics.</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="2"
face="verdana, arial, helvetica">You can support progressive
rendering (also known as interlaced formats) for some graphics or
include height and width information for the image so that the
space for the graphic appears while the image loads. These
techniques allow the user to browse a page and quickly get the
basic layout without having to wait for the graphics to load
completely. Remember to include descriptive information, or
&quot;alternate text,&quot; for all images. For more information,
see the following section on </font><a href="#design"><font
color="#000000" size="2" face="verdana, arial, helvetica">&quot;Designing
Accessible HTML Pages.&quot;</font></a><font color="#000000"
face="verdana, arial, helvetica"> </font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="2"
face="verdana, arial, helvetica">The size of your graphics not
only affects load time, but may also make document viewing and
navigation difficult. Having to scroll around a large graphic
image can be tedious. You may find that using many small graphics
is more effective and less time-consuming than using one large
image.</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="2"
face="verdana, arial, helvetica">Finally, consider the importance
of graphics to what you are trying to communicate. If your
graphics don&#146;t enhance visual presentation and
communication, avoid them.</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="2" face="verdana"><b>Using
sound, video, and animation</b></font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="2"
face="verdana, arial, helvetica">As <i>The Windows Guidelines for
Software Design</i> recommends, use sound primarily as an
enhancing quality. As with color, poor use of sound can annoy or
detract from a design. Consider that some users may not have
sound support, may operate in situations where sound should not
or cannot be heard, or may have hearing disabilities. As with
graphics, also consider the size of the sound file. The smaller
the file, the faster it will load and play.</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="2"
face="verdana, arial, helvetica">These guidelines also apply for
including video in your documents. It is typically better to give
the user the option to download the file, rather than to have it
automatically play when the page is loaded.</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="2"
face="verdana, arial, helvetica">The same may be true for
animations. Small, short animations can have an enhanced quality,
but long, large animation files should be made user downloadable.
Also, avoid using animation to display essential information,
without making it otherwise available to the user. For example,
displaying help information on an animated scrolling marquee can
prove frustrating for users.</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="3"
face="verdana, arial, helvetica"><b>Page design</b></font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="2"
face="verdana, arial, helvetica">The organization and navigation
you support for your HTML pages can have a significant impact on
their usability, particularly because users view active documents
interactively. How you organize the elements on a page can
dramatically affect how well they communicate. For example,
grouping establishes relationships between elements. Grouping can
be accomplished using lines, space, color, or patterns. Also
remember that users may view your page at different resolutions
and can change the size of fonts displayed on the page.
Therefore, it is important that you keep the layout flexible.</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="2" face="verdana"><b>Sizing
your page</b></font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="2"
face="verdana, arial, helvetica">Because HTML documents are
viewed on the screen, design your page size to take this into
account. A good rule of thumb is to limit the page size
vertically to what can be viewed in one to three screens of a
maximized window on a 640 × 480 display. (If you are certain
your target audience has different resolution, you may use a more
specific measurement.) For your initial page or any key
navigational pages, design for a single screen so that the user
can see the entire page without scrolling. Similarly, design your
page horizontally to fit within a maximized window. Larger
dimensions increase the likelihood that the user must scroll for
desired information. Usability studies have shown that users have
difficulty reading and retaining content for documents that
require extensive scrolling, or they may simply miss content
located outside the viewable area. In addition, larger pages
imply longer loading time. Users have little patience for long
load times.</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="2" face="verdana"><b>Displaying
update information</b></font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="2"
face="verdana, arial, helvetica">When creating Web documents for
any form of public consumption, you should include information
about the creation or modification of the document: the owner
(often the creator) of the document, and its creation or revision
date. When including date information, use an unambiguous format.
For example, a date formatted as 9-4-96 could be interpreted
either as September 4, 1996, or April 9, 1996. Using the text
format of the month provides a clearer interpretation.</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="2" face="verdana"><b>Supporting
downloads</b></font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="2"
face="verdana, arial, helvetica">Whenever you provide support for
users to download information, be sure to include the size of the
downloadable file so that the user can make an informed choice
about how long the download will take and how much local space it
will consume. For an example, try the download pages for the
Microsoft Excel Viewer</font><a
href="http://www.microsoft.com/msoffice/excel/"><font
color="#000000" size="2" face="verdana, arial, helvetica"> (<b>http://www.microsoft.com/msoffice/excel/</b>).</font></a></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="2" face="verdana"><b>Supporting
printing</b></font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="2"
face="verdana, arial, helvetica">A Web document typically
comprises several separate pages, which does not make it easy for
users to print the entire document. You should include other
mechanisms for this purpose; for example, provide an option on
the introductory page to download the entire document as a single
file. </p>

<p><a name="design"><font color="#000000" size="2"
face="verdana"><b>Designing navigation balance</b></font></a></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="2"
face="verdana, arial, helvetica">Designing navigation for a web
document requires more than simply breaking a document into
separate pages. You want to provide efficient ways to support
navigation throughout the document. Consider the following
guidelines:</font></p>

<blockquote>
    <p><font color="#000000" size="2"
    face="verdana, arial, helvetica">Give careful design
    consideration to your first page. You may want to provide a
    short summary or overview of the document and include links
    to key pages in the document. For documents that you update
    frequently, you may want to include links to new or recently
    updated pages.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#000000" size="2"
    face="verdana, arial, helvetica">When defining the topography
    of your navigational design, try to achieve a good balance
    between breadth and depth. Avoid a too-shallow hierarchy that
    forces the user to backtrack to a particular page in order to
    link to other pages. Such design makes navigation not only
    tiresome, but annoying if sounds are associated with a page
    that must be frequently traversed. However, forcing the user
    through multiple levels of menus before getting to actual
    information can also be annoying.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#000000" size="2"
    face="verdana, arial, helvetica">Provide an indication of
    where users are so that they can orient themselves within
    your navigational framework. Users can easily get lost in
    hierarchies. Display some type of visual cue to indicate
    where the user has come from. If all your pages display a
    common set of navigational links that correspond to specific
    pages, visually differentiate the link that relates to the
    page currently being viewed.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#000000" size="2"
    face="verdana, arial, helvetica">Avoid relying solely on
    navigation provided by the browser window. Many users have
    difficulty predicting what the Back command will do, because
    the command sometimes goes back at the same level and
    sometimes up a level, depending on the navigational design of
    the document. Providing navigation controls on the pages
    assists users with internal navigation in a document.
    However, be careful not to confuse Next and Previous with
    Back and Forward commands. Next and Previous imply navigation
    at the same level. Because in some situations, users may have
    difficulty understanding the difference between Previous and
    Back commands, it is better to be more specific in defining
    your general navigational controls. For example, instead of a
    Previous button, use a descriptive reference labeled as
    &quot;Page 2: Selecting a Product.&quot; Check out how the
    online version of the Windows guidelines updates its
    navigational links </font><a
    href="http://www.microsoft.com/win32dev/uiguide/default.htm"><font
    color="#000000" size="2" face="verdana, arial, helvetica">(<b>http://www.microsoft.com/win32dev/uiguide/default.htm</b>).</font></a><font
    color="#000000" size="2" face="verdana, arial, helvetica">
    Thumbnails (screen miniatures) of previous pages might also
    work to provide a reasonable cue, depending on how unique or
    identifiable the page may be.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#000000" size="2"
    face="verdana, arial, helvetica">Use descriptive definitions
    when defining links within the document. Avoid using the
    words &quot;Click Here&quot; when describing a link. Instead
    of using &quot;If you want information about selecting a
    product, <u>click here</u>&quot; or &quot;For more
    information, <u>click here</u>&quot;, use something like
    &quot;For more information, see <u>Selecting a Product</u>&quot;
    or &quot;The section, <u>Selecting a Product,</u> provides
    more information.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font color="#000000" size="2"
    face="verdana, arial, helvetica">Avoid including the
    mechanics of the navigation in your reference. Instead of
    saying &quot;You can read more about this in the tutorial,
    which is linked to the <u>home page</u>,&quot; say &quot;The <u>tutorial</u>
    provides more information.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font color="#000000" size="2"
    face="verdana, arial, helvetica">When providing your own
    navigation controls, always try to keep them visible. If the
    user must scroll to read the entire contents of the page and
    the navigation controls scroll off the page, also put the
    controls at the bottom of the page. The Windows design
    guidelines online follow this practice. Of course, you can
    also use frames to keep navigational controls on a page.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#000000" size="2"
    face="verdana, arial, helvetica">When composing the starting
    text to any page, never assume that all readers will be
    arriving at that page from the same place.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#000000" size="2"
    face="verdana, arial, helvetica">Avoid navigational dead
    ends. Use bi-directional links that allow the user to return
    to the previous page. At a minimum, consider a link back to a
    primary navigation page (such as the home page or table of
    contents page).</font></p>
    <p><font color="#000000" size="2"
    face="verdana, arial, helvetica">Avoid links to incomplete
    pages. Users find little value in being rewarded with an
    &quot;Under Construction&quot; banner.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#000000" size="2"
    face="verdana, arial, helvetica">Alert users when they will
    be going outside the context of your pages. Otherwise, users
    may become disoriented and have difficulty returning to your
    document. You may want to consider placing such links in a
    separate location or otherwise distinguishing them on the
    page, rather than mixing them in with the internal content.
    For example, you can include a graphic or description that
    makes a link to another document obvious to the user. To see
    how you might handle this, see the &quot;Other sites of
    interest&quot; section on </font><a
    href="http://www.microsoft.com/workshop/"><font
    color="#000000" size="2" face="verdana, arial, helvetica"><b>http://www.microsoft.com/workshop/</b>.</font></a></p>
    <p><font color="#000000" size="2"
    face="verdana, arial, helvetica">Avoid too many links on a
    page. While you want to support efficient navigation,
    remember that the greater the number of links, the less
    likely the user will read your entire page.</font></p>
