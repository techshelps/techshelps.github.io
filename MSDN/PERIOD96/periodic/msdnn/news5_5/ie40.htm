<p><font size="6">A Brief Walking Tour of Internet Explorer
4.0</font></p>

<p><font size="1"><i>by Nancy Winnick Cluts</i></font></p>

<p><font size="2">Many of you may not yet have had a chance to
sneak a peek at the user interface in Microsoft Internet Explorer
4.0. Known by the code name &quot;Nashville,&quot; the next
version of Internet Explorer includes enhanced Internet
navigation, new tools that automate Internet content, updates to
the common controls, and support for HTML built into the shell. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">Internet Explorer 4.0 was designed with the
following goals in mind:</font></p>

<blockquote>
    <p><font size="2">Make it <b>easy to browse</b> any content
    or information, not only folder contents. This means that the
    user can browse the Web directly via Windows Explorer now,
    and the Internet looks just like any other folder.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2"><b>Integrate</b> local machine, local area
    networks, and the Internet so that browsing among the
    different locations is seamless. This means that Windows
    Explorer and other portions of the shell don&#146;t
    discriminate among data locations.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Make it easy to browse the Web by offering <b>system-wide
    favorites</b> so that users can have all of their most
    cherished Web sites (like the <i>Win32Dev</i> site) available
    at the click of a mouse, as well as a history of sites
    visited and a map of your favorite Web sites. The ability to
    rate content (you don&#146;t want the kiddies reading
    offensive material like the latest rant by Rush Limbaugh, do
    you?) is also built in.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Make your computer more fun to use,
    bringing the content alive via <b>&quot;active content.&quot;</b>
    Tools will be available to automate the downloading of
    information and to schedule when information is gathered from
    your favorite Web sites. Additional tools will allow you to
    see whether something new has popped up on your favorites
    sites via icon handlers so that you will know whether or not
    you should check the sites. Finally, you will see the
    addition of some active desktop themes with &quot;live&quot;
    content that can be hooked up to the Internet, so the
    information that you see on your desktop is be updated daily,
    weekly, or at the interval you choose.</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="2">For a peek at what the new Windows Explorer
will look like when you install Internet Explorer 4.0, take a
look at the screen shot in Figure 1.</font></p>

<p><img src="Image10.gif" width="570" height="478"></p>

<p><font color="#0000ff" size="1" face="FrnkGothITC Bk BT">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Figure
1. Windows Explorer includes a view of the Internet.</i></font></p>

<p><font size="2">It&#146;s similar to the current version of
Windows Explorer, but if you look closely, you will notice that
the tree view on the left side of the window includes not only
the standard folders, but also a folder titled The Internet.
Within this folder are URLs to the most recently visited sites on
the Web. On the right side of the window, you may notice that the
list view used doesn&#146;t look like the usual large icon view.
The standard large icons are there, but there is also a blue box
containing the text &quot;Welcome to Internet Explorer 4.0!&quot;
This box has some hypertext that you can click to jump directly
to the associated Web site.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>What&#146;s new for Win32 developers</b></font></p>

<p><font size="2">A lot of what I&#146;ve shown you already gives
you a good idea of what will be provided for end users, but there
are some new enhancements that are specifically for developers
who use the Win32 application programming interface (API). The
major areas of change that concern developers are:</font></p>

<blockquote>
    <p><font size="2">Updates to the common controls</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Enhanced ability to extend the shell</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Use of Active Documents</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Folder aggregation</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">OLE Automation</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="3"><b>Enhancements to the common controls</b></font></p>

<p><font size="2">Many controls are built into Windows 95 and
supported by the Win32 API. These are called common controls.
Internet Explorer 4.0 provides some enhancements to these
existing controls. All common controls now support smooth
scrolling. The table below is a synopsis of some of the new
functionality that is supported in the common controls.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="verdana"><b>Combo box extension</b></font></p>

<p><font size="2">An extension to the current combo box, this new
control supports images with text. You set the style bits such
that images won&#146;t be painted when the item in the combo box
is being edited. This new combo box also gives the application
the ability to see whether the text in the edit portion of the
combo box has changed from its initial value. This will help if
you are doing any special validation for your edit field.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="verdana"><b>Date picker control</b></font></p>

<p><font size="2">The control called a date picker (no, it does
not pick fruit, and it doesn&#146;t get you an escort to a movie)
is a standard user interface that allows end users to set and
view the date. You will be provided the standard user interface,
including all of the controls needed, but you will need to
provide the &quot;guts&quot; of the code&#151;-the real work. A
new class called DATETIMEPICK_CLASS or
&quot;SysDateTimePick32&quot; in the common control header file
supports this new control.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Shell extensibility: How it works</b></font></p>

<p><font size="2">The Windows 95 shell is extensible. Internet
Explorer 4.0 takes that extensibility further and gives
developers the ability to really use the shell&#146;s built-in
functionality. The shell can host different views of the shell
views via the <b>IShellView</b> interface. For example, Windows
Explorer, the Printers folder, and MSN are all different shell
views. One cool thing about shell views is that they can merge
into the shell frame and into the shell&#146;s toolbar and status
bar.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="verdana"><b>Create active objects</b></font></p>

<p><font size="2">The Shell Explorer active object gives you the
ability to use part of the shell, with all of its functionality,
for your own application. You can use the events and methods that
the shell provides without having to rewrite the user interface
yourself. As a developer, some of the things that you can provide
to add value might be the ability to see detailed information
when a mouse hovers over an object, or new user interface
operations on objects such as a Delete button, or you might want
to expose your utility features directly in the shell (such as
compression or an undelete function).</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="verdana"><b>Add views to the shell</b></font></p>

<p><font size="2">As mentioned before, the shell can display
different views to the user if a developer uses the <b>IShellView</b>
interface. This allows you to add your own custom view to the
View menu of the shell. In fact, the Web view that is supported
in Internet Explorer 4.0 is an extension to the previous view
that the shell used. Custom shell views can be used only in
specific folders or for all folders of a particular type. You can
provide a different view by writing a full-blown shell extension
(as shown in the CABVIEW sample), or you can use an HTML
template.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Active Document support</b></font></p>

<p><font size="2">If you support Active Documents (DocObjs),
users will automatically be able to see your content in many
places such as Internet Explorer 3.0, the Windows shell (Windows
Explorer), or the Microsoft Office binder. If you are going to
support Active Documents, be sure to learn about and support
hyperlinking so that the navigation works properly to and from
your Active Document. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="verdana"><b>Active Document UI
guidelines</b></font></p>

<p><font size="2">Here are a few suggestions to keep in mind when
designing your Active Document:</font></p>

<p><font size="2">&#149; Be aware that you don&#146;t
automatically have your document open in the same pane that the
user is currently in. The default is to have a new window open
for your document. In order to open your document in the same
window, an author must specify that behavior for an authored
hyperlink.</font></p>

<p><font size="2">&#149; Prompt for saving changes when the user
leaves your document. Whenever the user clicks on the Back or
Next button and leaves your document, be sure to prompt the user
to save any changes he may have made in that session.</font></p>

<p><font size="2">&#149; Display minimal editing/adornment when
your document appears. Extra stuff just gets in the way. The
important stuff is the actual content, so attempt to optimize any
user interface enhancements for reading.</font></p>
