the Beans About Microsoft Visual J++</font></a></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="4"><b>First Java Development
Environment to Support COM Objects</b></font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="1"
face="verdana, arial, helvetica"><i>by Paul Johns</i></font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="2"
face="verdana, arial, helvetica">Microsoft&#146;s just pulled a
fresh cup of Java from its espresso machine. It&#146;s called
Microsoft Visual J++, and it&#146;s a lot more than just another
round of caffeinated puns. It&#146;s just what the good doctor
ordered. Visual J++ is a strong and hearty brew&#151;more so
because with Visual J++, Microsoft has poured a double shot.</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="2"
face="verdana, arial, helvetica">First shot: Visual J++ is rich
and tasty enough to set a new standard for convenience and power
in Java development and debugging systems. Second shot: As the
first Java development environment to support creation and use of
COM objects, Visual J++ gives you a real kick: unprecedented
power to create solutions for use on the Internet, on your
Intranet, or as standalone applications.</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="2" face="verdana"><b>Java
integrated</b></font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="2"
face="verdana, arial, helvetica">Visual J++ is Microsoft&#146;s
implementation of Java integrated into the Microsoft Developer
Studio Integrated Development Environment (IDE). If you&#146;re
familiar with Developer Studio, you already know how its
integration of a family of tools&#151;including the Microsoft
Developer Network, Visual SourceSafe, Visual C++, Visual Test,
and Microsoft Fortran PowerStation&#151;makes tough development
tasks easy. And you know how the world-class debugger makes it a
snap to find bugs (assuming your code has any). If you
haven&#146;t used Developer Studio, you&#146;re in for a
treat&#151;and incredible productivity. (It&#146;s better than a
double tall mocha!)</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="2"
face="verdana, arial, helvetica">Real Java lovers want to drink
their espresso anywhere&#151;they want their Java applets to run
on <i>any</i> platform. That&#146;s why the code generated by
Visual J++ is compatible with <i>all</i> Java execution
environments, including Netscape Navigator.</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="2"
face="verdana, arial, helvetica">Visual J++ comes with Microsoft
Internet Explorer 3.0, which includes Microsoft&#146;s Java
execution environment, the reference-standard Java execution
environment for Windows platforms. The execution platform
includes the high-performance Just in Time (JIT) compiler, which
runs Java many, many times faster than the fastest Java
interpreter. Finally, it is the first Java execution environment
to allow seamless integration of Java applets and ActiveX
components.</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="2" face="verdana"><b>Java
and ActiveX</b></font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="2"
face="verdana, arial, helvetica">Java is strong technology all by
itself, but when you combine it with ActiveX, you can quickly and
easily do things that&#146;ll make your boss say, &quot;Wow!
That&#146;s cool&#151;and useful!&quot; (Hint: that&#146;s a
great time to ask for a raise.)</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="2"
face="verdana, arial, helvetica">Visual J++ is the first tool to
let developers quickly and easily use ActiveX components (also
known as COM objects) directly from within Java programs. With
Visual J++, using ActiveX components is as easy and natural as
using a Java class. Components currently available include those
providing database access, distributed systems, and
high-performance multimedia. Because ActiveX components can be
written in any language (including Java), using ActiveX
components from within your Java program provides a great way to
reuse code written in another language, including legacy code.
That sure beats having to grow your own beans by writing
everything from scratch in Java. And, of course, you can use
Visual J++ to automate any application that provides a COM
automation interface&#151;including such applications as
Microsoft Excel.</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="2"
face="verdana, arial, helvetica">As noted, Visual J++ makes it
easy for you to write ActiveX components. These components can be
used anywhere that any COM component can be used&#151;by
ActiveX-enabled browsers, by applications that can use COM
objects (including many Microsoft applications), and by programs
written in any language. And with distributed COM (DCOM), you can
even execute your Java COM components on a server and communicate
with clients over a network.</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="2"
face="verdana, arial, helvetica">I hear you asking, &quot;But
isn&#146;t ActiveX proprietary? Won&#146;t I lock myself into
Windows if I use or write ActiveX components?&quot;</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="2"
face="verdana, arial, helvetica">In a word, &quot;No.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="2" face="verdana"><b>Open
standard</b></font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="2"
face="verdana, arial, helvetica">Microsoft is turning over
ownership of ActiveX specifications&#151;including COM and
DCOM&#151;to a neutral standards organization (of which Microsoft
will be but one of many members). So ActiveX will soon be
compatible with all leading coffeemakers and computing
platforms&#151;a true open standard.</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="2"
face="verdana, arial, helvetica">Also, Microsoft and partners are
working hard to implement ActiveX on the Macintosh and UNIX
platforms. Microsoft will ship ActiveX-enabled Internet Explorer
3.0 for these platforms soon.</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="2"
face="verdana, arial, helvetica">Now that you know <i>what</i>
you can do with Visual J++, let&#146;s look at <i>how</i> easy it
is to brew great Java applets and applications using Developer
Studio. (If you already use Developer Studio, you already know
about most of these features.)</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="2" face="verdana"><b>Sifting
through the beans: Developer Studio Project Workspace window</b></font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="2"
face="verdana, arial, helvetica">The Developer Studio Project
Workspace window makes it easy to find what you need to see
through its three views: </font><a name="_Toc361751843"><font
color="#000000" size="2" face="verdana, arial, helvetica"><b>ClassView</b></font></a><font
color="#000000" size="2" face="verdana, arial, helvetica"> shows
the classes, methods, and variables in your project; <b>FileView</b>
shows all the files in your project&#151;whether they&#146;re
Java source code, HTML, graphics, or other formats; and <b>InfoView</b>
allows users to browse and search online documentation. From any
view, a double-click on the icon that represents what you want to
see brings it up in the right-hand window&#151;much like Windows
Explorer. Right-clicking on those same icons gives you a menu of
common things you might want to do&#151;for instance,
right-clicking on a class name allows you to quickly add methods
or variables.</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="2" face="verdana"><b>Wizards
give you perfect espresso the first time</b></font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="2"
face="verdana, arial, helvetica">To make brewing your first Java
applet&#151;and every applet after that&#151;a snap, Microsoft
has extended its Wizard technology to Visual J++. The <b>Java
applet AppWizard</b> provides a wide variety of options from
which you can choose:</font></p>

<blockquote>

<p><font color="#00FFFF" size="1" face="FrnkGothITC Bk BT">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Java
Applet Wizard</i></font></p>

<p><font size="2">When you&#146;ve chosen your option, the Java
Applet Wizard generates the skeleton of the applet for you. You
can even run it before you add any code. For a complete applet,
all you have to do is add code to perform the actions you need.</font></p>

<p><font size="2">If you don&#146;t want to start from scratch,
it&#146;s easy to make an empty Visual J++ project and to import
an existing Java program. This allows you to use the full power
of Visual J++, including the debugger, on projects someone else
created.</font></p>

<p><font size="2">The <b>Resource Wizard</b> converts
Windows-based dialog box and menu resources into standard Java
source code, letting you reuse existing dialog box templates and
menu resources. The ability to use Developer Studio&#146;s visual
dialog box and menu editors makes laying out forms and menus much
easier.</font></p>

<p><font size="2">And you don&#146;t have to use Microsoft coffee
with Visual J++: it supports AppWizards built by third-party
companies.</font></p>

<p><a name="_Toc361751847"><font size="2"
face="verdana"><b>Debugging in Visual J++</b></font></a></p>

<p><font size="2">The Visual J++ debugger advances the state of
Java applet debugging. First, it allows you to debug an applet
while it&#146;s running in Internet Explorer 3.0. In fact, you
can debug multiple applets on the same Web page simultaneously.
And, of course, you can debug multithreaded applets and ActiveX
components written in Java. You can even debug applets you
download from the Web, including source-level debugging (if you
have access to the source and to a version of the applet with
standard-format debugging information&#151;most applets on the
Web include debugging information).</font></p>

<p><font size="2">The Visual J++ debugger provides the same
functionality as Developer Studio, including the <b>Call Stack</b>
window, which allows you to see how you got where you are, and
the <b>Watch</b> window, which displays variables&#146; values. <b>DataTips</b>
let you merely point to an expression to display its value.</font></p>

<p><font size="2">Unique to Visual J++, the <b>Variables</b>
window features a tree-view hierarchy of classes and three panes:
a &quot;locals&quot; pane with information on variables in scope;
an &quot;auto&quot; pane, which is automatically updated to show
expressions of interest based on the current statement; and a
&quot;this&quot; pane, which displays the variables of the
current class object.</font></p>

<p><a name="_Toc361751852"><font size="2"
face="verdana"><b>Editing code</b></font></a></p>

<p><font size="2">Visual J++ source editor gives developers lot
of flexibility, custom key bindings and emulations of the popular
BRIEF and Epsilon editors. It even extends syntax coloring to
HTML files!</font></p>

<p><font size="2">The popular resource editor from Visual C++
helps you quickly create menus and form-based applications. Just
create a Windows dialog box template and/or menu resource using a
visual resource editor, and then run the Resource Wizard to
generate the Java code.</font></p>

<p><font size="2">Visual J++ also includes an image editor for
creating Java-compliant .GIF and JPEG files and converting
bitmaps into .GIF and JPEG files.</font></p>

<p><font size="2">Finally, Developer Studio allows you to have
projects with many types of source files&#151;Visual J++, Visual
C++, HTML.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="verdana"><b>How to make great
