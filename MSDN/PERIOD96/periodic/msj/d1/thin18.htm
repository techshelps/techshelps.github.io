<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>To summarize, the thin client three-tier model builds on your
expertise as a Visual C++ developer for creating powerful
applications for the Internet. The model lets you effectively use
Java, giving your applications the dynamic cross-platform
deployment mechanism needed for the Internet. It also provides
the client side of your applications with just enough application
logic to optimally process and communicate user interaction
across the Internet to the server. And, best of all, you
don&#146;t have to be a Java guru to build real Internet
applications that solve real problems with Java. </p>

<p>The excitement surrounding the Internet is here to stay. The
challenge to you is to apply the litmus test as you evaluate the
profusion of frameworks and tools available in the months ahead.
Then, while everyone else is trying to figure out which way
they&#146;re going, you can get some real work done. </p>
