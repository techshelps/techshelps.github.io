<h2>The Application Building Litmus Test</h2>

<p>So you&#146;re convinced that you want to take advantage of
the Internet for deploying applications. How can you be sure that
the tools you select or the methods you employ for building and
publishing your applications are going to yield the best results?
Let&#146;s develop a litmus test to ensure that the solution you
choose will meet your objectives. When building applications for
the Internet, ask yourself the following questions: What
architectural features mesh most logically with the structure of
the Internet? What are the requirements for a development
framework to create Internet object-based applications using
Visual C++? Why didn&#146;t I become an accountant? How can I
best use an Internet client/server architecture with the Visual
C++ development environment I already use? What is a good
Internet application development solution, not just for the
Internet of today but into the future? </p>

<p>Let&#146;s take a brief look at some of the features you need
to get your C++ objects to the Web. </p>
