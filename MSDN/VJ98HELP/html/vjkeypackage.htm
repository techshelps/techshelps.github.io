<h1><a name="vjkeypackage"></a>package</h1>
<p>
The <b>package</b> keyword is used by Java to specify which package the code in the file is located in. Java code that is part of a particular package has access to all classes in the package, and all non-private methods and variables in those classes.</p>
<p>
The package statement must come before anything else (except comments and conditional compilation directives) in a Java file. If the package statement is omitted from a Java file, the code in that file becomes part of an unnamed default package.</p>
