<h1><a name="vjmsgcompilererrorj0204"></a>Compiler Error J0204</h1>
<p class=dt>
<b>Cannot access protected member 'identifier' in class 'identifier' via a qualifier of type 'identifier'</b></p>
<p>
The compiler detected that a class in one package, that is extending a class in another package, attempted to access a protected member of the base class using an instance of the base class. This error usually occurs when a class attempts to access members of its base class through an instance other than <b>this</b>, <b>super</b>, or an instance of the derived class. Ensure that the base class's protected member is accessed using the <b>this</b> or <b>super</b> keyword, or an instance of the derived class and compile again.</p>
<p>
The following example illustrates this error:</p>
<pre><code>/*(source located in a file called Point.java located in the Boxes package directory) */
package Boxes;

public class Point{
 &nbsp; protected int x, y;
 &nbsp; //Do other meaningful code here
}
//(source located in a file called simple.java)
import Boxes.Point;

public class Simple extends Point{
 &nbsp; public void method1(Point p){
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; super.x = 0; //this is OK!
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; p.x = 0; /*error: cannot use a protected member
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for usage other than extending it. */
 &nbsp; }
}
</code></pre>
