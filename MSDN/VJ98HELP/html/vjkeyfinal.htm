<h1><a name="vjkeyfinal"></a>final</h1>
<p>
The <b>final</b> keyword is used as a modifier for classes, methods, and variables.</p>
<p>
When the final keyword appears in a <a href="vjkeyclass.htm">class</a> declaration, it means that the class may never be subclassed or overridden. This prevents over-specialization of a particular class. In some sense, the person who created the class considered any further changes to be tangential to its primary purpose.</p>
<p>
When the final keyword appears in a method declaration, it means that the method may never be overridden. (Note that methods declared with the keywords <a href="vjkeystatic.htm">static</a> or <a href="vjkeyprivate.htm">private</a> are implicitly final.)</p>
<p>
When the final keyword appears in a variable declaration, it means that the variable has an assigned value that can never be changed.</p>
