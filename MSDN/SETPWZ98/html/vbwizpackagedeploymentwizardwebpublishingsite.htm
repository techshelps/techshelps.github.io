<p>
Allows you to specify information about the location to which you want to deploy your package. The information includes the URL of the site, the publishing method (HTTP Post, FTP, and so on), and whether or not the contents of .cab files should be unpacked and installed on the Web server.</p>
<p>
This screen is available only when you have selected Web Publishing as your method of deployment on the Deployment Method screen.</p>
<h3>Options</h3>
<p class=dt>
<b>URL</b></p>
<p class=indent>
Indicates the URL (uniform resource locator) of the Web site to which you want to send the package. For example, you might enter http://www.myserver.com.</p>
<p class=dt>
<b>Publishing Method</b></p>
<p class=indent>
Indicates the protocol that will be used to send the package to the Web site.</p>
<p class=atl>
<B><b>Note</b></B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the URL and publishing method that you chose are not saved as a Web Publishing site, you will be asked if you want to save the information as a Web Publishing site when you click the Next or Finish button. If you choose to save the information, you will be prompted for a site name. Saving the information as a site has two advantages: it verifies that the information is valid, and it saves time in future deployments.</p><p class=dt>
<b>Unpack and Install Cabs on Server</b></p>
<p class=indent>
When selected, unpacks the .cab files on the server, installing the contents. This option is unavailable for some publishing methods.</p>
<p class=atl>
<B><b>Note</b></B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you choose to unpack and install .cab files but the wizard has not successfully unpacked .cab files at this URL before, you will be asked if you want to verify the ability to unpack when you click Next or Finish. If you choose to verify, the wizard will attempt to unpack a sample .cab file on the server.</p><p class=dt>
<b>Help</b></p>
<p class=indent>
Displays the help topic for this step. You can also press F1 for help.</p>
<p class=dt>
<b>Cancel</b></p>
<p class=indent>
Cancels your previous actions and closes the deployment portion of the Package and Deployment Wizard.</p>
<p class=dt>
<b>Back</b></p>
<p class=indent>
Moves you to the previous step.</p>
<p class=dt>
<b>Next</b></p>
<p class=indent>
Moves you to the next step.</p>
<p class=dt>
<b>Finish</b></p>
<p class=indent>
Deploys your package using the settings you selected and displays a report at the end of the process. Available only when you have provided enough information for the Package and Deployment Wizard to successfully deploy the package.</p>
<p class=tl>
If you chose a pre-existing script, the Finish button is available because the Package and Deployment Wizard assumes that the script contains all of the information needed to deploy the package.</P></BODY>
