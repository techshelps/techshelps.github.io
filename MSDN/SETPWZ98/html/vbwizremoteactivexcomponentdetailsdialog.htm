<p>
Allows you to provide or modify the settings necessary for the end user's machine to find and connect to a remote server. When end users install the package, they will be required to provide any information necessary for the connection that you did not enter here.</p>
<p>
This screen only appears if your package includes one or more .vbr files. These and all included files are listed on the Included Files screen; they are either needed by your project, manually added to the package on the Included Files screen, or needed by another file in the package.</p>
<h3>Options</h3>
<p class=dt>
<b>Remote Servers List</b></p>
<p class=indent>
Displays the name and current location of each .vbr file, and provides columns in which you can specify the necessary connection settings:</p>
<p class=tl>
<B><b>Net Address</b></B> — The network address of the machine where the server application will be installed. If you leave this column blank, your users will be asked for this information when they install the package.</P><p class=tl>
<B><b>Connection Type</b></B> — Choose whether your application uses DCOM (Distributed Component Object Model) or RA (Remote Automation) to access the remote component.</P><p class=tl>
<B><b>Protocol</b></B> — Displays a list of the network protocols from which you can choose. Available only if you selected RA (Remote Automation) as the connection type. If you want the end user to supply the information, choose "(End user must specify)."</P><p class=tl>
<B><b>Authentication</b></B> — Available only if you selected RA (Remote Automation) as the connection type. Required. For more information, see RPC Security in your Windows NT documentation.</P><p class=tl>
When you move the mouse cursor over an entry in the remote servers list, a tooltip appears, listing the files for which the given file is needed or stating that the given file was manually added to the list.</P><p class=dt>
<b>Help</b></p>
<p class=indent>
Displays the help topic for this step. You can also press F1 for help.</p>
<p class=dt>
<b>Cancel</b></p>
<p class=indent>
Cancels your previous actions and closes the packaging portion of the Package and Deployment Wizard.</p>
<p class=dt>
<b>Back</b></p>
<p class=indent>
Moves you to the previous step.</p>
<p class=dt>
<b>Next</b></p>
<p class=indent>
Moves you to the next step.</p>
<p class=dt>
<b>Finish</b></p>
<p class=indent>
Creates a package using the settings you selected and displays a report at the end of the process. Available only when you have provided enough information for the Package and Deployment Wizard to successfully create a package.</p>
<p class=tl>
If you chose a pre-existing script, the Finish button is available because the Package and Deployment Wizard assumes that the script contains all of the information needed to create the package.</P></BODY>
