<p>
Displays a list of the files that will be included in the package and allows you to add additional files to the package or to remove unwanted files.</p>
<h3>Options</h3>
<p class=dt>
<b>Included Files List</b></p>
<p class=indent>
Displays the name and current location of each file that will be included in the package. The main project executable file is initially selected.</p>
<p class=tl>
To remove files, clear the checkbox to the left of the file name. If you remove a file with dependencies, all of its dependency files are also removed. (Removed files remain listed. If you have removed a file mistakenly, check its check box.)</P><p class=tl>
When you move the mouse cursor over an entry in this list, a tooltip appears, listing the files for which the given file is needed or stating that the given file was manually added to the list.</P><p class=dt>
<b>Add</b></p>
<p class=indent>
Displays the Add File dialog box where you can locate and choose a file to add to your package. The Add File dialog box is a standard Windows dialog box. When you add a file, the wizard searches for dependencies of the file and adds them as well.</p>
<p class=dt>
<b>Help</b></p>
<p class=indent>
Displays the help topic for this step. You can also press F1 for help.</p>
<p class=dt>
<b>Cancel</b></p>
<p class=indent>
Cancels your previous actions and closes the packaging portion of the Package and Deployment Wizard.</p>
<p class=dt>
<b>Back</b></p>
<p class=indent>
Moves you to the previous step.</p>
<p class=dt>
<b>Next</b></p>
<p class=indent>
Moves you to the next step.</p>
<p class=dt>
<b>Finish</b></p>
<p class=indent>
Creates a package using the settings you selected and displays a report at the end of the process. Available only when you have provided enough information for the Package and Deployment Wizard to successfully create a package.</p>
<p class=tl>
If you chose a pre-existing script, the Finish button is available because the Package and Deployment Wizard assumes that the script contains all of the information needed to create the package.</P></BODY>
