<p>
Lists the ActiveX objects in your project and lets you mark selected components as safe for initialization and/or safe for scripting.
<ul type=disc>
<li>
If you mark a component as safe for scripting, no component should be able to access script in this component that could create, change, or delete arbitrary files, even temporary ones, or change system settings.<br><br></li>
<li>
If you mark a component safe for initializing, initialization data should not be able to cause the component to create, change or delete arbitrary files, even temporary ones, or change system settings.</li>
</ul>
<p>
For Internet installations only. Making a component safe means that you claim it will not do harm to the end user’s machine.</p>
<p>
By marking a component as safe for scripting or safe for initialization, you are guaranteeing that your component can never corrupt or cause undesirable behavior on an end user’s machine, even if used in a Web page that you yourself did not author. Marking a component as either safe for scripting or safe for initialization implies that you are accepting liability for this guarantee.</p>

<B><b>Note</b></B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You must have your .cab files signed in order to take full advantage of these options. For more information about .cab files, see , "Downloading ActiveX Components" in the Building Internet Applications book of <i>the Component Tools Guide</i>.</p>

<B><b>Note</b></B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Objects that implement the IObjectSafety interface are not listed on this screen. The IObjectSafety interface is a separate mechanism for marking an object as safe for initialization and/or scripting.</p><p class=dt>
