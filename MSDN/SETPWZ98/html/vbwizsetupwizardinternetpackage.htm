<p>
Allows you to specify the location from which an Internet package should retrieve necessary files during installation. When you choose to create an Internet package, the wizard creates a single .cab file, known as the <i>primary .cab</i>, that contains:
<ul type=disc>
<li>
Your application's components, such as the ActiveX control, ActiveX DLL, or ActiveX EXE for the application.<br><br></li>
<li>
The .<a href="vbwizinffile.htm">inf file</a> that contains installation information and links to other .cab files that contain other needed files and installation information. <br><br></li>
<li>
Reserved space for digital signatures.<br><br></li>
<li>
All files that are not in other .cab files.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Additional files needed for your application can be included in your primary .cab file, or they can be referenced through other, secondary .cabs. All run-time components such as msvbvm60.dll, custom controls, and data access components are packaged into separate .cab files, digitally signed by Microsoft, and placed on the Microsoft Web site. You can tell the package to retrieve such files from the .cab files on the Microsoft Web site or you can download the .cab files from the Microsoft Web site and tell the package to retrieve the run-time components from your local copies of the .cab files.</p>
<h3>Options</h3>
<p class=dt>
<b>Files</b></p>
<p class=indent>
Displays a list of all of the files in your package. Select each file and set the retrieval options for it in the other columns of the table. You can indicate any of the following options by selecting the file and then selecting the appropriate radio button.</p>
<p class=dt>
<b>Include in this cab</b></p>
<p class=indent>
Indicates that the related file should be packaged in the primary .cab for the application, rather than retrieved from another location.</p>
<p class=dt>
<b>Download from Microsoft Web site</b></p>
<p class=indent>
Indicates that the file should be retrieved from a .cab file on the Microsoft Web site during the installation process.</p>
<p class=dt>
<b>Download from alternate cab</b></p>
<p class=indent>
Indicates that the file should be retrieved from a .cab file found at an alternate location. You must enter the URL or UNC location where the .cab can be found, and the .cab name.</p>
<p class=tl>
This information is placed in the .inf file. If you put invalid information in the Download from alternate .cab field, you can edit the .inf file that is located in the \Support directory and manually rebuild the .cab file using Makecab.exe or using the batch file (.bat) that is provided. See your <i>ActiveX SDK</i> for additional information.</P><p class=dt>
<b>Help</b></p>
<p class=indent>
Displays the help topic for this step. You can also press F1 for help.</p>
<p class=dt>
<b>Cancel</b></p>
<p class=indent>
Cancels your previous actions and closes the packaging portion of the Package and Deployment Wizard.</p>
<p class=dt>
<b>Back</b></p>
<p class=indent>
Moves you to the previous step.</p>
<p class=dt>
<b>Next</b></p>
<p class=indent>
Moves you to the next step.</p>
<p class=dt>
<b>Finish</b></p>
<p class=indent>
Creates a package using the settings you selected and displays a report at the end of the process. Available only when you have provided enough information for the Package and Deployment Wizard to successfully create a package.</p>
<p class=tl>
If you chose a pre-existing script, the Finish button is available because the Package and Deployment Wizard assumes that the script contains all of the information needed to create the package.</P></BODY>
