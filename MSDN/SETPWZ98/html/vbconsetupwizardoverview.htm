<p>
The Package and Deployment Wizard is a tool that helps you create installation packages for your Visual Basic applications and install them to your end-users' computers. You can also use the Package and Deployment Wizard to create dependency (.dep) files.</p>
<p class=indent>
<B><b>Note</b></B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You must have a saved and compiled project before you can run this wizard.</p>
<p>
The Package and Deployment Wizard provides a number of options for distributing your application, including the creation of:
<ul type=disc>
<li>
Standard packages, designed to be installed by a setup.exe program.<br><br></li>
<li>
Internet packages, designed to be downloaded from a Web site.<br><br></li>
<li>
Dependency files that can be distributed with your components.</li>
</ul>
<p>
The wizard packages your application components into compressed cabinet (.cab) files. You can create a single .cab, or multiple .cab files that can be copied onto floppy disks. In addition, you can save your settings as you work in the wizard as scripts that you can reuse if you need to package or deploy the same application again.</p>
<p>
You can start the Package and Deployment Wizard as an add-in, or as a stand-alone application. To start it as an add-in, load the wizard using the Add-In Manager dialog box, then run it by clicking on the menu item on the Add-Ins menu. To start it as a stand-alone component, click the Package and Deployment Wizard icon from the Microsoft Visual Basic 6.0 group on the Start menu.</p>
<p class=indent>
<B><b>Note</b></B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Package and Deployment Wizard is not a disk duplication tool. If you want to make copies of your master distribution disks, use a disk copying application.</p>
