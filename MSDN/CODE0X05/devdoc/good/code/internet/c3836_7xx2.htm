<pre><code>The \Mssdk\Samples\Internet directory contains samples   <br>(written in C/C++, Visual Basic, Java, and/or HTML) demonstrating <br>different internet or intranet related technologies as described  <br>below. See also the \Mssdk\Samples\NetDS samples for additional  <br>networking sample code. <br> <br>* IE         - Internet Explorer capabilities and extensions  <br>               (including wininet) <br>* IIS        - Internet Information Server; ISAPI and Active Server <br>* Index      - programmatic access to the Content Indexing catalogs <br>* MSAgent    - demonstrating "interactive personalities" from web pages <br>* MSChat     - ActiveX chat control and various things you can do with it <br>* NetMeeting - NetMeeting ActiveX control and related tools <br>* Scripting  - ActiveX scripting <br>* WebPost    - APIs for updating content on Web Sites <br> <br>The build environment (headers, libraries, and minimum build  <br>tools) for the Platform SDK must be installed in order to build  <br>any of the samples in the \Mssdk\Samples\Internet directory. The  <br>most recent version of the build environment is available at  <br>http://www.microsoft.com/msdn/sdk/platform.htm.  <br>Some components may also require you to install runtimes, depending  <br>on the platform on which you are trying to run the sample.  <br>Redistributables are available in the \Mssdk\Redist subdirectory  <br>on the Platform SDK compact disc.  <br> <br>Documentation for the components listed above can be installed  <br>from the Platform SDK compact disc, or can be viewed online at  <br>http://premium.microsoft.com/msdn/library/. This is a FREE service;  <br>registration is necessary. <br> <br>If you do not see any subdirectories in the \Mssdk\Samples\Internet  <br>node, you'll need to install the Internet, Intranet, and Extranet  <br>Samples component from the Platform SDK compact disc or download and  <br>install it from http://www.microsoft.com/msdn/sdk/platform.htm.  <br> <br></code></pre>
