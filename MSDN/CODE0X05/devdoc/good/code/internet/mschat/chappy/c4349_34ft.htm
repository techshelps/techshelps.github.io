<pre><code>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ <br>             Microsoft Chat Control 1.0 &amp; Microsoft Chat Protocol Control 2.0 Readme File          <br>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ <br> <br>             (c) Copyright Microsoft Corporation, 1997 <br> <br> <br>HOW TO USE THIS DOCUMENT <br>======================== <br> <br>To view Readme.txt on screen in Windows Notepad, maximize the Notepad  <br>window. <br> <br>To print Readme.txt, open the file in Notepad or another word processor, <br>and then on the File menu, click Print. <br> <br> <br>CONTENTS <br>======== <br> <br>INSTALLING THE CHAT CONTROLS <br>OVERVIEW OF THE MICROSOFT CHAT CONTROL SAMPLES <br>KNOWN PROBLEMS <br> <br> <br>INSTALLING THE CHAT CONTROLS <br>============================ <br> <br>The Samples will work only with Windows 95 and Windows NT 4.0.  <br> <br>To install the chat control, run the chatcntl.exe in the \complib\i386 directory. <br>This executable program will: <br> <br>1. Copy the binaries (chatsock.dll, mschat.ocx and mschatpr.ocx) to your  <br>   System directory.  <br> <br>2. Register the controls as an OCX. <br> <br>OVERVIEW OF THE MICROSOFT CHAT CONTROL SAMPLES <br>============================================== <br> <br>The chatocx directory contains the following sample code, which  <br>demonstrates the use of the control in web pages, Microsoft Visual Basic  <br>Scripting and Visual Basic: <br> <br>  Four Visual Basic applications that use the Chat Control 1.1 <br> <br>  Five HTML web pages that use the chat control 1.1 and use Visual Basic Scripting <br> <br>  One MFC chat application that uses chat control 1.1 <br> <br>  5 samples that use Chat Control 2.0 beta 1 <br> <br>For more information on the samples, see the Sample.txt file in this directory.  <br>In addition, each subdirectory under Chatocx contains a text file with more  <br>detailed information on that sample. <br> <br>The samples requires that you have Visual Basic 4.0 runtime, mschat.ocx and  <br>chatsock.dll installed on your system. If you have problems running any of the  <br>applications you can use the Application Setup Wizard in Visual Basic 4.0 to create  <br>a setup program, which will create an installation program that installs all the  <br>required files for the samples. The Application setup wizard will not detect that  <br>the applications need to install chatsock.dll, you will need to add this to the  <br>list of files to install, when you run the wizard. <br> <br>KNOWN PROBLEMS <br>============== <br>If you experience any problems connecting to the chat server with any of <br>the demos, please try to connect again, since the chat server might be down  <br>at this time.  If you continue to experience this problem, you may not be  <br>able to connect to the chat server if you are using a proxy server or firewall  <br>that doesn't pass port "6667". The system administrator for your Internet <br>Service Provider or your company can tell you if they allow pass through for <br>port "6667".  <br> </code></pre>
