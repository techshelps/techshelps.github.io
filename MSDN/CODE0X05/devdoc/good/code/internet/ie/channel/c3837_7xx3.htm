<pre><code>The files contained in this directory (..\Samples\Channel) can be used <br>to subscribe to a sample channel. To make the channel work properly <br>these files must be placed on an HTTP server, and the path names in the <br>color.cdf and scrnsave.htm files must reflect their actual URL. To <br>subscribe to the channel, either double-click the color.cdf file or <br>right-click the color.cdf file and select "subscribe" on the context <br>menu. The "subscribe" option will only appear if the local machine has <br>Internet Explorer 4.0 installed. <br> <br>The small *.gif files (red, green, and blue) are displayed in the <br>Channels Explorer bar to represent various channel items. The <br>Homepage.htm file is the top-level page assigned to the sample color <br>channel. The browser displays this page whenever the channel is <br>launched. Page1.htm, Page2.htm, and Page3.htm are displayed in the <br>browser whenever the corresponding red, green, or blue page is clicked <br>in the Channels Explorer bar. The Logo_big.gif file is displayed in the <br>Browser Channels Explorer bar and the Logo_med.gif file is displayed in <br>the desktop Channel Bar (if the "View as Web page" option is enabled). <br>Color.cdf is the Channel Definition Format file that defines the sample <br>color channel. <br></code></pre>
