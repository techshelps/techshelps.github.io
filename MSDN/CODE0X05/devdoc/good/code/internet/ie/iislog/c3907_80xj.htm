<pre><code>======================================================================= <br> <br>Release notes for the IISLog Sample of the Internet Client Software  <br>Development Kit: <br> <br>Copyright (c) Microsoft Corporation, 1997 <br>======================================================================= <br> <br>Description: <br> <br>The IISLog sample demonstrates how to receive and parse the IE4 user <br>logging profile from the server side. When the user subscribes to a <br>channel which has hit count logging specified and they later browse to <br>those pages, IE40 will log the hit counts and post them back to the <br>server when the channel subscribed to gets updated. The user can <br>globally turn logging off from the control panel UI if desired. IE40 <br>uses the W3C extended server log file format and may encode a posted <br>string as directed in the CDF file associated with the channel <br>subscribed to. This sample shows how to parse the extended server log <br>file format and merge to a W3C flexible log file format. This sample <br>also shows how to decode a posted string if it is encoded using <br>pluggable protocol filters. IISLog.htm is a sample page to post a string <br>to logparse.dll on the server side. The posted string should simulate <br>the extended server log file format. <br> <br>Building procedure: <br> <br>The Logparse ISAPI DLL was created and built using VC++ 5.0 ISAPI <br>extension wizard. VC++ 5.0 is required to build this sample. It links <br>to urlmon.lib to obtain the pluggable protocol filters. <br> <br>Install the ISAPI DLL: <br> <br>You need IIS 4.0 or greater to run this sample. Copy LogParse.dll to <br>that server's scripts directory. A detailed description of how to <br>install an ISAPI DLL can be found in the MSDN library. </code></pre>
