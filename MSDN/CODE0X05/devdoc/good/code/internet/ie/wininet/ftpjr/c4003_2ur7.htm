<pre><code>Overview: <br>FtpJr sample demonstrates FTP WinInet APIs. FtpJr mimics FTP client, which comes <br>with Windows 95 or with Windows NT, but it is entirely written with WinInet APIs. <br> <br>Usage: <br>1.  To start the sample with the direct connection to the Internet:  <br>    c:&gt; ftpjr    <br>2.  To start the sample with the proxy connection to the Internet:  <br>    c:&gt; ftpjr FtpProxy <br>     <br>     <br>Upon starting FtpJr, it prompts user to enter FTP command. It resembles to the  <br>standard command like based FTP server. <br> <br>Once you see the FTP Jr&gt; prompt, you can type any command supported by the sample. <br>To get the list of the supported commands type "help" <br> <br>For example, to get the file from the remote FTP server following sequence of <br>commands needed: <br>    open -&gt; to open a session to the remote server <br>    ls   -&gt; to list the contains of the server <br>    type -&gt; to set the proper file type (BIN or ASCII) <br>    get  -&gt; to get the file <br>     <br>If the command requires extra parameters (such as file names, for example), it  <br>will prompt the user for it. <br> <br>Error reporting: <br>All errors are repored in form of the numeric error codes and <br>extended information reported by the server (if available). For example, if you try  <br>to change directory which does not exist following will take place: <br> <br>FTP Jr&gt;cd MyBogusDir <br>FtpSetCurrentDirectory error 12003 <br> 550 MyBogusDir: The sytem cannot find the file specified. <br>  <br>In this sample server reported an extended information. FtpSetCurrentDirectory in its <br>turn failed with the error 12003. This error could be located in the WinInet.h file and  <br>it is: <br> <br>#define ERROR_INTERNET_EXTENDED_ERROR           (INTERNET_ERROR_BASE + 3) <br> <br>It is possible that some WinInet fails without any extended information supplied by the <br>server, for example if you use wrong password: <br> <br>FTP Jr&gt;open ftp.microsoft.com <br>Enter user, pass: WrongUser BogusPass <br>InternetConnect error 12014 <br> <br>Session closed. <br> <br>Error 12014 (from WinInet.h) is: <br>#define ERROR_INTERNET_INCORRECT_PASSWORD       (INTERNET_ERROR_BASE + 14) <br> <br>     <br>     <br>Notes: <br>    CERN type proxy does not work with FTP WinInet APIs, because it returns  <br>information in HTML format. You will need to use TIS style FTP proxy with FTP <br>WinInet APIs. If you have Remote Windows Sockets installed (client part of the  <br>Catapult server), FTP WinInet API may fail because of the following reason: server <br>will specify a random port for a client to connect to for a data connection.  <br>If access via this port is disallowed, then error 10061 ("connection refused") <br>may be returned by the FTP APIs such as FtpFindFirstFile. </code></pre>
