<pre><code>README.TXT <br> <br>SampleIME is a sample class which demostarates how to use DefaultInputManager and <br>InputMethodListener interface to implement an IME in Microsoft VM. SampleIME <br>allows users to input unicode characters by typing the hexadecimal value <br>of the unicode characters. <br> <br>To Compile SampleIME <br>==================== <br>To compile this example, just compile all of the *.java files. You <br>could type the following under DOS prompt if Microsoft SDK for Java <br>is installed: <br> <br>jvc *.java <br> <br>To Run SampleIME <br>================ <br>To run SampleIME, please compile all the *.java file. You could  <br>use the following under DOS prompt to start this example: <br> <br>jview SampleIMETest.class <br> <br>Or you could run it from Internet Explorer, open the <br>following file using IE: <br> <br>Sample.html <br> <br>To Use SampleIME <br>================ <br>When this example is started, you could use TextArea and TextField  <br>as normal. When you want to use SampleIME, click on the button which <br>says "Click here to activate SampleIME." <br> <br>After doing so, you could click on the TextFields again, <br>, type '41', and press Enter. You should see an 'A' appearing on <br>the TextField, because 0x41( hexadecimal value ) is the unicode <br>represenation of 'A'. If you are using a FarEast version of Windows, <br>you could input CJK characters by typing their unicode value. <br>For example, if you type '4e00', you should see <br>the Chinese character "one". <br> <br>As you type along, you will find the IME will move the composition <br>window to the lower right corner of the input caret. This is called <br>IME level 2 ( near-caret ) support. <br> <br>Only digit 0 to digit 9, and 'a' through 'f' are accepted for this IME. <br>Those characters which are not accepted by the IME will appear on the TextFiled. <br>If you type something wrong on the IME, you could use BackSpace to  <br>correct them. <br> <br>If there are no characters appearing on the TextField, please make <br>sure that the input focus is on the TextField. You could do so by <br>clicking on the TextField. <br> <br>There is a button on the left of the IME which is used to activate/ <br>deactivate the IME. Besides, you could use mouse to click on the window <br>of IME except the button area to drag the IME around. <br> <br>Toggle IMEs <br>=========== <br>You could use Ctrl-Alt to toggle between different Java-based IMEs. In this  <br>example, there is only one Java IME, therefore, pressing Ctrl-Alt will  <br>activate/deactivate SampleIME. If you are running this under Far East  <br>version of Windows, pressing Ctrl-Alt for the first time will switch to  <br>system IME. And pressing it again will deactivate both system IME and <br>SampleIME. If you press Ctrl-Alt again,SampleIME will be activated. <br> <br>File List <br>========= <br> SampleIME.java <br>The IME itself.  <br> SampleIMEWindow.java <br>    The composition window. <br> SampleIMETest.java <br>The sample application which uses SampleIME. <br> SampleIMETestFrame.java <br>The Frame used by sample application. <br></code></pre>
