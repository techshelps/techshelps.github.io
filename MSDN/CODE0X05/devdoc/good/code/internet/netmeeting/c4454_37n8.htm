<pre><code>------------------------------------------------------------------ <br>       Microsoft NetMeeting SDK 2.0 Samples Readme File <br>                          August 1997             <br>------------------------------------------------------------------ <br> <br>             (c) Copyright Microsoft Corporation, 1997 <br> <br> <br>OVERVIEW OF THE NETMEETING SDK SAMPLES <br>====================================== <br> <br>The Samples directory consists of the following subdirectories, which   <br>contain samples demonstrating the use of the NetMeeting ActiveX Control, <br>NetMeeting COM objects, Internet Locator COM Objects, and Codec <br>installation COM Objects. <br> <br> <br>NMCHAT <br>------ <br>NMCHAT is a simple chat application that demonstrates the use of the new <br>NetMeeting 2.0 INm* COM interfaces.  In particular, this sample illustrates <br>the use of data channels to transmit information to peer applications in <br>a NetMeeting conference, as well as the basics of detecting new calls and <br>joining those calls. <br> <br> <br>NMUI <br>---- <br>NMUI is a large sample that demonstrates the use of most of the new COM <br>interfaces.  A critical new feature demonstrated by NMUI is the ability <br>for an application to replace NetMeeting's User Interface. <br> <br>In general you enable this sample to start its work by selecting the File, <br>Monitor menu item.  This kicks off the sample's processing. <br> <br>Using this sample you can see how to replace NetMeeting's user interface <br>with that of your own application.   To see this, go to the View,Options... <br>dialog and select the NM_INIT_CONTROL *before* selecting Monitor.  This will <br>cause the NMUI sample, via the NetMeeting 2.0 API, to "take over" all UI from <br>NetMeeting.  Upon selecting Monitor, the NetMeeting UI will not appear and <br>you can drive everything from within the NMUI sample. <br> <br>You can use the Call, User... menu to place calls, the Channel, Application <br>Sharing... menu to manipulate shared applications, The Call, Accept... menu <br>item to accept incoming calls, etc. <br> <br> <br>SKIPPY <br>------ <br>SKIPPY demonstrates the use of the ILS COM interface to gain access to <br>the same LDAP directory services used in NetMeeting.  SKIPPY shows how to <br>register with a server, retrieve information from a server, and filter that <br>information for specific properties or content. <br> <br>See README.TXT in the SKIPPY directory for more information. <br> <br> <br>INSTCODC <br>-------- <br>INSTCODC demonstrates the use of the codec installation APIs in NetMeeting <br>2.0.  These APIs are of interest only to vendors of audio and video codecs <br>who wish to add their codec to the set of codecs available during NetMeeting <br>calls. <br> <br>See README.TXT.TXT in the INSTCODC directory for more information. <br> <br> <br>HTML <br>---- <br>The HTML directory contains two sample HTML Web pages that are the same  <br>except one shows the use of the Control from VBScript, and the other  <br>shows the use of the Control from JScript. These samples illustrate the  <br>key Web-related functionality enabled by the Control, which is using a  <br>Web page to bring together, in a conference, a community of users with  <br>a similar interest. <br> <br>See the README.TXT file in the HTML directory for more information. <br> <br> <br>VBCARD <br>------ <br>VBCARD is a data conferencing application that leverages the AcitveX Control. <br> <br>See the README.TXT file in the VBCARD directory for more information. <br> <br> <br>NMSHARE <br>------- <br>The NMSHARE directory contains a sample which demonstrates the application <br>sharing interfaces in the NetMeeting 2.0 COM API.  NMSHARE is particularly <br>focused on new app sharing state notifications built into the new 2.0 COM APIs. <br>Run NMSHARE, establish a call with NetMeeting, share an app using NetMeeting, <br>and watch the various state changes as they are tracked in NMSHARE.  You can use <br>the Share menu to set the collaboration state of application sharing. <br> <br> <br>NMFT <br>---- <br>The NMFT directory contains a sample which demonstrates the file transfer <br>related interfaces in the NetMeeting 2.0 COM API. <br> <br>To run the NMFT application you must already be in a NetMeeting call. <br>Once in a call, running the application will result in a "pick a file" dialog <br>box that allows you to choose the file to send.  A progress indicator is <br>displayed during the send. <br> <br></code></pre>
