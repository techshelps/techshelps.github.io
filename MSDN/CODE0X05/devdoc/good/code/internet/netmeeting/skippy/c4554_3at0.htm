Readme File <br>                           November 1997 <br>------------------------------------------------------------------ <br> <br>             (c) Copyright Microsoft Corporation, 1997 <br> <br>CONTENTS <br>======== <br> <br>OVERVIEW OF THE SKIPPY! SAMPLE <br>BUILDING THE SKIPPY! SAMPLE <br> <br> <br>OVERVIEW OF THE SKIPPY! SAMPLE <br>============================= <br> <br>SKIPPY! is a COM based Internet Location Services application that allows <br>the user to query an ILS server for users and user information.  It  <br>demonstrates filtering the server results, creation of user objects and  <br>registration of users on a server. <br> <br> <br>BUILDING THE SKIPPY! SAMPLE <br>============================= <br> <br>Building the sample application requires VC++ Version 5.0 or later. <br> <br>To build the sample from Visual C++, open the project makefile (skippy.mak)  <br>as a Microsoft VC++ project, and build as usual.  The NetMeeting SDK  <br>directories must be added to your VC++ environment. <br> <br>If your DOS environment is correctly configured, you can build the sample <br>from the command line by typing "nmake".  The DOS path, include and lib <br>environment variables must point to the VC installation and the  <br>NetMeeting SDK directories. <br> <br> <br>Notes:  <br> <br>1) To run the SKIPPY! sample you do not need to have Microsoft  <br>   NetMeeting installed but you must install the ILS client support <br>   DLLs.  To do this, go to the REISTRB directory and run the ilsinst.exe  <br>   utility.   <br> <br>2) User objects created on a server by this application will appear <br>   in a NetMeeting directory listing for that server but NetMeeting <br>   users will not be able to connect to them. <br> <br>3) You do not need to specify IP address in the user information dialog. <br>   If you do not, the IP address for your machine will be used.  If you <br>   do, the IP Address you provide will be used. <br> <br>4) User objects obtained via a call to EnumUsers cannot be used in calls to  <br>   EnumProtocols.  To work around this issue, call EnumUserNames and then <br>   GetUser on each name. <br> </code></pre>
