<pre><code>This directory contains test components for the Java ASP Component Framework,  <br>as well as ASP pages for you to use for working with the components.  To use,  <br>do the following: <br> <br>1) Build these components using the latest Java SDK tools. If you are working  <br>   in VJ++, you will need to install the new compiler from the Java SDK. This  <br>   means copying jvc.exe, jps.dll, and msjvc.dll from the Java SDK installation  <br>   into your DevStudio\SharedIDE\bin directory. Also, make sure you set the  <br>   destination for the project (Project/settings/Output Directory) to the  <br>   %windir%\java\trustlib directory. <br> <br>   Alternatively, you can use the pre-built .class files provided in this  <br>   directory. To do so, copy *.class to the %windir%\java\trustlib\IISSample <br>   directory. <br> <br>2) Run regit.cmd, which will register your components with COM.  This <br>   assumes that javareg is on your path. Javareg comes with J++ and the Java <br>   SDK. <br> <br>3) Register the dir that houses all of these .asp files as a vroot with IIS,  <br>   and mark it as scriptable.  This will allow you to run the asp files. There <br>   is a default.asp with links to the other .asp files. </code></pre>
