<pre><code>FWRITE.dll - File Transfer using Synchronous WriteClient() inside ISAPI DLL <br> <br>Overview <br>-------- <br>FWRITE.DLL is a sample ISAPI Extension DLL to demonstrate Synchronous  <br>WriteClient functionality in the ISAPI interface. This dll illustrates <br>how one can use the WriteClient() callback in the ECB to perform an <br>Synchronous IO operation. It is intended for comparison against the <br>Asynchronous WriteClient() and Asynchronous TransmitFile() options. <br> <br>FWRITE.dll sends the file specified on the query string. It also converts <br>a virtual file-path (given in the URL name-space) into a physical file <br>name using the ServerSupportFunction( HSE_REQ_MAP_URL_TO_PATH) function. <br> <br>Installation: <br>------------- <br>Build FWRITE.dll and copy the .dll into the virtual directory maked with <br>"execute" permissions. <br> <br>To run:  <br>------- <br> <br>Reference FWRITE.DLL file as a URL from the browser,  <br>specifying a file-name on the query string. <br> <br>For example, the following URL entered on the address line of your browser <br>will transfer file SAMPLE.GIF, located in WWW root directory: <br> <br>http://localhost/scripts/fwrite.dll?/sample.gif <br> <br>Disclaimer: <br>----------- <br>This sample is provided for the purpose of demonstrating an ISAPI  <br>extension. It has not been tested for use in a production environment  <br>and no support will be provided for use in a production environment. </code></pre>
