<pre><code>CTETEST.DLL is a sample ISAPI HTTP Extension DLL to demonstrate Chunked  <br>Transfer Encoding. The Chunked Transfer Encoding modifies the body of a  <br>message in order to transfer it as a series of chunks, each with its own  <br>size indicator. Unlike "normal" HTTP file transfer, Chunked Transfer  <br>does not need to specify (or even know) the transfer length in advance.  <br>There is no "Content-Length:" header transferred. For complete details  <br>about Chunked Transfer Encoding, see section 3.6 "Transfer Codings" of  <br>the latest HTTP/1.1 specifications, available from  <br>http://www.w3.org/Protocols. <br> <br> <br>CTETEST.DLL sends the file specified on the query string. If no query  <br>string is present, or if the query string does not identify a readable  <br>file, CTETEST.DLL will return a plain text page describing its usage. <br> <br>To install:  <br> <br>Build the CTETEST.DSP project and copy the .DLL into virtual directory  <br>with "execute" permissions. <br> <br>To run:  <br> <br>Reference CTETEST.DLL file as a URL from the browser (currently only  <br>Microsoft Internet Explorer version 4.xx supports chunked encoding),  <br>specifying a URL on the query string. <br> <br>For example, the following URL entered on the address line of Internet  <br>Explorer will transfer file SAMPLE.GIF, located in WWW root directory,  <br>encoded in 1024-byte chunks: <br> <br>http://localhost/scripts/ctetest.dll?file=/sample.gif+chunksize=1024  <br> <br> <br>Disclaimer: <br> <br>This sample is provided for the purpose of demonstrating an ISAPI  <br>extension. It has not been tested for use in a production environment  <br>and no support will be provided for use in a production environment. <br> </code></pre>
