<pre><code>Asynchronous IO Support <br> <br>ISAPI 1.0 support synchronous IO operations via callback  <br>methods ReadClient() and WriteClient(). The ability to  <br>support asynchronous operations is important; it frees  <br>up a server pool thread from being blocked to complete  <br>the IO operation. In addition, IIS server engine already  <br>has built in support to manage asynchronous IO operations  <br>using the completion ports and server thread pool.  <br> <br>ISAPI 2.0 supports asynchronous write operation using  <br>the existing callback function WriteClient() with a special  <br>flag indicating that the operation has to be performed  <br>asynchronously. In addition, ISAPI 2.0 also provides a  <br>mechanism to request the server to transmit a file using  <br>the TransmitFile() . <br> <br>ISAPI 3.0 supports asynchronous read operation from the  <br>client using ServerSupportFunction() with HSE_REQ_ASYNC_READ_CLIENT  <br>and a special flag indicating that the operation has to be  <br>performed asynchronously. In addition, the ISAPI application  <br>should submit a callback function and context by calling  <br>ServerSupportFunction() with HSE_REQ_IO_COMPLETION. <br> <br>To use the areadcli.dll extension created by this directory,  <br>perform the following steps: <br> <br>1) Create an IIS virtual root with execute permissions <br>2) Copy the isapi dlls into the directory <br>3) Point a browser at the virtual path <br> <br>ie: <br> <br>http://localhost/sdk/areadcli.dll <br> <br> <br>Disclaimer: <br> <br>This sample is provided for the purposes of demonstrating an <br>ISAPI extension.  It has not been tested for use in a production <br>environment and no support will be provided for use in a <br>production environment. </code></pre>
