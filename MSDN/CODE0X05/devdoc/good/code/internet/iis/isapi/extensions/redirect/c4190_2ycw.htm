<pre><code>Description: <br> <br>Redirect is a sample ISAPI extension to demonstrate redirecting <br>a request.  It redirects requests to a URL specified on the <br>query string.  If no query string is present, or if the query <br>string is not identified as a legal target for redirection, <br>Redirect.dll will return a page to the client with brief  <br>instructions for its use. <br> <br>Redirections to a resource on the same server as the dll will <br>be handled by IIS and will be transparent to the browser. <br>Redirections to a resource on a different server will result <br>in an HTTP 302 response instructing the browser to obtain the  <br>resource from another location. <br> <br>To Install: <br> <br>Build the redirect.dsw project and copy the resulting Redirect.dll <br>file into a virtual directory containing execute permissions. <br> <br>To Run: <br> <br>Reference the Redirect.dll file as a URL from a browser, specifying <br>a URL on the query string. <br> <br>For example, the following URL entered on the address line of <br>Internet Explorer will redirect the request to the specified <br>URL on a different server: <br> <br>   http://server/scripts/Redirect.dll?http://server2/virtualdir/file.htm <br> <br>The following URL entered on the address line will redirect the <br>request to the specified resource on the same server: <br> <br>   http://server/scripts/Redirect.dll?/virtualdir/file.htm <br> <br>Disclaimer: <br> <br>This sample, and the included automation dll, is provided for the <br>purposes of demonstrating an ISAPI extension.  It has not been <br>tested for use in a production environment and no support will <br>be provided for use in a production environment. </code></pre>
