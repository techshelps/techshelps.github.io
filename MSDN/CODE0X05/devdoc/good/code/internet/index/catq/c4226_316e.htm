<pre><code><br>SUMMARY <br>======= <br> <br>The CATQ sample shows how to run a query against a catalog generated by <br>the Microsoft Index Server.  By default, in this example, the catalog is <br>for files on the local machine and the query is restricted to the scope <br>of the SDK.  As such, this sample provides fast full text search over all <br>text-based files in the SDK. <br> <br> <br>MORE INFORMATION <br>================ <br> <br>Content indexing (CISVC) is a service included in all versions of Windows NT 5, <br>but it is not running by default.  When the CATQ sample is started, it checks <br>the status of CISVC, and starts it up if it is not running. <br> <br>In the status window at the bottom of the CATQ sample, the progress of the <br>indexing effort is displayed as a fraction and as a blue "progress bar."  The <br>numerator and denominator of this fraction are read as performance registry <br>counters, which are written out by CISVC. <br> <br>The denominator in the progress display is the total number of files that <br>CISVC must index in order for the catalog to be up-to-date.  Unfortunately, <br>this value is not known instantly at the time of CISVC startup, and in fact, <br>it typically grows over time as the numerator grows.  For this reason, the <br>progress percentage can decrease even as the content indexer is making <br>progress.  I.e. it is finding new files to index as fast as it is indexing <br>files in its existing list. <br> <br>As a result of running the CATQ sample, the CISVC service is started.  This <br>will place a small load on your CPU and on your disk controler.  The resulting <br>catalog will also take up some amount of disk space. <br> <br>If you would like to stop the CISVC service, use the service control manager <br>built into the system, or the SC.EXE utility distributed with the SDK.  In the <br>case of the later tool, the appropriate command line is: <br> <br>    SC stop CISVC <br> <br>If you wish to reclaim disk space occupied by the catalog, after the service <br>has been stopped, delete all of the files in %SystemRoot%\system32\catalog.wci. <br> <br>By default, most of the text file formats present in the SDK are indexed. <br>Additional file formats can also be indexed and searched by providing custom <br>filters.  See IFilter in the documentation for more information. </code></pre>
