<p>
Consider a server that manages thousands of objects of many different types. Whenever the server started, the server application would have to call the function <a href="pr-func2_1n8l.htm"><b>RpcObjectSetType</b></a> for every one of the objects, even though clients might refer to only a few of the objects (or take a long time to refer to them). The thousands of objects are likely to be on disk so that retrieving their types would be time consuming. Also, the internal table that is mapping the object UUID to the manager type UUID would essentially duplicate the mapping maintained with the objects themselves.</p>
<p>
For convenience, the RPC function set includes the function <a href="pr-func2_82cu.htm"><b>RpcObjectSetInqFn</b></a>. With this function, you provide your own object-inquiry function.</p>
<p>
As an example, you can supply your own object-inquiry function when you map objects 100 – 199 to type number 1, 200 – 299 to type number 2, and so on. The object-inquiry function can also be extended to a distributed file system, where the server application does not "know" all the files (object UUIDs) available, or when files in the file system are named by object UUIDs and you do not want to preload all object-UUID-to-type-UUID mappings.</p>
