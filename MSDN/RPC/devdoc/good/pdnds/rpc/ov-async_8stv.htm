<h1><a name="_rpc_causal_ordering_of_asynchronous_calls"></a>Causal Ordering of Asynchronous Calls</h1>
<p>
In an asynchronous RPC application, it is possible for a client thread to make a second asynchronous call on a binding handle before an earlier call made on that handle has completed. The RPC runtime handles this situation as follows.
<ul>
<li>
The asynchronous RPC mechanism in Windows NT 5.0 guarantees that asynchronous calls made on the same binding handle, at the same security level, are dispatched in the order they were made. Actual execution of the calls may occur out of order.</li>
<li>
Calls made to a server application running on Windows NT 3.51, Windows NT 4.0, or on Windows 95 are dispatched and executed in the order they were made. The runtime automatically detects these platforms and serializes the calls on the client.</li>
</ul>
