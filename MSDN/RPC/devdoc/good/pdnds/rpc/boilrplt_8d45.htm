<h1><a name="_rpc_about_this_guide"></a>About This Guide</h1>
<p>
This guide explains the Microsoft RPC programming model, standards, and tools in detail. Part I, the Overviews portion of the guide, consists of a sequence of topics that will help you understand distributed application programming and Microsoft RPC as follows:</p>
<p>
<a href="ov-model_1e0c.htm">Microsoft RPC Model</a> provides an overview of the client-server programming model, standards for distributed application programming, and a description of how Microsoft RPC works.</p>
<p>
<a href="ov-envir_8hro.htm">Installing The RPC Programming Environment</a><b> </b>tells how to install the files and tools needed to develop distributed applications with Microsoft RPC.</p>
<p>
<a href="ov-tutor_77e4.htm">Tutorial</a> provides an overview of the development of a small distributed application. This example demonstrates all the steps in developing a distributed application, the tools you use, and the components that make up the executable programs.</p>
<p>
The following topics deal with the underlying mechanisms that pass data from the calling application to the remote procedure. </p>
<p>
<a href="ov-build_8ctv.htm">Building RPC Applications</a> describes the MIDL compiler and the necessary environment for building distributed applications with Microsoft RPC.</p>
<p>
<a href="ov-files_608j.htm">IDL and ACF Files</a> describes the IDL and ACF files used to specify the interface to the remote procedure call and the MIDL compiler switches that control how these files are processed.</p>
<p>
<a href="ov-featr_8i43.htm">Data and Language Features</a> demonstrates the use of standard data types.</p>
<p>
<a href="ov-arptr_61v7.htm">Arrays and Pointers</a> explains how to pass arrays pointers as parameters.</p>
<p>
<a href="ov-handl_8r03.htm">Binding and Handles</a> describes the binding handle — the data structure that allows the developer to bind the calling application to the remote procedure.</p>
<p>
<a href="ov-memmg_1gfo.htm">Memory Management</a> offers ideas about how to manage memory on the client and server when performing remote procedure calls.</p>
<p>
<a href="ov-encod_4cdv.htm">Encoding Services</a> describes the methods for encoding or decoding data.</p>
<p>
<a href="ov-runtm_1xmb.htm">Run-time RPC Functions</a> describe the Microsoft RPC run-time libraries and the functions in the run-time library that applications use to manage their own client and server binding.</p>
<p>
<a href="ov-secur_6buh.htm">Security</a> describes the methods for implementing security features in your distributed applications.</p>
<p>
<a href="ov-cnfig_3jw3.htm">Installing and Configuring RPC Applications</a> discusses installing your client and server applications in the MS-DOS, Microsoft Windows 3.x, Windows 95, and Windows NT environments, describes how to configure the name service provider and the security service. This section also contains network transport information for RPC.</p>
<p>
Part II, The RPC Programmers' Reference provides alphabetical listings of <a href="pr-dtype_3dwz.htm">RPC Data Types and Structures</a>, and <a href="pr-func1_042t.htm">RPC Functions</a>.</p>
<p>
The Appendix contains a listing of RPC Error Codes and sample code that demonstrates a variety of RPC concepts.</p>
