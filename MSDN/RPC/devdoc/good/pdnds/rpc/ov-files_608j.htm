<h1><a name="_rpc_the_idl_and_acf_files"></a>The IDL and ACF Files</h1>
<p>
The MIDL design specifies two distinct files, the Interface Definition Language (IDL) file and the application configuration file (ACF). These files contain attributes which direct the generation of the C-language stub files that manage the remote procedure call. The purpose of distinguishing the files is to keep the network interface separate from characteristics that affect only the operating environment. </p>
<p>
The IDL file specifies a network contract between the client and server — that is, the IDL file specifies what is transmitted between client and server. Keeping this information distinct from the information about the operating environment makes the IDL file portable to other environments. The IDL file consists of two parts: an <a href="ov-files_2dyq.htm">interface header</a> and an <a href="ov-files_7da1.htm">interface body</a>.</p>
<p>
The ACF specifies attributes that affect only local performance rather than the network contract. Microsoft RPC allows you to combine the ACF and IDL attributes in a single IDL file. You can also combine multiple interfaces in a single IDL file (and its ACF).</p>
<p>
The syntax of MIDL is based on the syntax of the C programming language. Whenever a language concept in this description of MIDL is not fully defined, the C-language definition of that term is implied.</p>
<p>
This section is organized by topic and summarizes the attributes that are specified in the IDL and ACF files, and in the output files generated by the MIDL compiler. The same material is alphabetized and presented in more detail in the reference topics. For more information, see the <object id=alink_1 type="application/x-oleobject"
