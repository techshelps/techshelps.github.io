<h1><a name="_rpc_the_rpc_name_service_database"></a>The RPC Name-Service Database</h1>
<p>
A name service is a service that maps names to objects, and usually maintains the (name, object) pairs in a database. Generally, the name is a logical name that is easy for users to remember and use. For example, a name service would allow a user to use the logical name "laserprinter." The name service maps this name to the network-specific name used by the print server.</p>
<p>
To use a simplified explanation, the RPC name service maps a name to a binding handle and maintains the (name, binding handle) mappings in the RPC name-service database. The RPC name service allows client applications to use a logical name instead of a specific protocol sequence and network address. The use of the logical name makes it easier for network administrators to install and configure your distributed application.</p>
<p>
An RPC name-service database entry has one of the following attributes: server, group, or profile. In the Microsoft implementation, entries can have only one attribute, so these entries are also known as server entries, group entries, and profile entries. </p>
<p>
The server entry consists of interface UUIDs, object UUIDs (needed when the server implements multiple entry points), network address, protocol sequence, and any endpoint information associated with well-known endpoints. When a dynamic endpoint is used, the endpoint information is kept in the endpoint-map database rather than the name-service database, and the endpoint is resolved like any other dynamic endpoint. Server entries are managed by functions that start with the prefix "RpcNsBinding."</p>
<p>
The group entry can contain server entries or other group entries. Group entries are managed by functions that start with the prefix "RpcNsGroup."</p>
<p>
The profile entry can contain profile, group, or server entries. Profile entries are managed by the functions that start with the prefix "RpcNsProfile."</p>
