<h1><a name="_rpc_microsoft_rpc_model"></a>Microsoft RPC Model</h1>
<p>
Microsoft Remote Procedure Call (RPC) for the C and C++ programming languages is designed to help meet the needs of developers working on the next generation of software for the Microsoft® MS-DOS®, Microsoft® Windows®, Microsoft® Windows® 95, and Microsoft® Windows NT® family of operating systems.</p>
<p>
Microsoft RPC represents the convergence of three powerful programming models: the familiar model of developing C applications by writing procedures and libraries; the model that uses powerful computers as network servers to perform specific tasks for their clients; and the client-server model, in which the client usually manages the user interface while the server handles data storage, queries, and manipulation.</p>
<p>
This section explains the convergence of these three powerful models in distributed computing, which delivers the ability to share computational power among the computers on a network. This section also describes the industry standard for RPC and provides an overview of Microsoft RPC components and their operation.</p>
