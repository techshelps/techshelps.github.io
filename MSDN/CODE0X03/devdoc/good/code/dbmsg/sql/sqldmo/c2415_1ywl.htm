<pre><code>**************************************************************** <br>         MICROSOFT SQL SERVER WORKSTATION SYSTEM 6.5  <br> SQL DISTRIBUTED MANAGEMENT OBJECTS (SQL-DMO) SAMPLE PROGRAMS <br>**************************************************************** <br>This file describes the SQL-DMO sample programs included with <br>Microsoft(R) SQL Server(TM) 6.5 and Microsoft SQL Server  <br>Workstation System 6.5. <br> <br>For additional information about SQL Server 6.5, SQL Distributed <br>Management Objects, and ODBC, see the "What's New in SQL Server 6.5," <br>"Programming SQL Distributed Management Objects," and "Programming  <br>ODBC for SQL Server" sections of SQL Server Books Online, which  <br>contains the most up-to-date information available. <br> <br>**************************************************************** <br>32-BIT VISUAL BASIC SAMPLES <br> <br>The following 32-bit Microsoft(R) Visual Basic(R)-based sample  <br>programs are located in the C:\MSSQL\SAMPLES\SQLDMO\VB directory  <br>by default: <br> <br>EXPLORE <br>Sample SQL-DMO object browser using 32-bit Visual Basic. Includes  <br>the following files: <br>    EXPLORE.MAK <br>    EXPLORE.FRM <br>    EXPLORE.BAS <br> <br>GENERIC <br>Sample SQL-DMO generic program using 32-bit Visual Basic. Includes  <br>the following files: <br>    GENERIC.MAK <br>    GENERIC.FRM <br> <br>**************************************************************** <br>32-BIT VISUAL C++ SAMPLES <br> <br>The following 32-bit C++ sample program is located in the <br>C:\MSSQL\SAMPLES\SQLDMO\C\CPP directory by default: <br> <br>SOCPP <br>Sample C++ program using 32-bit Visual C++. Includes the following  <br>files: <br>    SOCPP.MAK <br>    SOCPP.CPP <br>    SOCPP.MDP <br> <br>The following 32-bit C sample program is located in the <br>C:\MSSQL\SAMPLES\SQLDMO\C\CPP directory by default: <br> <br>SOC <br>Sample C program using 32-bit Visual C++. Includes the following  <br>files: <br>    SOC.MAK <br>    SOC.C <br>    SOC.MDP <br> <br>Each project on the Intel(R) platform includes Visual C++ 4.0  <br>workspace files (.MDP). Double-click on the workspace file to load  <br>the workspace and make file into the Developer Studio environment. <br> <br>Each project also contains cross-platform native Visual C++ 4.0 make  <br>files (.MAK). For each 32-bit project the .MAK file contains Intel,  <br>Alpha AXP(R), MIPS(R), and PowerPC(TM) build information. When the  <br>project is loaded into Developer Studio, pick the appropriate target,  <br>for example "Example1 - Win32 (ALPHA) Debug", and build it. <br> <br>You can also build from the command line. BUILDALL.BAT, a file that  <br>will build all of the 32-bit PTK samples, is in the samples directory.  <br>Use the following syntax:  <br> <br>BUILDALL ({intel | alpha | mips | powerpc} {debug | release} {force}) <br> <br>To use these samples with Visual C++ 4.0, you need to ensure that  <br>your Library and Include directory settings point to your own  <br>directories. To do this using Developer Studio, from the Tools menu,  <br>choose Options, then click the Directories tab. From the "Show  <br>directories for" box, choose Include files and Library files, and  <br>ensure that these directories (as appropriate) are included: <br> <br>Include files:Library files: <br>C:\MSSQL\DBLIB\INCLUDEC:\MSSQL\DBLIB\LIB <br>C:\MSSQL\MSDTC\INCLUDEC:\MSSQL\MSDTC\LIB <br>C:\MSSQL\ODBD\INCLUDEC:\MSSQL\ODS\LIB <br>C:\MSSQL\ODS\INCLUDE <br>C:\MSSQL\SQLOLE\INCLUDE <br> <br></code></pre>
