<pre><code>**************************************************************** <br>          MICROSOFT SQL SERVER WORKSTATION SYSTEM 6.5 <br>              OPEN DATA SERVICES SAMPLE PROGRAMS <br>**************************************************************** <br>This file describes the Open Data Services sample programs  <br>included with Microsoft(R) SQL Server(TM) Workstation System 6.5. <br> <br>For additional information about SQL Server 6.5, Open Data Services, <br>and ODBC, see the "What's New in SQL Server 6.5," "Programming  <br>Open Data Services," and "Programming ODBC for SQL Server" sections <br>of SQL Server Books Online, which contains the most up-to-date  <br>information available. <br> <br>**************************************************************** <br>OPEN DATA SERVICES SAMPLE APPLICATIONS <br> <br>The following 32-bit C sample programs are located in the <br>C:\MSSQL\SAMPLES\ODS directory by default: <br> <br>GATEWAY <br>Sample C gateway application that connects to SQL Server as an <br>alternate data source and demonstrates a "pass through" application.  <br>Includes the following files: <br>    GATECBS.C <br>    GATEWAY.C <br>    GATEWAY.MAK <br>    GATEWAY.MDP <br> <br>ODSODBC <br>Builds an Open Data Services gateway version of the SQL Server ODBC  <br>driver that can be customized for the capabilities of a particular  <br>Open Data Services gateway application. Documented in Appendix E of  <br>"Programming Open Data Services." To build a 16-bit version of the <br>SQL Server ODBC driver, refer to  <br>C:\MSSQL\SAMPLES\ODS\ODSODBC\README.TXT. Includes the following files: <br>    BUILDW16.BAT <br>    LIBMAIN.C <br>    LOCAL.RC <br>    MAKEFILE.W16 <br>    ODBCSS.H <br>    ODBCVER.H <br>    ODXRC.H <br>    ODSSAMP.MAK <br>    ODSSAMP.MDP <br>    README.TXT <br>    SAMP.RC     <br> <br>PROCSRV <br>Demonstrates how to implement a procedure server using Open Data  <br>Services to handle specific pre-defined requests. Includes the  <br>following files: <br>    PROCSRV.C <br>    PROCSRV.MAK <br>    PROCSRV.MDP <br>    SALES.DBF <br>    SERVICE.C <br> <br>XP <br>Sample extended procedure DLL built with Open Data Services. The  <br>functions within the DLL can be invoked by using the extended <br>stored procedures support in SQL Server.  To register the functions  <br>and allow all users to use them, run the Transact-SQL script  <br>INSTXP.SQL. Includes the following files: <br>    INSTXP.SQL <br>    XP.C <br>    XP.DEF <br>    XP.MAK <br>    XP.MDP <br> <br>XP_DBLIB <br>Sample extended stored procedure using 32-bit Visual C++ and the  <br>DB-Library interface to open a new connection to the SQL Server  <br>that called the extended stored procedure. Returns a result set and  <br>passes the results to the client. Uses a bound session for the  <br>loopback connection. <br>    XP_DBLIB.C <br>    XP_DBLIB.DEF <br>    XP_DBLIB.MAK <br>    XP_DBLIB.MDP <br>    XP_DBLIB.SQL <br> <br>XP_ODBC <br>Sample extended stored procedure using 32-bit Visual C++ and the  <br>ODBC interface to open a new connection to the SQL Server that  <br>called the extended stored procedure. Returns a result set and  <br>passes the results to the client. Uses a bound session for the  <br>loopback connection. Note: To connect to the server using integrated  <br>security, the local server data source name (registered using ODBC  <br>in the Control Panel) must be used. Includes the following  <br>files: <br>    XP_ODBC.C <br>    XP_ODBC.DEF <br>    XP_ODBC.MAK <br>    XP_ODBC.MDP <br>    XP_ODBC.SQL <br> <br>Each project on the Intel(R) platform includes Visual C++ 4.0  <br>workspace files (.MDP). Double-click the workspace file to load  <br>the workspace and make file into the Developer Studio environment. <br> <br>Each project also contains cross-platform native Visual C++ 4.0 make  <br>files (.MAK). For each 32-bit project the .MAK file contains Intel,  <br>Alpha AXP(R), MIPS(R), and PowerPC(TM) build information. When the  <br>project is loaded into Developer Studio, pick the appropriate target,  <br>for example "Example1 - Win32 (ALPHA) Debug", and build it. <br> <br>You can also build from the command line. BUILDALL.BAT, a file that  <br>will build all of the 32-bit PTK samples, is in the samples  <br>directory. Use the following syntax:  <br> <br>BUILDALL ({intel | alpha | mips | powerpc} {debug | release} {force}) <br> <br>To use these samples with Visual C++ 4.0, you need to ensure that  <br>your Library and Include directory settings point to your own  <br>directories. To do this using Developer Studio, from the Tools menu,  <br>choose Options, then click the Directories tab. From the "Show  <br>directories for" box, choose Include files and Library files, and  <br>ensure that these directories (as appropriate) are included: <br> <br>Include files:Library files: <br>C:\MSSQL\DBLIB\INCLUDEC:\MSSQL\DBLIB\LIB <br>C:\MSSQL\MSDTC\INCLUDEC:\MSSQL\MSDTC\LIB <br>C:\MSSQL\ODBC\INCLUDEC:\MSSQL\ODS\LIB <br>C:\MSSQL\ODS\INCLUDE <br>C:\MSSQL\SQLOLE\INCLUDE <br> <br></code></pre>
