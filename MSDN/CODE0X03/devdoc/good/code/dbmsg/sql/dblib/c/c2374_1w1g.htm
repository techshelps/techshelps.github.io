The following DB-Library sample projects  <br>are targeted to specific client operating systems: Microsoft(R)  <br>Windows NT(R) and Microsoft Windows(R) 95 for Intel(R), MIPS(R),  <br>Alpha AXP(R), and PowerPC(TM) platforms; Microsoft Windows and  <br>MS-DOS(R) for Intel. Each of these samples has an associated make  <br>file for building with the NMAKE utility: <br> <br>**************************************************************** <br>DB-LIBRARY FOR C SAMPLE 32-BIT APPLICATIONS <br> <br>Windows NT for Intel, Alpha AXP, MIPS, and PowerPC platforms <br> <br>Project directories are located in the following path: <br> <br>     C:\MSSQL\SAMPLES\DBLIB\C <br> <br>     EXAMPLE1    Sending queries in a command batch <br>     EXAMPLE2    Working with data files <br>     EXAMPLE3    Binding aggregate and compute results <br>     EXAMPLE4    Using row buffering <br>     EXAMPLE5    Converting data with dbconvert <br>     EXAMPLE6    Querying and updating the database <br>     EXAMPLE7    Using browse-mode functions <br>     EXAMPLE8    Using remote stored procedures and return  <br> parameters <br>     NMPSDMP     Windows NT-based console named pipe dump device  <br> sample <br>     SQLCURS     Using cursor functions <br>     SQLEXAMP    Command-line interpreter <br>     SQLTESTC    Windows NT-based console sample  <br>     SQLTESTN    Windows NT-based GUI sample <br>     TEXTCOPY    Windows NT-based console text and image sample,  <br> also uses GETOPT.* <br>     TWOPHASE    Two-phase commit example <br> <br>     DATAFILE    Data file used by the EXAMPLE2 and EXAMPLE 6  <br> programs. <br> <br>Each project on the Intel platform includes Visual C++ 4.0  <br>workspace files (.MDP). Double-click the workspace file to load  <br>the workspace and make file into the Developer Studio environment. <br> <br>Each project also contains cross-platform native Visual C++ 4.0 make  <br>files (.MAK). For each 32-bit project the .MAK file contains Intel,  <br>Alpha, MIPS, and PowerPC build information. When the project is  <br>loaded into Developer Studio, pick the appropriate target, for  <br>example "Example1 - Win32 (ALPHA) Debug", and build it. <br> <br>You can also build from the command line. BUILDALL.BAT, a file that  <br>will build all of the 32-bit PTK samples, is in the samples directory.  <br>Use the following syntax:  <br> <br>BUILDALL ({intel | alpha | mips | powerpc} {debug | release} {force}) <br> <br>To use these samples with Visual C++ 4.0, you need to ensure that  <br>your Library and Include directory settings point to your own  <br>directories. To do this using Developer Studio, from the Tools menu,  <br>choose Options, then click the Directories tab. From the "Show  <br>directories for" box, choose Include files and Library files, and  <br>ensure that these directories (as appropriate) are included: <br> <br>Include files:Library files: <br>C:\MSSQL\DBLIB\INCLUDEC:\MSSQL\DBLIB\LIB <br>C:\MSSQL\MSDTC\INCLUDEC:\MSSQL\MSDTC\LIB <br>C:\MSSQL\ODBC\INCLUDEC:\MSSQL\ODS\LIB <br>C:\MSSQL\ODS\INCLUDE <br>C:\MSSQL\SQLOLE\INCLUDE <br> <br>**************************************************************** <br>DB-LIBRARY FOR C SAMPLE 16-BIT APPLICATIONS <br> <br>16-bit Windows project directories are located in the following path: <br> <br>C:\MSSQL\SAMPLES\DBLIB\C\WIN16 <br> <br>    SQLTEST3      Windows-based sample <br>    SQLCURSW      Windows-based cursor sample <br> <br>    SQLTEST.ICO   Icon used by both Windows-based samples <br> <br>The MS-DOS project directory is located in the following path: <br> <br>C:\MSSQL\SAMPLES\DBLIB\C\MSDOS <br> <br>    SQLTESTR      MS-DOS-based sample <br> <br>Visual C++ 1.5x batch and make files are included to build all of  <br>these cross-platform samples on a given platform.
