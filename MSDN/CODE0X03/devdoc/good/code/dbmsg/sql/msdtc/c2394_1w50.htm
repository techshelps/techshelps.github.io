<pre><code>**************************************************************** <br>           MICROSOFT SQL SERVER WORKSTATION SYSTEM 6.5 <br>  MICROSOFT DISTRIBUTED TRANSACTION COORDINATOR SAMPLE PROGRAMS <br>**************************************************************** <br>This file describes the Microsoft Distributed Transaction  <br>Coordinator (MS DTC) sample programs included with Microsoft(R)  <br>SQL Server(TM) Workstation System 6.5. <br> <br>For additional information about SQL Server 6.5, MS DTC, and ODBC, <br>see the "What's New in SQL Server 6.5," "Guide to Microsoft <br>Distributed Management Coordinator," and "Programming ODBC for SQL  <br>Server" sections of SQL Server Books Online, which contains the most  <br>up-to-date information available. <br> <br>**************************************************************** <br>MICROSOFT DISTRIBUTED TRANSACTION COORDINATOR SAMPLE APPLICATIONS <br> <br>The following 32-bit C++ sample programs are located in the <br>C:\MSSQL\SAMPLES\MSDTC directories by default: <br> <br>DBLIB <br>Sample C++ program using 32-bit Visual C++ and the DB-Library <br>interface to communicate with both MS DTC and SQL Server. Includes  <br>the following files: <br>    DBLIB.MAK <br>    DBLIB.CPP <br>    DBLIB.MDP <br> <br>ODBC <br>Sample C++ program using 32-bit Visual C++ and the ODBC interface to  <br>communicate with both MS DTC and SQL Server. Includes the following  <br>files: <br>    ODBC.MAK <br>    ODBC.CPP <br>    ODBC.MDP <br> <br>Each project on the Intel(R) platform includes Visual C++ 4.0  <br>workspace files (.MDP). Double-click the workspace file to load  <br>the workspace and make file into the Developer Studio environment. <br> <br>Each project also contains cross-platform native Visual C++ 4.0 make  <br>files (.MAK). For each 32-bit project the .MAK file contains Intel,  <br>Alpha AXP(R), MIPS(R), and PowerPC(TM) build information. When the  <br>project is loaded into Developer Studio, pick the appropriate target,  <br>for example "Example1 - Win32 (ALPHA) Debug", and build it. <br> <br>You can also build from the command line. BUILDALL.BAT, a file that  <br>will build all of the 32-bit PTK samples, is in the samples directory.  <br>Use the following syntax:  <br> <br>BUILDALL ({intel | alpha | mips | powerpc} {debug | release} {force}) <br> <br>To use these samples with Visual C++ 4.0, you need to ensure that  <br>your Library and Include directory settings point to your own  <br>directories. To do this using Developer Studio, from the Tools menu,  <br>choose Options, then click the Directories tab. From the "Show  <br>directories for" box, choose Include files and Library files, and  <br>ensure that these directories (as appropriate) are included: <br> <br>Include files:Library files: <br>C:\MSSQL\DBLIB\INCLUDEC:\MSSQL\DBLIB\LIB <br>C:\MSSQL\MSDTC\INCLUDEC:\MSSQL\MSDTC\LIB <br>C:\MSSQL\ODBC\INCLUDEC:\MSSQL\ODS\LIB <br>C:\MSSQL\ODS\INCLUDE <br>C:\MSSQL\SQLOLE\INCLUDE <br> <br>The following Transact-SQL sample scripts are located in the <br>C:\MSSQL\SAMPLES\MSDTC directories by default: <br> <br>DBLIB <br>Sample Transact-SQL scripts that demonstrate communicating with both  <br>MS DTC and SQL Server. Includes the following files: <br>    CHGADDR.SQL <br>    UPDADR.SQL <br> <br> <br> <br></code></pre>
