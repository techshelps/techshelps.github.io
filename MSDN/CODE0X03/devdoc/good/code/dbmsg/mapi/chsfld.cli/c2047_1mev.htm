<pre><code>MAPI Choose Folder Sample <br> <br>Copyright 1986 - 1998 Microsoft Corporation. All Rights Reserved. <br> <br> <br>This samples illustrates implementing a MAPI Container hierarchy viewer. <br>It uses standard WIN32 Tree View Control to display folder hierarchy of <br>a message store and to allow a user to choose a particular folder. <br>Chsfld32.dll exports a single entry point  HrPickFolder. Please see <br>chsfld.h located in common directory for the exact description of <br>arguments and return values. <br> <br>The use of HrPickFolder is straightforward: just pass in all the required <br>parameters and, assuming that everything goes OK, get back pointers to <br>IMAPIFolder interface of the folder chosen by the user and a pointer to <br>IMsgStore interface of the message store that contains the folder. <br>There are to optional parameters. If you use them (meaning they are not <br>zeroes), the function will save the expand/collapse state of the dialog <br>at the moment the user pressed "OK". If you pass this parameter back next <br>time you call HrPickFolder, the dialog will restore the saved state. See <br>route.cli and simple.frm samples for the example on how to use the function. <br> <br>If you want to use the function as is, in a separate DLL, all you need to <br>do is to link with chsfld32.dll either statically or dynamically and call <br>the function. To reuse the source code, you will have to modify it a bit. <br>You have to make sure that the HINSTANCE parameter that you pass to <br>CChsFldDlg constructor in function HrPickFolder (file chsfld.cpp) is the <br>handle of the executable module that contains the resources used by the <br>class (the dialog and the icons). </code></pre>
