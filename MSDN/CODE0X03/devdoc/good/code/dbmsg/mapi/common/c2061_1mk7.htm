This will be used to construct inbound <br> *      and outbound addresses where needed. It also will be used to tell the <br> *      Spooler what address types we should get. <br> * <br> *  PR_SAMPLE_EMAIL_ADDRESS <br> *      Email address. This will usually be the same as the inbound directory, <br> *      although this may tend to have a more canonical form for remote access. <br> * <br> *  PR_SAMPLE_INBOUND_DIR <br> *      Inbound directory. This is where the transport will look in order to <br> *      determine whether it has received any mail. <br> * <br> *  PR_SAMPLE_OUTBOUND_DIR <br> *      Outbound directory. The transport will store its message files here <br> *      while it is in the process of sending them. The presence of a file <br> *      in this directory implies that the transport still has work to do. <br> * <br> *  PR_SAMPLE_FILENAME <br> *      Filename. This is an 8-character root for use by mail-enabled or <br> *      workgroup applications to build a complete file specification (by <br> *      adding an extension) for data they wish to store for this user. <br> * <br> *  PR_SAMPLE_DIRECTORY <br> *      Directory. This is a directory in which workgroup applications may <br> *      wish to store their files pertaining to this user. <br> * <br> *  PR_SAMPLE_FLAGS <br> *      Flags. Contain various options for this transport provider. <br> *      Valid values are: <br> * <br> *          PR_SAMPLE_FLAG_PEER_TO_PEER <br> *          PR_SAMPLE_FLAG_UI_ALWAYS <br> *          PR_SAMPLE_FLAG_LOG_EVENTS <br> *          PR_SAMPLE_FLAG_SAVE_DATA <br> * <br> *  PR_SAMPLE_LOGFILE <br> *      Logfile. This is where logging information will be written. If this <br> *      property is not present, we will use (PR_SAMPLE_FILENAME)".LOG" <br> * <br> *  PR_SAMPLE_LOGHIGHWATER <br> *      Logfile high water mark. This is the point at which the log writer will <br> *      truncate the logfile so as not to fill up the disk. <br> * <br> *  PR_SAMPLE_LOGLOWWATER <br> *      Logfile low water mark. This is the approximate size that the logfile <br> *      writer will truncate the logfile to (modulo a line ending). <br> */ <br> </code></pre>
