<pre><code>Sample Simple MAPI Client <br> <br> <br>The Simple.Cli sample application illustrates using Simple MAPI functions. <br> <br>The sample is a very simple mail client. Using it is intuitive and <br>straightforward. <br> <br>To run this application, you have to have MAPI run-time binaries installed on <br>your system. For installation instructions, see the readme.wri in the <br>mstools\mapi\ directory. <br> <br>When writing simple MAPI applications, the addresses of all of the simple <br>MAPI functions has to be obtained explicitly (using GetProcAddress), as <br>opposed to linking to the import library for MAPI.DLL. <br> <br>If sending/receiving mail is not the primary function of your application, you <br>can test presence of simple MAPI in a system without incurring high cost of <br>trying to load a DLL. You can test the value of the MAPI variable. It is 1 if <br>simple MAPI is installed. The variable is located in the [mail] section of <br>win.ini on 16-bit Windows and Windows NT version 3.51 and earlier and under <br>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows Messaging Subsystem in the <br>registry on Windows 95 and Windows NT 4.0 and later. <br> <br>Known Problems <br>-------------- <br> <br>When you Reply All to a message that you sent to yourself, your name will <br>appear twice in the To well. This is caused by the fact that Simple MAPI <br>does not expose either search key or a way to compare entry IDs, so there is <br>no safe way to remove duplicates from the recipient list. </code></pre>
