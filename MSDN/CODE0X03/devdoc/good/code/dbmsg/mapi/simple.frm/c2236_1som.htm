<pre><code>MAPI Sample Simple Form <br> <br> <br>The Simple.Frm sample application illustrates writing a form in C++. The form <br>can be used by form-aware mail clients for sending/receiving messages of <br>IPM.Note.Sample.Simple message class instead of standard send/read forms. <br> <br>Installation <br>------------ <br> <br>The form has to be properly registered to be used by mail clients. Run <br>pdkin32 -f smpfrm.cfg to register the form in the local form registry. Then <br>run regedit smpfrm.reg to register smpfrm.exe as an OLE server for the form in <br>the registry. The path to the form .EXE file has to be put in smpfrm.reg or <br>into the PATH. <br>  <br>Implementation <br>-------------- <br> <br>The forms class CBaseForm supports the IMAPIForm, IPersistMessage, and <br>IMAPIFormAdviseSink interfaces. Class CClassFactory implements IClassFactory. <br>The form also implements two helper classes: CLastError and CViewNotifier to <br>handle last error information and event notifications. <br> <br>If you would like to use the sample as a base for your own form, you'll need <br>to change: <br> <br> - File names. <br> - Form message class and class ID (in guid.h, smpfrm.reg, smpfrm.cfg). <br> - The Verbs and Extension sections and all the human readable information <br>   in smpfrm.cfg. <br> - The UI and supporting functions. <br> - Implementation of all of the IPersistMessage methods, IMAPIForm::Doverb. <br> <br>Supported Features <br>------------------ <br> <br> - Send. <br> - Reply, Forward. <br> - Next, Previous. <br> - Save, Delete. <br> <br>Unsupported Features <br>-------------------- <br> <br> - Attachments. <br> - Reply All, Post. <br> - Move, Copy. <br> - Print. <br> <br>For unsupported features, you have a choice of either disabling them or <br>delegating their execution to the form viewer. This is controlled by setting <br>the appropriate fields of the Value variable in the [Extensions.1] section of <br>the form .cfg file. Refer to MAPI Form Documentation for details. </code></pre>
