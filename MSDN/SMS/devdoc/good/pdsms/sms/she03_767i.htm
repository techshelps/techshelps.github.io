<p>
Applications compiled for a particular version of the SMS SDK DLLs (SMSAPI.DLL and OBJECTTY.DLL) will work with all subsequent versions of those DLLs, but may not run with earlier versions if new SDK functionality is being used. Additionally, the SDK DLLs are matched to a particular minor version of the SMS base DLLs (BASE.DLL) and will only run with that version of SMS. </p>
<p>
To make sure that applications run correctly, ISV application setup programs should perform checks during installation to determine which version of SMS and which version of the SMS SDK exist on the system where the application will be installed. The setup program can then use this information to determine which version of the SDK DLLs must be used with the application.</p>
<p>
This section describes the DLL resource strings that must be extracted to obtain version information, provides a code sample for extracting the resource strings, and details the actions to take to determine which DLLs to use with the application.</p>
