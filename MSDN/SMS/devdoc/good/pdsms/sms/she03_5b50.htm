<h2><a name="sms_.5b.setup_package_for_inventory.5d"></a>[Setup Package for Inventory] (required)</h2>
<p>
The [Setup Package for Inventory] section defines the Inventory properties of the package. The Inventory properties are used by the SMS system to maintain inventory on the package.</p>
<p>
The SMS system identifies a package by searching for a set of files that you specify in the package’s Inventory properties. For each file, you specify the attributes used to detect the file (such as file date, file size, CRC, and so on). If the SMS Inventory Agent program detects files that satisfy the conditions set by the package’s Inventory properties, the Inventory Agent reports that the package has been detected on the workstation.</p>
<p>
Within the Inventory properties, you can also set an option that enables SMS to collect specified files from workstations and store them at the site server.
<dl>
<dt>
<b>InventoryThisPackage</b> (required)</dt>
<dd>
This entry specifies whether the package should be included in the SMS inventory. You can specify TRUE or FALSE.
<p>
Example:

<pre><code>InventoryThisPackage = TRUE
 </code></pre>
</dd>
<dt>
<b>Detection Rule</b> (required)</dt>
<dd>
This entry specifies the inventory rule used to identify the package. A package’s inventory rule is the set of files used to identify the package. Using the <b>AND</b> and <b>OR</b> operators, you can specify the set of files required to detect the package.
<p>
For the files specified in the rule (except Boolean operators and grouping operators), the PDF must have a key that defines each file. Each file corresponds to a key that defines the attributes of the file. The file key heading must have the following form: [File <i>index</i>] where <i>index</i> is a unique integer that identifies the file within the PDF and the inventory rule. The <i>index</i> should start at 1 and increase by 1 for each additional file.

<p>
You combine the file specifications by using the following rules:

<ul>
<li>
Files are combined using <b>AND</b> and <b>OR</b> operators. <b>AND</b> has precedence over <b>OR</b>.</li>
<li>
Files can be grouped and ungrouped by using parentheses. Files within a group are treated as a single entity. For example, the rule File1 <b>AND</b> (File2 <b>OR</b> File3) specifies that SMS detects the package when File1 is found and either File2 or File3 is found—that is, File1 = TRUE and (File2 <b>OR</b> File3) = TRUE. Groups have precedence over <b>AND</b> and <b>OR</b>.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Example:

<pre><code>Detection Rule Part 1 = File1
Detection Rule Part 2 = AND
Detection Rule Part 3 = File2
Detection Rule Part 4 = OR
Detection Rule Part 5 = (
Detection Rule Part 6 = File3
Detection Rule Part 7 = AND
Detection Rule Part 8 = File4
Detection Rule Part 9 = )</code></pre>
