<h2><a name="sms_sms_status"></a>SMS_STATUS</h2>
<p>
All SMS API functions return a value of type SMS_STATUS. The functions can return the following values:
<dl>
<dt>
SMS_ALREADY_CONNECTED</dt>
<dd>
Your application has an existing connection to the site database. An application can have only one connection to a site database at one time.</dd>
<dt>
SMS_COMMIT_FAILED</dt>
<dd>
For <a href="sheapi_2s36.htm"><b>SmsCommitFolder</b></a>, the folder could not be committed to the site database.</dd>
<dt>
SMS_CONNECT_FAILED</dt>
<dd>
For <a href="sheapi_2s36.htm"><b>SmsCommitFolder</b></a>, the connection to the site database has been broken. The folder could not be committed to the database.</dd>
<dt>
SMS_CONTAINER_NOT_POPULATED</dt>
<dd>
For <a href="sheapi_58ky.htm"><b>SmsGetNextFolder</b></a>, the specified container is not populated.
<p>
An action was attempted on a container before the container was populated. The container must be populated before this action can be processed.
</dd>
<dt>
SMS_CONTAINER_POPULATED</dt>
<dd>
For <a href="sheapi_4u79.htm"><b>SmsPopulate</b></a> and <a href="sheapi_3z5e.htm"><b>SmsSetFilter</b></a>, the specified container is already populated.
<p>
An action was attempted on a container after the container was populated. The action must be taken before the container is populated.
</dd>
<dt>
SMS_DUPLICATE_FILTER</dt>
<dd>
For <a href="sheapi_3z5e.htm"><b>SmsSetFilter</b></a>, a filter of the specified type has already been set on the container.</dd>
<dt>
SMS_DUPLICATE_FOLDER</dt>
<dd>
For <a href="sheapi_88tu.htm"><b>SmsLinkFolder</b></a>, the specified folder is newly created and a folder with the same name already exists in the SMS database.</dd>
<dt>
SMS_EMPTY</dt>
<dd>
For <a href="sheapi_4u79.htm"><b>SmsPopulate</b></a>, the container was populated but returned no folders—no objects of the type specified were found in the site database.
<p>
For <a href="sheapi_3z5e.htm"><b>SmsSetFilter</b></a>, the application did not call <a href="sheapi_6c6m.htm"><b>SmsAddToken</b></a> to add tokens to the filter.
</dd>
<dt>
SMS_ERROR</dt>
<dd>
An unexpected error occurred. Usually, this is a SQL Server error.
<p>
Note that an insufficient size for the tempdb on the SQL Server containing the site database can cause this error to occur.

<p>
To size the tempdb, you should allocate 2K per machine (that is, 2K for each inventoried object, including objects of all architectures such as Personal Computer, SMSEvent, UserGroups, and so on). The log device should be at least 20 percent of the size of the data device. For example, if you have 50,000 machines in your SMS database, you should allocate at least 100 MB total for the tempdb and at least 20 MB for the tempdb log.
</dd>
<dt>
SMS_FILTER_NO_MODIFY</dt>
<dd>
For <a href="sheapi_6mcy.htm"><b>SmsCommitFilter</b></a>, the application attempted to commit a persistent filter. Only transient filters can be committed.</dd>
<dt>
SMS_FOLDER_ALREADY_DELETED</dt>
<dd>
An action was attempted on a folder or persistent filter that has already been deleted.</dd>
<dt>
SMS_FOLDER_LINKED</dt>
<dd>
For <a href="sheapi_88tu.htm"><b>SmsLinkFolder</b></a>, the specified folder has already been linked to the parent.</dd>

SMS_FOLDER_NO_UPDATE</dt>
<dd>
For <a href="sheapi_2s36.htm"><b>SmsCommitFolder</b></a> and <a href="sheapi_62sy.htm"><b>SmsSetScalar</b></a>, the folder is of a type that has read-only access.
<p>
In order to set a scalar or commit a folder, the parent folder or container of the scalar or folder must also have ACCESS_MODIFY or ACCESS_CREATE permissions.
</dd>
<dt>
SMS_FOLDER_NOT_MODIFIED</dt>
<dd>
For <a href="sheapi_2s36.htm"><b>SmsCommitFolder</b></a>, your application attempted to commit a newly-created folder whose scalars have not been set sufficiently to be added to the site database. Additional scalars may need to be set within the specified folder.</dd>

<dd>
For <a href="sheapi_3z5e.htm"><b>SmsSetFilter</b></a>, the filter's connection handle does not match the container's connection handle.</dd>

<p>
For <a href="sheapi_2nua.htm"><b>SmsDescribeFolder</b></a>, the specified folder type tag is for an unknown folder type. If an F_GROUP folder is specified, this status code is returned. The set of attributes for an F_GROUP folder is dependent on the instance of the group itself within a specific machine folder—there is no generic set of attributes for all F_GROUP folders.

(Note that <a href="sheapio_1gky.htm">job containers</a> and <a href="sheapio_5elu.htm">package containers</a> do not support asynchronous population.) Or an invalid window handle was specified in the <b>hwnd</b> member of the <b><i>pNotify</i></b> structure.
<p>
For <a href="sheapi_2s36.htm"><b>SmsCommitFolder</b></a>, one of the folder's scalars does not contain a valid value.

<p>

If your application attempted to add a token to an inventory rules folder and the <b>szTokenString</b> member of the <b>TOKEN</b> structure also uses the <b>retrieve</b> keyword, the <b>szTokenString</b> member may contain a file name that specifies an incorrect location for the file. <b>SmsAddToken</b> will not add the token to the inventory rules folder and will return a status of SMS_PARAMETER_ERROR. If your application passes OP_AND for the <i>opAndOr</i> parameter for an attribute filter, group filter, site filter, or architecture filter, a status of SMS_PARAMETER_ERROR is also returned.
