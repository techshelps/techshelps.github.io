<h2><a name="sms_placing_the_mif_file_on_an_inventory_collection_point"></a>Placing the MIF File on an Inventory Collection Point</h2>
<p>
To add an object to the inventory, you place its MIF file at an inventory collection point for the site where you want to add the object. The object will be added to the inventories of all sites up to the Central Site.</p>
<p>
You can place the MIF file at either of the following collection points:
<ul>
<li>
An ISV collection directory at one of the site's logon servers. By default, this directory is the \ISVMIF.BOX subdirectory of the SMS_SHR share on an SMS logon server.</li>
<li>
A stand-alone MIF collection directory on an SMS workstation at the site. The location of this directory is specified by the StandaloneISVMIFPath entry in the [SMS] section of the workstation's SMS.INI file. By default, this directory is C:\MS\SMS\IDMIFS.</li>
</ul>
<p>
The share name and path for these collection points were specified when you first installed the site.</p>
<p>
The SMS system detects the MIF file at inventory collection points. Using the information in the MIF file, the SMS system adds the object to the SMS system databases of the site containing the collection point and all of its parent sites.</p>
