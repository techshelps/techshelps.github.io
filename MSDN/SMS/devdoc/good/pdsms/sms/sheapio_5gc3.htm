<h2><a name="sms_types_of_system_jobs"></a>Types of System Jobs</h2>
<p>
There are different types of system jobs that perform different actions. The type of system job is identified by the Comment <a href="sheapio_55rn.htm">scalar</a> in the <a href="sheapio_3fw2.htm">system job folder</a>.</p>
<p>
Comment scalar values are as follows:
<dl>
<dt>
<b>System job to resync client</b></dt>
<dd>
The Inventory Data Loader creates a system job to initiate a resync (a full inventory scan) for a computer at the current site or at a child site. This system job is sent directly to the site containing the computer to be resynchronized. No package is created; all data for the resync is stored in an instruction file. Priority is Medium.</dd>
<dt>
<b>Applications Manager/ inventory rule replication</b></dt>
<dd>
The Applications Manager creates this job to send package properties (for the current site and site above it) to the sites directly below it in the hierarchy. Package property information includes package and program group changes, including deletions. Priority is Medium.</dd>
<dt>
<b>Site preinstall job for <i>secondary site code</i></b></dt>
<dd>
The Site Hierarchy Manager initiates this job to create an installation directory at the secondary site, to install the Bootstrap service to that directory, and to start that service at the site server for the secondary site. The Scheduler passes the job to the Sender, which connects to the site server for the secondary site and carries out system job instructions. No package is created for this job. Priority is High.</dd>
<dt>
<b>Site install job for <i>secondary site code</i></b></dt>
<dd>
The Site Hierarchy Manager initiates this job to send a package containing SMS site components to a secondary site. The Bootstrap service at the secondary site receives the package, decompresses it, and creates the site directory structure on the secondary site server. Priority is High. </dd>
<dt>
<b>Site control job for <i>secondary site code</i></b></dt>
<dd>
The Site Hierarchy Manager uses this job to create a package to send the site control file to the secondary site. This file contains configuration information for the site. The site control file can contain site delete instructions as well as updates (delete instructions occur after the parent site initiates a job to delete a secondary site; they serve to delete the secondary site from sites above the immediate parent). Priority is High. </dd>
<dt>
<b>Site deinstall job for <i>secondary site code</i></b></dt>
<dd>
The Site Hierarchy Manager at the parent site creates this job when a secondary site is deleted by using the SMS Administrator. No package is created. Priority is High.</dd>
<dt>
<b>Site Configuration Manager system job for sending site control file from secondary to parent site</b></dt>
<dd>
The Site Configuration Manager starts a system job to send the site control file from a secondary site to the parent site. The file is treated as a regular package: it is compressed by the Scheduler and placed in the SITE.SRV\SENDER.BOX\TOSEND directory. At the parent site, the Despooler decompresses the package and copies the file to the SITE.SRV\SITECFG.BOX using a unique name. Priority is High.</dd>
<dt>
<b>Site Configuration Manager system job for sending site control file from primary to parent site</b></dt>
<dd>
The Site Hierarchy Manager starts a system job to send the site control file from a primary site to its parent site. The file is treated as a regular package. It is compressed by the Scheduler and placed in the SITE.SRV\SENDER.BOX\TOSEND directory. At the parent site, the Despooler decompresses the package and copies the file to the SITE.SRV\SITECFG.BOX using a unique name. Priority is High.</dd>
<dt>
<b>System job for Site Reporter send of status and inventory</b></dt>
<dd>
The Site Reporter at a secondary site creates this job to send Delta-MIFs to the parent site. All Delta-MIFs in a directory are compressed into a single package by the Scheduler. The Despooler at the receiving site decompresses Delta-MIFs into a temporary directory and renames them to unique names (DEL*.MIF) in the SITE.SRV\DATALOAD.BOX\deltamif.coL directory. If any error event Delta-MIFs are involved, priority is Medium. Otherwise, priority is Low.
