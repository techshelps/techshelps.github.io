<p>
In an inventory rules folder, the set of files used to identify a package are combined by using <b>AND</b> and <b>OR</b> operators.</p>
<p>
The <b>AND</b> operator evaluates to true when both files connected by the <b>AND</b> are found in the same directory.</p>
<p>
The <b>OR</b> operator evaluates to true when any (or both) of the files connected by the <b>OR</b> are found in a directory.</p>
<p>
<b>AND</b> has precedence over <b>OR</b>.</p>
<p>
Note that the Inventory Agent program searches for the list of files within each directory. For example, if a package is defined as two files connected by an <b>AND</b> operator and the two files exist in different directories, the package is not detected:</p>
<pre><code>FILE "CONFIG.SYS"
  AND
  FILE "SYSTEM.INI"
</code></pre>
<p>
A package with <b>AND</b> operators is detected on a computer when all the file rules evaluate to true within the same directory. The example package would be found if CONFIG.SYS and SYSTEM.INI existed in the same directory (for example, C:\BACKUP).</p>
<p>
For files connected by an <b>OR</b> operator, one or both must exist in a directory for the package to be detected. For example, if a package is defined as two files connected by an <b>OR</b> operator and the two files exist in the same directory, one instance of the package is detected:</p>
<pre><code>FILE "CONFIG.SYS"
  OR
  FILE "SYSTEM.INI"
</code></pre>
<p>
If CONFIG.SYS is detected in C:\ and SYSTEM.INI is detected in C:\WINDOWS, two instances of the example package are detected because the file rule evaluates to true in both directories.</p>
