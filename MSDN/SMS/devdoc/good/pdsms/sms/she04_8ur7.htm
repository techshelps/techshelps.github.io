<p>
SMSVIEW creates a view called <b>vGroupNames</b> that lists the SMS group names that have views. However, because the list generated by this view may be inaccurate, you should ignore the contents of <b>vGroupNames</b> and use the query described in the previous section to get the correct listing of group names that have views.</p>
<p>
SMSVIEW creates a separate Identification view for each additional machine architecture created in SMS. Each of these additional Identification views will have a number appended to the end of the view name to distinguish it from the others. For example, if the vIdentification view refers to the Personal Computer architecture view, additional machine architecture Identification views will be vIdentification1, vIdentification2, and so on.</p>
