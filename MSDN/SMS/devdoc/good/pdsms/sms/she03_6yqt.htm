<h2><a name="sms_contents_of_the_prodspec.ini_file"></a>Contents of the <i>prodspec</i>.INI File</h2>
<p>
The <i>prodspec</i>.INI file uses the standard .INI file format and contains sections and keys that, taken together, uniquely define a specific version of a product. </p>
<p>
The contents of the<i> prodspec</i>.INI file are entirely arbitrary. However, the following sections and keys are recommended:
<ul>
<li>
[SMS Inventory Identification]<p>
This section contains the version number that identifies the file for SMS inventory if the file is used in later versions of SMS. This section also contains a warning to users not to edit the file. 
</li>
<li>
[Product Specification]<p>
The following keys are recommended: product name, version, localization, and patch or service pack level. These keys enable SMS to uniquely inventory versions of a package at different patch levels as well as the product itself. The localization key identifies the language version of the product. See the Microsoft Development Network (MSDN) Development Library for tables of the localization key names.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
It is important to note that a unique <i>prodspec</i>.INI must be created and included with the package each time the package ships. Upgrades of applications must replace the existing <i>prodspec</i>.INI to ensure that SMS inventories the application accurately. If <i>prodspec</i>.INI files for previous versions of the package remain after an upgrade, SMS will report both versions of the software.</p>
