<h2><a name="sms_system_job_folder_scalars"></a>System Job Folder Scalars</h2>
<p>
A system job folder contains a set of scalars that store information about the system job. System folder scalars have read-only access. Therefore, an application cannot set scalar values for a system job folder.</p>
<p>
A system job folder has the following scalars:
<dl>
<dt>
<b>Job ID</b></dt>
<dd>
String. A unique identifier for the job. When a job is created, the SMS system assigns the job a unique Job ID based on the site code (first three characters) and a number (last five characters).</dd>
<dt>
<b>Job type</b></dt>
<dd>
String. The type of job. There are three general types of system jobs:
<p>
"microsoft\SMS\mini-job"

<p>
"microsoft\SMS\site_job"

<p>
"microsoft\SMS\nad_transfer"
</dd>
<dt>
<b>Job comment</b></dt>
<dd>
String. Text that indicates the specific type of system job and its action. For a list and description of each specific type of system job, see <a href="sheapio_5gc3.htm">Types of System Jobs</a>.</dd>
<dt>
<b>Activate time</b></dt>
<dd>
Time. The time when you want SMS to activate the job.
<p>
The time specifies the date and time after which the Scheduler activates the job and begins sending the job to the target sites. Note that the Scheduler uses the SQL Server time to evaluate the activation time. Also note that this time is written directly to the site database, that is, no time zone conversion is done.
</dd>
<dt>
<b>Left icon</b></dt>
<dd>
String. A string that sets the left icon for the job in the Jobs window of the SMS Administrator.</dd>
<dt>
<b>Center icon</b></dt>
<dd>
String. A string that sets the middle icon for the job in the Jobs window of the SMS Administrator.</dd>
<dt>
<b>Right icon</b></dt>
<dd>
String. A string that sets the right icon for the job in the Jobs window of the SMS Administrator.</dd>
<dt>
<b>Priority</b></dt>
<dd>
Integer. Priority setting that you want the job to have relative to other jobs when being sent to target sites.
<p>
The priority setting is used to ensure that higher priority jobs are sent before lower priority jobs. A High priority tells the Scheduler to send the job to a target site before any other jobs with lower priority.

<p>
For example, if a Sender is sending a Medium or Low priority job and the Sender detects a High priority job in one of its outboxes, the Sender will suspend the sending of the lower priority job and send the High priority job first. After the High priority job has completed, the Sender will resume sending the lower priority job that was suspended.

<p>
In addition, an outbox can be set to process all jobs, only higher priority jobs, or no jobs at specified days and times.

<p>
High has priority over Medium and Low; Medium has priority over Low.

<dl>
<dt>
JOBPRI_HIGH</dt>
<dd>
High</dd>
<dt>
JOBPRI_MEDIUM</dt>
<dd>
Medium</dd>
<dt>
JOBPRI_LOW</dt>
<dd>
Low
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dt>
<b>Repeat mode</b></dt>
<dd>
Integer. Interval at which the job is repeated.
<p>
The intervals range from Daily (every 24 hours after the Activate time) to Monthly. The interval is based on the SMS system time. A repeated job generates a new job each time that interval elapses.

<dl>
<dt>
JOBRPT_NEVER</dt>
<dd>
Never. Perform the job once.</dd>
<dt>
JOBRPT_DAILY</dt>
<dd>
Daily. Repeat every 24 hours after the Activate time.</dd>
<dt>
JOBRPT_WEEKLY</dt>
<dd>
Weekly. Repeat every 7 days after the Activate time.</dd>
<dt>
JOBRPT_BIWEEKLY</dt>
<dd>
Biweekly. Repeat every 14 days after the Activate time.</dd>
<dt>
JOBRPT_MONTHLY</dt>
<dd>
Monthly. Repeat every month.
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dt>
<b>Cancel mode</b></dt>
<dd>
Integer. When Cancel mode is set to JOBCANCEL_CANCEL, the SMS system attempts to cancel the job. All other values for this scalar have no effect.
<dl>
<dt>
JOBCANCEL_DONT_CANCEL</dt>
<dd>
Do not cancel the job.</dd>
<dt>
JOBCANCEL_CANCEL</dt>
<dd>
Cancel the job.
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dt>
<b>Job status</b></dt>
<dd>
Integer. Indicates the overall status of the job across all target sites. There are six overall job states:
<dl>
<dt>
JOBSTAT_PENDING</dt>
<dd>
Pending. Indicates that the job has not started and that the Scheduler is waiting to activate the job. When a job has this overall status, you can delete the job and prevent it from ever starting.</dd>
<dt>
JOBSTAT_ACTIVE</dt>
<dd>
Active. Indicates that the Scheduler has started the job and that SMS is currently carrying out the job without errors. The job may be complete or may still be in progress at the target sites or computers.</dd>
<dt>
JOBSTAT_ACTIVE_FAILED</dt>
<dd>
Retrying. Indicates that the job has failed at some target sites or target computers; however, SMS continues to attempt to complete the job at those sites or computers. The job may be complete or may still be in progress at other target sites or computers.</dd>
<dt>
JOBSTAT_COMPLETE</dt>
<dd>
Complete. Indicates that the job successfully completed its tasks at all target computers at all target sites. When a job has this overall status, you can delete the job because the system does no further processing on the job.</dd>
<dt>

<dd>
Failed. Indicates that the job has failed at some or all target sites or target computers and that SMS has stopped trying to complete the job. The job may have completed successfully at some target sites or computers. You can note the job identifier and check the event log to determine why the job failed.
