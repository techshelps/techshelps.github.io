<h2><a name="sms_site_folder_scalars"></a>Site Folder Scalars</h2>
<p>
A <a href="sheapio_0o8i.htm">site folder</a> contains a set of scalars that store information about the site. Site folder scalars have read-only access. Therefore, an application cannot set scalar values for a site folder.</p>
<p>
A site folder has the following scalars:
<dl>
<dt>
<b>Site name</b></dt>
<dd>
String. Read-only access. Name of the site. The site name is specified when the site is created and cannot be changed.</dd>
<dt>
<b>Parent site</b></dt>
<dd>
String. Read-only access. Site code for the site's parent site. The parent site is directly above the child site in the site hierarchy. If the site has no parent site, the string is empty.</dd>
<dt>
<b>Depth</b></dt>
<dd>
Integer. Read-only access. Number of levels that the site is nested beneath the current site. For example, a site directly beneath the current site would have a depth of 1, and a site directly below that site would have a depth of 2. The current site has a depth of 0.</dd>
<dt>
<b>Status</b></dt>
<dd>
String. Read-only access. Last reported installation status for the site. Status can have the following values:
<dl>
<dt>
"Active"</dt>
