<h2><a name="sms_architecture_bitmaps"></a>Architecture Bitmaps</h2>
<p>
For each object of each architecture, the SMS Administrator displays a 16-by-16-pixel bitmap that represents that specific object within that specific architecture. These architecture bitmaps are displayed in the Sites, Machine Groups, and Query Results windows.</p>
<p>
Using a resource-only DLL, you can override the graphics for existing architectures and objects or add graphics for new types of architectures or objects. If a new architecture or new type of object is added to the SMS inventory and no resource-only DLL is provided, the default graphic is displayed.</p>
<h5><img src="../../../images/wedge.gif" border=0>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To override or add an architecture bitmap for an object</h5>
<ol>
<li>
Create a 16-by-16-pixel bitmap for the object.</li>
<li>
In the resource script for the DLL, add the bitmap by using the following formats:<p>
<i>architecture</i>_<i>SystemType</i>_<i>SystemRole</i>
<p>
–or–
<p>
<i>architecture</i>_<i>SystemRole</i>
<p>
where <i>architecture</i> is the name of the object's architecture, <i>SystemType</i> is the value for the SystemType attribute in the Identification group, and <i>SystemRole</i> is the value for the SystemRole attribute in the Identification group.
<p>
<b>Important</b>  In an architecture, SystemType, or SystemRole name, you must replace any spaces with an underscore character. For example, the Personal Computer architecture should be specified as Personal_Computer.
<p>
The SMS Administrator will search first for a bitmap named according to format 1. If a bitmap resource of this name cannot be found in any of the registered resource-only DLLs, the SMS Administrator searches for a bitmap named according to format 2. If this bitmap resource cannot be found, the default bitmap is displayed.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
For example, a Macintosh workstation has an architecture Personal Computer, SystemType Macintosh, and SystemRole Workstation. You could create a bitmap named MAC.BMP and use it as the graphic for a Macintosh workstation by adding the following line to your resource script:</p>
<pre><code>Personal_Computer_Macintosh_Workstation  BITMAP  mac.bmp
</code></pre>
<p>
You can also specify a mask bitmap for an architecture bitmap. A mask bitmap explicitly specifies the pixels to display with the highlight color (if the object is selected) or the background window color (if the object is not selected). The mask bitmap is white where you want the highlight color or background window color to show through the bitmap, and black where you want the bitmap to show. If you do not provide a mask, the system will generate one.</p>
<p>
For the previous example, you could create a mask bitmap called MACMASK.BMP and use it as the mask when the object is selected:</p>
<pre><code>Personal_Computer_Macintosh_Workstationmask  BITMAP  macmask.bmp
 </code></pre>
