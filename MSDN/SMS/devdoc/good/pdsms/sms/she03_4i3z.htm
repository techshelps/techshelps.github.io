<p>
Microsoft has developed the Designed for Microsoft BackOffice logo program to provide developers and users with consistent criteria and standards to use in developing and implementing client/server solutions that live in the Microsoft BackOffice environment. The goal of the logo program is to help users identify applications designed specifically to take advantage of BackOffice components and functionality, and to allow developers to garner the marketing benefits of using the logo on product packaging, advertisements, collateral, and other materials. Meeting the criteria required to obtain a logo ensures that your product uses and benefits from important BackOffice technologies. </p>
