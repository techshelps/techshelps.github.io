<h3><a name="sms_system_job_folder"></a>System Job Folder (F_SYSTEMJOB)</h3>
<p>
A system job folder (F_SYSTEMJOB) represents a job created by the SMS system to maintain the configuration at sites below the current site in the site hierarchy.</p>
<p>
The SMS system uses system jobs to transfer instructions and data to other sites. For example, if you change a package's properties in the site's database, these package changes trigger a system job that updates the package in the databases of all primary sites beneath the current site.</p>
<p>
Unlike other types of jobs, system jobs (except NAD transfer system jobs) are targeted for a single site and do not return job details or status information. However, system jobs created at a site appear in the Jobs window. Internally, SMS has full control over these jobs—it can cancel, activate, or delete system jobs.</p>
<p>
Using the SMS API, your application can perform the following actions:
<ul>
<li>
View existing system jobs</li>
<li>
Delete existing system jobs</li>
</ul>
<p>
Note that your application can delete a system job from the site database only when it is active or after it has been completed or canceled by SMS.</p>
<p>
Different types of system jobs perform different actions. The type of system job is identified by the Comment field in the system job folder.</p>
<p>
A system job folder has the following properties:</p>
