<p>
You could use the SMS API to automate the setup of an application for immediate distribution and installation through Systems Management Server. Your setup program could install a network version of your application on a server and then use the SMS API to create a package for the application, specifying the installation directory where your setup program just installed your application and the workstation command lines used to install the application on individual computers. You could further extend the functionality of your setup program by creating a query to find computers that have an older version of your application. Your setup program could then create a Run Command On Workstation job that uses an upgrade workstation command line for your application's package and targets the computers that were found with your query.</p>
