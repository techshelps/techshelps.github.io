<h2><a name="sms_determining_which_dlls_to_use"></a>Determining Which DLLs to Use</h2>
<p>
ISV applications that are intended to be installed on both SMS 1.1 and 1.2 should ship with a version of the SMS 1.1 DLLs because these DLLs are not included in an SMS 1.1 installation. </p>
<p>
It may also be appropriate to ship the application with a version of the SMS 1.2 DLLs if the application requires a later version of the DLLs than the version that shipped with the SMS 1.2 product. The SMS 1.2 DLLs shipping with this SDK are a later version and include functional enhancements that are not part of the DLLs shipped with the SMS 1.2 product.</p>
<p>
To determine which version of the DLLs to use with the application, run the code shown in the previous section on BASE.DLL to determine which version of SMS is running on the system where the application is being installed. Then, take one of the following actions:</p>
<p>
<b>For applications that ship with SDK DLLs</b></p>
<p>
When the application is being installed on SMS 1.1:
<ul>
<li>
If the application is shipping with SMS 1.1 SDK DLLs, these DLLs should be installed and used.</li>
<li>
If the application is shipping with SMS 1.2 SDK DLLs and a version of the SMS 1.1 DLLs is not found in the site server BIN directory, the setup program should report an error stating that the ISV application cannot run with this version of SMS.</li>
<li>
When the application is being installed on SMS 1.2:</li>
<li>
If the application is shipping with SMS 1.2 SDK DLLs, the setup program should compare the build version of the DLLs being shipped with that of the DLLs in the SMS site server BIN directory. The DLLs with the higher build number should be used. If the DLLs shipped with the application have the higher build number, they should be installed in the SMS site server BIN directory and the application should load them from this directory. <p>
If the DLLs have the same build number, the application can use the existing DLLs in the site server BIN directory.
</li>
<li>
If the SDK DLLs being shipped with the application are of a different version of SMS (other than 1.2), the application should use the existing DLLs in the site server BIN directory. </li>
</ul>
<p>
<b>For applications that do not ship with SDK DLLs</b></p>
<p>
The setup program must make sure that it can load the SDK DLLs from the SMS site server BIN directory. If the application is being installed on SMS 1.1 and the DLLs are not present, the setup program should report an error stating that the ISV application cannot run with this version of SMS.</p>
