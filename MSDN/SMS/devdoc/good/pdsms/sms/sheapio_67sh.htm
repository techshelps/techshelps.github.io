<h3><a name="sms_delete_a_folder_proc1"></a>Delete a folder</h3>
<h5><img src="../../../images/wedge.gif" border=0>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To delete a folder</h5>
<ol>
<li>
After getting the handle to the folder you want to delete, use the <a href="sheapi_0pte.htm"><b>SmsUnlinkFolder</b></a> function to unlink the folder from its parent (the parent is the container or folder that contains the folder to delete). Note that unlinking a folder only detaches the folder from its parent within the application's memory—the folder is not deleted from the site database.<p>
Example:
<pre><code>// UnLink the folder from its parent.
stat = SmsUnLinkFolder( hFolder );
</code></pre>
<p>
If the parent folder's handle is still open, your application can link the folder to its parent again.
</li>
<li>
Use the <a href="sheapi_2s36.htm"><b>SmsCommitFolder</b></a> function to remove the unlinked folder from the site database.<p>
Example:
<pre><code>// Remove the folder from the site database.
stat = SmsCommitFolder( hFolder );
 </code></pre>
<p>
Note that the folder is not deleted from the site database until the application calls the <b>SmsCommitFolder</b> function for that folder. If you do not want to delete the folder from the database, do not commit the unlinked folder.
<p>
<b>Important </b>After your application deletes a folder from the site database by using the <b>SmsCommitFolder</b> function, the handle for the deleted folder can only be used for closing the folder with the <b>SmsCloseFolder</b> function.
</li>
</ol>
