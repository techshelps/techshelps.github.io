<h2><a name="sms_inventory_rules_folder_scalars"></a>Inventory Rules Folder Scalars</h2>
<p>
An inventory rules folder contains a single scalar that stores information about the package's availablity for inventory. Inventory rules folder scalars have both create and read access. Therefore, an application can create an inventory rules folder.</p>
<p>
An inventory rules folder has the following scalar:</p>

<dl>
<dt>
<a name="sms_f_inventory_inventory_this_package"></a><b>Inventory this package</b></dt>
<dd>
Integer. Create access. A flag that specifies that the package be included in the SMS software inventory, using the rule defined by the tokens in the inventory rules folder. TRUE specifies that the package is included in the inventory. FALSE specifies that the package is not included in the inventory.
<p>
The Inventory this package scalar is used by the SMS API engine to determine whether to set the <a href="sheapio_0zg3.htm#sms_f_package_inventory_package">Inventory package</a> scalar for the <a href="sheapio_9rci.htm">package folder</a> that contains the inventory rule folder. Note that the SMS API engine will set the Inventory package scalar for a package folder to TRUE only if the following conditions are met:

<ul>
<li>
Inventory this package scalar is set to TRUE.</li>
<li>
The inventory rules folder contains at least one expression <a href="sheapio_7rw3.htm">token</a>.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
