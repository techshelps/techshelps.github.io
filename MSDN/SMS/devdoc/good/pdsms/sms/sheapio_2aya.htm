<p>
Include the SMSAPI.H file in source files that use the SMS API.</p>
<p>
The SMSAPI.H file is the header file for the SMS API. It is located in the \MSSDK\INCLUDE directory of the Platform SDK CD-ROM.</p>
<p>
Note that SMSAPI.H includes three other header files: QRYCODES.H, OBJECTTY.H, and SMSINFO.H. These files are also located in the \MSSDK\INCLUDE directory of the Platform SDK CD-ROM.</p>
<p>
When building your application, you must also statically link SMSAPI.LIB and OBJECTTY.LIB. These static libraries are located in the \MSSDK\LIB\<i>platform</i> directory of the Platform SDK CD-ROM, where <i>platform</i> is the processor type of your build environment and target processor platform.</p>
