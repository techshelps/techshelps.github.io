<p>
The sample document SMSTRAIN.DOC (using the macros in the SMS.DOT template and the ODBC functions in WBODBC.WLL) reads the site database and finds all inventoried software packages. After you select one of these packages, the macro finds all of the computers that have the package installed and generates a letter for the user of each computer informing the user about training information for that package. You can generate these messages to another Word document, to a printer, or to Microsoft® Mail messages.</p>
<h5><img src="../../../images/wedge.gif" border=0>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To set up Microsoft Word for using the sample with Microsoft Mail</h5>
<ol>
<li>
Install Microsoft Mail on the computer where you are using the sample document SMSTRAIN.DOC.</li>
<li>
Users of SMS computers must complete the UINFO.XNF form that is automatically distributed to SMS client computers.<p>
When the users complete this form, they report their name, electronic mail, and other information with their computer inventories. The macro used by SMS.DOT uses the information in the electronic-mail attribute to send the messages as mail messages to the users of the package.
</li>
</ol>
<h5><img src="../../../images/wedge.gif" border=0>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To set up the Word sample</h5>
<ol>
<li>
Before you run the Word sample, make sure that your site database contains inventory for one or more software packages.</li>
<li>
Copy SMS.DOT and WBODBC.WLL from the SDK\TEMPLATE directory on the SMS CD-ROM to the template directory used by Microsoft Word (usually, the template directory is the TEMPLATE subdirectory of the Word root directory).</li>
<li>
Copy SMSTRAIN.DOC from the SDK directory on the SMS CD-ROM to the directory on your hard disk where you want to place the sample.</li>
</ol>
<h5><img src="../../../images/wedge.gif" border=0>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To use the Word sample</h5>

</li>
<li>
From the list box, select the software package that you want to use to search for SMS computers.<p>
The macro will query the site database to get all computers with the software package installed. The macro will search for computers with the Personal Computer architecture with the attribute Software Name equal to the selected package in the Software group (group class MICROSOFT|SOFTWARE|1.0).
</li>
<li>
From the <b>Notification Method</b> box, select the method to use to notify the computer users of the package.<p>
If you choose <b>Merge To Document</b>, a Word document will be created for each computer user with the software package.
