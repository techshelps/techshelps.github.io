<p>
SMS uses jobs to distribute packages to target systems. There are three primary types of jobs for this purpose: <a href="she03_29yr.htm">Run Command on Workstation jobs</a>, <a href="she03_2zqr.htm">Share Package on Server jobs</a>, and <a href="she03_7rw3.htm">Remove Package From Server jobs</a>.</p>
<p>
There are various job options that you can specify, depending on the type of job that you are creating. The main options that affect the distribution of software are the specification of targets, the distribution servers where the package will be made available, and the options for the run phase of the job.</p>
<p>
The most useful mechanism for specifying job targets is an SMS database query. You can create a query that allows you to target only those clients or servers that meet the criteria for the particular package that you are going to install. Once you have defined and run the query, the resulting set of clients or servers can be specified as the target of the job.</p>
