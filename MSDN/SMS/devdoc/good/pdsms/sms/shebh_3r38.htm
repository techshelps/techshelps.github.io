<h2><a name="sms_the_level_field"></a>The Level Field</h2>
<p>
The level fields of the <b>AttachPropertyInstance</b> and <b>AttachPropertyInstanceEx</b> APIs are used by the user interface for making decisions about which properties are subservient to other properties. For example, if you have a flags byte:</p>
<pre><code>Joe Flags = 0x06 
 </code></pre>
<p>
which is a level 2 property, then when you break out the definition of the flags:</p>
<pre><code>Joe Flags = 0x06 
    ......1.  User has Read Privileges
    .....1..  User has Write Privileges
 </code></pre>
<p>
The breakdown of the flags properties are set to level 3. The user interface automatically indents the level 3 properties from the level 2 properties, and, if the user wishes, the user interface can hide all level 3 properties for that protocol.</p>
<p>
Another use of the level field is to show increasing detail of the properties. A level 4 property should be one that has more detail than a level 3 property.</p>
<p>
Parsers should strive to follow the following rules:
<ul>
<li>
Properties should go from less detail to more detail as you indent further.</li>
<li>
Properties at the same level should pass the test of "Is this property as important as its peers at this level?" If not, group them under another property, or make a new property that summaries the group and add the properties at a higher level.</li>
<li>
A parser writer should strive to make as much information available as will fit within a normal detail pane under a VGA system.</li>
</ul>
