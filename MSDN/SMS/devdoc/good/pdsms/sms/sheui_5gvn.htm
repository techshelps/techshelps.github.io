<h1><a name="sms_how_the_sms_administrator_uses_resource_dlls_to_display_graphics"></a>How the SMS Administrator Uses Resource DLLs to Display Graphics</h1>
<p>
When the SMS Administrator needs to display an object or group, it searches for the graphics to use for the display of that architecture, object, or group in the set of DLLs specified in the Windows NT Registry. When displaying a specific object or group, the SMS Administrator searches for a resource with a name corresponding to the object's architecture, type, and/or group. For the naming conventions used for the resources for graphics, see <a href="sheui_3boz.htm">Architecture Bitmaps</a> and <a href="sheui_8lir.htm">Machine Properties Icons</a>.</p>
<p>
The set of DLLs can be specified by using the following registry keys:</p>
<p>
<b>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\SMS\ResDLLs</b></p>
<p>
<b>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\SMS\ResDLLs</b></p>
<p>
Within the <b>ResDLLs</b> key, there is an Installed value that lists the subkey that represents each DLL in the list. For example, if the Installed value contained DLLName1 DLLName2, two DLLs are specified and the path to those DLLs is specified by the DLLName1 and DLLName2 subkeys. Beneath the <b>ResDLLs</b> key, there are subkeys for each DLL specified in the Installed value. Each of those subkeys contains a PathName value. The PathName value contains the actual path and file name of the DLL.</p>
<p>
When the SMS Administrator searches for display graphics in the resource-only DLLs, it searches the DLLs in the following order:
<ol>
<li>
DLLs listed in <b>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE</b>. The SMS Administrator uses the reverse of the order listed in the Installed value to search the DLLs.</li>
<li>
DLLs listed in <b>HKEY_CURRENT_USER</b>. The SMS Administrator uses the reverse of the order listed in the Installed value to search the DLLs.</li>
<li>
SMS Administrator's own application resources. Note that some architectures, objects, and groups (such as the Personal Computer architecture, Macintosh workstation computers, and the Processor and Disk groups) have graphics predefined in the SMS Administrator's resources. However, these graphics can be overriden by a resource-only DLL.</li>
</ol>
<p>
Because the graphic for an item may have more than one available format, the SMS Administrator may search the list of resources several times. For the naming conventions used for the resources for graphics, see <a href="sheui_3boz.htm">Architecture Bitmaps</a> and <a href="sheui_8lir.htm">Machine Properties Icons</a>.</p>
<p>
For example, if the SMS Administrator needed to display a Macintosh workstation, it would first search for a graphic for the specific architecture, system type, and role in all resources. In this case, the resource name would be Personal_Computer_Macintosh_Workstation. If the resource with this name is found, it uses that graphic. If no resource with this name is found, it searches for the graphic for the architecure and role. In this case, the resource name would be Personal_Computer_Workstation. If no resource matching this name is found, it searches for the graphic for the architecture. In this case, the resource name would be Personal_Computer_None. If no resource matching this name is found, the default graphic is displayed.</p>
