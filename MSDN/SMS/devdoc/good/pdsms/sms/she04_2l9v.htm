<p>
This sample Access database uses ODBC to link to the SMS database. The sample provides one form, five queries, and two reports.</p>
<p>
The form shows all computers with duplicate TCP/IP addresses.</p>
<p>
There are five queries: Duplicate TCP/IP Addresses, Late Scan, ListDup, Low Disk Space, and Network.</p>
<p>
The first report shows all computers that have not scanned their hardware or software in the past 10 days. The second report shows all computers that have fixed disks that are over 90 percent full.</p>
<p>
You can use Microsoft Access to generate any number of forms or reports to analyze the SMS data. For example, you can create a help desk tracking system using Microsoft Access that ties in to the site database. This can include maintenance history, trouble calls, configuration changes, and so on.</p>
<h5><img src="../../../images/wedge.gif" border=0>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To set up Microsoft Access for the Microsoft Access sample</h5>
<p>
Make sure you have completed the ODBC setup as described in <a href="she04_573n.htm">General Setup for Using the SMSVIEW Samples</a>.</p>
<h5><img src="../../../images/wedge.gif" border=0>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To use the Microsoft Access sample</h5>
<ol>
<li>
Start Microsoft Access.</li>
<li>
Copy SMSDB.MDB from the SDK directory on the SMS CD-ROM to the directory on your hard disk where you want to place the sample.</li>
<li>
Open the SMSDB.MDB database.<p>
The sample has a main menu form, from which you choose a report or form. You can view the queries (as well as the form and reports) in the database window for SMSDB.
<p>
When you click a button in the main menu form, the <b>SQL Server Login</b> dialog box appears.
</li>
<li>
In the <b>Login ID</b> and <b>Password</b> boxes, type the SQL login identifier and password for the SQL Server containing the site database.<p>
Note that the SQL login identifier must have dbo permission on the site database.
</li>
<li>
In the Database: SMSDB window, you can choose the tab for the type of item you want to use. The sample SMSDB database provides sample forms, queries, and reports. In the tab list, double-click the item you want to use.</li>
</ol>
