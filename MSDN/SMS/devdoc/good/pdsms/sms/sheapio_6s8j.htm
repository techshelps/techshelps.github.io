<h2><a name="sms_remove_package_job_folder_scalars"></a>Remove Package From Server Job Folder Scalars</h2>
<p>
A <a href="sheapio_0hwy.htm">Remove Package From Server job folder</a> contains a set of scalars that store information about the job. Remove Package From Server folder scalars have both create and read access. Therefore, an application can create a Remove Package From Server job folder.</p>
<p>
A Remove Package From Server job folder has the following scalars:</p>

<dl>
<dt>
<a name="sms_f_rempkgjob_job_id"></a><b>Job ID</b></dt>
<dd>
String. Read-only access. Unique identifier for the job. The SMS system assigns the job a unique eight-character Job ID based on the site code (first three characters) and five characters (last five characters).</dd>
<dt>
<a name="sms_f_rempkgjob_job_type"></a><b>Job type</b></dt>
<dd>
String. Read-only access. The type of job. For the F_REMPKGJOB folder, the Job type is always "microsoft\SMS\remove_package".</dd>
<dt>
<a name="sms_f_rempkgjob_job_comment"></a><b>Job comment</b></dt>
<dd>
String. Modify access. Text that describes the job. This text is viewed only by administrators of the SMS system. You can use this field to save comments about the job for yourself or other SMS administrators. You may want to include the package name, job target, or other information that helps you identify the job. Maximum length is 255 characters.</dd>
<dt>
<a name="sms_f_rempkgjob_activate_time"></a><b>Activate time</b></dt>
<dd>
Time. Create access. The time when you want SMS to activate the job.
<p>
The time specifies the date and time after which the Scheduler activates the job and begins sending the job to the target sites. Note that the Scheduler uses the SQL Server time to evaluate the activation time. Also note that this time is written directly to the site database, that is, no time zone conversion is done.
</dd>
<dt>
<a name="sms_f_rempkgjob_left_icon"></a><b>Left icon</b></dt>
<dd>
String. Read-only access. A string that sets the left icon for the job in the Jobs window of the SMS Administrator.</dd>
<dt>
<a name="sms_f_rempkgjob_center_icon"></a><b>Center icon</b></dt>
<dd>
String. Read-only access. A string that sets the middle icon for the job in the Jobs window of the SMS Administrator.</dd>
<dt>
<a name="sms_f_rempkgjob_right_icon"></a><b>Right icon</b></dt>
<dd>
String. Read-only access. A string that sets the right icon for the job in the Jobs window of the SMS Administrator.</dd>
<dt>
<a name="sms_f_rempkgjob_priority"></a><b>Priority</b></dt>
<dd>
Integer. Modify access. Priority setting that you want the job to have relative to other jobs when being sent to target sites.
<p>
The priority setting is used to ensure that higher priority jobs are sent before lower priority jobs. A High priority tells the Scheduler to send the job to a target site before any other jobs with a lower priority.

<p>
For example, if a Sender is sending a Medium or Low priority job and the Sender detects a High priority job in one of its outboxes, the Sender will suspend the sending of the lower priority job and send the High priority job first. After the High priority job has completed, the Sender will resume sending the lower priority job that was suspended.

<p>
In addition, an outbox can be set to process all jobs, only higher priority jobs, or no jobs at specified days and times.

<p>
High has priority over Medium and Low; Medium has priority over Low.

<dl>
<dt>
JOBPRI_HIGH</dt>
<dd>
High</dd>
<dt>
JOBPRI_MEDIUM</dt>
<dd>
Medium</dd>
<dt>
JOBPRI_LOW</dt>
<dd>
Low
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dt>
<a name="sms_f_rempkgjob_repeat_mode"></a><b>Repeat mode</b></dt>
<dd>
Integer. Modify access. Interval at which the job is repeated.
<p>
The intervals range from Daily (every 24 hours after the Activate time) to Monthly. The interval is based on the SMS system time. A repeated job generates a new job each time that interval elapses.

<dl>
<dt>
JOBRPT_NEVER</dt>
<dd>
Never. Perform the job once.</dd>
<dt>
JOBRPT_DAILY</dt>
<dd>
Daily. Repeat every 24 hours after the Activate time.</dd>
<dt>
JOBRPT_WEEKLY</dt>
<dd>
Weekly. Repeat every 7 days after the Activate time.</dd>
<dt>
JOBRPT_BIWEEKLY</dt>
<dd>
Biweekly. Repeat every 14 days after the Activate time.</dd>
<dt>
JOBRPT_MONTHLY</dt>
<dd>
Monthly. Repeat every month.
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dt>
<a name="sms_f_rempkgjob_cancel_mode"></a><b>Cancel mode</b></dt>
<dd>
Integer. Modify access. When Cancel mode is set to JOBCANCEL_CANCEL, the SMS system attempts to cancel the job. Any other values for this scalar have no effect.
<dl>
<dt>
JOBCANCEL_DONT_CANCEL</dt>
<dd>
Do not cancel the job.</dd>
<dt>
JOBCANCEL_CANCEL</dt>
<dd>
Cancel the job.
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dt>
<a name="sms_f_rempkgjob_package_id"></a><b>Package ID</b></dt>
<dd>

<p>
<b>Caution</b>  If your application is creating a Remove Package From Server job, your application must ensure that this scalar is set to a valid package identifier. Your application can get the package identifier through the <a href="sheapio_9rci.htm">package's folder</a> in a populated <a href="sheapio_5elu.htm">package container</a>.

</dd>
<dt>
<a name="sms_f_rempkgjob_limit_to_sites"></a><b>Limit to sites</b></dt>
<dd>

Specifies that the job target should be the current site and all sites beneath the current site.</dd>
<dt>
JOBTGT_SITEGROUP</dt>
<dd>
Enables your application to narrow down the job target to the sites in a site group.
<p>
When using this option, your application must also set <a href="#sms_f_rempkgjob_site_limit_name">Site limit name</a> scalar to specify the site group to use.
</dd>
<dt>
JOBTGT_SITE</dt>
<dd>
Enables your application to narrow down the job target to a specific site.
<p>
When using this option, your application must also set Site limit name scalar to specify the site to use.

</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dt>
<a name="sms_f_rempkgjob_include_subsites"></a><b>Include subsites</b></dt>
<dd>
Integer. Modify access. Option that specifies how a job is propagated to the subsites of the sites that you specified by <a href="#sms_f_rempkgjob_site_limit_name">Site limit name</a> scalar. This scalar applies only if the Limit to sites scalar is set to JOBTGT_SITEGROUP or JOBTGT_SITE.
<dl>
<dt>
JOBTGT_NOSUBSITES</dt>
<dd>
Specifies that only the sites specified in the Site limit name scalar are used.</dd>
<dt>
JOBTGT_INCLUDESUBSITES</dt>
<dd>
Enables your application to specify that the job target includes the subsites of the sites that you specfied in the Site limit name scalar.
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dt>
<a name="sms_f_rempkgjob_site_limit_name"></a><b>Site limit name</b></dt>
<dd>
String. Modify access. The name of the site or site group to which to limit the job target. This scalar applies only if the <a href="#sms_f_rempkgjob_limit_to_sites">Limit to sites</a> scalar is set to JOBTGT_SITEGROUP or JOBTGT_SITE.
<p>
If Limit to sites is set to JOBTGT_SITE, the Site limit name scalar specifies the name of the site to which to limit the job target.

<p>
If Limit to sites is set to JOBTGT_SITEGROUP, the Site limit name scalar specifies the name of the site group to which to limit the job target.

<p>
If the <a href="#sms_f_rempkgjob_include_subsites">Include subsites</a> scalar is set to JOBTGT_INCLUDESUBSITES, the job target is limited to the specified site or site group and its subsites.


<p>
<b>Caution</b>  When creating a job, your application must ensure that this scalar is set to a valid site or site group name. Your application can get the site name through the site's <a href="sheapio_0o8i.htm">site folder</a> in a populated <a href="sheapio_4zhu.htm">site container</a>. Your application can get the site group name through the site group's <a href="sheapio_2bzm.htm">site group folder</a> in a populated <a href="sheapio_3oky.htm">site group container</a>.

</dd>
<dt>
<a name="sms_f_rempkgjob_package_type"></a><b>Package type</b></dt>
<dd>

<dl>
<dt>
RMPKGJOB_PKGTYPE_WKSTA</dt>

<dt>
RMPKGJOB_PKGTYPE_SERVER</dt>
<dd>
Specifies the package source directory defined by the package's Sharing properties. This is the package source directory that has been sent or distributed by a Share Package On Server job.</dd>
<dt>
RMPKGJOB_PKGTYPE_BOTH</dt>
<dd>
Specifies the package source directory for both types of packages: RMPKGJOB_PKGTYPE_WKSTA and RMPKGJOB_PKGTYPE_SERVER.
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dt>
<a name="sms_f_rempkgjob_job_tasks"></a><b>Job tasks</b></dt>
<dd>
Integer. Modify access. Method used to specify the distribution servers where the package source directory will be removed. For the sharing version of a package, the package directory will be removed from these servers based on the share name that was set for the package. There are two methods for specifying the distribution servers. Your application can select one method.
<dl>
<dt>
RMPKGJOB_TASKS_RM_ALL</dt>
<dd>
Removes the uncompressed version of the package from all distribution servers where the package source directory exists. This option also removes the compressed package from the site server in each target site.</dd>
<dt>
RMPKGJOB_TASKS_RM_SELECTED</dt>
<dd>
Removes the uncompressed package from the distribution servers specified by the <a href="#sms_f_rempkgjob_distribution_servers">Distribution servers</a> scalar.
</dd>
</dl>

<p>
When the job is carried out, SMS removes the package from the specified distribution servers. If RMPKGJOB_TASKS_RM_ALL is set, the compressed files are also removed from the site server in each target site.
</dd>
<dt>
<a name="sms_f_rempkgjob_distribution_servers"></a><b>Distribution servers</b></dt>
<dd>
String. Modify access. The name of the machine group that contains the distribution servers from which to remove the package.
<p>
When the <a href="#sms_f_rempkgjob_job_tasks">Job tasks</a> scalar is set to RMPKGJOB_TASKS_RM_SELECTED, this machine group specifies the distribution servers for the job.

<p>
To specify the Default Servers group, your application must set the Job tasks scalar to RMPKGJOB_TASKS_RM_SELECTED, and set the Distribution servers scalar to NULL. <i>Default Servers</i> is a special machine group created at each site (Default Servers are maintained using the <b>Site Properties</b> dialog box in the SMS Administrator). If default servers are used as distribution servers at a target site, the SMS Scheduler (at the site where the job is created) builds the list of target distribution servers for the target sites. Note that the list of default servers is read from the site database of the site where the job was created. This means that the default servers on the list are the default servers that were last reported to the site where the job was created.


<p>
<b>Caution</b>  When creating a job, your application must ensure that this scalar is set to a valid machine group name or set to NULL (NULL specifies the Default Servers group). Your application can get the machine group name through the <a href="sheapio_4b3m.htm">machine group's folder</a> in a populated <a href="sheapio_8zoy.htm">machine group container</a>.

</dd>
<dt>
