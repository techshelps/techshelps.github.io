<h2><a name="sms_package_folder_scalars"></a>Package Folder Scalars</h2>
<p>
A package folder contains a set of scalars that store information about the package. Package folder scalars have both create and read access. Therefore, an application can create a package folder.</p>
<p>
A package folder has the following scalars:</p>

<dl>
<dt>
<a name="sms_f_package_key"></a><b>Key</b></dt>
<dd>
String. Read-only access. Unique identifier for the package. The SMS system assigns the job a unique eight-character job identifier based on the site code (first three characters) and five characters (last five characters).</dd>
<dt>
<a name="sms_f_package_name"></a><b>Name</b></dt>
<dd>
String. Create access. Name for the package. This scalar is required for committing the package folder to the site database.
<p>
Give the package a descriptive name, such as the name of the application. When you create a Run Command On Workstation job to install this package on computers, this name appears as the package's description in the Package Command Manager at the target computers.
</dd>
<dt>
<a name="sms_f_package_comment"></a><b>Comment</b></dt>
<dd>
String. Create access. Text to further describe the package.
<p>
For a Run Command On Workstation job, the comment text is displayed to the user in the <b>Details</b> dialog box of the Package Command Manager. The Comment text can be used to display a short description of instructions for the applications (or command line) provided by the package.

<p>
For Share Package On Server jobs, the comment is not used.
</dd>
<dt>
<a name="sms_f_package_workstation_root"></a><b>Workstation root</b></dt>
<dd>
String. The network path to the shared directory where the files for the Workstations properties are located. This scalar is required for the package to be available for Run Command On Workstation jobs.
<p>
You can specify the universal naming convention (UNC) share name or a redirected drive name. Note that SMS resolves the redirected drive to its UNC path. For example, a UNC path could be \\APPSVR\WINSHARE\EXCEL. Or if drive K: is connected to \\APPSVR\WINSHARE, you could specify K:\EXCEL as the source directory, unless the SMS Scheduler is on another server. If the Scheduler is not on the site server, use the UNC path to specify the source directory.


<p>
<b>Important</b>  Your application is responsible for verifying that the Workstation root scalar contains a valid path to the source directory for Workstation properties. The Scheduler will use the directory specified by the Workstation root scalar as the location for the files to be distributed with Run Command On Workstation jobs that use the package.

</dd>
<dt>
<a name="sms_f_package_server_root"></a><b>Server root</b></dt>
<dd>
String. The network path to the shared directory where the files for the sharing properties are located. This scalar is required for the package to be available for Share Package On Server jobs.
<p>
You can specify the universal naming convention (UNC) share name or a redirected drive name. (See the preceding entry, "Workstation root.")


<p>
<b>Important</b>  Your application is responsible for verifying that the Server root scalar contains a valid path to the source directory for Sharing properties. The Scheduler will use the directory specified by the Server root scalar as the location for the files to be distributed with Share Package On Server jobs that use the package.

</dd>
<dt>
<a name="sms_f_package_share_name"></a><b>Share name</b></dt>
<dd>
String. Create access. The share name that you want to assign to the shared package when it is installed on a server. This scalar is required for the package to be available for Share Package On Server jobs.
<p>
At each target server (specified by the Share Package On Server job), this share name is set for the directory that contains the shared version of the package. The share name can be no longer than eight characters, but subdirectories can have longer names. 

<p>
For example, if you specify FRISBEE\TESTGROUP as the share name, the Despooler creates the root directory FRISBEE (if it does not already exist) and shares it as FRISBEE. It also creates the subdirectory TESTGROUP and places the shared package in the directory FRISBEE\TESTGROUP. If the FRISBEE directory already exists, the Despooler creates the directory FRISBEE00\TESTGROUP. You can specify an unlimited number of subdirectories in the share name.

</dd>
</dl>

<p>
Note that the Despooler creates the package share on the server drive with the most free space.</p>
<p class=indent1>
<b>Note</b>  If you are setting up a package for sharing on a NetWare server, you must specify a volume name and a subdirectory as the share name.</p>

<dl>
<dt>
<a name="sms_f_package_share_permissions"></a><b>Share permissions</b></dt>
<dd>
Integer. The permissions for users to access the package's shared directory that you specified in the Share name scalar. By default, all four available permission settings are set.
<p>
You can assign permissions to two user groups: Users and Guests. Users is the Domain Users global group (for LAN Manager domains, Users is the Users group) for the domains at each target site. Guests is the Guests global group, which can contain user accounts not defined in the domain, or a set of user accounts in the domain that is part of the Guests group. For NetWare domains, Users is equivalent to the default group EVERYONE and Guests applies to default user GUEST.

<dl>
<dt>
PACKAGE_USER_READ</dt>
<dd>
Permits users in the Domain Users, Users, or EVERYONE group to read and copy files, run programs, change directories within the shared directory, and read extended attributes of files.
<p>
To run a program file (one with a .COM, .EXE, or .BAT extension), a user must have read permission.
</dd>
<dt>
PACKAGE_USER_WRITE</dt>
<dd>
Permits users in the Domain Users, Users, or EVERYONE group to write the contents and extended attributes of files.
<p>
Write permission is required for applications that need to write information back to the shared package directory.
</dd>
<dt>
PACKAGE_GUEST_READ</dt>
<dd>
Permits users in the Guests or GUEST group to read and copy files, run programs, change directories within the shared directory, and read extended attributes of files.
<p>
To run a program file (one with a .COM, .EXE, or .BAT extension), a user must have read permission.
</dd>
<dt>
PACKAGE_GUEST_WRITE</dt>
<dd>
Permits users in the Guests or GUEST group to write the contents and extended attributes of files.
<p>
Write permission is required for applications that need to write information back to the shared package directory.

</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dt>
<a name="sms_f_package_workstation_permissions"></a><b>Workstation permissions</b></dt>
<dd>
Integer. The permissions for users to access the package's shared directory on distribution servers for the package source directory for Run Command On Workstation jobs. By default, all four available permission settings are set.
<p>
You can assign permissions to two user groups: Users and Guests. Users is the Domain Users global group (for LAN Manager domains, Users is the Users group) for the domains at each target site. Guests is the Guests global group, which can contain user accounts not defined in the domain or a set of user accounts in the domain that is part of the Guests group. For NetWare domains, Users is equivalent to the default group EVERYONE and Guests applies to default user GUEST.

<dl>
<dt>
PACKAGE_USER_READ</dt>
<dd>
Permits users in the Domain Users, Users, or EVERYONE group to read and copy files, run programs, change directories within the shared directory, and read extended attributes of files.
<p>
To run a program file (one with a .COM, .EXE, or .BAT extension), a user must have read permission.
</dd>
<dt>
PACKAGE_USER_WRITE</dt>
<dd>
Permits users in the Domain Users, Users, or EVERYONE group to write the contents and extended attributes of files.
<p>
Write permission is required for applications that need to write information back to the shared package directory.
</dd>
<dt>
PACKAGE_GUEST_READ</dt>
<dd>
Permits users in the Guests or GUEST group to read and copy files, run programs, change directories within the shared directory, and read extended attributes of files.
<p>

</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dt>
<a name="sms_f_package_workstation_package"></a><b>Workstation package</b></dt>
<dd>
Integer. Read-only access. This scalar specifies that the package has Workstations properties set and that the package is available for Run Command On Workstation jobs. TRUE specifies availablility for Run Command On Workstation jobs. FALSE specifies no availability.
<p>
The SMS API engine sets the Workstation package scalar when the package is created. The SMS API engine sets this scalar to TRUE if the package has at least one <a href="sheapio_9igi.htm">Workstation Command Line subfolder</a> and has the <a href="#sms_f_package_workstation_root">Workstation root</a> scalar set.
</dd>
<dt>
<a name="sms_f_package_sharing_package"></a><b>Sharing package</b></dt>
<dd>
Integer. Read-only access. This scalar specifies that the package has Sharing properties set and that the package is available for Share Package On Server jobs. TRUE specifies availablility for Share Package On Server. FALSE specifies no availability.
<p>
The SMS API engine sets the Sharing package scalar when the package is created. The SMS API engine sets this scalar to TRUE if the package has the <a href="#sms_f_package_server_root">Server root</a> and <a href="#sms_f_package_share_name">Share name</a> scalars set. If the package will be used for network applications, your application must also create program item subfolders for each network application within the package.
</dd>
<dt>
<a name="sms_f_package_inventory_package"></a><b>Inventory package</b></dt>
<dd>
Integer. Read-only access. This scalar specifies that the package has Inventory properties set and that the package will be inventoried at the current site and all its subsites. TRUE specifies that inventory rules for the package have been set and the SMS system will scan for this package in its software scan. FALSE specifies no availability.
<p>
The SMS API engine sets the Inventory package scalar when the package is created. The SMS API engine sets this scalar to TRUE if the package folder has an <a href="sheapio_0cvm.htm">inventory rules subfolder</a> and the <a href="sheapio_4sj7.htm#sms_f_inventory_inventory_this_package">Inventory this package</a> scalar for the Inventory rules subfolder is set to TRUE.
</dd>
<dt>
<a name="sms_f_package_workstation_transfer_file"></a><b>Workstation transfer file</b></dt>
<dd>
String. Read-only access. The file name and UNC path to the compressed package file for the package when it is used for Run Command On Workstation jobs.
<p>
After the job's activation time has elapsed, the Scheduler starts the job by creating a compressed package file (<i>packageid</i>.W* where <i>packageid</i> is the eight-character package identifier for the package used by the job) that contains all directories and files specified by the package's source directory (Workstation root scalar). The <i>packageid</i>.W* file is placed in the SITE.SRV\SENDER.BOX\TOSEND directory in the SMS root directory of the computer where the Scheduler is installed (usually the site server).
</dd>
<dt>
<a name="sms_f_package_server_transfer_file"></a><b>Server transfer file</b></dt>
<dd>
