<h1><a name="sms_overriding_and_extending_graphics_in_the_sms_administrator"></a>Overriding and Extending Graphics in the SMS Administrator</h1>
<p>
The SMS Administrator displays a wide variety of graphics to assist the user in identifying objects in a list and in differentiating between various properties. These graphics can be extended or overridden using resource-only dynamic-link libraries.</p>
<p>
Specifically, when the SMS Administrator displays an object of a particular architecture (such as a computer with the Personal Computer architecture) within a window, it displays identifying graphics for that object and architecture.</p>
<p>
In addition, the detailed properties of an object can be viewed by using a machine properties window. To view the attributes by group, the user selects the group to view in the Properties pane. The attributes for the group are then displayed in the right pane. Each group has a graphic that represents that particular group within that particular architecture.</p>
<p>
Using resource-only DLLs and the Windows NT Registry, you can override the graphics of existing architectures, objects, and groups.</p>
<p>
In addition, you can provide graphics for new architectures, objects, and groups that have been added to the SMS inventory by using custom MIF files. Note that when new architectures, new types of objects, or new properties are added to the SMS inventory, the SMS Administrator uses the default graphic to display these items if no resource-only DLL is supplied.</p>
<p>
For more information about adding new architectures, objects, and groups by using MIF files, see <a href="she02_05q1.htm">Extending the Inventory</a>.</p>
