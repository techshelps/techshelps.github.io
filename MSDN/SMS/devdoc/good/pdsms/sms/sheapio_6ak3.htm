<h2><a name="sms_workstation_command_line_folder_scalars"></a>Workstation Command Line Folder Scalars</h2>
<p>
A <a href="sheapio_9igi.htm">workstation command line folder</a> contains a set of scalars that store information about the workstation command line. Workstation command line folder scalars have both create and read access. Therefore, an application can create a workstation command line folder.</p>
<p>
A workstation command line folder has the following scalars:</p>

<dl>
<dt>
<a name="sms_f_wcl_name"></a><b>Name</b></dt>
<dd>
String. Modify access. The name for the workstation command line. This scalar has a maximum length of 255 characters. Within a <a href="sheapio_9rci.htm">package folder</a>, the Name scalar for a workstation command line folder must be unique, that is, no two workstation command line folders can have the same value for the Name scalar within a single package folder.
<p>
Note that the Name scalar is also used as the identifier for the folder. Your application should ensure that this scalar is not set to a string that is already being used by another workstation command line folder within the same package folder.

<p>
In the SMS Administrator, this name will identify the command in the package's <b>Workstation Command Lines</b> dialog box and in a Run Command On Workstation job's <b>Run Command</b> dialog box. If the command is used for a Run Command On Workstation job, this name will also appear in the Command Name field of the Package Command Manager window on the target computers.
</dd>
<dt>
<a name="sms_f_wcl_command"></a><b>Command</b></dt>
<dd>
String. Modify access. Command line for the Package Command Manager to run when the package command is run at a target computer.
<p>
The command line is run from the package's root directory, which is located on a shared directory on a server. The command line has a limit of 255 characters.

<p>
The command line must specify an executable file or a batch file. It cannot contain MS-DOS or Windows NT commands. If you want to use operating-system commands, put them in a batch file and specify the batch file for the Command scalar.
</dd>
<dt>
<a name="sms_f_wcl_flags"></a><b>Flags</b></dt>
<dd>
Integer. Modify access. Flags that specify the execution requirements for the command line.
<p>
If you set this scalar to zero, the setting is equivalent to clearing the <b>Automated Command Line</b> check box in the <b>Command Line Properties</b> dialog box in the SMS Administrator. If the command line requires the user at the target computer to enter data or respond to prompts, your application should set this scalar to zero.

<dl>
<dt>
WCL_AUTOMATED_COMMAND_LINE</dt>
<dd>
Indicates that no user input is required to complete the package command. This is equivalent to the <b>Automated Command Line</b> check box in the <b>Command Line Properties</b> dialog box in the SMS Administrator. 
<p>
If the command completes without any response from the user, make sure the <b>Automated Command Line</b> check box is selected. This displays a No in the package's Requires Input field in the Package Command Manager window.
</dd>
<dt>
WCL_BACKGROUND_TASK</dt>
<dd>
This enables the SMS Package Command Manager service for Windows NT to run the command in background mode (this option is useful for running maintenance jobs on unattended servers). Note that the Package Command Manager service is installed by default only on servers running Windows NT.
<p>
This is equivalent to the <b>System Background Task</b> check box in the <b>Command Line Properties</b> dialog box in the SMS Administrator.

<p>
Set this flag if the application you are installing runs under Windows NT and does not display windows or require user input during installation.

<p>
Note that setting this flag implicitly sets the WCL_AUTOMATED_COMMAND_LINE flag.

</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dt>
<a name="sms_f_wcl_platforms"></a><b>Platforms</b></dt>
<dd>
Integer. Modify access. Flags that specify the operating systems on which the package command will be available—MS-DOS, Windows version 3.1, Windows NT (x86), Windows NT (Alpha), and so on.

<p>
<b>Caution</b>  Your application must set at least one platform flag for the Platforms scalar. If your application does not set a platform flag, the workstation command line will not be available for jobs. To correct this problem, your application must delete the workstation command line folder and re-create the folder with the Platforms scalar set correctly.


<p>
You can select one or more operating systems. When a platform flag is set, the package command is available at target computers with the specified platform (the package appears in the Package Command Manager window). When a platform flag is not set, the package command is not available on computers with the specified platform (the package does not appear in the Package Command Manager window).
