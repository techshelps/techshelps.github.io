<h2><a name="sms_.5b.setupvariation_setup.5d"></a>[<i>SetupVariation</i> Setup]</h2>
<p>
For the setup variations specified in the <b>SetupVariation</b> entry in the [Package Definition] key, the PDF must have a key that defines each variation. For SMS, the setup variations specify the package commands that will be defined for the package’s Workstations property.
<dl>
<dt>
<b>CommandName</b> (required)</dt>
<dd>
The name used for this package command. When the PDF is imported into SMS, this string is used as the Command Name for this package command. This text must be localized.
<p>
Example:

<pre><code>CommandName = Automated Minimum Installation
 </code></pre>
</dd>
<dt>
<b>CommandLine</b> (required)</dt>
<dd>
The command line used for this package command. When the PDF is imported into SMS, this string is used as the Command Line for this package command.
<p>
Example:

<pre><code>CommandLine = setup.exe
 </code></pre>
</dd>
<dt>
<b>UserInputRequired</b> (required)</dt>
<dd>
The value for this entry specifies whether this package command requires interaction with the user to complete the command. You can specify TRUE or FALSE.
<p>
Example:

<pre><code>UserInputRequired = FALSE
 </code></pre>
</dd>
<dt>
<b>SynchronousSystemExitRequired</b> (required)</dt>
<dd>
On Windows clients, by default, once SMS starts executing a job, it intervenes if it receives a request to exit the Windows environment. SMS does this by returning zero if it receives a WM_QUERY_END_SESSION. SMS then presents a dialog box asking the user to confirm when it is okay to restart the computer. For programs simply attempting to restart the system, this does not cause a problem. However, it does cause a problem for jobs attempting to run MS-DOS programs using <b>ExitWindowsExec</b>. Setting <b>SynchronousSystemExitRequired</b> to TRUE disables the default SMS behavior so that the job can run an MS-DOS program.
<p>
On MS-DOS clients, setting <b>SynchronousSystemExitRequired</b> to TRUE indicates to SMS that the job will cause the client to restart. This tells SMS to use overlay mode when executing the job, freeing up the memory used by SMS so it can be made available to the program being executed. By default, SMS executes programs synchronously and remains in memory when a job command line is executed.

<p>
Note that setting this value to TRUE is not necessary just to exit the environment at the end of the package setup program.

<p>
The possible values are TRUE and FALSE, and the default is FALSE.

<p>
Example:

<pre><code>SynchronousSystemExitRequired = FALSE
 </code></pre>
</dd>
<dt>
<b>SupportedPlatforms</b> (required)</dt>
<dd>
The value for this entry specifies the operating systems where the package can be installed and run. Each operating system name must be separated by a comma and a space.
<p>
Example:

<pre><code>SupportedPlatforms = Windows, Windows NT (Alpha), Macintosh
</code></pre>

<p>
Note that a version number is no longer needed and should not be used with Windows and Windows NT. Old PDFs that specified Windows 3.1 or Windows NT 3.1 will still work with SMS, but PDFs that specify any other versions of these platforms will not work. Particular versions of an operating system can still be uniquely targeted for package installation by using the SMS database query feature.
