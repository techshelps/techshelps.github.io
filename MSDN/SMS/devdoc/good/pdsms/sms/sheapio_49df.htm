<h2><a name="sms_program_item_folder_scalars"></a>Program Item Folder Scalars</h2>
<p>
A <a href="sheapio_02lu.htm">program item folder</a> contains a set of scalars that store information about the program item. Program item folder scalars have both create and read access. Therefore, an application can create a program item folder.</p>
<p>
A program item folder has the following scalars:</p>

<dl>
<dt>
<a name="sms_f_progitem_itemkey"></a><b>ItemKey</b></dt>
<dd>
String. Read-only access. An eight-character identifier that the SMS system assigns to the program item. Note that the first three characters are the site code for the site where the program item was created.</dd>
<dt>
<a name="sms_f_progitem_description"></a><b>Description</b></dt>
<dd>
String. Modify access. The text that will be used at SMS computers to describe the network application's program item. Maximum length is 64 characters.
<p>
At Windows and Windows NT computers where this network application is available, this text is used for the application's program item in the Program Manager and for its icon when the icon is minimized on the desktop.

<p>
For example, you could specify the name of the application, such as "Microsoft Excel version 5.0."
</dd>
<dt>
<a name="sms_f_progitem_command_line"></a><b>Command line</b></dt>
<dd>
String. Modify access. The command that will be used to start the network application. The command line has a limit of 255 characters and cannot include commas.
<p>
Specify the file name of the application; the extension is optional. (For example, WINWORD.EXE, WINWORD, VPPROF.BAT, and VPROF will all work.) You can also specify a text editor and a file together, such as NOTEPAD README.TXT.

<p>
The command line is run from the package's root directory, which is located on a shared directory on a server.
</dd>
<dt>
<a name="sms_f_progitem_run_minimized"></a><b>Run minimized</b></dt>
<dd>
Integer. Modify access. A flag that specifies that the application should be minimized to an icon each time it starts. TRUE specifies that the application starts as a minimized icon. FALSE specifies that the application runs at its normal window size.</dd>
<dt>
<a name="sms_f_progitem_icon"></a><b>Icon</b></dt>
<dd>
Binary. Modify access. An icon resource that will be used as the icon for the program item in the client's program group in the Program Manager, and when the network application represented by the program item is minimized. The icon will automatically be distributed to clients that use the network application. The binary data for the Icon scalar has the same format as an icon resource file (.ICO). For information about the Icon binary scalar, see <a href="sheapio_54xe.htm">Example of Retrieving a <b>SCALAR_BINARY</b> Scalar</a> and <a href="sheapio_1diq.htm">Example of Setting a <b>SCALAR_BINARY</b> Scalar</a>.</dd>
<dt>
<a name="sms_f_progitem_platforms"></a><b>Platforms</b></dt>
<dd>
Integer. Modify access. Flags that specify the supported operating systems and processors. You can select one or more operating systems.

<p>
<b>Caution</b>  Your application must set at least one platform flag for the Platform flags scalar. If your application does not set a platform flag, the program item will not be available for program groups. To correct this problem, your application must delete the program item folder and re-create the folder with the Platform flag scalar set correctly.


<p>
When a platform flag is set, the network application is available as a program item at computers with the specified platform. When a platform flag is not set for a specific operating system or processor type, the network application is not available to computers with the specified platform—no program item is created and the application is not configured to run on that computer.

<dl>
<dt>
PLTFRM_WIN16</dt>
<dd>
Windows version 3.1</dd>
<dt>
PLTFRM_WIN95</dt>
<dd>
Windows 95</dd>
<dt>
PLTFRM_WIN32_X86</dt>
<dd>
Windows NT with x86 processor.</dd>
<dt>
PLTFRM_WIN32_MIPS</dt>
<dd>
Windows NT with MIPS processor.</dd>
<dt>
PLTFRM_WIN32_ALPHA</dt>
<dd>
Windows NT with Alpha processor.
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dt>
<a name="sms_f_progitem_configure_script_file"></a><b>Configure script file</b></dt>
<dd>
String. Modify access. The command line used to configure the network application on a computer. The command line contains the configuration program and the parameters required to run a configuration script or configuration program. This scalar has a limit of 255 characters.
<p>
When a network application is first configured on a computer, the Program Group Control program can use a setup program or script to configure the registry and initialization files for the application so that it can run over the network.

<p>
This entry enables you to specify custom programs or scripts. For example, this line can call a setup program that reads an STF file or a Microsoft Test script. Before distributing the package, you must copy all setup programs and their data files to the package source directory.

<p>
If no configuration script or setup program is required, you can set this scalar to NULL.

<p>
If you are using a script, type the script processor command (such as MTRUN.EXE or WBRUN20.EXE) followed by the name of the configuration file or script. You can place the script processor in the package source directory.


<p>
<b>Note</b>  In order for Program Group Control to identify and locate a default script processing program (such as wbrun20.exe, mtrun.exe, and SMSINST.EXE), you must specify the script processor by using .EXE as the part of the command when creating the package (for example, MTRUN.EXE ACCEL.MST).


<p>
All other files, including supplied PDFs, must be in the package source directory.
</dd>
<dt>
<a name="sms_f_progitem_search_local_flag"></a><b>Search local flag</b></dt>
<dd>
Integer. Modify access. A flag that specifies that Program Group Control should search the local directories in the computer's path for the file specified in the Command line scalar. TRUE specifies that the local path should be searched. FALSE specifies that the application is always run from a server.
<p>
When you set this scalar to TRUE, Program Group Control starts the local version if it finds one; otherwise, it starts the network version. When you set this scalar to FALSE, Program Group Control always runs the network version.
</dd>
<dt>
<a name="sms_f_progitem_drive_letter"></a><b>Drive letter</b></dt>
<dd>
String. Modify access. The drive letter used to connect to a network application's share. The length of this scalar is one character.
<p>
When the <a href="#sms_f_progitem_drive_mode">Drive mode</a> scalar is set to PI_DRIVEMODE_SPECIFIC_LETTER, Program Group Control must connect using the drive letter specified by the Drive letter scalar. If the specified drive is already used, Program Group Control displays a message box that asks if the user wants to use the next available drive. If the user clicks <b>OK</b>, Program Group Control selects the next available drive and continues the execution of the application. If the user clicks <b>Cancel</b>, Program Group Control terminates without starting the application.
</dd>
<dt>
<a name="sms_f_progitem_drive_mode"></a><b>Drive mode</b></dt>
<dd>
Integer. A value that specifies how the Program Group Control program should connect to the network application's share. There are three options:
<dl>
<dt>
PI_DRIVEMODE_UNC</dt>
<dd>
Specifies that Program Group Control must execute the application using a UNC name (such as <i>\\server\share\exename.exe</i>). No drive letter is connected to the application share.</dd>
<dt>
PI_DRIVEMODE_ANY_LETTER</dt>
<dd>
Specifies that Program Group Control must connect using a drive letter—but Program Group Control can use any available drive letter on the local client.</dd>
<dt>
PI_DRIVEMODE_SPECIFIC_LETTER</dt>
<dd>
Specifies that Program Group Control must connect using a specific drive letter (for example, T). If you set this flag, you must specify the drive letter in the Drive letter scalar.
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dt>
<a name="sms_f_progitem_registry_name"></a><b>Registry name</b></dt>
<dd>
String. Modify access. The registry name for a network application to be used in the registry of the SMS computer where the application resides. The Registry name scalar has a limit of 50 characters.
<p>
If this entry is left blank, the SMS package identifier number (the site code plus the package number) is used as the registry name. You should specify a recognizable registry name.

<p>
Registry names enable an application script to call a dependent application by using its registry name. For example, a Word for Windows script can call an MSAPPS application by using the MSAPPS registry key specified in the program item created for MSAPPS.
</dd>
<dt>
<a name="sms_f_progitem_display_icon_in_program_group"></a><b>Display Icon in Program Group</b></dt>
<dd>
Integer. Modify access. A flag that specifies that the Program Group Control program creates an icon in the program group on the computer that has been assigned the network application. TRUE specifies that the program item appears as an icon in the program groups where the program item has been added. FALSE specifies that the program item does not appear as an icon.
</dd>
