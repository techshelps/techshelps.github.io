<h2><a name="sms_site_container_mif_group_folder_scalars"></a>MIF Group Folder Scalars</h2>
<p>
A MIF <a href="sheapio_91ki.htm">group folder</a> contains scalars that represent the actual properties (or attributes) of the group. Each attribute is assigned a value. The set of attribute values for a group makes up the inventory for a specific item. For example, a Disk group on a computer has attributes such as Drive Index, Storage Type, Free Storage, and so on. In a workstation's inventory, a Disk's Drive Letter attribute can be assigned a value such as A, B, C, and so on.</p>
<p>
LastChanged is the only defined scalar for MIF group folders (see description below). The set of scalars within a group folder depends on its group class. </p>
<p>
The set of scalars within a group folder is also dependent on the instance of the group—all attributes defined for the group may not have been included by the MIF that reported the inventory. Indeed, different instances of the same group may contain completely different sets of attributes.</p>
<p>
Your application can retrieve the list of scalars within a specific folder by using the <a href="sheapi_16ia.htm"><b>SmsGetNextScalar</b></a> function to retrieve each scalar sequentially.</p>
<p>
A MIF group folder has the following scalar:
<dl>
<dt>
<b>LastChanged</b></dt>
<dd>
Time. Read-only access. The time that any scalar in the MIF group was last changed. This could be the time of creation or subsequent modification. LastChanged is a read-only system scalar and will not be recognized if specified as a scalar when creating a MIF group folder.
</dd>
</dl>
