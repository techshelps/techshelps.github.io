<p>
Friend functions can be defined inside class declarations. These functions are inline functions, and like member inline functions they behave as though they were defined immediately after all class members have been seen but before the class scope is closed (the end of the class declaration).</p>
<p>
Friend functions defined inside class declarations are not considered in the scope of the enclosing class; they are in file scope.</p>
