<p>
You can increase the integrity of software built with C++ by controlling access to class member data and functions. Class members can be declared as having private, protected, or public access, as shown in Table 10.1.</p>
<p class=label>
<b><a name="_pluslang_table_10..1"></a>Table 10.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Member-Access Control</b></p>
<table border=1 cellpadding=5 cols=2 frame=below rules=rows>
<tr valign=top>
<td class=label width=25%><b>Type of Access</b></td>
<td class=label width=75%><b>Meaning</b></td>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=25%><b>private</b></td>
<td width=75%>Class members declared as <b>private</b> can be used only by member functions and friends (classes or functions) of the class.</td>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=25%><b>protected</b></td>
<td width=75%>Class members declared as <b>protected</b> can be used by member functions and friends (classes or functions) of the class. Additionally, they can be used by classes derived from the class.</td>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=25%><b>public</b></td>
<td width=75%>Class members declared as <b>public</b> can be used by any function.</td>
</tr>
</table><br>
<p>
Access control prevents you from using objects in ways they were not intended to be used. This protection is lost when explicit type conversions (casts) are performed.</p>
<p class=indent>
<B><b>Note</b></B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Access control is equally applicable to all names: member functions, member data, nested classes, and enumerators.</p>
<p>
The default access to class members (members of a class type declared using the <b>class</b> keyword) is private; the default access to <b>struct</b> and <b>union</b> members is public. For either case, the current access level can be changed using the <b>public</b>, <b>private</b>, or <b>protected</b> keyword.</p>
