<h1><a name="_pluslang_one.92.s_complement_operator"></a><sup></sup>One’s Complement Operator (~)</h1>
<p>
The one’s complement operator (<b>~</b>), sometimes called the “bitwise complement” operator, yields a bitwise one’s complement of its operand. That is, every bit that is set in the operand is 0 in the result. Conversely, every bit that is 0 in the operand is set in the result. The operand to the one’s complement operator must be an integral type.</p>
<pre><code>unsigned short y = 0xAAAA;
 &nbsp;&nbsp; y = ~y;
</code></pre>
<p>
In this example, the new value assigned to <code>y</code> is the one’s complement of the unsigned value 0xAAAA, or 0x5555.</p>
<p>
Integral promotion is performed on integral operands, and the resultant type is the type to which the operand is promoted. See <a href="_pluslang_integral_promotions.htm">Integral Promotions</a>  for more information on how the promotion is done.</p>
