<B><b>ANSI 3.1.3.4</b></B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The value of an integer character constant that contains more than one character or a wide character constant that contains more than one multibyte character</p>
<p>
The regular character constant, 'ab' has the integer value (int)0x6162. When there is more than one byte, previously read bytes are shifted left by the value of <b>CHAR_BIT</b> and the next byte is compared using the bitwise-OR operator with the low <b>CHAR_BIT</b> bits. The number of bytes in the multibyte character constant cannot exceed sizeof(int), which is 4 for 32-bit target code.</p>
<p>
The multibyte character constant is read as above and this is converted to a wide-character constant using the <b>mbtowc</b> run-time function. If the result is not a valid wide-character constant, an error is issued. In any event, the number of bytes examined by the <b>mbtowc</b> function is limited to the value of <b>MB_CUR_MAX</b>.</p>
