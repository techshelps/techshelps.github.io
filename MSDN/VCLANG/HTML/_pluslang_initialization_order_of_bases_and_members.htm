<h1><a name="_pluslang_initialization_order_of_bases_and_members"></a><sup></sup>Initialization Order of Bases and Members</h1>
<p>
Base classes and member objects are initialized in the following order: 
<ol>
<li>
Virtual base classes are initialized in the order in which they appear in the directed acyclic graph. For information about using the directed acyclic graph to construct a list of unique subobjects, see <a href="_pluslang_virtual_base_classes.htm">Virtual Base Classes</a> in Chapter 9. (Note that these subobjects are destroyed by walking the same list in reverse.) For more information about how the directed acyclic graph is traversed, see <a href="_pluslang_order_of_destruction.htm">Order of Destruction</a>.<br><br></li>
<li>
Nonvirtual base classes are initialized in the order in which they are declared in the class declaration.<br><br></li>
<li>
Member objects are initialized in the order in which the objects are declared in the class.</li>
</ol>
<p>
The order in which base classes and member objects are initialized is not affected by the order in which the member initializers or base-class initializers appear in the <i>member-initializer-list</i> of the constructor.</p>
