<p>
A pointer to a member of a base class can be converted to a pointer to a member of a class derived from it, when the following conditions are met:
<ul type=disc>
<li>
The inverse conversion, from pointer to derived class to base-class pointer, is accessible.<br><br></li>
<li>
The derived class does not inherit virtually from the base class.</li>
</ul>
<p>
When the left operand is a pointer to member, the right operand must be of pointer-to-member type or be a constant expression that evaluates to 0. This assignment is valid only in the following cases:
<ul type=disc>
<li>
The right operand is a pointer to a member of the same class as the left operand.<br><br></li>
<li>
The left operand is a pointer to a member of a class derived publicly and unambiguously from the class of the right operand.</li>
</ul>
