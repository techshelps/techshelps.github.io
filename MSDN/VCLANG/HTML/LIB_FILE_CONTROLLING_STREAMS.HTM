<h2><a name="Controlling Streams">Controlling Streams</a></h2>
<META NAME="MS-HKWD" CONTENT="controlling streams"><META NAME="MS-HKWD" CONTENT="streams, controlling">
<p>The <code>fopen</code> function returns the address of an object of type <code>FILE</code>. You use this address as the <code>stream</code> argument to several library 
functions to perform various operations on an open file. For a byte stream, all input takes place as if each character is 
read by calling <code>fgetc</code>, and all output takes place as if each character is written by calling <code>fputc</code>. For a wide stream 
(with Amendment 1), all input takes place as if each character is read by calling <code>fgetwc</code>, and all output takes place as if 
each character is written by calling <code>fputwc</code>.</p>
<p>You can <a name="file close"><b>close</b></a> a file by calling <code>fclose</code>, after which the address of the <code>FILE</code> object is invalid.</p>
<p>A <code>FILE</code> object stores the state of a stream, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>An <a name="error indicator"><b>error indicator</b></a> -- set nonzero by a function that encounters a read or write error </li>
<li>An <a name="end-of-file indicator"><b>end-of-file indicator</b></a> -- set nonzero by a function that encounters the end of the file while reading </li>
<li>A <a name="file-position indicator"><b>file-position indicator</b></a> -- specifies the next byte in the stream to read or write, if the file can support 
positioning requests </li>
<li>A <a href="LIB_FILE_Stream_States.htm#Stream States"><b>stream state</b></a> -- specifies whether the stream will accept reads and/or writes and, with Amendment 1, whether 
the stream is <a href="LIB_FILE.htm#unbound stream">unbound</a>, <a href="LIB_FILE.htm#byte oriented">byte-oriented</a>, or <a href="LIB_FILE.htm#wide oriented">wide-oriented</a> </li>
<li>A <b>conversion state</b> -- remembers the state of any partly assembled or generated <a href="LIB_FILE_Byte_and_Wide_Streams.htm#generalized multibyte characters">generalized multibyte 
character</a>, as well as any shift state for the sequence of bytes in the file </li>
<li>A <a name="file buffer"><b>file buffer</b></a> -- specifies the address and size of an array object that library functions can use to improve the 
performance of read and write operations to the stream </li>
</ul>
<p>Do not alter any value stored in a <code>FILE</code> object or in a file buffer that you specify for use with that object. You cannot 
copy a <code>FILE</code> object and portably use the address of the copy as a <code>stream</code> argument to a library function.</p>
