<p>
Like C, C++ does not have built-in input/output capability. All C++ compilers, however, come bundled with a systematic, object-oriented I/O package, known as the iostream classes. The “stream” is the central concept of the iostream classes. You can think of a stream object as a “smart file” that acts as a source and destination for bytes. A stream’s characteristics are determined by its class and by customized insertion and extraction operators.</p>
<p>
Through device drivers, the disk operating system deals with the keyboard, screen, printer, and communication ports as extended files. The iostream classes interact with these extended files. Built-in classes support reading from and writing to memory with syntax identical to that for disk I/O, which makes it easy to derive stream classes.</p>
