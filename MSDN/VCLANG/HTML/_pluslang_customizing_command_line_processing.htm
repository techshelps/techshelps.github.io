<b>Microsoft Specific </b></p>
<p>
If your program does not take command-line arguments, you can save a small amount of space by suppressing use of the library routine that performs command-line processing. This routine is called <b>_setargv</b> and is described in <a href="_pluslang_wildcard_expansion.htm">Wildcard Expansion</a>. To suppress its use, define a routine that does nothing in the file containing the <b>main</b> function, and name it <b>_setargv</b>. The call to <b>_setargv</b> is then satisfied by your definition of <b>_setargv</b>, and the library version is not loaded.</p>
<p>
Similarly, if you never access the environment table through the <i>envp</i> argument, you can provide your own empty routine to be used in place of <b>_setenvp</b>, the environment-processing routine. Just as with the <b>_setargv</b> function, <b>_setenvp</b> must be declared as <b>extern "C"</b>.</p>
<p>
Your program might make calls to the <b>spawn</b> or <b>exec</b> family of routines in the C run-time library. If this is the case, you should not suppress the environment-processing routine, since this routine is used to pass an environment from the parent process to the child process.</p>
