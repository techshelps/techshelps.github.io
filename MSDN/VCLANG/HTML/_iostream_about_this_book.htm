<h1><a name="_iostream_about_this_book"></a><sup></sup>About the iostream Documentation</h1>
<p>
Chapter 1, <a href="_iostream_iostream_programming.htm">iostream Programming</a>, provides information you need to get started using iostream classes. After reading this material, you will begin to understand how to write programs that process formatted text character streams and binary disk files and how to customize the library in limited ways. The chapter includes advanced information on how to derive iostream classes and create custom multiparameter “manipulators.” These topics will get you started on extending the library and doing specialized formatting. You will also learn about the relationship between the iostream classes and their subsidiary buffer classes. You can then apply some of the iostream library design principles to your own class libraries.</p>
<p>
Chapter 2, <a href="_iostream_alphabetic_microsoft_iostream_class_library_reference.htm">Alphabetic Microsoft iostream Class Library Reference</a>, begins with a detailed class hierarchy diagram. The iostream class library reference follows, arranged by classes in alphabetic order. Each class description includes a summary of each member, arranged by category, followed by alphabetical listings of member functions (public and protected), overloaded operators, data members, and manipulators.</p>
<p>
Public and protected class members are documented only when they are normally used in application programs or derived classes. See the class header files for a complete listing of class members.</p>
