<h1><a name="_pluslang_protected_member_access"></a><sup></sup>Protected Member Access</h1>
<p>
Class members declared as <b>protected</b> can be used only by the following:
<ul type=disc>
<li>
Member functions of the class that originally declared these members.<br><br></li>
<li>
Friends of the class that originally declared these members.<br><br></li>
<li>
Classes derived with public or protected access from the class that originally declared these members.<br><br></li>
<li>
Direct privately derived classes that also have private access to protected members.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Protected members are not as private as <b>private</b> members, which are accessible only to members of the class in which they are declared, but they are not as public as <b>public</b> members, which are accessible in any function.</p>
<p>
Protected members that are also declared as <b>static</b> are accessible to any friend or member function of a derived class. Protected members that are not declared as <b>static</b> are accessible to friends and member functions in a derived class only through a pointer to, reference to, or object of the derived class.</p>
