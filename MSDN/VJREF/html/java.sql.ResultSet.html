<P>A ResultSet provides access to a table of data generated by
 executing a Statement. The table rows are retrieved in
 sequence. Within a row its column values can be accessed in any
 order.
 <P>A ResultSet maintains a cursor pointing to its current row of
 data.  Initially the cursor is positioned before the first row.
 The 'next' method moves the cursor to the next row.
 <P>The getXXX methods retrieve column values for the current
 row.  You can retrieve values either using the index number of the
 column, or by using the name of the column.  In general using the 
 column index will be more efficient.  Columns are numbered from 1.
 <P>For maximum portability, ResultSet columns within each row should be
 read in left-to-right order and each column should be read only once.
 <P>For the getXXX methods, the JDBC driver attempts to convert the
 underlying data to the specified Java type and returns a suitable
 Java value.  See the JDBC specification for allowable mappings
 from SQL types to Java types with the ResultSet.getXXX methods.
 <P>Column names used as input to getXXX methods are case
 insensitive.  When performing a getXXX using a column name, if
 several columns have the same name, then the value of the first
 matching column will be returned. The column name option is
 designed to be used when column names are used in the SQL
 query. For columns that are NOT explicitly named in the query, it
 is best to use column numbers. If column names were used there is
 no way for the programmer to guarantee that they actually refer to
 the intended columns.
 <P>A ResultSet is automatically closed by the Statement that
 generated it when that Statement is closed, re-executed, or is used
 to retrieve the next result from a sequence of multiple results.
 <P>The number, types and properties of a ResultSet's columns are
 provided by the ResulSetMetaData object returned by the getMetaData
 method.
