<p><i>When you can measure what you are speaking about,<br>
and express it in numbers, you know something about it;<br>
but when you cannot measure it, when you cannot express it in numbers,<br>
your knowledge of it is of a meager and unsatisfactory kind:<br>
it may be the beginning of knowledge, but you have scarcely,<br>
in your thoughts, advanced to the stage of science.</i><br>

Much of the work in a Java program is done by evaluating <i>expressions</i>, either 
for their side effects, such as assignments to variables, or for their values, which 
can be used as arguments or operands in larger expressions, or to affect the execution sequence in statements, or both.

This chapter specifies the meanings of Java expressions and the rules for their evaluation.<p>
