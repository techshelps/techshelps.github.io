This is the interface used for representing one entry in an Access 
 Control List (ACL).<P>
 An ACL can be thought of as a data structure with multiple ACL entry
 objects. Each ACL entry object contains a set of permissions associated 
 with a particular principal. (A principal represents an entity such as 
 an individual user or a group). Additionally, each ACL entry is specified
 as being either positive or negative. If positive, the permissions are 
 to be granted to the associated principal. If negative, the permissions 
 are to be denied. Each principal can have at most one positive ACL entry 
 and one negative entry; that is, multiple positive or negative ACL 
 entries are not allowed for any principal.
 Note: ACL entries are by default positive. An entry becomes a 
 negative entry only if the <A HREF = 
 "#setNegativePermissions">setNegativePermissions</A>
 method is called on it.
