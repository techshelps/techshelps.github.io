<H5>Parameters</H5>
<DL>
<DT><I> classLoader </I>
<DD> the class-loader from which we should create
 		              the bean.  If this is null, then the system
                        class-loader is used.
    <DT><I> beanName </I>
<DD> the name of the bean within the class-loader.
   	              For example "sun.beanbox.foobah"
    </DL>
<H5>Description</H5>
 Instantiate a bean.
 <P>
 The bean is created based on a name relative to a class-loader.
 This name should be a dot-separated name such as "a.b.c".
 <P>
 In Beans 1.0 the given name can indicate either a serialized object
 or a class.  Other mechanisms may be added in the future.  In
 beans 1.0 we first try to treat the beanName as a serialized object
 name then as a class name.
 <P>
 When using the beanName as a serialized object name we convert the
 given beanName to a resource pathname and add a trailing ".ser" suffix.
 We then try to load a serialized object from that resource.
 <P>
 For example, given a beanName of "x.y", Beans.instantiate would first
 try to read a serialized object from the resource "x/y.ser" and if
 that failed it would try to load the class "x.y" and create an
 instance of that class.
 <P>
 If the bean is a subtype of java.applet.Applet, then it is given
 some special initialization.  First, it is supplied with a default
 AppletStub and AppletContext.  Second, if it was instantiated from 
 a classname the applet's "init" method is called.  (If the bean was
 deserialized this step is skipped.) 
 <P>
 Note that for beans which are applets, it is the caller's responsiblity
 to call "start" on the applet.  For correct behaviour, this should be done
 after the applet has been added into a visible AWT container.
 <P>
 Note that applets created via beans.instantiate run in a slightly
 different environment than applets running inside browsers.  In
 particular, bean applets have no access to "parameters", so they may 
 wish to provide property get/set methods to set parameter values.  We
 advise bean-applet developers to test their bean-applets against both
 the JDK appletviewer (for a reference browser environment) and the
 BDK BeanBox (for a reference bean container).
<P>
  <H5>
Exceptions</H5>
</B> <A HREF="java.lang.ClassNotFoundException.html">ClassNotFoundException</A>
     if the class of a serialized
              object could not be found.

Exceptions</H5>
</B> <A HREF="java.io.IOException.html">IOException</A>
