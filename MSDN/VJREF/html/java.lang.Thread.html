A <I>thread</I> is a thread of execution in a program. The Java 
 Virtual Machine allows an application to have multiple threads of 
 execution running concurrently. 
 <P>
 Every thread has a priority. Threads with higher priority are 
 executed in preference to threads with lower priority. Each thread 
 may or may not also be marked as a daemon. When code running in 
 some thread creates a new <B>Thread</B> object, the new 
 thread has its priority initially set equal to the priority of the 
 creating thread, and is a daemon thread if and only if the 
 creating thread is a daemon. 
 <P>
 When a Java Virtual Machine starts up, there is usually a single 
 non-daemon thread (which typically calls the method named 
 <B>main</B> of some designated class). The Java Virtual 
 Machine continues to execute threads until either of the following 
 occurs: 
 <UL>
 <LI>The <B>exit</B> method of class <B>Runtime</B> has been 
     called and the security manager has permitted the exit operation 
     to take place. 
 <LI>All threads that are not daemon threads have died, either by 
     returning from the call to the <B>run</B> method or by 
     performing the <B>stop</B> method. 
 </UL>
 <P>
 There are two ways to create a new thread of execution. One is to 
 declare a class to be a subclass of <B>Thread</B>. This 
 subclass should override the <B>run</B> method of class 
 <B>Thread</B>. An instance of the subclass can then be 
 allocated and started. For example, a thread that computes primes 
 larger than a stated value could be written as follows: 
 <P><HR><BLOCKQUOTE></FONT><PRE>
     class PrimeThread extends Thread {
         long minPrime;
         PrimeThread(long minPrime) {
             this.minPrime = minPrime;
         }
         public void run() {
             // compute primes larger than minPrime
             &nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
         }
     }
 </PRE><FONT FACE=VERDANA,ARIAL,HELVETICA SIZE=2></BLOCKQUOTE><HR>
 <P>
 The following code would then create a thread and start it running: 
 <P><BLOCKQUOTE></FONT><PRE>
     PrimeThread p = new PrimeThread(143);
     p.start();
 </PRE><FONT FACE=VERDANA,ARIAL,HELVETICA SIZE=2></BLOCKQUOTE>
 <P>
 The other way to create a thread is to declare a class that 
 implements the <B>Runnable</B> interface. That class then 
 implements the <B>run</B> method. An instance of the class can 
 then be allocated, passed as an argument when creating 
 <B>Thread</B>, and started. The same example in this other 
 style looks like the following: 
 <P><HR><BLOCKQUOTE></FONT><PRE>
     class PrimeRun implements Runnable {
         long minPrime;
         PrimeRun(long minPrime) {
             this.minPrime = minPrime;
         }
         public void run() {
             // compute primes larger than minPrime
             &nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
         }
     }
 </PRE><FONT FACE=VERDANA,ARIAL,HELVETICA SIZE=2></BLOCKQUOTE><HR>
 <P>
 The following code would then create a thread and start it running: 
 <P><BLOCKQUOTE></FONT><PRE>
     PrimeRun p = new PrimeRun(143);
     new Thread(p).start();
 </PRE><FONT FACE=VERDANA,ARIAL,HELVETICA SIZE=2></BLOCKQUOTE>
 <P>
 Every thread has a name for identification purposes. More than 
 one thread may have the same name. If a name is not specified when 
 a thread is created, a new name is generated for it.
