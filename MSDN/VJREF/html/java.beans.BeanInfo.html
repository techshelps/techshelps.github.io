<P>

A bean implementor who wishes to provide explicit information about
 their bean may provide a BeanInfo class that implements this BeanInfo
 interface and provides explicit information about the methods,
 properties, events, etc, of their  bean.
 <P>
 A bean implementor doesn't need to provide a complete set of
 explicit information.  You can pick and choose which information
 you want to provide and the rest will be obtained by automatic
 analysis using low-level reflection of the bean classes' methods
 and applying standard design patterns.
 <P>
 You get the opportunity to provide lots and lots of different
 information as part of the various XyZDescriptor classes.  But
 don't panic, you only really need to provide the minimal core
 information required by the various constructors.
 <P>
 See also the SimpleBeanInfo class which provides a convenient
 "noop" base class for BeanInfo classes, which you can override
 for those specific places where you want to return explicit info.
 <P>
 To learn about all the behaviour of a bean see the Introspector class.
