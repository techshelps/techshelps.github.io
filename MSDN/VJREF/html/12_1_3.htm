<h3>12.1.3	 Initialize Test: Execute Initializers</h3>
<a name="46634"></a>
<p>
<a name="46618"></a>
In our continuing example, the virtual machine is still trying to execute the 
method <code>main</code> of class <code>Test</code>. This is an attempted active use <a href="12_4_1.htm#44560">(&#167;12.4.1)</a> of the class, 
which is permitted only if the class has been initialized.
<p><a name="46639"></a>
Initialization consists of execution of any class variable initializers and static initializers of the class <code>Test</code>, in textual order. But before <code>Test</code> can be initialized, its direct superclass must be initialized, as well as the direct superclass of its direct superclass, and so on, recursively. In the simplest case, <code>Test</code> has <code>Object</code> as its implicit direct superclass; if class <code>Object</code> has not yet been initialized, then it must be initialized before <code>Test</code> is initialized. Class <code>Object</code> has no superclass, so the recursion terminates here.<p>
<a name="47019"></a>
If class <code>Test</code> has another class <code>Super</code> as its superclass, then <code>Super</code> must be initialized before <code>Test</code>. This requires loading, verifying, and preparing <code>Super</code> if this has not already been done and, depending on the implementation, may also involve resolving the symbolic references from <code>Super</code> and so on, recursively.<p>
<a name="47072"></a>
Initialization may thus cause loading, linking, and initialization errors, including such errors involving other types.<p>
<a name="47023"></a>
The initialization process is described further in <a href="12_4.htm#44557">&#167;12.4</a>.<p>
