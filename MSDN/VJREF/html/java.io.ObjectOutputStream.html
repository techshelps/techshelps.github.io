<P>

An ObjectOutputStream writes primitive data types and graphs of
 Java objects to an OutputStream.  The objects can be read
 (reconstituted) using an ObjectInputStream.
 Persistent storage of objects can be accomplished by using a file for
 the stream.
 If the stream is a network socket stream, the objects can be reconsituted
 on another host or in another process. <P>
 Only objects that support the java.io.Serializable interface can be
 written to streams.
 The class of each serializable object is encoded including the class
 name and signature of the class, the values of the
 object's fields and arrays, and the closure of any other objects
 referenced from the initial objects. <P>
 The method <STRONG>writeObject</STRONG> is used to write an object
 to the stream.  Any object, including Strings and arrays, is
 written with writeObject. Multiple objects or primitives can be
 written to the stream.  The objects must be read back from the
 corresponding ObjectInputstream with the same types and in the same
 order as they were written.<P>
 Primitive data types can also be written to the stream using the
 appropriate methods from DataOutput. Strings can also be written
 using the writeUTF method.<P>
 The default serialization mechanism for an object writes the class
 of the object, the class signature, and the values of all
 non-transient and non-static fields.  References to other objects
 (except in transient or static fields) cause those objects to be
 written also. Multiple references to a single object are encoded
 using a reference sharing mechanism so that graphs of objects can
 be restored to the same shape as when the original was written. <P>
 For example to write an object that can be read by the example in ObjectInputStream: <BR>
 </FONT><PRE>
	FileOutputStream ostream = new FileOutputStream("t.tmp");
	ObjectOutputStream p = new ObjectOutputStream(ostream);
	p.writeInt(12345);
	p.writeObject("Today");
	p.writeObject(new Date());
	p.flush();
	ostream.close();
 </PRE><FONT FACE=VERDANA,ARIAL,HELVETICA SIZE=2>
 Classes that require special handling during the serialization and deserialization
 process must implement special methods with these exact signatures: <P>
 </FONT><PRE>
 private void readObject(java.io.ObjectInputStream stream)
     throws IOException, ClassNotFoundException; 
 private void writeObject(java.io.ObjectOutputStream stream)
     throws IOException
 </PRE><FONT FACE=VERDANA,ARIAL,HELVETICA SIZE=2><P>
 The writeObject method is responsible for writing the state of
 the object for its particular class so that the corresponding
 readObject method can restore it.
 The method does not need to concern itself with the
 state belonging to the object's superclasses or subclasses.
 State is saved by writing the individual fields to the ObjectOutputStream
 using the writeObject method or by using the methods for
 primitive data types supported by DataOutput. <P>
 Serialization does not write out the fields of any object that does
 not implement the java.io.Serializable interface.  Subclasses of
 Objects that are not serializable can be serializable. In this case
 the non-serializable class must have a no-arg constructor to allow
 its fields to be initialized.  In this case it is the
 responsibility of the subclass to save and restore the state of the
 non-serializable class. It is frequently the case that the fields
 of that class are accessible (public, package, or protected) or
 that there are get and set methods that can be used to restore the
 state. <P>
 Serialization of an object can be prevented by implementing writeObject
 and readObject methods that throw the NotSerializableException.
 The exception will be caught by the ObjectOutputStream and abort the
 serialization process.
 Implementing the Externalizable interface allows the object to
 assume complete control over the contents and format of the object's
 serialized form.  The methods of the Externalizable interface,
 writeExternal and readExternal, are called to save and restore the
 objects state.  When implemented by a class they can write and read
 their own state using all of the methods of ObjectOutput and
 ObjectInput.  It is the responsibility of the objects to handle any
 versioning that occurs.
