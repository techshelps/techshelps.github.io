<P><B> public final class <B>Math</B>

<P>

The class <B>Math</B> contains methods for performing basic 
 numeric operations such as the elementary exponential, logarithm, 
 square root, and trigonometric functions. 
 <P>
 To help ensure portability of Java programs, the definitions of 
 many of the numeric functions in this package require that they 
 produce the same results as certain published algorithms. These 
 algorithms are available from the well-known network library 
 <B>netlib</B> as the package "Freely Distributable 
 Math Library" (<B>fdlibm</B>). These algorithms, which 
 are written in the C programming language, are then to be 
 understood as executed with all floating-point operations 
 following the rules of Java floating-point arithmetic. 
 <P>
 The network library may be found on the World Wide Web at 
 <UL><B>
   http://netlib.att.com/
 </B></UL>
 <P>
 then perform a keyword search for "<B>fdlibm</B>".
 <P>
 The Java math library is defined with respect to the version of 
 <B>fdlibm</B> dated January 4, 1995. Where 
 <B>fdlibm</B> provides more than one definition for a 
 function (such as <B>acos</B>), use the "IEEE 754 core 
 function" version (residing in a file whose name begins with 
 the letter <B>e</B>).
