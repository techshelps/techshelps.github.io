<p><i>The Tao that can be told is not the eternal Tao;<br>The name that can be named is not the eternal name.<br>The Nameless is the origin of Heaven and Earth;<br>The Named is the mother of all things.</i><br>

Names are used to refer to entities declared in a Java program. A declared 
entity <a href="6_1.htm#33757">(&#167;6.1)</a> is a package, class type, interface type, member (field or method) of a 
reference type, parameter (to a method, constructor, or exception handler), or 
local variable.
<p><a name="56343"></a>
Names in Java programs are either simple, consisting of a single identifier, or qualified, &#32;consisting of a sequence of identifiers separated by "<code>.</code>" tokens <a href="6_2.htm#31692">(&#167;6.2)</a>.<p>
<a name="56234"></a>
Every name introduced by a declaration has a <i>scope</i> <a href="6_3.htm#33623">(&#167;6.3)</a>, which is the part of the Java program text within which the declared entity can be referred to by a simple name.<p>
<a name="56241"></a>
Packages and reference types (that is, class types, interface types, and array types) have members <a href="6_4.htm#31814">(&#167;6.4)</a>. A member can be referred to using a qualified name <i>N</i><code>.</code><i>x</i>, where <i>N</i> is a simple or qualified name and <i>x</i> is an identifier. If <i>N</i> names a package, then <i>x</i> is a member of that package, which is either a class or interface type or a subpackage. If <i>N</i> names a reference type or a variable of a reference type, then <i>x</i> names a member of that type, which is either a field or a method.<p>
<a name="34249"></a>
In determining the meaning of a name <a href="6_5.htm#20569">(&#167;6.5)</a>, Java uses the context of the occurrence to disambiguate among packages, types, variables, and methods with the same name.<p>
<a name="56266"></a>
Access control <a href="6_6.htm#33916">(&#167;6.6)</a> can be specified in a class, interface, method, or field declaration to control when <i>access</i> to a member is allowed. Access is a different concept from scope; access specifies the part of the Java program text within which the declared entity can be referred to by a qualified name, a field access expression <a href="15_10.htm#41267">(&#167;15.10)</a>, or a method invocation expression <a href="15_11.htm#20448">(&#167;15.11)</a> in which the method is not specified by a simple name. The default access is that a member can be accessed anywhere within the package that contains its declaration; other possibilities are <code>public</code>, <code>protected</code>, and <code>private</code>.<p>
<a name="27329"></a>
Fully qualified names <a href="6_7.htm#25430">(&#167;6.7)</a> and naming conventions <a href="6_8.htm#11186">(&#167;6.8)</a> are also discussed in this chapter.<p>
<a name="31249"></a>
The name of a field, parameter, or local variable may be used as an expression <a href="15_13_1.htm#4984">(&#167;15.13.1)</a>. The name of a method may appear in an expression only as part of a method invocation expression <a href="15_11.htm#20448">(&#167;15.11)</a>. The name of a class or interface type may appear in an expression only as part of a class instance creation expression <a href="15_8.htm#41147">(&#167;15.8)</a>, an array creation expression <a href="15_9.htm#46168">(&#167;15.9)</a>, a cast expression <a href="15_15.htm#238146">(&#167;15.15)</a>, or an <code>instanceof</code> expression <a href="15_19_2.htm#80289">(&#167;15.19.2)</a>, or as part of a qualified name for a field or method. The name of a package may appear in an expression only as part of a qualified name for a class or interface type.<p>
