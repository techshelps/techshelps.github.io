<P>

The <B>Graphics</B> class is the abstract base class for 
 all graphics contexts that allow an application to draw onto 
 components that are realized on various devices, as well as 
 onto off-screen images.
 <P>
 A <B>Graphics</B> object encapsulates state information needed
 for the basic rendering operations that Java supports.  This
 state information includes the following properties:
 <P>
 <UL>
 <LI>The <B>Component</B> object on which to draw.
 <LI>A translation origin for rendering and clipping coordinates.
 <LI>The current clip.
 <LI>The current color.
 <LI>The current font.
 <LI>The current logical pixel operation function (XOR or Paint).
 <LI>The current XOR alternation color 
     (see <A HREF="java.awt.Graphics008.html#setXORMode"><B>setXORMode</B></A>).
 </UL>
 <P>
 Coordinates are infinitely thin and lie between the pixels of the
 output device.
 Operations which draw the outline of a figure operate by traversing
 an infinitely thin path between pixels with a pixel-sized pen that hangs
 down and to the right of the anchor point on the path.
 Operations which fill a figure operate by filling the interior
 of that infinitely thin path.
 Operations which render horizontal text render the ascending
 portion of character glyphs entirely above the baseline coordinate.
 <P>
 The graphics pen hangs down and to the right from the path it traverses. 
 This has the following implications:
 <P><UL>
 <LI>If you draw a figure that covers a given rectangle, that 
 figure occupies one extra row of pixels on the right and bottom edges 
 as compared to filling a figure that is bounded by that same rectangle.
 <LI>If you draw a horizontal line along the same <I>y</I> coordinate as
 the baseline of a line of text, that line is drawn entirely below
 the text, except for any descenders.
 </UL><P>
 All coordinates which appear as arguments to the methods of this
 <B>Graphics</B> object are considered relative to the 
 translation origin of this <B>Graphics</B> object prior to 
 the invocation of the method.
 All rendering operations modify only pixels which lie within the
 area bounded by both the current clip of the graphics context
 and the extents of the component used to create the 
 <B>Graphics</B> object.
 All drawing or writing is done in the current color, 
 using the current paint mode, and in the current font.
