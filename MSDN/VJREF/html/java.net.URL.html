Class <B>URL</B> represents a Uniform Resource 
 Locator, a pointer to a "resource" on the World 
 Wide Web. A resource can be something as simple as a file or a 
 directory, or it can be a reference to a more complicated object, 
 such as a query to a database or to a search engine. More 
 information on the types of URLs and their formats can be found at:
 <UL><B>
     http://www.ncsa.uiuc.edu/demoweb/url-primer.html
 </B></UL>
 <P>
 In general, a URL can be broken into several parts. The previous 
 example of a URL indicates that the protocol to use is 
 <B>http</B> (HyperText Transport Protocol) and that the 
 information resides on a host machine named 
 <B>www.ncsa.uiuc.edu</B>. The information on that host 
 machine is named <B>demoweb/url-primer.html</B>. The exact 
 meaning of this name on the host machine is both protocol 
 dependent and host dependent. The information normally resides in 
 a file, but it could be generated on the fly. This component of 
 the URL is called the <I>file</I> component, even though the 
 information is not necessarily in a file. 
 <P>
 A URL can optionally specify a "port", which is the 
 port number to which the TCP connection is made on the remote host 
 machine. If the port is not specified, the default port for 
 the protocol is used instead. For example, the default port for 
 <B>http</B> is <B>80</B>. An alternative port could be 
 specified as: 
 <UL><B>
     http://www.ncsa.uiuc.edu:8080/demoweb/url-primer.html
 </B></UL>
 <P>
 A URL may have appended to it an "anchor", also known 
 as a "ref" or a "reference". The anchor is 
 indicated by the sharp sign character "#" followed by 
 more characters. For example, 
 <UL><B>
     http://java.sun.com/index.html#chapter1
 </B></UL>
 <P>
 This anchor is not technically part of the URL. Rather, it 
 indicates that after the specified resource is retrieved, the 
 application is specifically interested in that part of the 
 document that has the tag <B>chapter1</B> attached to it. The 
 meaning of a tag is resource specific. 
 <P>
 An application can also specify a "relative URL", 
 which contains only enough information to reach the resource 
 relative to another URL. Relative URLs are frequently used within 
 HTML pages. For example, if the contents of the URL:
 <UL><B>
     http://java.sun.com/index.html
 </B></UL>
 contained within it the relative URL:
 <UL><B>
     FAQ.html
 </B></UL>
 it would be a shorthand for:
 <UL><B>
     http://java.sun.com/FAQ.html
 </B></UL>
 <P>
 The relative URL need not specify all the components of a URL. If 
 the protocol, host name, or port number is missing, the value is 
 inherited from the fully specified URL. The file component must be 
 specified. The optional anchor is not inherited.
