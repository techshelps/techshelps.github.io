<P>

The Introspector class provides a standard way for tools to learn about
 the properties, events, and methods supported by a target Java Bean.
 <P>
 For each of those three kinds of information, the Introspector will
 separately analyze the bean's class and superclasses looking for
 either explicit or implicit information and use that information to
 build a BeanInfo object that comprehensively describes the target bean.
 <P>
 For each class "Foo", explicit information may be available if there exists
 a corresponding "FooBeanInfo" class that provides a non-null value when
 queried for the information.   We first look for the BeanInfo class by
 taking the full package-qualified name of the target bean class and
 appending "BeanInfo" to form a new class name.  If this fails, then
 we take the final classname component of this name, and look for that
 class in each of the packages specified in the BeanInfo package search
 path.
 <P>
 Thus for a class such as "sun.xyz.OurButton" we would first look for a
 BeanInfo class called "sun.xyz.OurButtonBeanInfo" and if that failed we'd
 look in each package in the BeanInfo search path for an OurButtonBeanInfo
 class.  With the default search path, this would mean looking for
 "sun.beans.infos.OurButtonBeanInfo".
 <P>
 If a class provides explicit BeanInfo about itself then we add that to
 the BeanInfo information we obtained from analyzing any derived classes,
 but we regard the explicit information as being definitive for the current
 class and its base classes, and do not proceed any further up the superclass
 chain.
 <P>
 If we don't find explicit BeanInfo on a class, we use low-level
 reflection to study the methods of the class and apply standard design
 patterns to identify property accessors, event sources, or public
 methods.  We then proceed to analyze the class's superclass and add
 in the information from it (and possibly on up the superclass chain).
