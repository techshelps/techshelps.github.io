<P>

The interface for objects which represent some form of geometric
 shape.
 <P>
 This interface will be revised in the upcoming Java2D project.
 It is meant to provide a common interface for various existing
 geometric AWT classes and methods which operate on them.  Since
 it may be superseded or expanded in the future, developers should
 avoid implementing this interface in their own classes until it
 is completed in a later release.
