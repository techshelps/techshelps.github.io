<P>

Write text to a character-output stream, buffering characters so as to
 provide for the efficient writing of single characters, arrays, and strings.
 <P> The buffer size may be specified, or the default size may be accepted.
 The default is large enough for most purposes.
 <P> A newLine() method is provided, which uses the platform's own notion of
 line separator as defined by the system property <TT>line.separator</TT>.
 Not all platforms use the newline character ('\n') to terminate lines.
 Calling this method to terminate each output line is therefore preferred to
 writing a newline character directly.
 <P> In general, a Writer sends its output immediately to the underlying
 character or byte stream.  Unless prompt output is required, it is advisable
 to wrap a BufferedWriter around any Writer whose write() operations may be
 costly, such as FileWriters and OutputStreamWriters.  For example,
 </FONT><PRE>
 PrintWriter out
   = new PrintWriter(new BufferedWriter(new FileWriter("foo.out")));
 </PRE><FONT FACE=VERDANA,ARIAL,HELVETICA SIZE=2>
 will buffer the PrintWriter's output to the file.  Without buffering, each
 invocation of a print() method would cause characters to be converted into
 bytes that would then be written immediately to the file, which can be very
 inefficient.
