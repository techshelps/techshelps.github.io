<p>Disposes of the component. </p>

<p class="label">Syntax</p>

<p class="indent"><b>public void dispose()</b></p>


<p class="label">Remarks</p>

<p>A call to <b>dispose</b> indicates that the component is no longer needed. An
implementation of <b>dispose</b> must do the following: 

<ul type=disc>
  <li>Remove any references that the component is holding to other components. This is
    typically accomplished by assigning <b>null</b> to any fields that contain
    references to other components. </li>
  <li>Release any system resources that are associated with the component, such as file
    handles, window handles, or database connections. </li>
  <li>Dispose of any child components, such as child windows or submenu items, by calling the <b>dispose</b>
    method of these components. (A component is a child component if its <A HREF="com.ms.wfc.core.IComponent_getChildOf.html">getChildOf</A>
    method returns <b>true</b> when passed this component.) </li>
  <li>Remove the component from its container. If the component has a site, it must execute
    the following:<br>
    <code><i>site</i>.getContainer().removeComponent(this);</code><br>
    where <i>site</i> is the current (non-<b>null</b>) site.</li>
  <li>Trigger a <b>dispose</b> event for any event handlers that have been
    registered through the <A HREF="com.ms.wfc.core.IComponent_addOnDispose.html">addOnDispose</A> method. </li>
</ul>

<p>Ideally, a call to <b>dispose</b> will return a component to the state it was
in immediately after it was created (this is not a requirement). Following a call to <b>dispose</b>,
a component may raise exceptions for operations that cannot meaningfully be performed. </p>
