Immutable arbitrary-precision integers.  All operations behave as if
 BigIntegers were represented in two's-complement notation (like Java's
 primitive integer types).  BigIntegers provide analogues to all of Java's
 primitive integer operators, and all relevant static methods from
 java.lang.Math.  Additionally, BigIntegers provide operations for modular
 arithmetic, GCD calculation, primality testing, prime generation,
 single-bit manipulation, and a few other odds and ends.
 <P>Semantics of arithmetic operations exactly mimic those of java's integer
 arithmetic operators, as defined in The Java Language Specification.  For
 example, division by zero throws an ArithmeticException, and division of
 a negative by a positive yields a negative (or zero) remainder.  All of
 the details in the Spec concerning overflow are ignored, as BigIntegers
 are made as large as necessary to accommodate the results of an operation.
 <P>Semantics of shift operations extend those of Java's shift operators
 to allow for negative shift distances.  A right-shift with a negative
 shift distance results in a left shift, and vice-versa.  The unsigned
 right shift operator (>>>) is omitted, as this operation makes little
 sense in combination with the "infinite word size" abstraction provided
 by this class.
 <P>Semantics of bitwise logical operations are are exactly mimic those of
 Java's bitwise integer operators.  The Binary operators (and, or, xor)
 implicitly perform sign extension on the shorter of the two operands
 prior to performing the operation.
 <P>Comparison operations perform signed integer comparisons, analogous to
 those performed by java's relational and equality operators.
 <P>Modular arithmetic operations are provided to compute residues, perform
 exponentiation, and compute multiplicative inverses.  These methods always
 return a non-negative result, between 0 and (modulus - 1), inclusive.
 <P>Single-bit operations operate on a single bit of the two's-complement
 representation of their operand.  If necessary, the operand is sign
 extended so that it contains the designated bit.  None of the single-bit
 operations can produce a number with a different sign from the the
 BigInteger being operated on, as they affect only a single bit, and the
 "infinite word size" abstraction provided by this class ensures that there
 are infinitely many "virtual sign bits" preceding each BigInteger.
