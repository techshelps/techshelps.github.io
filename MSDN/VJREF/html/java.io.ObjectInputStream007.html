<H5>Description</H5>
 This method will allow trusted subclasses of ObjectInputStream
 to substitute one object for another during
 deserialization. Replacing objects is disabled until
 enableResolveObject is called. The enableResolveObject method
 checks that the stream requesting to resolve object can be
 trusted. Every reference to serializable objects is passed to
 resolveObject.  To insure that the private state of objects is
 not unintentionally exposed only trusted streams may use
 resolveObject. <P>
 This method is called after an object has been read but before it is
 returned from readObject.  The default resolveObject method
 just returns the new object. <P>
 When a subclass is replacing objects it must insure that the
 substituted object is compatible with every field where the
 reference will be stored.  Objects whose type is not a subclass
 of the type of the field or array element abort the
 serialization by raising an exception and the object is not be
 stored. <P>
 This method is called only once when each object is first encountered.
 All subsequent references to the object will be redirected to the
 new object. <P>
