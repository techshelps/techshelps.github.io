<h3>8.4.4	 Throws</h3>

<meta name="MS-HKWD" content="throws">
A <i>throws clause</i> is used to declare any checked exceptions <a href="11_2.htm#44121">(&#167;11.2)</a> that can result 
from the execution of a method or constructor:
<p><pre>
<i>Throws:<br>
<code>	throws </code>ClassTypeList
</i>
<i>ClassTypeList:<br>
	ClassType<br>
	ClassTypeList<code> , </code>ClassType
</i></pre><p><a name="39173"></a>
A compile-time error occurs if any <i>ClassType</i> mentioned in a <code>throws</code> clause is not 
the class <code>Throwable</code> <a href="20_22.htm#14470">(&#167;20.22)</a> or a subclass of <code>Throwable</code>. It is permitted but not 
required to mention other (unchecked) exceptions in a <code>throws</code> clause.
<p><a name="39177"></a>
For each checked exception that can result from execution of the body of a method or constructor, a compile-time error occurs unless that exception type or a superclass of that exception type is mentioned in a <code>throws</code> clause in the declaration of the method or constructor.<p>
<a name="24551"></a>
The requirement to declare checked exceptions allows the compiler to ensure that code for handling such error conditions has been included. Methods or constructors that fail to handle exceptional conditions thrown as checked exceptions will normally result in a compile-time error because of the lack of a proper exception type in a <code>throws</code> clause. Java thus encourages a programming style where rare and otherwise truly exceptional conditions are documented in this way.<p>
<a name="55271"></a>
The predefined exceptions that are not checked in this way are those for which declaring every possible occurrence would be unimaginably inconvenient:<p>
<ul><a name="41434"></a>
<li>Exceptions that are represented by the subclasses of class <code>Error</code>, for example <code>OutOfMemoryError</code>, are thrown due to a failure in or of the virtual machine. Many of these are the result of linkage failures and can occur at unpredictable points in the execution of a Java program. Sophisticated programs may yet wish to catch and attempt to recover from some of these conditions.
<a name="41435"></a>
<li>The exceptions that are represented by the subclasses of the class <code>RuntimeException</code>, &#32;for example <code>NullPointerException</code>, result from runtime &#32;integrity checks and are thrown either directly from the Java program or in library routines. It is beyond the scope of the Java language, and perhaps beyond the state of the art, to include sufficient information in the program to reduce to a manageable number the places where these can be proven not to occur.
</ul><p><a name="230101"></a>
A method that overrides or hides another method <a href="8_4_6.htm#228745">(&#167;8.4.6)</a>, including methods that implement <code>abstract</code> methods defined in interfaces, may not be declared to throw more checked exceptions than the overridden or hidden method.<p>
<a name="230102"></a>
More precisely, suppose that <i>B</i><i></i> is a class or interface, and <i>A</i><i></i> is a superclass or superinterface of <i>B</i>, and a method declaration <i>n</i> in <i>B</i> overrides or hides a method declaration <i>m</i> in <i>A</i><i></i>. If <i>n</i><i></i> has a <code>throws</code> clause that mentions any checked exception types, then <i>m</i> must have a <code>throws</code> clause, and for every checked exception type listed in the <code>throws</code> clause of <i>n</i>, that same exception class or one of its superclasses must occur in the <code>throws</code> clause of <i>m</i>; otherwise, a compile-time error occurs.<p>
