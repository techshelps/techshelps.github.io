<h3>11.3.1	 Exceptions are Precise</h3>

Exceptions in Java are <i>precise</i>: when the transfer of control takes place, all effects 
of the statements executed and expressions evaluated before the point from which 
the exception is thrown must appear to have taken place. No expressions, statements, or parts thereof that occur after the point from which the exception is 
thrown may appear to have been evaluated. If optimized code has speculatively 
executed some of the expressions or statements which follow the point at which 
the exception occurs, such code must be prepared to hide this speculative execution from the user-visible state of the Java program.
