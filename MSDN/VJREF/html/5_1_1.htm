<h3>5.1.1	 Identity Conversions</h3>

<p>
<a name="25210"></a>
A conversion from a type to that same type is permitted for any type. This may 
seem trivial, but it has two practical consequences. First, it is always permitted for 
an expression to have the desired type to begin with, thus allowing the simply 
stated rule that every expression is subject to conversion, if only a trivial identity 
conversion. Second, it implies that it is permitted for a program to include redundant cast operators for the sake of clarity.

The only permitted conversion that involves the type <code>boolean</code> is the identity conversion from <code>boolean</code> to <code>boolean</code>.<p>
