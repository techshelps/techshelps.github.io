<H5>Description</H5>
 Flushes all resources being used by this Image object.  This
 includes any pixel data that is being cached for rendering to
 the screen as well as any system resources that are being used
 to store data or pixels for the image.  The image is reset to
 a state similar to when it was first created so that if it is
 again rendered, the image data will have to be recreated or
 fetched again from its source.
