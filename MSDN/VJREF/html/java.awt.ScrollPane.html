<P>

A container class which implements automatic horizontal and/or
 vertical scrolling for a single child component.  The display
 policy for the scrollbars can be set to:
 <OL>
 <LI>as needed: scrollbars created and shown only when needed by scrollpane
 <LI>always: scrollbars created and always shown by the scrollpane
 <LI>never: scrollbars never created or shown by the scrollpane
 </OL>
 <P>
 The state of the horizontal and vertical scrollbars is represented
 by two objects (one for each dimension) which implement the
 Adjustable interface.  The API provides methods to access those
 objects such that the attributes on the Adjustable object (such as unitIncrement,
 value, etc.) can be manipulated.
 <P>
 Certain adjustable properties (minimum, maximum, blockIncrement,
 and visibleAmount) are set internally by the scrollpane in accordance
 with the geometry of the scrollpane and its child and these should
 not be set by programs using the scrollpane.
 <P>
 If the scrollbar display policy is defined as "never", then the
 scrollpane can still be programmatically scrolled using the 
 setScrollPosition() method and the scrollpane will move and clip
 the child's contents appropriately.  This policy is useful if the
 program needs to create and manage its own adjustable controls.
 <P>
 The placement of the scrollbars is controlled by platform-specific
 properties set by the user outside of the program.
 <P>
 The initial size of this container is set to 100x100, but can
 be reset using setSize(). 
 <P>
 Insets are used to define any space used by scrollbars and any
 borders created by the scroll pane. getInsets() can be used
 to get the current value for the insets.  If the value of 
 scrollbarsAlwaysVisible is false, then the value of the insets
 will change dynamically depending on whether the scrollbars are
 currently visible or not.
