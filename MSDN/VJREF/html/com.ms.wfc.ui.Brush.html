<h1>Brush Class</h1>
 </p>

<p>Encapsulates a Windows brush, a tool that Win32-based applications use to paint the
interior of polygons and ellipses.</p>

<p class="label">Remarks</p>

<p>A brush is used to fill areas of a window or a <A HREF="com.ms.wfc.ui.Graphics.html">Graphics</A> region. You can use the constants
defined in the Brush and <A HREF="com.ms.wfc.ui.BrushStyle.html">BrushStyle</A>
classes to create a <b>Brush</b> object that represents the pattern or color (or
both) with which you want to paint enclosed areas. Optionally, you can create a Brush
object based on a bitmap that you read from a disk file or create in memory.</p>

<p>Brushes come in three varieties:&nbsp; <i>solid</i>, <i>pattern</i>, and <i>hatched</i>.</p>

<p>A solid brush can consist of any color, and can consist additionally of a color or
pattern specifically defined by some element of the Windows user interface.</p>

<p>A hatched brush consists of a combination of a color and of one of the six patterns
defined by Windows.</p>

<p>A pattern brush consists of a bitmap that is used
as the basis for a pattern that fills a shape. Where the area to be filled is larger than
the bitmap, the bitmap is tiled horizontally and vertically across the display. Pattern
brushes enable you to create custom brushes that consist of any pattern that you define.</p>
