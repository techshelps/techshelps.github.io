<P>

This class creates a labeled button. The application can cause 
 some action to happen when the button is pushed. This image 
 depicts three views of a "<B>Quit</B>" button as it appears
 under the Solaris operating system: 
 <P> 
 <IMG SRC="images-awt/Button-1.gif"
 ALIGN=CENTER HSPACE=10 VSPACE=7>  
 <P>
 The first view shows the button as it appears normally. 
 The second view shows the button 
 when it has input focus. Its outline is darkened to let the 
 user know that it is an active object. The third view shows the 
 button when the user clicks the mouse over the button, and thus 
 requests that an action be performed.
 <P>
 The gesture of clicking on a button with the mouse
 is associated with one instance of <B>ActionEvent</B>, 
 which is sent out when the mouse is both pressed and released 
 over the button. If an application is interested in knowing
 when the button has been pressed but not released, as a separate 
 gesture, it can specialize <B>processMouseEvent</B>, 
 or it can register itself as a listener for mouse events by
 calling <B>addMouseListener</B>. Both of these methods are
 defined by <B>Component</B>, the abstract superclass of
 all components.
 <P>
 When a button is pressed and released, AWT sends an instance  
 of <B>ActionEvent</B> to the button, by calling 
 <B>processEvent</B> on the button. The button's 
 <B>processEvent</B> method receives all events
 for the button; it passes an action event along by
 calling its own <B>processActionEvent</B> method.
 The latter method passes the action event on to any action
 listeners that have registered an interest in action
 events generated by this button.
 <P>
 If an application wants to perform some action based on  
 a button being pressed and released, it should implement 
 <B>ActionListener</B> and register the new listener 
 to receive events from this button, by calling the button's
 <B>addActionListener</B> method. The application can
 make use of the button's action command as a messaging protocol.
