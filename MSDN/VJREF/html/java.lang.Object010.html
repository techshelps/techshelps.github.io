<H5>Parameters</H5>
<DL>
<DT><I> timeout </I>
<DD> the maximum time to wait in milliseconds.
    </DL>
<H5>Description</H5>
 Waits to be notified by another thread of a change in this object.
 <P>
 The current thread must own this object's monitor. The thread 
 releases ownership of this monitor and waits until either of the 
 following two conditions has occurred: 
 <UL>
 <LI>Another thread notifies threads waiting on this object's monitor 
     to wake up either through a call to the <B>notify</B> method 
     or the <B>notifyAll</B> method. 
 <LI>The timeout period, specified by the <B>timeout</B> 
     argument in milliseconds, has elapsed. 
 </UL>
 <P>
 The thread then waits until it can re-obtain ownership of the 
 monitor and resumes execution. 
 <P>
 This method should only be called by a thread that is the owner 
 of this object's monitor. See the <B>notify</B> method for a 
 description of the ways in which a thread can become the owner of 
 a monitor.
<P>
  <H5>

     if the value of timeout is

<H5>Parameters</H5>
<DL>
<DT><I> timeout </I>
<DD> the maximum time to wait in milliseconds.
    <DT><I> nano </I>
<DD> additional time, in nanoseconds range
                       0-999999.
    </DL>
<H5>Description</H5>
 Waits to be notified by another thread of a change in this object.
 <P>
 This method is similar to the <B>wait</B> method of one 
 argument, but it allows finer control over the amount of time to 
 wait for a notification before giving up. 
 <P>
 The current thread must own this object's monitor. The thread 
 releases ownership of this monitor and waits until either of the 
 following two conditions has occurred: 
 <UL>
 <LI>Another thread notifies threads waiting on this object's monitor 
     to wake up either through a call to the <B>notify</B> method 
     or the <B>notifyAll</B> method. 
 <LI>The timeout period, specified by <B>timeout</B> 
     milliseconds plus <B>nanos</B> nanoseconds arguments, has 
     elapsed. 
 </UL>
 <P>

 monitor and resumes execution
