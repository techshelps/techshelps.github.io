<h3>6.6.1	 Determining Accessibility</h3>
<a name="62395"></a>
<p>
<ul><a name="33934"></a>
<li>Whether a package is accessible is determined by the host system <a href="7_2.htm#37758">(&#167;7.2)</a>.
<a name="62409"></a>
<li>If a class or interface type is declared <code>public</code>, then it may be accessed by any Java code that can access the package in which it is declared. If a class or interface type is not declared <code>public</code>, then it may be accessed only from within the package in which it is declared.
<a name="62410"></a>
<li>A member (field or method) of a reference (class, interface, or array) type or a constructor of a class type is accessible only if the type is accessible and the member or constructor is declared to permit access:
<ul>
<a name="62795"></a>
<li>If the member or constructor is declared <code>public</code>, then access is permitted. All members of interfaces are implicitly <code>public</code>.
<a name="62561"></a>
<li>Otherwise, if the member or constructor is declared <code>protected</code>, then access is permitted only when one of the following is true:
<ul><ul>
<a name="62562"></a>
<li>Access to the member or constructor occurs from within the package containing the class in which the <code>protected</code> member is declared.
<a name="62452"></a>
<li>Access occurs within a subclass of the class in which the <code>protected</code> member is declared, and the access is correct as described in <a href="6_6_2.htm#62587">&#167;6.6.2</a>.
</ul>
</ul><p><a name="62857"></a>
<li>Otherwise, if the member or constructor is declared <code>private</code>, then access is permitted only when it occurs from within the class in which it is declared.
<a name="62586"></a>
<li>Otherwise, we say there is default access, which is permitted only when the access occurs from within the package in which the type is declared.
</ul>
</ul><p>
