<H5>Description</H5>
 This method will allow trusted subclasses of ObjectOutputStream
 to substitute one object for another during
 serialization. Replacing objects is disabled until
 enableReplaceObject is called. The enableReplaceObject method
 checks that the stream requesting to do replacment can be
 trusted. Every reference to serializable objects is passed to
 replaceObject.  To insure that the private state of objects is
 not unintentionally exposed only trusted streams may use
 replaceObject. <P>
 When a subclass is replacing objects it must insure that either
 a complementary substitution must be made during
 deserialization or that the substituted object is compatible
 with every field where the reference will be stored.  Objects
 whose type is not a subclass of the type of the field or array
 element abort the serialization by raising an exception and the
 object is not be stored. <P>
 This method is called only once when each object is first encountered.
 All subsequent references to the object will be redirected to the
 new object. This method should return the object to be substituted or
 the original object. <P>
 Null can be returned as the object to be substituted, but may
 cause NullReferenceException in classes that contain references
 to the original object since they may be expecting an object
 instead of null.<P>
