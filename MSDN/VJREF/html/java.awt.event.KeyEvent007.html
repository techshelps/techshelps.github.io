<H5>Description</H5>
 Virtual key codes.  These codes report which keyboard key has
 been pressed, rather than any character generated by one or more
 keys being pressed.  
 For example, pressing the Shift key will cause a KEY_PRESSED event 
 with a VK_SHIFT keyCode, while pressing the 'a' key will result in 
 a VK_A keyCode.  After the 'a' key is released, a KEY_RELEASED event 
 will be fired with VK_A, followed by a KEY_TYPED event with a keyChar 
 value of 'A'.  Key combinations which do not result in characters,
 such as action keys like F1, will not generate KEY_TYPED events.
 Note: not all keyboards or systems are capable of generating all
 virtual key codes.  No attempt is made in Java to artificially
 generate these keys.
 WARNING:  aside from those keys where are defined by the Java language
 (VK_ENTER, VK_BACK_SPACE, and VK_TAB), do not rely on the values of these
 constants.  Sun reserves the right to change these values as needed
 to accomodate a wider range of keyboards in the future.<P>
