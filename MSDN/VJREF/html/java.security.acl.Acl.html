Interface representing an Access Control List (ACL).  An Access
 Control List is a data structure used to guard access to
 resources.<P>
 An ACL can be thought of as a data structure with multiple ACL
 entries.  Each ACL entry, of interface type AclEntry, contains a
 set of permissions associated with a particular principal. (A
 principal represents an entity such as an individual user or a
 group). Additionally, each ACL entry is specified as being either
 positive or negative. If positive, the permissions are to be
 granted to the associated principal. If negative, the permissions
 are to be denied.<P>
 The ACL Entries in each ACL observe the following rules:<P>
 <UL> <LI>Each principal can have at most one positive ACL entry and
 one negative entry; that is, multiple positive or negative ACL
 entries are not allowed for any principal.  Each entry specifies
 the set of permissions that are to be granted (if positive) or
 denied (if negative). <P>
 <LI>If there is no entry for a particular principal, then the
 principal is considered to have a null (empty) permission set.<P>
 <LI>If there is a positive entry that grants a principal a
 particular permission, and a negative entry that denies the
 principal the same permission, the result is as though the
 permission was never granted or denied. <P>
 <LI>Individual permissions always override permissions of the
 group(s) to which the individual belongs. That is, individual
 negative permissions (specific denial of permissions) override the
 groups' positive permissions. And individual positive permissions
 override the groups' negative permissions.<P>
 </UL>
 The <B> java.security.acl </B> package provides the
 interfaces to the ACL and related data structures (ACL entries,
 groups, permissions, etc.), and the <B> sun.security.acl </B>
 classes provide a default implementation of the interfaces. For
 example, <B> java.security.acl.Acl </B> provides the
 interface to an ACL and the <B> sun.security.acl.AclImpl </B>
 class provides the default implementation of the interface.<P>
 The <B> java.security.acl.Acl </B> interface extends the
 <B> java.security.acl.Owner </B> interface. The Owner
 interface is used to maintain a list of owners for each ACL.  Only
 owners are allowed to modify an ACL. For example, only an owner can
 call the ACL's <B>addEntry</B> method to add a new ACL entry 
 to the ACL.
