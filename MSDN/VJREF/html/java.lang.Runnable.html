<P><B> public interface <B>Runnable</B>

<P>

The <B>Runnable</B> interface should be implemented by any 
 class whose instances are intended to be executed by a thread. The 
 class must define a method of no arguments called <B>run</B>.
 <P>
 This interface is designed to provide a common protocol for objects that
 wish to execute code while they are active. For example,
 <B>Runnable</B> is implemented by class <B>Thread</B>.
 Being active simply means that a thread has been started and has not
 yet been stopped. 
 <P>
 In addition, <B>Runnable</B> provides the means for a class to be
 active while not subclassing <B>Thread</B>. A class that implements
 <B>Runnable</B> can run without subclassing <B>Thread</B>
 by instantiating a ,code>Thread</B> instance and passing itself in
 as the target.  In most cases, the <B>Runnable</B> interface should
 be used if you are only planning to override the <B>run()</B>
 method and no other <B>Thread</B> methods.  
 This is important because classes should not be subclassed
 unless the programmer intends on modifying or enhancing the fundamental
 behavior of the class.
