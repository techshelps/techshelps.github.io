<h1>Graphics Class</h1>
 </p>

<p>Encapsulates a Win32 device context (DC) and the drawing operations that are typically
performed on a DC. </p>

<p><b>package com.ms.wfc.ui </b></p>

<p><b>public class Graphics </b></p>

<p class="label">Remarks</p>

<p>These operations include the drawing of standard shapes, such as pies and arcs, as well
as the drawing of Windows controls, such as buttons and check boxes. The <b>Graphics</b>
object automatically performs garbage collection, freeing the resources allocated for
various drawing objects. In addition, you can call the object's <A HREF="com.ms.wfc.ui.Graphics_dispose.html">dispose</A>
method to enforce the cleanup of these resources. A <b>Graphics</b> object that
is connected to a Windows control is valid only for the duration of the current event or
message. For example, if a control processes its <b>paint</b> event, the <b>Graphics</b>
object that is passed as a parameter to <b>paint</b> is valid only until <b>paint</b>
returns. </p>
