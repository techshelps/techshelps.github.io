A font metrics object, which gives information about the rendering 
 of a particular font on a particular screen. Note that the 
 implementations of these methods are inefficient, they are usually 
 overridden with more efficient toolkit-specific implementations.
 <P>
 <B>Note to subclassers</B>: Since many of these methods form closed
 mutually recursive loops, you must take care that you implement
 at least one of the methods in each such loop in order to prevent
 infinite recursion when your subclass is used.
 In particular, the following is the minimal suggested set of methods
 to override in order to ensure correctness and prevent infinite
 recursion (though other subsets are equally feasible):

 <LI><A HREF="java.awt.FontMetrics015.html#charsWidth(char[], int, int)">charsWidth</A>(char data[], int off, int len)
 </UL>

 When an application asks AWT to place a character at the position 
 (<I>x</I>,&nbsp;<I>y</I>), the character is placed so that its 
 reference point (shown as the dot in the accompanying image) is 
 put at that position. The reference point specifies a horizontal 
 line called the <I>baseline</I> of the character. In normal 
 printing, the baselines of characters should align. 
 <P> 
 In addition, every character in a font has an <I>ascent</I>, a 
 <I>descent</I>, and an <I>advance width</I>. The ascent is the 
 amount by which the character ascends above the baseline. The 
 descent is the amount by which the character descends below the 
 baseline. The advance width indicates the position at which AWT  
 should place the next character. 
 <P>
 If the current character is placed with its reference point 
 at the position (<I>x</I>,&nbsp;<I>y</I>), and 
 the character's advance width is <I>w</I>, then the following 
 character is placed with its reference point at the position 
 (<I>x&nbsp;</I><B>+</B><I>&nbsp;w</I>,&nbsp;<I>y</I>). 
 The advance width is often the same as the width of character's 
 bounding box, but need not be so. In particular, oblique and 
 italic fonts often have characters whose top-right corner extends 
 slightly beyond the advance width. 
 <P>
 An array of characters or a string can also have an ascent, a 
 descent, and an advance width. The ascent of the array is the 
 maximum ascent of any character in the array. The descent is the 
 maximum descent of any character in the array. The advance width 
 is the sum of the advance widths of each of the characters in the 
 array.
