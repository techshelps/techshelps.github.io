 public SecureRandom()
</B>
<H5>Description</H5>
 This empty constructor automatically seeds the generator.  We attempt
 to provide sufficient seed bytes to completely randomize the internal
 state of the generator (20 bytes).  Note, however, that our seed
 generation algorithm has not been thoroughly studied or widely deployed.
 It relies on counting the number of times that the calling thread
 can yield while waiting for another thread to sleep for a specified
 interval. 
 <P>The first time this constructor is called in a given Virtual Machine,
 it may take several seconds of CPU time to seed the generator, depending
 on the underlying hardware.  Successive calls run quickly because they
 rely on the same (internal) pseudo-random number generator for their
 seed bits.
 <P>The seeding procedure implemented by this constructor ensures that
 the sequence of pseudo-random bytes produced by each SecureRandom 
 instance yields no useful information about the byte-sequence produced
 by any other instance.  If however, the user wishes to produce multiple 
 instances with truly unrelated seeds, the following code yields
 the desired result (at substantial CPU cost per instance!):<P>

 SecureRandom rnd = new SecureRandom(SecureRandom.getSeed(20));

<DD> the seed.
  </DL>
<H5>Description</H5>
 This constructor uses a user-provided seed in preference to the 
 self-seeding algorithm referred to in the empty constructor 
 description. It may be preferable to the empty constructor if the 
 caller has access to high-quality random bytes from some physical 
 device (for example, a radiation detector or a noisy diode).
