<h2>18.3	 Summary Sentence and General Description</h2>
<a name="25993"></a>
<p>
<a name="25994"></a>
The first sentence of each documentation comment should be a summary sentence, containing a concise but complete description of the declared entity. This 
sentence ends at the first period that is followed by a blank, tab, or line terminator, 
or at the first tagline (as defined below). This simple rule means that a first sentence such as:
<p><pre><a name="26961"></a>This is a simulation of Prof. Knuth's MIX computer.
</pre><p><a name="26965"></a>
will not work properly, because the period after the abbreviation "<code>Prof</code>" ends the 
first sentence, as far as the Java documentation comment processor is concerned. 
Take care to avoid such difficulties.
<p><a name="27193"></a>
Sentences following the summary sentence but preceding the first tagged paragraph (if any) form the general description part of the documentation comment.<p>
