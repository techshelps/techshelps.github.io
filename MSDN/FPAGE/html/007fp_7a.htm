<h3>Shared Borders</h3>
<p>
Pages can include <i>shared borders</i>, which usually contain navigation bars (graphical elements that contain hyperlinks to other pages). FrontPage maintains a single set of borders — top, bottom, left, and righ — for the entire FrontPage web.</p>
<p>
You can include shared borders on pages in two ways:
<ul>
<li>
In the FrontPage Explorer you can specify that one or more shared borders should be included in all pages that are part of the FrontPage web’s navigational structure (as displayed in the <b>Navigation</b> view). Choose <b>Shared Borders</b> on the <b>Tools</b> menu and, in the <b>Shared Borders</b> dialog box, select the shared borders to include. For example, if you specify the Top border in this way, it will appear on all pages that are part of the FrontPage web’s navigational structure.<br><br></li>
<li>
In the FrontPage Editor you can specify to include one or more shared borders on the currently opened page. Choose <b>Shared Borders</b> on the <b>Tools</b> menu, and, in the <b>Shared Borders</b> dialog box, click <b>Set for this page only</b> and select the shared borders to include.<p>
<img src="007fp05.gif" border=0></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
You edit the contents of shared borders in the FrontPage Editor. Click inside it on a page and edit the region as you would edit any other part of the page. When you save the page, all edits to shared borders are also saved.</p>
<p>
Each shared border is used throughout a FrontPage web. When you edit it, you are changing its appearance on every page that it is included in. For example, if you add your e-mail address to the Bottom shared border in one page, all other pages that include the Bottom border will now display your e-mail address.</p>
