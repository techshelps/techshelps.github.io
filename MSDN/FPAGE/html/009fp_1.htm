<h2>Importing and Saving Images</h2>
<p>
In the FrontPage Explorer, you can import an image or an entire folder of images to the FrontPage web, using the <b>Import</b> command on the <b>File</b> menu. You can also drag and drop image files from a desktop folder into the FrontPage Explorer or FrontPage Editor. When you drag an image that is not in the GIF or JPEG format into your FrontPage web, it is automatically converted to the GIF format (for images with 8 bits or less of color) or the JPEG format (for images with more than 8 bits of color). Images that you import using the <b>Import</b> command are not automatically converted.</p>
<p>
Besides importing images in the FrontPage Explorer for later use, you can save images to a FrontPage web using the FrontPage Editor. When you save a page on which you have inserted an image from your file system, the FrontPage Editor will prompt you to save the image to the current FrontPage web. Also, when you open a page from the World Wide Web or from your file system and save it to the current FrontPage web, the FrontPage Editor prompts you to save any images that are not already in the current FrontPage web. If you save a page to a folder in your file system instead of to a FrontPage web, FrontPage will save the images on the page to the same folder.</p>
<p>
When you create a FrontPage web, the FrontPage Explorer creates a folder called <b>images</b>. It is convenient to import all of your images to this folder so that you can easily locate them in your FrontPage web when you want to use them.</p>
<p>
It is often convenient to import several images at once for later use in your pages. However, images take up space in your FrontPage web, so it’s a good idea to delete any images that you are not using before publishing a FrontPage web. Images that are not used on any pages in a FrontPage web are listed with the label <b>Yes</b> in the <b>Orphan</b> column of the <b>All Files</b> view in the FrontPage Explorer.</p>
