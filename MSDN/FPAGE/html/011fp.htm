<p>
A <i>form</i> is a collection of <i>form fields </i>on a page along with a <i>form handler</i>, a method of collecting information from the form. Forms are a key to making your FrontPage web interactive. Users can “talk back” to your FrontPage web by filling in forms in your FrontPage web and submitting them. The layout of a form can include form fields, text in all paragraph styles, tables, images, and most other objects that can be inserted on a page. In FrontPage, you create forms using a simple point-and-click interface.</p>
<p>
 </p>
<p>
A user fills in a form by typing into text fields, clicking radio buttons and check boxes, and selecting options from drop-down menus. The user then submits the form by clicking a button, usually labeled “Submit.” When this happens, FrontPage appends the contents of the form to a file in your FrontPage web. This is the file you will periodically open to gather the collected information from the form. You can also configure a form to send its data to your e-mail address.</p>
<p>
A form’s handler is not visible to a user but is associated with a form by FrontPage. It is invoked when a user submits the form. FrontPage automatically assigns a <i>default form handler</i> to each form that you create. You can also select from a set of FrontPage form handlers or add you own custom form handler to a form.</p>
<p>
The uses of forms on the World Wide Web are always evolving. Some typical uses are:
<ul>
<li>
To collect names, addresses, telephone numbers, e-mail addresses, and other information to register users for a service or event.<br><br></li>
<li>
To collect feedback about a Web site.<br><br></li>
<li>
To gather information for the purchase of an item or service. For example you can design your form to collect size, color, and quantity information for clothes purchases. You can also collect payment information, such as credit card type, number, and expiration date.<br><br></li>
<li>
To moderate a discussion forum about a topic of your choice. Using the FrontPage <b>Discussion Web Wizard</b>, you can create an entire FrontPage discussion web. Using forms, users submit articles, create new areas for discussion (called <i>threads</i>) or add their comments to existing threads.</li>
</ul>
