<h2>Image Fields</h2>
<p>
An <i>image</i> form field is similar to a Push Button field because it submits a form to a form handler. However, when submitting a form when a user clicks an Image field, a Web browser also sends the form handler the x and y coordinates of the point in the image where the user clicked. Using this coordinate information, a custom form handler could process a form based on where in the image that user clicked. You cannot configure an Image form field to reset a form to its initial state.</p>
<p>
You can use an image form field instead of a submit button in a form processed by a FrontPage form handler. However, FrontPage form handlers do not process forms based on the coordinate information that is sent with Image form fields.</p>
