<h2><a name="What Are Extensions">What Are the FrontPage Server Extensions?</a></h2>

<p>The <em>FrontPage Server Extensions </em>are a set of programs on the Web server that
support: 

<ul>
  <li><em>Authoring FrontPage webs.</em> For example, when an author moves a page from one
    folder to another in a FrontPage web, the Server Extensions automatically update all
    hyperlinks to that page from every other page and Microsoft Office document in the
    FrontPage web, directly on the Web server machine. </li>
  <li><em>Administering FrontPage webs.</em> For example, a FrontPage web administrator can
    specify which users can administer, author or browse a FrontPage web.</li>
  <li><em>Browse-time FrontPage web functionality.</em> For example, users of a FrontPage web
    can participate in a discussion group. The Server Extensions will maintain an index of
    hyperlinks to articles in the discussion, separate discussion threads, tables of contents,
    and search forms to locate pages of interest. </li>
</ul>

<p>A FrontPage web is a project containing all the pages, images, and other files that
make up a Web site. For a full description of FrontPage webs, see <a
href="#FrontPage Webs">FrontPage Webs</a>.</p>

<p>The design of the FrontPage client and Server Extensions minimizes the need for costly
file transfers over the Internet. When an author using the FrontPage Explorer opens a
FrontPage web from a Web server containing the Server Extensions, information about the
FrontPage web, such as its hyperlink map, is downloaded to the client machine so that the
FrontPage Explorer can display the information. However, the full set of pages and other
files that comprise the FrontPage web remain on the Web server machine. A page is only
downloaded over the Internet when it is opened for editing in the FrontPage Editor. This
is a very efficient mechanism: an entire Web site can be changed directly on a Web server
at the cost of downloading and editing a single file.</p>

<p>When a Web server machine has the FrontPage Server Extensions, FrontPage web authoring
and administering functionality is available from a PC or Macintosh computer that has the
FrontPage client program and that is on the Internet or an a local Intranet. The browse
time functionality of the Server Extensions is available from any Web browser on the
Internet or Intranet.</p>

<p>Communications between a client computer and a Web server containing the Server
Extensions uses the same open, ubiquitous HTTP protocol that Web browsers on a client
computer use to interact with a Web server. No file-sharing access on the Web server
machine is needed, nor are FTP or telnet access required. No proprietary file system
sharing calls are necessary.</p>

<p>The Server Extensions are designed to work with any standard Web server
using the Common Gateway Interface (CGI), the near-universal Web server extension
mechanism. This includes freeware and shareware servers such as those from Apache,CERN and NCSA, and commercial web servers from Netscape, Microsoft, and
O&#146;Reilly and Associates. The Server Extensions are designed to be easily ported to
all popular hardware and software platforms for cross-platform Web server compatibility.
See <a href="#Supported Platforms">FrontPage Server Extensions: Supported Platforms</a>
for a complete list of the operating systems and Web servers for which the Server
Extensions are available.</p>

<p>On Windows Web servers, the Server Extensions are integrated with
Microsoft Visual SourceSafe and support version control and check-ins and check-outs of
files from the Web server.</p>

<p>The Server Extensions are also used by Microsoft Visual InterDev in the
same way that they are used by Microsoft FrontPage.</p>

<h2><a name="FrontPage Webs">FrontPage Webs</a></h2>

<p>FrontPage works with World Wide Web content by managing <em>FrontPage webs</em>. You
can think of a FrontPage web as a project. It contains all the pages, images, and other
files that make up a Web site. Authors can create, delete, open, and close FrontPage webs
using the FrontPage Explorer and FrontPage Editor on a client computer. A FrontPage web
can be stored on a remote Web server computer, a Web server running on the same computer
as the client program, or in the client computer's file system.</p>

<p>Many of the features of a FrontPage web require the FrontPage Server Extensions to be
on the server containing the FrontPage web. Some of the features of FrontPage webs that
are supported by the FrontPage Server Extensions are: 

<ul>
  <li>A <em>full</em> <em>hyperlink map</em> of all files in a FrontPage web. The FrontPage
    Explorer displays hyperlinks using this hyperlink map. When a FrontPage web is copied from
    one Web server to another, the entire hyperlink map is recalculated.</li>
  <li>A <em>full-text index </em>of all Web pages in a FrontPage web. This lets end-users
    search a FrontPage web for pages containing words or phrases. </li>
  <li>A <em>persistent structure </em>that authors can create and manipulate. This structure
    defines the key pages in a FrontPage web and the relationships among these pages. Authors
    operate on the structure of a FrontPage web in the FrontPage Explorer. When the structure
    of a FrontPage web is changed, affected pages are updated to reflect the changes.</li>
  <li><em>Web themes</em>. A theme is a set of color-coordinated page elements, including
    background colors, text colors, bullets, borders, and horizontal lines. By applying a
    theme to a FrontPage web, an author can easily give a FrontPage web a consistent,
    attractive appearance. When a new theme is applied to a FrontPage web, all pages are
    automatically updated to use it.</li>
  <li>A <em>Tasks list</em> containing the tasks needed to complete a FrontPage web. Tasks are
    linked to the pages on which they occur.</li>
  <li><em>Unique security settings</em>. Each FrontPage web can be made available to a
    different group of administrators, authors and end-users.</li>
</ul>

<p>FrontPage supports two kinds of FrontPage webs: <em>root webs</em> and <em>sub-webs</em>.
A root web is a FrontPage web that is the top level content directory of a Web server or,
in a multihosting environment, of a virtual Web server. It can have many levels of
subdirectories, containing it&#146;s content. There can be only one root web per Web
Server or virtual Web server.</p>

<p>A single root web can support a number of sub-webs. A sub-web is a complete FrontPage
web that is a subdirectory of the root web. Sub-webs can only exist one level below the
root web. Each sub-web can have many levels of subdirectories, making up its content.
Sub-webs cannot have sub-webs.</p>

<p>Even though sub-webs appear below the root web in the Web server's file system and URL
space, the root web does not include the content in its sub-webs. This separation of
content is done by the FrontPage Server Extensions.</p>

<p>The root web and all sub-webs on a server have separate copies of the Server Extensions
installed, or have stub executables of the Server Extensions programs. Having separate
Server Extensions copies for each FrontPage web lets the Web server enforce different
end-user, author, and administrator permissions on each FrontPage web, since FrontPage
uses the Web server's built-in security mechanism to control access.</p>

<p>FrontPage webs can be implemented on a Web server and accessed by Web browsers in the
following ways: 

<ul>
  <li>As private domain names, such as &quot;www.mycompany.com.&quot; These are usually
    implemented as virtual servers on the same physical server machine using <em>multihosting</em>.
    Private domain name customers each get their own root web and have the option of creating
    sub-webs.</li>
  <li>As a common or shared domain but with private virtual servers, as in
    &quot;www.mycompany.myprovider.com,&quot; where &quot;myprovider.com&quot; is a shared
    domain and &quot;www.mycompany&quot; is a private virtual server. Private virtual server
    customers on a shared domain each get their own root web and have the option of creating
    sub-webs.</li>
  <li>As a URL on an Internet service provider's server machine, as in
    &quot;www.myprovider.com/mycompany.&quot; URL customers get a single sub-web.</li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="Authoring Support">FrontPage Authoring Support</a></h2>

<p>In FrontPage, authors create Web pages and entire Web sites using FrontPage on a client
computer (a PC or Macintosh). The FrontPage client programs are the <em>FrontPage Explorer</em>
and the <em>FrontPage Editor</em>. 

<ul>
  <li>The FrontPage Explorer is the FrontPage tool for creating, designing, viewing,
    maintaining, and publishing FrontPage webs. Various views in the FrontPage Explorer
    provide different ways of looking at and modifying the contents of a FrontPage web.<p><img
    src="/html/explorer.gif" width="634" height="457"></p>
  </li>
  <li>The FrontPage Editor is the FrontPage tool for creating, editing, and testing World Wide
    Web pages. As an author adds text, tables, forms, images, controls and other elements to a
    page, the FrontPage Editor displays it in WYSIWYG style, as it would appear in a Web
    browser. The FrontPage Editor is fully integrated with the FrontPage Explorer.<p><img
    src="/html/editor.gif" width="613" height="442"></p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Much of the FrontPage Explorer and Editor's functionality is supported by the FrontPage
Server Extensions. Some examples are: 

<ul>
  <li>Saving documents to FrontPage webs.</li>
  <li>Creating, copying, and publishing FrontPage webs.</li>
  <li>The Tasks view, containing a list of tasks needed to complete a FrontPage web.</li>
  <li>FrontPage web-structure editing. An author defines the structure of a FrontPage web in
    the FrontPage Explorer's Navigation View and inserts navigation bars in the FrontPage
    Editor. FrontPage navigation bars automatically create the hyperlinks that express the
    FrontPage web's structure. If the author changes the structure in the Navigation View, all
    FrontPage navigation bars automatically update these hyperlinks.</li>
  <li>FrontPage components (also called WebBot components). FrontPage includes a rich set of
    active components that update pages when a change occurs in the FrontPage web. For
    example, the Table of Contents component keeps an updated table of contents of the entire
    FrontPage web. When an author moves a page, the table of contents is updated. Another
    FrontPage component, the Include component, inserts the contents of one page into another.
    If the inserted page changes, all pages that include it are automatically updated.</li>
  <li>Hyperlink map. A FrontPage web's hyperlink map is browsable in the FrontPage Explorer's
    Hyperlink View. Using this map, FrontPage updates affected hyperlinks in the FrontPage web
    when a page is moved or renamed.</li>
  <li>Themes. Authors select FrontPage web themes in the FrontPage Explorer, or they can apply
    a theme to a single page in the FrontPage Editor. When the theme for a FrontPage web
    changes, FrontPage automatically updates every page in the FrontPage web to use the new
    theme.</li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="Administrative Support">FrontPage Administrative Support</a></h2>

<p>The FrontPage Server Extensions provides a set of web-administration tools that can be
used remotely from the FrontPage Explorer. These tools provide access control and general
Web-administration functionality. The Server Extensions support three levels of access
control of FrontPage webs: administrator, author, and browser. 

<ul>
  <li><em>Administering permission</em> gives a user, group of users, or a computer permission
    to administer the FrontPage web. </li>
  <li><em>Authoring permission</em> gives a user, group of users, or a computer permission to
    open the FrontPage web in the FrontPage Explorer and edit its pages and files.</li>
  <li><em>Browsing permission</em> gives a user, group of users, or a computer permission to
    browse the FrontPage web when it is published on the Internet or on an intranet.</li>
</ul>

<p>For a full discussion of FrontPage Server Extension administrative capabilities, along
with a general discussion of Server Extensions security issues, see <a href="security.htm">The
FrontPage Server Extensions: Security Considerations</a>.</p>

<h2><a name="Browse-time Support">FrontPage Browse-time Support</a></h2>

<p>FrontPage <em>browse-time</em> support occurs when a user views a page in a FrontPage
web from a Web browser. Browse-time support is implemented in the FrontPage Server
Extensions as <em>FrontPage components </em>(also called <em>WebBot components</em>).</p>

<p>A FrontPage component is an active object that is inserted on an HTML page using the
FrontPage Editor. It has a persistent state that is encoded as HTML comments. FrontPage
components typically produce as their output HTML that is inserted in the surrounding HTML
page. FrontPage components can be active at authoring-time, while the FrontPage Editor and
Explorer are in use, or at browse-time. For example, the Include component is an
authoring-time component that includes the contents of one page in another.</p>

<p>Some browse-time FrontPage components are: 

<dl>
  <dt><strong>Search Form</strong></dt>
  <dd>The Search Form uses the full text index created by the Server
    Extensions. It appears as a form on a page. When a user submits a Search Form containing
    words to locate, the Search Form returns hyperlinks to all pages in a FrontPage web that
    contain the words.</dd>
  <dt><strong>E-mail Form Handler</strong></dt>
  <dd>The E-mail Form Handler gathers information from a form, formats the
    information, and sends it to an e-mail address.</dd>
  <dt><strong>Discussion Form Handler</strong></dt>
  <dd>The Discussion Form Handler lets users participate in an online
    discussion. It collects information from a form, formats it into an HTML page, and adds
    the page to a table of contents and to a text index. </dd>
</dl>

<p>When a user browses an HTML page containing a browse-time FrontPage component, the
Server Extensions do whatever processing is required and then generate a new HTML page to
display the results of the operation. For example, a Search Form will generate an HTML
list of hyperlinks to pages and an E-mail Form Handler will generate a page confirming
that a form's contents have been processed and sent to an e-mail address.</p>

<p>An HTML page with no browse-time FrontPage components does not use the Server
Extensions when a user browses the page. Instead, the normal Web server page-retrieval
process occurs. </p>

<h2><a name="Publishing FrontPage Webs">Publishing FrontPage Webs</a></h2>

<p><em>Publishing</em> a FrontPage web means making the FrontPage web available to users
for browsing from a Web server, either on an intranet or on the Internet. The Internet and
intranet cases typically use different methods of publishing.</p>

<p>In Internet publishing, the most common method is for an author to create a FrontPage
web on a Web server installed on the client computer. (When the FrontPage client program
is installed, FrontPage optionally installs a Web server with the Server Extensions on the
client computer.) Then, when the FrontPage web is completed and tested, the author
publishes it to an Internet service provider's Web server using the FrontPage Explorer's <strong>Publish
FrontPage Web </strong>command. Authoring on a local Web server is efficient because it
does not require an author to be connected to an Internet service provider while working
on a FrontPage web.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="/html/publish1.gif" width="623" height="335"></p>

<p>The <strong>Publish FrontPage Web </strong>command copies the FrontPage web from a
source (desktop) Web server to a destination (production) Web server in batch mode. Only
new or changed pages and files are copied by default. Pages and files deleted from the
source FrontPage web are also deleted from the destination web.</p>

<p>When an author publishes a FrontPage web using the <strong>Publish FrontPage Web </strong>command,
the home page is renamed, if necessary, to match the naming-convention on the destination
Web server. Also, all FrontPage components in the FrontPage web are regenerated to take
advantage of platform-specific functionality. For example when a FrontPage web is
published to an IIS server containing Microsoft Index Server, any Search Forms are
configured to use the Index Server.</p>

<p align="left">In Intranet publishing, the most common method does not require the <strong>Publish
FrontPage Web </strong>command. Instead, an author works directly on a Web server machine
on an internal network, which is typically used to share information inside an
organization. In this method, whenever a page is opened from the Web server and edited,
the change is published to the intranet when it is saved from the FrontPage Editor.</p>

<p align="left"><img src="/html/publish2.gif" width="623" height="335"></p>

<h2><a name="FrontPage Product Architecture">FrontPage Product Architecture</a></h2>

<p>The FrontPage client system communicates with a Web server via the FrontPage Explorer.
The library dedicated to communicating from the client is the WEC (Web Extender Client), a
private FrontPage library. This library communicates via WinSock and TCP/IP. Wizards and
custom applications on the client communicate with the Editor and Explorer using OLE
automation. </p>

<p><img src="/html/architec.gif" width="560" height="300"></p>

<p>The FrontPage client tools communicate with the Server Extensions using HTTP, the same
protocol used to communicate between Web browsers and Web servers. FrontPage implements a
remote procedure call (RPC) mechanism on top of the HTTP &quot;POST&quot; request, so that
the FrontPage client can request documents, update the Tasks list, add new authors, and so
on. The Web server sees &quot;POST&quot; requests addressed to the Server Extensions CGI
programs and directs those requests accordingly. FrontPage correctly communicates between
client and server through firewalls (proxy servers). FrontPage does not use or require the
HTTP &quot;PUT&quot; request. As described in the HTTP specification, &quot;PUT&quot;
sends a document to a Web server. However, few Web servers implement &quot;PUT.&quot;
Therefore, FrontPage uses the universally-implemented HTTP &quot;POST&quot; request for
all communications with the Server Extensions.</p>

<p>For most web servers, the Server Extensions are accessed by the Web
server using the Common Gateway Interface (CGI), the near-universal Web server extension
mechanism. The implementation of CGI differs somewhat among Web servers and platforms. For
example, most Unix web servers invoke a CGI extension by running it in a separate fork,
whereas some Windows NT web servers support a Dynamic Link Library (DLL) variant of
CGI-style communication that incurs less overhead. But the information flow is similar for
all CGI implementations: user-driven values and environment parameters are passed to the
CGI extension using a block of name/value pairs, and the CGI extension program returns a
result in HTML format.</p>

<p>The Server Extensions are divided into three libraries: 

<ul>
  <li><em>admin.dll</em> for FrontPage web administration</li>
  <li><em>author.dll </em>for FrontPage web authoring support</li>
  <li><em>shtml.dll</em> for browse-time support</li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="FrontPage Extensibility">FrontPage Extensibility</a></h2>

<p>FrontPage is extensible in the following areas: 

<ul>
  <li>Web wizards and page wizards</li>
  <li>Web themes and page themes</li>
  <li>menu commands</li>
  <li>FrontPage components</li>
</ul>

<p>The Microsoft FrontPage Software Developer's Kit, which is included on the FrontPage
CD-ROM in the \SDK folder, contains full documentation for adding these features,
including examples and sample code.</p>

<h2><a name="Compatability">FrontPage Client and Server Extensions Compatibility</a></h2>

<p>The FrontPage Server Extensions exist for FrontPage client versions 1.1, FrontPage 97,
and FrontPage 98. Each FrontPage client release is accompanied by a new Server Extensions
release that supports the new features of the client. For example, the current release,
FrontPage 98, is accompanied by a new FrontPage 98 Server Extensions release. It is always
most effective to use the most up-to-date versions of the FrontPage client and the Server
Extensions.</p>

<p>Each new release of the Server Extensions is backward compatible with previous
FrontPage client versions so that it continues to support the client's functionality at
each earlier level. For example, a FrontPage 97 client can open and edit a FrontPage web
from a Web server that has the FrontPage 98 Server Extensions installed with no loss of
functionality in the FrontPage 97 client. However, the client will not be able to access
new Server Extensions functionality added for the FrontPage 98 client such as applying
themes to a FrontPage web or creating and saving a FrontPage web structure.</p>

<p>A FrontPage client can also open and edit FrontPage webs on a Web server containing an
earlier version of the Server Extensions. However, the client will not be able to use its
newer features, because they will not be supported by the earlier version of the Server
Extensions.</p>

<p>Bug fixes and patches are occasionally issued for the current released version of the
Server Extensions . Older versions of the Server Extensions do not receive these
occasional updates. However, patches to the current version of the Server Extensions will
work with earlier versions of the FrontPage client.</p>
