<h3>Include Components</h3>
<p>
The three FrontPage Include components — the <i>Scheduled Include Page</i> component, <i>Scheduled Image</i> component, and <i>Include Page</i> component — are all replaced by a page or file in your FrontPage web. The two scheduled FrontPage components are only active during a time period that you specify.</p>
<p>
You use FrontPage Include components to give the pages in your FrontPage web a unified appearance and to simplify maintenance of your FrontPage web. For example, you can create an informational page containing your address, phone number, and e-mail address and include it throughout your FrontPage web. Then, if you change your address on this informational page, it will automatically be updated on every page that has it included.</p>
<p>
When you create an Include Page component or FrontPage Scheduled Include component, you specify the location of the page to include. When you create a FrontPage Scheduled Image component, you specify the location of an image.</p>
<p>
For FrontPage Scheduled Include components and FrontPage Scheduled Image components you also can specify:
<ul>
<li>
The date and time to start and stop including the page or image.<br><br></li>
<li>
An alternate image or page to include when a user visits the page outside of the specified time period.</li>
</ul>
<p>
FrontPage Scheduled Include components and FrontPage Scheduled Image components are activated when you make any change to your FrontPage web. To ensure proper timing of these FrontPage components, make some change to your FrontPage web daily.</p>
