<h4><a name="sharedborders"></a>Shared Borders</h4>
<p>
Shared borders are typically used on every page in a FrontPage web. When you edit the contents of a shared border, the changes apply to all pages in the current FrontPage web that use shared borders. For example, adding your name (or the name of your organization) to the Top shared border on one page will cause all other pages in that FrontPage web to display the same name, in the same location.</p>
<p>
If a FrontPage web is not created in the <b>Navigation</b> view, you can enable shared borders by choosing <b>Shared Borders</b> on the <b>Tools</b> menu in the FrontPage Explorer. In the <b>Shared Borders</b> dialog box, select the shared borders you want to include on your pages (top, left, right, and/or bottom).</p>
<p>
<b>Note</b> You cannot insert Shared Borders on a frames page.</p>
<p>
You can edit the contents of shared borders in the FrontPage Editor, where you also have greater control over the visual appearance of shared borders. For more information, see “The Microsoft FrontPage Editor”.</p>
<h5>Navigation Bars</h5>
<p>
To navigate through your Web site, users will follow hyperlinks in a Web browser from one page to another. FrontPage manages these hyperlinks for you with <i>navigation bars</i> —page regions that provide access to other pages in your FrontPage web, using textual or graphical hyperlinks.</p>
<p>
Navigation bars can be added automatically when you create a new FrontPage web in the FrontPage Explorer’s <b>Navigation</b> view, or when you create a FrontPage web from a web wizard or template. You can also insert navigation bars on individual pages using the FrontPage Editor. For more information, see “The Microsoft FrontPage Editor”.</p>
<p>
Typically, navigation bars are placed inside a shared border, which displays the navigation bar on every page in the FrontPage web that includes that shared border. If you change the FrontPage web’s structure in the FrontPage Explorer’s <b>Navigation</b> view, FrontPage will update the hyperlinks on the navigation bar automatically.</p>
