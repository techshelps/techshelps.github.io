<h3>Scripting</h3>
<p>
<i>Scripting</i> is a type of programming language that you can use to write custom code for your Web page. This is an advanced FrontPage feature that requires knowledge of programming. Scripting is useful for custom Web-based solutions development. It provides a full object model for the Web browser and the objects on the current page. This makes it easy to write code that manipulates elements on the page without knowing the details of the HTML or how the objects are implemented.</p>
<p>
FrontPage provides a range of scripting features that are compatible with JavaScript and Visual Basic Script. In the FrontPage Editor, you insert a script into your page on the <b>Insert</b> menu by pointing to <b>Advanced</b> and then clicking <b>Script</b>. The <b>Script</b> command lets you easily insert scripting code inline on your page. You pick the scripting language you want, type in the script code, and click <b>OK</b>. The script will appear on your page as a small icon. You can double-click this icon at any time to edit the script.</p>
<p>
You can also use the Script Wizard to create script code that is specifically designed to handle events that occur on objects (such as ActiveX controls) on your page. The Script Wizard includes an online Help system.</p>
<p>
As a simple example, you can insert a push button using the FrontPage Editor’s <b>Push Button</b> command, on the Forms toolbar. In the <b>Push Button Properties</b> dialog box, click <b>Normal</b> and click <b>OK</b>. Right click on the button and choose <b>Script Wizard</b>. This launches the FrontPage Script Wizard. Click from the list to select the button object. Click to select the <b>OnClick</b> event. Now switch to code-writing mode and type in the statement<i> </i><b>MsgBox &quot;Thanks for clicking!&quot;</b></p>
<p>
To test the script, choose the <b>Preview in Browser</b> command on the FrontPage Editor’s <b>File</b> menu. Click on the button to view the message.</p>
<h3>Microsoft Visual SourceSafe Integration</h3>
<p>
<i>Microsoft Visual SourceSafe</i> is a visual version control system that is available separately from FrontPage. If you install Microsoft Visual SourceSafe version 5.0 or higher on your Web server, FrontPage will automatically detect it and provide some new commands in the FrontPage Explorer.</p>
<p>
In the FrontPage Explorer’s <b>Tools</b> menu, use the <b>Web Settings</b> command, and select the <b>Configuration</b> tab. In the <b>Source Control Project</b> edit box, enter the name of the Visual SourceSafe project that you want to associate with the current FrontPage web. Visual SourceSafe project names begin with “$\” as in “$\myproj.” To create a new Visual SourceSafe project to use with a FrontPage web, type in its name. You can only create one new level of a Visual SourceSafe project using this technique. For example, if only the root Visual SourceSafe project ($\) exists, you can type <b>$\webs</b>, but not <b>$\webs\myweb</b>.</p>
<p>
When you associate your FrontPage web with a new Visual SourceSafe project, the FrontPage server extensions will communicate with Visual SourceSafe to create a new project on the server, and place all of the files in your current FrontPage web under version control.</p>
<p>
After associating your FrontPage web with a Source Safe project, you can use the <b>Check-Out</b> command on the <b>Edit</b> menu to exclusively edit a file in the FrontPage web. You can make changes to the page or file in the FrontPage Editor, save it, and use the <b>Check-In</b> command on the <b>Edit</b> menu to make the changes available to other authors working on the FrontPage web. Or, if you make a mistake, you can use the <b>Undo Check-Out</b> command to revert back to the version you had before you checked the file out.</p>
