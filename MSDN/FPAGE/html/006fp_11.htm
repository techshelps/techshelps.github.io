<h4><a name="tasksview"></a>Tasks View</h4>
<p>
This view displays a list of tasks associated with a FrontPage web. Tasks are items that may need your attention before you publish your FrontPage web. If you are working in a multi-user environment, such as an intranet, you can assign tasks to other authors.</p>
<p>
You can add tasks to the <b>Tasks</b> view, as well as modify task names, descriptions, and who the task is assigned to. Certain FrontPage Explorer web wizards and some of the FrontPage Editor’s commands can add tasks and link them to the appropriate page or file. For example, when you check the spelling in the pages in your FrontPage web, you can choose to add a new task for each page containing misspellings. You can open the pages that require corrections by double-clicking a task, and then clicking <b>Do Task</b> in the <b>Task Details</b> dialog box.</p>
<p>
To monitor all tasks in a FrontPage web — including completed tasks — you can enable <b>Task History</b> from the FrontPage Explorer’s <b>Views</b> menu while in the <b>Tasks</b> view.</p>
<p>
While it is not necessary to complete every task before you publish your FrontPage web, it is a good idea to review the list of tasks when you are finished making changes to your FrontPage web. The <b>Tasks</b> view helps you manage your FrontPage web by flagging important reminders for you.</p>
<h3>Shared Borders and Navigation Bars</h3>
<p>
Shared borders are a useful way to present recurring information in a consistent manner. In the FrontPage Explorer, you can specify that one or more shared borders be included on all pages that are part of the FrontPage web’s navigational structure (as displayed in the <b>Navigation</b> view). You can also add shared borders for individual pages, using the FrontPage Editor.</p>
<p>
If you enable shared borders, FrontPage will automatically create navigation bars that help users navigate your Web site.</p>
