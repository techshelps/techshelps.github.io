<h2>Check Box Fields</h2>
<p>
<i>Check box</i> fields present the user with a choice that can be made by clicking a check box. Unlike radio buttons, more than one check box in a set can be selected.</p>
<p>
For example, in a product order form, a set of check boxes could represent individual products. A user could order one or more products by clicking the appropriate check boxes.</p>
<p>
When you configure a check box field, you assign it a name, a value, and an initial state: selected or not selected. Although related check box fields in a set do not have to share a common group name, it is often convenient to give them each the same name and differentiate them by their values. When a form containing check boxes is submitted by a user, the name of each selected check box, along with the its value, is sent to the form handler.</p>
