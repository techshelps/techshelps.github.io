<h2>Introducing FrontPage Components</h2>
<p>
<i>FrontPage components</i> are dynamic objects that you insert on your pages. They provide complex functionality to your FrontPage web that would otherwise require you to write scripts and install them on the Web server.</p>
<p>
Most FrontPage components do some processing and then generate HTML. The HTML that a FrontPage component generates depends on conditions in your FrontPage web at the time the component is activated. For example, a FrontPage Search Form generates an HTML list of hyperlinks to all the pages in a FrontPage web that contain a word submitted by a user. The Search Form supplies this HTML list to the Web browser which displays it to the user.</p>
<p>
Some FrontPage components are only activated when a user visits the page in a Web browser. For example, a Search Form is activated when a user submits the form. Other FrontPage components are only activated when an author is using FrontPage. For example, a FrontPage Table of Contents generates an HTML table of contents when an author adds the table of contents and saves the page.</p>
<p>
You can insert some FrontPage components on a page and you can associate others with a form. This topic describes the following FrontPage components:
<ul>
<li>
Table of Contents<br><br></li>
<li>
Search Form<br><br></li>
<li>
Include Component<br><br></li>
<li>
Scheduled Image<br><br></li>
<li>
Scheduled Include Page<br><br></li>
<li>
Substitution Component</li>
</ul>
<p>
For details on FrontPage components that you can associate with forms, see “Forms and Form Fields”.</p>
<p>
You insert most FrontPage components on a page in the FrontPage Editor using the <b>FrontPage Component</b> command on the <b>Insert</b> menu. This command opens the <b>Insert FrontPage Component</b> dialog box, which lists most FrontPage components. After selecting a FrontPage component and clicking <b>OK</b>, you can configure the FrontPage component by editing its dialog box. (Other FrontPage components are available on the <b>Insert</b> menu or on the <b>Active Elements</b> sub-menu.) After you configure the FrontPage component and close its dialog box, the FrontPage Editor inserts the FrontPage component on the page.</p>
<p>
WebBot Pointer</p>
<p>
When you insert a FrontPage component on a page, the FrontPage Editor displays a placeholder representing it. You can cut, copy, and paste this placeholder, but you cannot click inside it to edit text. When you drag the pointer over a FrontPage component on a page, the pointer becomes the FrontPage “WebBot” pointer.</p>
<p>
You can edit a FrontPage component by changing any setting in its properties dialog box. To open a FrontPage component’s properties dialog box, double-click the component on the page or point to the component and open its properties dialog box from the shortcut menu.</p>

<p>
<b>Can I add my own FrontPage components to FrontPage? </b>Yes. Using the FrontPage Software Developer’s Kit, you can create your own FrontPage components and add them to the FrontPage Editor. The FrontPage Software Developer’s Kit is on the Microsoft FrontPage CD-ROM, in the \SDK folder.</p>
<p>
The following FrontPage components require that the FrontPage Server Extensions are installed on the Web server on which the FrontPage web is published:
<ul>
<li>
Search Form<br><br></li>
<li>
Confirmation Field<br><br></li>
<li>
Default FrontPage form handler<br><br></li>
<li>
Registration form handler<br><br></li>
<li>
Discussion form handler</li>
</ul>
<p>
The FrontPage Server Extensions are a set of programs that support authoring and administering FrontPage webs, along with browse-time FrontPage functionality. They are available for the Microsoft Internet Information Server (IIS) and other popular Windows and UNIX web servers.</p>
<p>
When a Web server has the FrontPage Server Extensions installed, FrontPage web authoring and administration is available from a PC or Macintosh computer that can communicate with the Web server over the Internet or an intranet and that has the FrontPage Explorer and Editor installed. The browse-time functionality of the Server Extensions is available from any Web browser on the Internet or an intranet.</p>
<p>
For full documentation of the FrontPage Server Extensions, see the FrontPage Server Extensions Resource Kit, in the \SERK folder of your Microsoft FrontPage CD-ROM.</p>
