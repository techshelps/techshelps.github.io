<p>
More and more organizations are publishing their databases on corporate intranets and on the World Wide web to offer convenient access to data for employees and customers alike. The benefits of making existing information widely and easily available quickly become evident: a retail business can create an online product catalog that tells customers which items are currently in stock; a computer software company can give its customers round-the-clock self-help information and troubleshooting tips through an online knowledge base; and human resources departments in any organization can post directories of up-to-date employee information right on the company intranet.</p>
<p>
With FrontPage, you can easily create custom database queries on dynamic, richly formatted Web pages, providing visitors to your Internet or intranet site with information at their fingertips.</p>
