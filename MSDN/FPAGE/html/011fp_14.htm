<p>
You can create a form that registers users for your FrontPage web. When a user visits a FrontPage web that requires registered users, the Web server prompts the user for a name and password before it releases the FrontPage web for display in a Web browser.</p>
<p>
The FrontPage form handler that adds a user and password to the list of users with permission to access a FrontPage web is the Registration Form Handler. You must create forms handled by Registration Form Handlers in the root FrontPage web (the FrontPage web named “&lt;Root Web&gt;” by default).</p>
<p>
A user registers for access to a FrontPage web by supplying a name and password to a form handled by a Registration Form Handler. Along with adding the user and password to the list of users with permission to use the FrontPage web, Registration Form Handlers can save other information from the form in the same way as the default form handler.</p>
<p>
By default, all FrontPage webs on a Web server have the same permissions for administrators, authors, and users as the root FrontPage web. When you create a FrontPage web that will require users to register before using it, you must open the FrontPage web and specify that it does not inherit its permissions from the root web, but instead has its own set of permissions. You can do this by opening the FrontPage web for which you are registering users and choosing the <b>Permissions</b> command in the <b>Tools</b> menu of the FrontPage Explorer. In the <b>Settings</b> tab, click <b>Use unique permissions for this web</b> and then click the <b>Apply</b> button. Next, in the <b>Users</b> tab, click <b>Only Registered Users Have Browse Access</b> and click the <b>Apply</b> button.</p>
<p>
Once you have configured your FrontPage web to accept only registered users, you can add the user registration form to any page in your root web. (If you do not add the form on the home page of the root web, make sure you have a hyperlink to it from the home page, so users can find it.) Along with Push Button fields for submitting and resetting the form, a registration form should have the following fields:
<ul>
<li>
a one-line text box field for entering a user’s name<br><br></li>
<li>
a one-line text box field for entering a user’s password</li>
</ul>
<p>
The easiest way to add a user-registration form to the root web is to create a new page and select the <b>User Registration</b> template. This template contains a complete user registration form along with explanatory text that you can modify. Once you have created a user registration page, you must open the page, open the <b>Form Properties</b> dialog box, click the <b>Options</b> button, and specify the FrontPage web for which you are registering users. In the <b>FrontPage web name</b> field, type in the name of the FrontPage web that requires registered users, and click <b>OK</b> twice to close all dialog boxes.</p>
