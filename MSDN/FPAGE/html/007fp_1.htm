<h2><a name="whatcanyoudoinfrontpageeditor"></a>What Can You Do in the FrontPage Editor?</h2>
<p>
Here are some of the key features of the FrontPage Editor:</p>
<p>
<b>Create Pages </b>You can create new HTML pages based on built-in wizards and templates. The FrontPage Editor offers many choices of page formats, or you can create your own templates.</p>
<p>
<b>Design and Lay Out Pages </b>You can apply one of the many FrontPage themes, created by professional designers, to give your pages a dynamic, colorful appearance. You can also add and design borders for your pages and insert navigation bars, which guide your users around your Web site.</p>
<p>
<b>Convert Files to HTML </b>You can open files of many popular types, and the FrontPage Editor converts them to HTML. Some of the file types you can open are Microsoft Word 2.0 and 6.0, Microsoft Word 6.0 for MS-DOS, Microsoft Word 95 and 97, Microsoft Excel 4.0 and 5.0, Microsoft Excel 95 and 97, and WordPerfect 6.<i>x</i>. The FrontPage Editor preserves hyperlinks in Microsoft Office documents.</p>
<p>
<b>Open HTML Files </b>You can open any HTML file in the FrontPage Editor. All the HTML tags on the page are preserved.</p>
<p>
<b>Type and Edit Text </b>You can insert text in all HTML styles, create multilevel lists, change text size and color, and apply formatting such as centering a heading or making text italic. Using cascading style sheet support, you can control margins, line spacing, colors, fonts faces and sizes.</p>
<p>
<b>Create and Test Hyperlinks </b>Using a point-and-click interface, you can create hyperlinks to pages and files in your FrontPage web or to pages and files on the World Wide Web. Point to a page and FrontPage creates the correct hyperlink syntax for you automatically.</p>
<p>
<b>Create and Edit Image Maps </b>You can insert an image of almost any type, and the FrontPage Editor converts it into GIF or JPEG format. Click an image and it opens for editing in your favorite image-editing program. Create an <i>image map</i> by adding <i>hotspots</i>, areas in an image containing hyperlinks. Using FrontPage image-editing commands, you can crop, rotate, and resize an image, make it black and white, give it beveled edges, and change its brightness and contrast. FrontPage includes the Microsoft Clip Gallery, a large library of images chosen for World Wide Web sites.</p>
<p>
<b>Create and Edit Forms </b>You can create forms containing text fields, check boxes, radio buttons, drop-down lists, and push buttons. When you create a form, the default FrontPage form handler automatically saves form information to a file or sends it to an e-mail address. You can select from a set of FrontPage form handlers or add you own custom form handler to a form.</p>
<p>
<b>Create and Edit Tables </b>Using the FrontPage table-editing commands, you can create a table, insert rows and columns, align them, and create background colors, using a point-and-click interface.</p>
<p>
<b>Use FrontPage Components and Other Active Page Elements </b>You can add powerful functionality to your page by inserting FrontPage components. They add interactive features such as navigation bars, threaded discussion groups, full-text searches, and form handlers that would otherwise require complex programming. For example, the <b>Table of Contents</b> component automatically creates an HTML outline of your FrontPage web with hyperlinks to each page, and the <b>Banner Ad Manager</b> replays a sequence of images using effects similar to a rotating billboard.</p>
<p>
<b>Create and Edit Frames Pages </b>You can create new frames pages, edit the appearance of your frames, and assign initial pages to each frame, all using a point-and click interface. FrontPage displays your frames pages in WYSIWYG style and generates the HTML.</p>
<p>
<b>Add Advanced Features </b>You can insert ActiveX Controls, plug-ins, and Java applets in the FrontPage Editor. You can launch a script-editing session and create and insert JavaScript scripts and Microsoft Visual Basic<sup>&reg;</sup> Scripting Edition scripts.</p>
