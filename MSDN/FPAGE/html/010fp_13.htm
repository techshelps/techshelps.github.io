<h3>Timestamps</h3>
<p>
The <i>FrontPage Timestamp</i> inserts a date and timestamp that either corresponds to the last time the page was edited and saved to the Web server or the last time the page was automatically updated. (A page is automatically updated to recalculate its hyperlinks or FrontPage components.)</p>
<p>
Putting a timestamp on your page lets users know how recently the page has been modified. A recent timestamp means that the material is new, motivating users to read it. Also, by checking the page’s timestamp, users can determine if the page has changed since the last time they viewed it.</p>
<p>
When you create a Timestamp, you can choose the format in which to display the date and time from a list of standard formats.</p>
