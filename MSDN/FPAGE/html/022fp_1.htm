<p>
FrontPage database integration is based on Active Server Pages (ASP). An Active Server Page is an HTML document that contains embedded server-side scripting. Web servers compatible with ASP can execute these server-side scripts. On the client side, an ASP is a standard HTML document, viewable on any platform using any Web browser.</p>
<p>
Before you can integrate a database into a FrontPage web, you must follow a series of steps that take place outside of FrontPage. These include configuring your Web server and workstation, and building (and modifying) Structured Query Language (SQL) queries in a database management tool such as Microsoft Access. The examples provided in this chapter will refer to the Northwind Traders database, a sample database in Microsoft Access MDB format. However, you can use any database with an available Open Data Base Connectivity (ODBC) compliant driver to publish data on a Web site.</p>
<p>
Using the FrontPage Database Region Wizard, you can submit SQL queries to an ODBC-compliant database accessible from the Web server computer. When a user visits your Web site and submits search criteria, the query runs based on the values of SQL parameter fields. The results are then combined with an Active Server Page, which acts as a custom form handler, and returned to the Web browser for display. The search form and the Active Server Page that displays the query results are both created in the FrontPage Editor.</p>
<p>
Publishing a database on a Web site using FrontPage requires an ASP-compatible Web server, such as the Microsoft Internet Information Server family of Web servers, which consists of the Microsoft Internet Information Server (IIS) for Windows&nbsp;NT Server, the Microsoft Peer Web Services for Windows&nbsp;NT Workstation, and the Microsoft Personal Web Server for Windows&nbsp;95. Check with your server administrator or Internet Service Provider to see whether your Web server supports this technology.</p>
<h3>Importing the Database File</h3>
<p>
Before you can properly configure the Web server and workstation, you need to import your database file to your FrontPage web.</p>
<p>
<b><font face="Symbol"><span style="font-family:symbol">&#219;</span></font>&#09;To Import a Database File to a FrontPage Web</b>
<ol>
<li>
Launch the FrontPage Explorer and open the FrontPage web that is to contain your database.<br><br></li>
<li>
On the FrontPage Explorer’s <b>File</b> menu, choose <b>Import</b> to display the <b>Import File to FrontPage Web</b> dialog box.<br><br></li>
<li>
Click the <b>Add File</b> button, then point to the folder where you saved your database (for example, <i>northwind.mdb</i>).<br><br></li>
<li>
Click <b>Open</b> to add the file to the import list.<br><br></li>
<li>
Next, click <b>OK</b> to import the file to your FrontPage web.</li>
</ol>
<p>
Before proceeding, decide on a permanent location for the imported database file. Drag and drop the file to the folder in your FrontPage web where you want to store the database file.</p>
<p>
<b>Securing the Database File </b>To keep your database file from being downloaded in a Web browser, move it to its own folder in the root level of your FrontPage web. You can then secure this folder by right-clicking it in the FrontPage Explorer’s <b>Folders</b> view and choosing <b>Properties</b>, where you can deselect the <b>Allow Files to be Browsed</b> option.</p>
