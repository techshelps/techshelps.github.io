The World Wide Web is the graphical Internet service that provides a network of interactive documents and the software to access them. It is based on documents called<i> pages</i> that combine text, pictures, forms, sound, animation, and hypertext links called <i>hyperlinks</i>. To navigate the World Wide Web, users “surf” from one page to another by pointing and clicking on hyperlinks in text or graphics.</p>
<p>
The World Wide Web is many things to its millions of users. It is used as a marketplace, art gallery, library, community center, school, publishing house, and whatever else its authors, including you, create.</p>
