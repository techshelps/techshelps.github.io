<p>
Before you publish the search form and results pages you just created, you will want to make sure that the SQL query string works correctly (that is to say, the results returned in the Web browser match those displayed in Microsoft Access’ Datasheet view).</p>
<p>
To test a query, you will need to launch Microsoft Internet Explorer (or another Web browser). If you have not yet installed Internet Explorer, you can install it from the Microsoft FrontPage&nbsp;98 CD-ROM.</dt>
<p>
<b>Note </b>You cannot test a query using the FrontPage Editor’s <b>Preview</b> tab. The FrontPage Editor does not execute queries or Active Server code. They are executed only when the page is fetched by a Web browser.</p>
<p>
To test the query, browse to the page containing the search form, then enter “Seafood” into the search form. Click the <b>Submit</b> button. The results page should be displayed in the Web browser, showing the same database records that Microsoft Access returned for the same query. Return to the search form and enter “Beverages” to see different results.</p>
<p>
When the search mechanism is working properly, you can further format and customize the appearance of the search form and results pages, but remember to retain the <b>.asp</b> extension for the results page and the <b>.htm</b> extension for the page containing the search form.</p>
