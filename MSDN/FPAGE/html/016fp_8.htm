<p>
When the home page is opened in the FrontPage Editor, note the page elements that have been applied by the FrontPage theme you selected in the previous section: the page has a textured background image, a page banner with the page’s title, and a navigation bar with linked buttons pointing to the other pages in the Personal Web.</p>
<p>
To add text on the page, simply begin typing as you would in a new word processing document.</p>
<p>
<b><font face="Symbol"><span style="font-family:symbol">&#219;</span></font>&#09;To Add Text to the Home Page</b></p>
<p>
The home page of a Web site should have a greeting for your visitors (people that will “surf” to your site after it has been published on the World Wide Web).
<ol>
<li>
Type <b>Welcome to my Web site!</b> on the home page, then press ENTER.<p>
Pressing ENTER creates a new paragraph on the page.</p>
</li>
<li>
On the new line, type <b>Please make sure you take a look at the other pages at my site.</b> and then press ENTER.<p>
You can later replace this text with a personal greeting in your own words, along with a description of what your site has to offer.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>
Your page should now look like this:</p>
<p><img src="016FP05.GIF"border=0></p></font></BODY>
