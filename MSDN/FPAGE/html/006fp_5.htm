<h4><a name="thefoldersview"></a>The Folders View</h4>
<p>
To display the file and folder structure of a FrontPage web, choose the <b>Folders</b> view. In this view, you can manage files and folders much in the same way as you would in the Windows 95 (or Windows NT) Explorer.</p>
<p>
The left side of the <b>Folders</b> view, called the <b>All Folders</b> pane, shows a hierarchical list of the folders in your FrontPage web. Clicking on a folder in the <b>All Folders</b> pane displays its contents in the <b>Contents</b> pane. Using the plus (+) and minus (–) signs in the <b>All Folders</b> pane, you can expand and collapse folders to show or hide their subfolders.</p>
<p>

<p>
The <b>Contents</b> pane displays information about the individual files. Clicking on a column header sorts the list by that column; clicking the column header a second time reverses the sort order.</p>
<p>
You can right-click any file to display a shortcut menu, from which you can open, cut, copy, rename, or delete the selected file. From the shortcut menu, you can also view properties or add a web task for the selected file.</p>
<p>
To arrange files and folders, simply drag and drop them between folders using the mouse. You can drag and drop single files or any selection of files. When you move or rename files or folders, FrontPage will update any hyperlinks that point to them.</p>
