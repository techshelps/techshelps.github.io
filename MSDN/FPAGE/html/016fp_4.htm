<h2><a name="thenavigationthemesviews"></a>The Navigation and Themes Views</h2>
<p>
The <b>Navigation</b> view is the most useful view for constructing a new Web site, because it provides a useful outline of your site structure and it can automatically create navigation bars on all pages in your FrontPage web. A <i>navigation bar</i> is a page region that provides access to other pages in your FrontPage web, using textual or graphical hyperlinks. In larger Web sites, linking all of the pages together in a consistent and accurate manner could take hours of work. If you create your site structure in the <b>Navigation</b> view, FrontPage can do this work for you.</p>
<p>
You will use the <b>Themes</b> view to apply a set of professionally designed graphics to your FrontPage web. A theme consists of design elements for bullets, fonts, images, navigation bars, and other page elements. When applied, a theme gives the pages and navigation bars in a FrontPage web an attractive and consistent appearance.</p>
<p>
Later, in Lesson 3 of the FrontPage tutorial, you will learn about some of the other FrontPage Explorer views that help you organize files and folders, check and repair the hyperlinks on your pages, and remind you of tasks that must be completed before you publish your site on the World Wide Web.</p>
<p>
For a complete discussion of all FrontPage Explorer views, see “FrontPage Webs and the Microsoft FrontPage Explorer”.</p>
