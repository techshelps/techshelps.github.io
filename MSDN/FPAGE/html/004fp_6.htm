<h2>Intranets</h2>
<p>
An <i>intranet</i> is a network that exists exclusively within an organization and that is based on Internet technology. It delivers an organization’s informational resources to each member’s desktop quickly and inexpensively but protects the information from unauthorized access. Because an intranet is based on Internet technology, it can have thousands of users across many locations and still be private.</p>
<p>
An intranet can be set up inside a <i>firewall</i>, a software mechanism that blocks unwanted access to the intranet from outside while giving the users of the intranet access to the global Internet.</p>
<p>
Some of the ways organizations use intranets are:
<ul>
<li>
To give access to databases<br><br></li>
<li>
To distribute and upgrade software<br><br></li>
<li>
To distribute electronic documentation<br><br></li>
<li>
To provide a forum for discussions<br><br></li>
<li>
To offer online training<br><br></li>
<li>
To administer payroll and benefits packages</li>
</ul>
<p>
Using World Wide Web technology, an organization can make its intranet easy to use. Microsoft FrontPage is an ideal tool for creating, maintaining, and administering intranets.</p>
