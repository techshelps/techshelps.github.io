<p>
The Internet is a computer network that connects millions of computers globally and provides world-wide communications to businesses, homes, schools, and governments.</p>
<p>
The Internet has grown explosively in the 1990s. There are now more than twelve million server computers on the Internet, each providing some type of information or service. The number of users of the Internet is more difficult to measure. Since each service on the Internet is used by many people, many millions of users are currently online. The number of users and services on the Internet continues to grow as the variety of the services increases.</p>
<p>
Perhaps the most popular Internet service, the World Wide Web, has accelerated the growth of the Internet by giving it an easy to use, point and click, graphical interface. Users are attracted to the World Wide Web because it is interactive, because it is easy to use, and because it combines graphics, text, sound, and animation into a rich communications medium.</p>
