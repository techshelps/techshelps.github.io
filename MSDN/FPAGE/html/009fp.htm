<p>
On the World Wide Web, authors use images on their pages to provide information or decoration, to communicate their personal style or that of their organization, to display graphic artwork or pictures of products, and to create <i>image maps</i>, which are images containing one or more hyperlink areas.</p>
<p>
FrontPage has a complete set of tools for using images in FrontPage webs. In FrontPage, you can easily import images to your FrontPage web and insert them on pages, align them with text, create and edit image maps, and use images in page design.</p>
<p>
<img src="009fp01.gif" border=0></p>
<p>
FrontPage also includes image editing commands that let you change the appearance of your image. You can crop, rotate, and resize an image, make it black and white, give it beveled edges, and change its brightness and contrast.</p>
<p>
Along with its comprehensive set of image mapping and editing commands, FrontPage includes the Microsoft Clip Gallery, a tool for previewing and inserting clip art, pictures, sounds, video clips, and animations. If you already have the Clip Gallery on your PC, FrontPage will add images and videos designed for Web pages to it.</p>
<p>
In FrontPage, you create hyperlinks from image maps using a similar method to the one described for text hyperlinks in “Creating Hyperlinks and Bookmarks”. For a full discussion about creating hyperlinks using FrontPage, read that topic first. For a general overview of hyperlinks and URLs, see “Welcome to the World Wide Web”.</p>
