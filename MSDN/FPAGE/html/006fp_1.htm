<h2><a name="explorer"></a>What Can You Do in the FrontPage Explorer?</h2>
<p>
Here are some of the key features of the FrontPage Explorer:</p>
<p>
<b>Create FrontPage Webs </b>FrontPage includes web templates and wizards that help you create professional-looking Web sites. For example, you can create a corporate presence on the World Wide Web with the <b>Corporate Presence Wizard</b>; launch a Customer Support site with the <b>Customer Support Web</b> template; host a discussion group with the <b>Discussion Web Wizard</b>; or publish a project management web with the <b>Project Web</b> template.</p>
<p>
<b>Import Existing Web Sites </b>If you have an existing Web site, you can easily convert it to a full-featured FrontPage web with the FrontPage Explorer’s <b>Import Web Wizard</b>.</p>
<p>

<p>
In a few steps, this wizard imports your pages, images, and files, while preserving the web’s structure as well as its hyperlinks.</p>
<p>
<b>Import and Export Files </b>You can import files to your FrontPage web. You specify a folder in your file system to import its contents. You can also export files from your FrontPage web to your file system.</p>
<p>
<b>Display FrontPage Web Structure </b>You can display and maintain the files, folders, hyperlinks, and layout of a FrontPage web by selecting any of the FrontPage Explorer’s seven views. Each view gives you a different perspective of a FrontPage web, designed to assist you in maintaining FrontPage webs from their creation until their publication to a Web server.</p>
<p>
<b>Apply Shared Borders and Navigation Bars </b>In the FrontPage Explorer, you can apply one or more shared borders — page regions that are reserved for content that is to appear consistently throughout your pages. Shared borders usually contain navigation bars — hyperlinks to the other pages in the current FrontPage web. When you create a FrontPage web in the FrontPage Explorer’s <b>Navigation</b> view, FrontPage can create shared borders and navigation bars that are automatically updated whenever you add, move, or delete pages from the web’s structure.</p>
<p>
<b>Apply a Theme </b>FrontPage includes a gallery of professionally designed graphics and color schemes — called themes — that can be applied to any FrontPage web. Themes enhance the appearance of list bullets, fonts, navigation bars, horizontal lines, and page backgrounds, and they lend an attractive and consistent appearance to any FrontPage web.</p>
<p>
<b>Launch the FrontPage Editor and Other Applications </b>Double-click an HTML page in the FrontPage Explorer and it will open for editing in the FrontPage Editor. In the FrontPage Explorer, you can also associate other editors for other file types in your FrontPage web. When you double-click a file that has been associated with an editor, it will open in that editor.</p>
<p>
<b>Publish FrontPage Webs </b>When your FrontPage web is ready to be published on the World Wide Web — or on your organization’s intranet — the FrontPage Explorer’s <b>Publish</b> command transfers the pages and files to the World Wide Web or a Web server while automatically verifying the addresses of pages and the paths to your files.</p>
<p>
<b>Test and Repair Hyperlinks </b>If you use the FrontPage Explorer to rename or move a file in your FrontPage web, all hyperlink references to that file are automatically updated within the FrontPage web, including hyperlinks from Microsoft Office 97 documents. You can also verify and repair broken hyperlinks, including hyperlinks to external World Wide Web sites. In a multi-authoring environment, you can refresh hyperlinks to incorporate and view recent changes made to the FrontPage web by other authors.</p>
<p>
<b>Track Tasks </b>Using the Tasks view in the FrontPage Explorer, you can track and complete any unfinished FrontPage web tasks (such as spell-checking corrections) on all pages. Clicking a task can take you right to the page that needs work. Some tasks are generated automatically as you create and maintain a FrontPage web; you can add other tasks and assign them to other FrontPage authors.</p>
<p>
<b>Administer FrontPage Webs </b>In multi-user environments, you can protect a FrontPage web from unauthorized access by requiring a logon username and password for browsing or authoring access.</p>
