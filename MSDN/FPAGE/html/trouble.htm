<h1>Server Extensions Resource Kit Troubleshooting Guide</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>This chapter of the Server Extensions Resource Kit helps you understand common error
messages associated with the FrontPage Server Extensions. It is divided into two sections,
<a href="#NTErrors">NT issues</a> and <a href="#UNIXerrors">UNIX issues</a>.</p>

<p>Many of the error messages that are listed in this chapter can occur in many ways. This
chapter attempts to identify the most common causes of each error message. In many cases,
when FrontPage returns a standard HTML error, the recommended action is to check the error
log files of your server. These log files will often have enough detailed information to
identify the problem.</p>

<h3>Installing</h3>

<p><strong><a name="NT_UnknownIIS">IIS &#150; Unknown Server &quot;MSIIS</a>&quot;, or IIS
is not listed in Server type dropdown box </strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <strong><p></strong>This error message may be caused by a missing or out of date file:</p>
  <p>c:\Program Files\Microsoft FrontPage\version3.0\servsupp\fp30msft.dll</p>
  <p>Check for the presence and date of this file. Reinstall the FrontPage Server Extensions
  from the FrontPage 98 CD-ROM if the date is older than the other DLLs in the
  ../version3.0/servsupp directory.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>Opening a Web</h3>

<p><a name="IIS_NTLMFailed"><strong>NTLM authentication failed</strong></a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Outside of your LAN, your users will need to specify the name of the domain along with
  their user names, as in mydomain\myuserame. This will indicate that the Web server should
  use the account on the Primary Domain Controller (PDC) instead of looking for a local
  account.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a name="IIS_NTLMProxy"><strong>NTLM authentication failed, because you are connecting
to the server via a proxy server, and NTLM authentication does not work in this case. You
should either disable NTLM authentication for this server, or if the proxy server is
unnecessary, add the server to the List of Hosts without proxies in the Tools/Options
dialog.</strong></a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If NTLM is enabled and you are attempting to access a FrontPage web through a proxy
  server or firewall, you will be unable to access the web. To gain access, the Password
  Authentication setting should be set to Basic (Clear Text) in the Internet Service
  Manager. If some users who are accessing the web require NTLM and are not using a proxy
  server, select NTLM in addition to Basic authentication. FrontPage will attempt to connect
  using NTLM authentication and then degrade to using Basic authentication when necessary.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a name="IIS_OpenNoPass"><strong>IIS - Can open web without Username/Password prompt</strong></a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If a FrontPage Web can be accessed without being prompted for a username and password,
  consider the following: <ul>
    <li>If you are using NT Challenge/Response and are already logged into your machine as an
      administrator, FrontPage will automatically use your same password. To troubleshoot if
      this is the case, try to open a FrontPage Web from a client PC. You should now be prompted
      with the username/password dialog box.</li>
    <li>The IUSR_Machine_Name or INTERACTIVE account may have been given rx permission to the
      _vti_bin/_vti_aut directory. If you have applied this high a level of permissions to the
      subdirectories of _vti_bin, FrontPage Explorer will never prompt you to identify yourself
      when you log on, and the logon account will be regarded as the Internet guest. If this is
      the case, remove permissions for all but the author and administrator groups.</li>
    <li>If you are running on a FAT file system, you will not be able to limit access to your
      FrontPage web. Anyone using the FrontPage client will be able to access your web. You need
      to re-install IIS on an NTLM partition.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p><a name="IIS_CannotOpen"><strong>IIS &#150; Cannot open web, Username/Password prompt
continually displayed</strong>.</a> </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This error message can be caused by one of the following: <ul>
    <li>You are using an incorrect username/password combination </li>
    <li>There is a file/directory permissions problem. If this is a file/directory permissions
      problem, perhaps the account doesn't have rx permission to the _vti_aut or _vti_adm
      directory (depending on whether you are prompted for authoring permissions or
      administrator permissions). </li>
    <li>If this is a new NT user account, make sure that in the User Properties of the NT User
      Manager, the &quot;User Must Change Password at Next Logon&quot; option is not checked.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p><a name="IIS_ServerBusy"><strong>Server error: Web Server busy. Please try again.</strong></a></p>

<blockquote>

<p><strong><a name="NT_NscpOpen">Netscape &#150; Can open web without Username/Password
prompt</a> </strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For the Netscape server, this error message is usually caused by access control not

  configuration files (for access control) according to the parameters listed below: <ol
  type="a">

<h3>Http Errors</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>If you receive an http error message with a status code, it is important to note that
  the codes are industry standards and are specified in the HTML 3.2 specification. 400
  series messages indicate that the problem originates on the client while 500 series
  messages indicate that the problem originates on the server.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong><a name="NT_Http500">500</a> - Server Error This server has encountered an
internal error which prevents it from fulfilling your request. The most likely cause is a
misconfiguration. Please ask the administrator to look for messages in the server's error
log.</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Possible corrections: <ul>
    <li>Convert the default server to a virtual server in the Internet Service Manager. You can
      determine if the server is virtual in the FrontPage Server Administrator. If the default
      server shows just the port numbers (80 and 443) and not the TCP/IP address, it is not
      virtual. <p>To correct this problem, uninstall the Server Extensions from the default
      server only. Next run IIS Internet Service Manager and, under the <b>Directories</b> tab,
      select the directory for the default service. Select <b>Edit Properties</b>, mark the <b>Virtual
      Server</b> box, supply the proper TCP/IP address and click <b>Apply</b>. Next, stop and
      restart your server and reinstall the FrontPage Server Extensions on the new virtual
      server.</p>

<p><strong><a name="NT_Http501">501 </a>- HTTP/1.0 501 Not Supported</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This error message indicates that the target server does not have the FrontPage Server
  Extensions installed. On the server, use the FrontPage Server Administrator to install the
  Server Extensions.</p>
  <p>This error can also occur when attempting to run a CGI script. If this is the case, the
  501 error will be Unsupported. Make sure that the CGI-bin directory is marked as
  Executable in the FrontPage Explorer&#146;s Directory Properties dialog box.</p>

<h3>Installing</h3>

<p><strong><a name="UNIX_ServiceLock">Server error: Cannot open file

<a name="UNIX_MagnusLock">Server error: Cannot open file
&quot;usr/local/directory_name/config/magnus.lck&quot; for writing.</strong></a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>During installation of the Server Extensions, FrontPage attempts to create a zero byte
  lock file (.lck) in the named directory so that no changes can be made by other users or
  programs on the system. When the installation program cannot open this file, it is usually
  because the lock file has not been successfully created. This can happen because the
  permissions for the directory prevent the installation program from writing to that
  directory. For a listing of the correct permissions for this directory, see Files and
  Permissions for UNIX Web Servers.</p>

<h3>FAQ&#146;s &#150; UNIX</h3>

<p><a name="UNIX_Ftp"><strong>When using FTP to transfer FrontPage Web files to the

<blockquote>
  <strong><p></strong>FrontPage&#146;s Publish command utilizes HTTP to communicate with the
  web server. The command will not transfer the local FrontPage Server Extension files to
  the target server. When using an FTP application, it is important to transfer <strong>only</strong>
  the content files from the originating web server. Do not FTP any _vti _* directories. If
  these directories or files are transferred, they will overwrite the existing files on the
  target server. FrontPage Server Extensions should only be installed using the <a
