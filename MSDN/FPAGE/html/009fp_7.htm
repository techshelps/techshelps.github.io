<h3>Resampling an Image</h3>
<p>
You resample an image using the <b>Resample</b> command on the Image toolbar. Resampling an image changes the file size of the image to match the current size in which it is displayed. You can resample an image to a larger or smaller size.</p>
<p>
Before you select <b>Resample</b>, resize the image by selecting one of its resizing handles and stretching or shrinking it. Then click the <b>Resample</b> button to resample the image at the new size.</p>
<p>

<p>
<b>What does resizing without resampling do? </b>Although you can click an image and drag one of its selection handles to resize it, doing this does not change the underlying file size of the image. It only changes the HTML tags that tell Web browsers how to display it. For example, if you have a large image that you drag to a small size, it will be displayed at the smaller size by Web browsers but it will not take less time to load, because its underlying representation has not changed. To improve download performance, you must drag the image to a smaller size and then resample it at the smaller size.</p>
