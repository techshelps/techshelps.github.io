<h4>What is a URL?</h4>
<p>
On the World Wide Web, the key component of a hyperlink is its <i>Uniform Resource Locator</i>, or <i>URL</i>. A URL is text that supplies the Internet address of a resource on the World Wide Web, along with the protocol by which the resource is accessed, such as http://www.microsoft.com/. The most common URL type is <b>http</b>, which gives the Internet address of a World Wide Web page. Some other URL types are <b>mailto</b>, which sends electronic mail, and <b>file</b>, which indicates that the file is in the file system of a computer on the network. You can easily create any type of URL using FrontPage.</p>

<p>
If you get an idea for a new page while editing another page in the FrontPage Editor, you can create a hyperlink to the new page before you have created it. To do this, click the <b>New Page</b> button in the <b>Create Hyperlink</b> dialog box, then select a page template or wizard in the <b>New Page</b> dialog box and click <b>OK</b>. The FrontPage Editor creates a new page and puts a hyperlink to it in the page that you were editing. To postpone editing the new page, choose <b>Just add web task</b> in the <b>New Page</b> dialog box. The FrontPage Editor closes the new page, creates a hyperlink to it, and adds a task to the <b>Tasks</b> list in the FrontPage Explorer to edit the page later.</p>
<p>
Along with creating World Wide Web (http) hyperlinks in the <b>Create Hyperlink</b> dialog box, you can easily create other types of hyperlinks:</p>

<p>
mailto<b> button</b>
<ul>
<li>
You can create <b>mailto</b> hyperlinks in the <b>Create Hyperlink</b> dialog box by clicking the <b>mailto</b> button and typing an e-mail address. When a user follows a <b>mailto</b> hyperlink in your FrontPage web, the Web browser will prompt the user for a message and send the message to the e-mail address specified in the hyperlink. Not all Web browsers support <b>mailto</b> URLs.<p>

</ul>
<p>
File <b>button</b>
<ul>
<li>
You can create <b>file</b> hyperlinks in <b>Create Hyperlink</b> dialog box by clicking the <b>File</b> button. This displays the standard <b>Select File</b> dialog box. Locate the file in your file system and click <b>OK</b>. FrontPage creates a hyperlink to the file you selected. Note that file hyperlinks in a published FrontPage web will be relative to the file system on the Web browser’s computer. This will make your FrontPage web less portable, because it is unlikely that the same file will exist on computers of all users that browse your FrontPage web.<br><br></li>
<li>
You can create any type of URL by typing it directly into the <b>URL</b> field of the <b>Create Hyperlink</b> dialog box.</li>
