<h2>The Tasks View</h2>
<p>
The <b>Tasks</b> view displays the list of all outstanding tasks associated with a FrontPage web. Tasks are items that need your attention before you publish a FrontPage web.</p>
<p>
In the previous exercises, you added tasks to a list when you deferred certain actions. For example, when you checked the spelling of the pages in your FrontPage web, you chose to add a new task for each page containing misspellings. By adding tasks to the list, you can complete corrections all at once.</p>

<p>
If you are working in a web development environment, such as an intranet, the <b>Tasks</b> view makes it easy to track tasks and assign them to the correct authors.</p>
<p>

The task list is displayed.</p>
</li>
<li>
In the task list, click the <b>Modified Date</b> column label.<p>
The list is sorted by the date the tasks were modified.</p>
<p>
You can sort tasks by <b>Status</b>, <b>Task</b>, <b>Assigned To</b>, <b>Priority</b>, <b>Linked To</b>, <b>Modified Date</b>, and <b>Description</b>.</p>
</li>
<li>
Find the first task on the list that reads “Fix Misspelled Words” and double-click that task to open it.<p>
The <b>Task Details</b> dialog box is displayed. This dialog box provides a summary of the task you’re viewing. You can set the priority of the task, assign it to another FrontPage author on your network, or complete the task and remove it from the list.</p>
</li>
<li>
In the <b>Task Details</b> dialog box, click <b>Do Task</b>.<p>
The FrontPage Editor is displayed and the first misspelled word is highlighted.</p>
</li>
<li>
In the FrontPage Editor, correct the spelling on the page, then save and close the page.</li>
</ol>
<p>
Although it is not required that you complete every task before publishing your FrontPage web, it is a good idea to review this list when you are finished making changes to your FrontPage web. The <b>Tasks</b> view helps you manage your FrontPage web by flagging important reminders for you.</p>
