<p>
Every item on a page has <i>properties</i> that are encoded in the HTML that FrontPage generates to describe the item. Some items’ properties are used by Web browsers to determine how to display them. For example, a character has font properties that control its size and font style, and a paragraph has properties that control its alignment on the page.</p>
<p>
Properties do not all control the appearance of items. For example, a form has a property that specifies how it will be processed, and an image has a property that assigns it a default hyperlink.</p>
<p>
In the FrontPage Editor, you edit any item’s properties in its <i>properties dialog box</i>. For example, you can edit an image’s properties in the <b>Image Properties</b> dialog box or a <b>Radio Button</b> form field’s properties in the <b>Radio Button Properties</b> dialog box. To open an item’s properties dialog box, select the item and press ALT+ENTER. You can also open a selected item’s properties dialog box from the shortcut menu. For example, when you select a <b>Radio Button</b> field, the <b>Form Field Properties</b> command appears in the <b>Radio Button</b>’s shortcut menu.</p>
<p>
Because of the way HTML is designed, an item you see on the page is often part of other larger items. For example, a character in a table is a member of a paragraph, a table cell, a table, and a page. In the FrontPage Editor, you can view a list of all the relevant properties dialog boxes for a selected item by clicking the right mouse button to open its shortcut menu.</p>
<p>
In FrontPage 98, every page element’s properties dialog box has a <b>Style</b> button that opens a <b>Style</b> dialog box. The <b>Style</b> dialog box lets you assign <i>cascading style sheet </i>attributes to any page element. Cascading style sheets lets authors of HTML documents have more precise control over a page element’s indentation, colors, alignment, spacing, and other properties.</p>
<p>
Note that cascading style sheets are not supported by all Web browsers. If a Web browser does not recognize a cascading style sheet attribute it will ignore it. Cascading style sheets will be supported in the newest versions of the Microsoft Internet Explorer and Netscape browsers.</p>
