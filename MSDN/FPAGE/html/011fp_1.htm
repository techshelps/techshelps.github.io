<h2><a name="creatingforms"></a>Creating Forms</h2>
<p>
You can put a form field anywhere on the page where you can type text. On the <b>Insert</b> menu select <b>Form Field</b> and click the type of form field that you want. You can also create form fields using the Forms toolbar:</p>
<p>
In FrontPage, you make a new form by creating a form field anywhere on the page outside of other forms. (To help you see the boundaries of forms, the FrontPage Editor can display them as dotted lines.)</p>
<p>
To create a form, do the following:
<ul>
<li>
Insert the fields<br><br></li>
<li>
Lay out the form<br><br></li>
<li>
Set the properties of each field.</li>
</ul>
<p>
You lay out a form the way you lay out text. To label a field, click to the left of the field and start typing: the field moves to the right to make room for the text. Press Enter to create a new line in a form. You can align the form fields using the <b>Align</b> <b>Left</b>, <b>Center</b>, and <b>Align Right</b> commands on the FrontPage Editor’s standard toolbar. To control a form’s layout more precisely, insert a table inside a form’s boundaries and use it to control the placement of form fields and labels.</p>
<p>
Form fields have properties, including <b>Width in Characters</b>, which specifies the width of a text box field, <b>Initial Value</b>, which specifies the contents of a field when a user first sees it, and <b>Initial State</b>, which specifies whether some types of fields are selected by default. Each type of form field has a unique properties dialog box, in which you configure it. To open a field’s properties dialog box, double-click the field.</p>
<p>
When you create a new form, FrontPage adds two Push Button fields to the form, one labeled “Submit” and the other labeled “Reset.”
<ul>
<li>
The <i>submit button</i> is automatically associated with FrontPage’s default form handler. When a user fills in the form in a Web browser and clicks this button, this form handler processes the information in the form. For a description of the default FrontPage form handler, see “Processing Forms”. For a description of assigning a different form handler to a form, see “Processing Forms”.<br><br></li>
<li>
The <i>reset button</i> resets the contents of the form’s fields to their initial values.</li>
</ul>
