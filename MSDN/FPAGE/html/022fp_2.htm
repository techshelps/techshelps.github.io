<p>
With the help of your server administrator or Internet Service Provider, you must first define the ODBC Data Source Name (DSN) for the database you will use for queries in a Web browser. This name will also be defined on the workstation on which you will create the Active Server Pages, and it will be required by the FrontPage Editor’s Database Region Wizard when you create the results page.</p>
<p>
If you are hosting your FrontPage web through an Internet Service Provider (ISP), you must first request ODBC database service and have a Data Source Name configured on the ISP’s Web server. You may need to contact your ISP to determine whether database service is available and whether there is an additional fee for its use.</p>
<p>
If database service is available on your Web server, you will need to tell your ISP the following information:
<ul>
<li>
the exact URL to the database file on your Web site<br><br></li>
<li>
the type of database you are using (for example, Microsoft Access, Microsoft FoxPro, etc.)<br><br></li>
<li>
the requested name of the DSN</li>
</ul>
<p>
Your ISP will configure the Web server and then notify you with the final name to use as your DSN.</p>
<p>
<b>If Your ISP Does Not Support Active Server Pages </b>If your ISP’s Web server does not support Active Server Pages, you will not be able to use the database features FrontPage 98 offers. To help you choose from a comprehensive directory of Internet Service Providers who offer Web servers that support Active Server Pages, visit the FrontPage home page on the World Wide Web, at http://www.microsoft.com/frontpage.</p>
<p>
If you are a server administrator or ISP who needs to define a DSN on a server, use the definition procedure on the following page. In this case, perform the steps on the server computer, not on the workstation.</p>
