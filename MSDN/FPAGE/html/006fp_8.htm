<h4>Hyperlinks View</h4>
<p>
This view displays the hyperlinks connecting your pages and files, and a hierarchical list of the pages in your FrontPage web — starting with the home page. The title of each page is displayed to the right of each page icon.</p>
<p>
When you click a file or page in the left pane (the <i>All Pages pane</i>), it becomes the center of the right pane (the <i>Hyperlinks pane</i>). All of the pages and files that are the targets of the page’s hyperlinks are displayed to the right of the page or file, and the hyperlinks are drawn as arrows to the pages or files. If a page or other document that is the target of a hyperlink has a plus sign next to it, you can expand the view and display the hyperlinks from it by clicking the plus sign. Clicking a minus sign collapses the view of a page or document’s hyperlinks.</p>
<p>
The <b>Hyperlinks</b> pane also indicates the images on a page and the files that are included on a page by displaying a line between the page and the included images or files.</p>

<p>
<b>Hyperlink Details </b>You can obtain more information about a hyperlink by pointing to it in the <b>Hyperlinks</b> pane of the <b>Hyperlinks</b> view. A tool tip will appear, which describes the type of the hyperlink (such as “Hyperlinks for ‘Default.htm’” or “Broken Hyperlink”).</p>
