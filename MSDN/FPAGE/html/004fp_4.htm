<h2>Servers and Clients</h2>
<p>
Every computer program that communicates on the Internet is either a server or a client.</p>
<p>
A <i>server </i>offers a service to other machines on the network. For example, a <i>file server</i> contains files of interest to users around the network — the service it offers is the storage and retrieval of the files. There are thousands of file servers on the Internet, some offering files of a particular type, such as artwork (a file can contain an image), weather maps, or tourism information.</p>
<p>
A <i>client</i> requests a service from a server. Most services are designed so that specialized client software must be running to interact with the server. For example, to get a file from a file server, a client program on your machine must format and send the request to a program running on the server. The server program locates the file on the server machine and sends a copy of it back to the client program which saves it or opens it for immediate use. The client and the server use a common method for communicating and for passing the file from one machine to another, called a <i>protocol</i>.</p>
