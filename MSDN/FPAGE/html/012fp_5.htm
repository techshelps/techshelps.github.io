<h3>Secure Sockets Layer Support</h3>
<p>
<i>Secure Sockets Layer</i> (SSL) allows software to communicate with Web servers in a secure, encrypted manner. Many Web sites that conduct electronic commerce use SSL to securely transmit credit card numbers from a customer’s Web browser to the Web server.</p>
<p>
If you are creating a FrontPage web on a Web server that supports SSL, then FrontPage can take advantage of SSL in the following ways:
<ul>
<li>
To communicate securely between your computer and the Web server. This means that no one will be able to intercept and read the information you are sending back and forth between your computer and the Web server.<br><br></li>
<li>
To create secure hyperlinks in Web pages. Secure hyperlinks begin with https:// instead of the standard http://</li>
</ul>
<p>
To determine if you are running against a Web server that supports SSL, ask the Web server’s administrator or webmaster. If you are running against one of the following Web servers, then you can probably take advantage of SSL: Microsoft Internet Information Server, Netscape Commerce Server, Netscape Enterprise Server, and O’Reilly WebSite Professional. However, since your Web server administrator or webmaster may have disabled SSL support, you should check to be sure.</p>
<p>
If you’re not sure if you are running a Web server that supports SSL and you have no one to ask, you can try starting the FrontPage Explorer and creating a new blank web. Give the FrontPage web a name, and check the box labeled “Connect Using SSL.” If you do not receive an error message, then SSL is available.</p>
