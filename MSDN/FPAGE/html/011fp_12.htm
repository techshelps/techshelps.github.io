<h2><a name="processingforms"></a>Processing Forms</h2>
<p>
A form is processed by a <i>form handler </i>that is associated with the form. The way a form handler processes a form depends on the form handler’s design. Some form handlers enter form field data into a database. Others do some processing and generate HTML that the Web browser displays. For example, a form that is a mathematical calculator could accept numbers from a user and send them to a form handler which calculates a result, formats it in HTML, and sends it back to a Web browser for display.</p>
<p>
FrontPage includes a set of form handlers that process forms for most common uses. You can use FrontPage form handlers to collect information from your form and store it in a variety of formats, register users for your FrontPage web, or support a discussion group on your web. Advanced users can create their own form handlers and assign them to forms in FrontPage.</p>
<p>
When you create a form, FrontPage assigns its default form handler to your form. This general purpose form handler saves the form’s information to a file in your FrontPage web. See “Processing Forms”, for details.</p>
<p>
FrontPage also includes a set of advanced FrontPage form handlers. You select one of these form handlers using the <b>Form Properties</b> dialog box. Along with the default form handler, you can assign the following FrontPage form handlers to a form:
<ul>
<li>
<i>Registration Form Handler</i>, to register users so that they can access a service implemented as a Web site.<br><br></li>
<li>
<i>Discussion Form Handler</i>, to support participation in an online discussion.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Note that FrontPage automatically saves form results only on Web servers containing the FrontPage Server Extensions. These extensions are available for most popular Web servers at http://www.microsoft.com.</p>
<p>
If you do not want to use one of the FrontPage form handlers, you can assign a custom form handler that you have created. FrontPage supports custom form handlers that have been created using one of the following methods:
<ul>
<li>
Internet Server Application Program Interface (ISAPI)<br><br></li>
<li>
Netscape Server Application Program Interface (NSAPI)<br><br></li>
<li>
Common Gateway Interface (CGI)<br><br></li>
<li>
Active Server Page (ASP)</li>
</ul>
<p>
You use the <b>Form Properties</b> dialog box to change the settings of your current form handler or to change form handlers. To open this dialog box, right-click anywhere in the form and choose <b>Form Properties</b> from the shortcut menu.</p>
<p>
When <b>Send</b> <b>to</b> is selected in the <b>Form Properties</b> dialog box, the default form handler is in use and the results file, which is the file that will contain the saved form information, is displayed in the <b>File Name</b> field. To send form information in e-mail, type the e-mail address in the <b>E-mail Address</b> field. To select an advanced form handler, click <b>Send to other</b> and choose the form handler from the drop-down list.</p>
<p>
To configure the form handler, click <b>Options</b>. This opens the configuration dialog box for the form handler you selected. The default form handler’s configuration dialog box is called <b>Options for Saving Results of Form</b>.</p>
