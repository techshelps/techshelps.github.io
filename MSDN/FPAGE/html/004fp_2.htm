<h2><a name="tcpip"></a>TCP/IP</h2>
<p>
TCP/IP is the software used on the Internet to pass information from machine to machine and from network to network. It contains two components, Internet Protocol (IP) and Transmission Control Protocol (TCP).</p>
<p>
IP breaks up information and puts it into software packets that can move across networks. As long as machines on each end of the connection understand IP, they can accept packets from other computers and they can send packets along. A computer that wants to send information on the Internet uses IP to divide the information into packets. A computer that receives information reassembles it from the packets it receives.</p>
<p>
TCP works with the IP protocol to guarantee that information is transmitted correctly across the Internet. The TCP software makes sure that the packets of information get properly reassembled when they reach their Internet destination. TCP also requests that lost or damaged packets be resent to the destination computer.</p>
