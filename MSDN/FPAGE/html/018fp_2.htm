<h2><a name="thefoldersview"></a>The Folders View</h2>
<p>
In Lesson 1, you learned how to use the <b>Navigation</b> view to create the structure of the Personal Web and how to preview and apply professional-looking graphics using the <b>Themes</b> view.</p>
<p>
Now that the Personal Web has been created, and you have several pages and files in your web, you will use some of the other FrontPage Explorer views to help you organize your FrontPage web.</p>
<p>
You can safely and easily rearrange the pages and files in your FrontPage web using the <b>Folders</b> view, a split-screen display of the files in your FrontPage web. Similar to the Windows&nbsp;95 (or Windows&nbsp;NT) Explorer, the left side, called the <b>All Folders</b> pane, shows a hierarchical list of the folders in your FrontPage web. Clicking on a folder in the <b>All Folders</b> pane displays its contents on the right side, called the <b>Contents</b> pane.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
In the following steps, you will group the Personal Web’s image files and move them to the “images” folder.</p>
<p><img src="018fp01.gif" border=0></p>
Normally, moving pages and files from one folder to another would break the hyperlinks between your pages. However, if you move files in the FrontPage Explorer’s <b>Folders</b> view, FrontPage updates every page and hyperlink in your FrontPage web to track the new location of files and folders that have been moved.</p>
<p>
<b><font face="Symbol"><span style="font-family:symbol">&#219;</span></font>&#09;To Move Image Files to the Images Folder</b>
<ol>
<li>
Open the Personal Web you created for this tutorial.<p>
</p>
<p><img src="fpfoldvu.gif" border=0></p>
Folders<b> button</b></p>
</li>
<li>
On the <b>Views</b> bar in the FrontPage Explorer, click the <b>Folders</b> button.<br><br></li>
<li>
In the <b>All Folders</b> pane, select the top-level folder.<br><br></li>
<li>
In the <b>Contents</b> pane, click the <b>Type</b> column label.<p>
Clicking on a column label sorts the files in the Contents pane by that criteria. The first click on a column label sorts the list in ascending order; clicking it a second time sorts it in descending order.</p>
<p>
The list of files is now grouped by file type, with all GIF images at the top, followed by the HTM files (pages) below.</p>
</li>
<li>
In the <b>Contents</b><u> </u>pane, click the first GIF image file at the top of the list to select it.<br><br></li>
<li>
Next, while holding down the SHIFT key on your keyboard, click the last GIF image file in the list.<p>
</p>
<p><img src="018fp02.gif" border=0></p>
In the <b>Folders</b> view, FrontPage supports all standard Windows selection shortcuts, such as SHIFT+CLICK for selecting ranges of files, and CTRL+CLICK for selecting noncontiguous files.</p>
</li>
<li>
Click and hold the right mouse button while the pointer is over any of the selected GIF files.<br><br></li>
<li>
Next, drag the pointer over to the “images” folder in the <b>All Folders</b> pane.<p>
</p>
<p><img src="018fp03.gif" border=0></p></li>
<li>
When the “images” folder is selected, release the mouse button and choose <b>Move Here</b> from the shortcut menu.<p>
FrontPage moves the selected GIF image files to the “images” folder and automatically updates all hyperlinks to the files in the current FrontPage web.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>
Similarly, you can choose to group sound files, movie clips, and other types of files in their own folders. You can create new folders in the <b>Folders</b> view as needed.</p>
<p>
<b><font face="Symbol"><span style="font-family:symbol">&#219;</span></font>&#09;To Create a New Folder</b>
<ol>
<li>
In the <b>All Folders</b> pane of the <b>Folders</b> view, click the folder in which you want to create a new subfolder.<p>
Folders can be expanded and collapsed in the <b>All Folders</b> pane to bring their subfolders into view. Click the plus (+) and minus (–) signs next to a folder’s name to display or hide its subfolders.</p>
</li>
<li>
On the <b>File</b> menu, point to <b>New</b> and then click <b>Folder</b>.<p>
FrontPage creates a new folder with a temporary name.</p>
</li>
<li>
While the folder’s temporary name (“New_Folder”) is selected, type a new name for the folder, then press ENTER.<p>
The new folder is renamed and you can now drag and drop files into it.</p>
</li>
</ol>
