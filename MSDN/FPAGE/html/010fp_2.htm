<h2>Banner Ad Manager</h2>
<p>
Banner ads are dynamic “billboards” that display series of images. As each new image in the series is displayed, a visual <i>transition effect</i> is applied by the Web browser, so that the transition from one image to the next occurs seamlessly. You can associate a hyperlink with a banner ad.</p>
<p>
For example, you can use a banner ad to generate interest in a service on the World Wide Web, and invite the user to learn more about the service by clicking on the ad. Even if you do not associate a hyperlink with a banner ad, you can use it to design a compelling visual presentation on your page.</p>
<p>
You create a banner ad on the <b>Insert</b> menu by pointing to <b>Active Elements</b> and then clicking <b>Banner Ad Manager</b>. In the <b>Banner Ad Manager</b> dialog box, you supply a series of images, the amount of time to display each image, and a hyperlink, and you select the type of transition effect. The <b>Banner Ad Manager</b> dialog box has controls for adding images to the presentation, removing them, and rearranging their order.</p>
<p>
The best way to select the right transition effect for a banner ad is to create one and preview it, trying various effects until one matches your needs. To preview a banner ad, choose <b>Preview in Browser</b> on the FrontPage Editor’s <b>File</b> menu.</p>
