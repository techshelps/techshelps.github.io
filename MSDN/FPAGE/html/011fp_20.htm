<h2>Using Forms and Form Fields</h2>
<p>
Here are some commonly used FrontPage form and form field procedures. For a full set of FrontPage procedures, see “Creating and Configuring Forms” and “Creating and Editing Fields” in the <b>Contents</b> tab of the Microsoft FrontPage online Help system.</p>
<p>
<b><font face="Symbol"><span style="font-family:symbol">&#219;</span></font>&#09;To Create a Form</b></p>
<p>
In the FrontPage Editor, you can create a new form anywhere on a page outside of an existing form.
<ul>
<li>
At the insertion point, create any form field. On the <b>Insert</b> menu select <b>Form Field</b> and select the type of field that you want.<p>
FrontPage creates a new form containing the field that you selected and two Push Button fields, one for submitting the form and one for resetting it. If the field you created was a Push Button field, FrontPage does not add the additional fields.</p>
<p>
New forms are assigned the FrontPage default form handler.</p>
