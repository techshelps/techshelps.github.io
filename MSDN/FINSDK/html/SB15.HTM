<H2>Introduction  </H2><P>Financial Institutions choosing to offer Online Services with MS Money may take part in a unique branding program offered by Microsoft.  This program offers partner financial institutions a flexible and dynamic way to maintain and enhance their financial services, while building a strong identity with their online customers. This program allows the institution to incorporate graphics as well as other information—such as a welcome message or important phone numbers specific to your institution—into the customer's customized view of Microsoft Money.</P>
<P>The Branding Toolkit has been provided with the OFC SDK so that developers and product managers may have access to this information during the server development process.</P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
