<H3>Active Statement file format FAQ</H3><P>This section contains some of the questions that are frequently asked about the OFC format of the Active Statement file.</P>
<UL><LI>Q:  How are FITIDs assigned and how is this identifier used in Money? </LI><LI>A:  The FITID stands for Financial Institution transaction identifier and is expected to be assigned by the Financial Institution to each statement detail item.  Money stores this ID with the transaction when it is imported.  On subsequent calls, if these transactions are imported again for some reason, Money will be able to ensure that duplicate transactions are not entered in the account register by associating the duplicate transactions with the FITID.  For this reason, these IDs are very important as they ensure the users perception of accurate financial data.</LI><LI>Q:  How are the SIC codes in the OFC specification used in Money?</LI><LI>A:  Money uses SIC codes to determine default categories.  If a SIC code has been included for a transaction in the STMTTRN record, Money will use the default category listed in the specification when presenting the user with the transaction during statement reconciliation. If a SIC code is not present in the STMTTRN record, Money will simply not offer a default category.  If transactions have been previously downloaded for the same Payee and the user has already specified a category for the Payee, then the SIC code will be ignored.  </LI><LI>Q:  How is the TRNTYPE in the STMTTRN used by Money?</LI><LI>A:  In Money 97, the TRNTYPE may be used to offer the user a default category during statement reconciliation.  If the TRNTYPE is Transfer, Service Charge or Interest, Money will offer those as standard categories  If transactions have been previously downloaded for the same Payee and the user has already specified a category for the Payee, then the TRNTYPE will be ignored.  </LI></UL></FONT></BODY></HTML>
