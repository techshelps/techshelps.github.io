<H2>What is Active Statement Technology? </H2><P>Active Statement Technology refers to a mechanism that Financial Institutions may use to deliver transaction history (or statement data) from Internet banking websites to customers who are using Microsoft Money 97.  Active Statements are delivered to the Money client via a file that is created using the OFC data format.  The Active Statement file is typically delivered to the user via the banks web site.</P>
<P>Microsoft Money allows the user to read the Active Statement file that has been downloaded,  reconciling each transaction and allowing the user to assign categories to each transaction as required.  In some cases Money will also attempt to intelligently assign default categories to transactions (refer to description of SIC codes below).</P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
