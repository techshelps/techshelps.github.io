<H2>MS Money Branding Toolkit</H2><P>Branding of Microsoft Money is accomplished through online access to a remote branding server managed and supported by Microsoft. This server is a centralized storage place for graphics (bitmaps) and other types of files that Money uses to customize the customer's interface. When customers install the online services of Money, the branding graphics are accessed and downloaded. It all happens automatically and is transparent to the user. The Financial Institution's branding graphics are displayed from the start—from the online services setup screens that appear when customers dial in to add online functionality, to the ongoing services they access from your institution.</P>
<P>The purpose of Branding Toolkit is to show you how graphics and text files are used in the branded Microsoft Money product and its setup, and to provide information that will help in preparing files for delivery to Microsoft. </P>
