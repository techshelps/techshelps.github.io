<H2>Active Statement File Format</H2><P>The Active Statement file is created using the OFC data format.  The Active Statement file leverages the OFC File Import record definition called the Account Statement (ACCTSTMT) record. Refer to Chapter 15 of the <B><I>"Open Financial Connectivity and Microsoft Money"</I></B> specification, <B>version 1.0.6</B>, for complete details on the format of this record.  </P>
<P>This record is comprised of the following elements:</P>
<UL><LI>OFC Elements common to all files created in the OFC Data Format including the Document Type Definition (DTD) of the OFC file.  </LI></UL><P><B>Note</B>    Refer to Chapter 8 of the OFC specification; "OFC Data Format Details" for more information on the DTD version.</P>
<UL><LI>The OFC Account Aggregate which is used to describe the bank and the account ID that should be the recipient of the statement data in the user's Money file.  </LI></UL><P><B>Note    </B>Refer to the definition of the ACCOUNT aggregate in Chapter 9.</P>
<UL><LI>The OFC Statement Response record which encapsulates the details of each statement transaction.  The Ledger Balance for the account is also included in the Statement Response record.  </LI></UL><P><B>Note</B>    Refer to Chapter 13 for the definition of the Statement Response record.</P>
<P>The following OFC elements are required within the Statement Response record for the definition of each statement transaction:</P>
<UL><LI>The name of the Payee for the transaction (NAME or PAYEE)</LI><LI>The date the transaction was posted (DTPOSTED)</LI><LI>The amount of the transaction (TRNAMT)</LI><LI>The type of the transaction (TRNTYPE).</LI></UL><P>The following OFC elements may optionally be included in the definition of each statement transaction.</P>
<UL><LI>The check number for the transaction (CHKNUM)</LI><LI>A Standard Industrial Code for the transaction (SIC).  Refer to FAQ below for more information on SIC codes.</LI><LI>If the transaction is a funds transfer the transaction may include the Account identifier of account that received the funds (ACCTTO)</LI><LI>A memo description of the transaction (MEMO)</LI><LI>A unique identifier for the transaction called a Financial Institution ID (FITID).  This identifier is used to uniquely identify the transaction in the user's Money file.</LI></UL><P><B>Note</B>    While the FITID element is optional in the format it is strongly recommended that this identifier be included for each transaction.  Money uses this identifier to ensure that duplicate transactions are not entered into the user's account register in the event that the user may download the same statement transaction more than once.</P>
