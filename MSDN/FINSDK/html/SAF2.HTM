<H2>Testing Active Statement Technology</H2><P>Testing your Active Statement implementation will have three main focuses:</P>
<P>that the data in the Active Statement file accurately represents the statement transactions for the user's accounts.  </P>
<P>The burden here is on the Financial Institution to validate that the correct data is being extracted and translated from the backend legacy system where the data is stored.</P>
<P>Ensuring that the Active Statement file is in the correct format so that it may be read correctly by the Money client.  </P>
<P>If the data in the Active Statement file is not formatted according to the OFC specification the user's attempt to read the statement data will fail.  Money is not forgiving in this regard, any problem with the format of the file will cause the entire file to be unreadable.  </P>
<P>In order to help in this effort.  Microsoft delivers a utility that may be used by testers to validate OFC files.  This application is called OFCVALID and can be downloaded in the download area of the OFC web site.</P>
<P>Ensuring the best experience for your Active Statement users.  </P>
<P>To validate the user experience the Money client should be used in testing as much as possible.  The Money client contains strong algorithms for reconciling the users transactions in the Active Statement file, but these algorithms rely on the data that is in the file.  Make sure your data is accurate and include FITIDs for each transaction!</P>
