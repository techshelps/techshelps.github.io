4.3 WFS_CMD_CDM_PRESENT</h5>
<p>
<b>Description</b> This command is only used for ATMs; it causes presentation of the currency. It can be used only following the WFS_CMD_CDM_DISPENSE command (with <i>bPresent</i> = FALSE).</p>
<p>
The command completes when the bills are positioned at the exit slot of the device. A service event is generated to report the user has removed the bills. If no event is received within a reasonable time period, the application should send a WFS_CMD_CDM_RETRACT to clear the bills from the exit. On devices which do not have the ability to detect when bills are taken (see WFS_INF_CDM_CAPABILITIES) the service event is generated as soon as the bills are available to the user. </p>
