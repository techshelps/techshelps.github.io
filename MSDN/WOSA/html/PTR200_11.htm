<p>
WFS_PTR_WRITESTAMP Device has stamping capability. </p>
<p>
 <i>fwExtents</i><BR>Specifies whether the device is able to measure the inserted media, as a combination of the following flags:</p>
<p>
Value Meaning</p>
<p>
WFS_PTR_EXTHORIZONTAL Device has horizontal size detection capability.</p>
<p>
WFS_PTR_EXTVERTICAL Device has vertical size detection capability.</p>
<p>
 <i>fwControl</i><BR>Specifies the manner in which media can be controlled, as a combination of the following bit flags:</p>
<p>
Value Meaning</p>
<p>
WFS_PTR_CTRLEJECT Device can eject media.</p>
<p>
WFS_PTR_CTRLPERFORATE Device can perforate media.</p>
<p>
WFS_PTR_CTRLCUT Device can cut media.</p>
<p>
WFS_PTR_CTRLSKIP Device can skip to mark.</p>
<p>

<p>
WFS_PTR_CTRLRETRACT Device can retract media</p>
<p>
WFS_PTR_CTRLSTACK Device can stack media items before ejecting as a bundle.</p>
<p>
WFS_PTR_CTRLPARTIALCUT Device can partially cut the media.</p>
<p>
WFS_PTR_CTRLALARM Device can ring a bell, beep or otherwise sound an audible alarm.</p>
<p>
WFS_PTR_CTRLATPFORWARD Capability to turn one page forward.</p>
<p>
WFS_PTR_CTRLATPBACKWARD Capability to turn one page backward.</p>
<p>
