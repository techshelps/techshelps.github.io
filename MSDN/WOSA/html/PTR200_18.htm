7.1 WFS_CMD_PTR_CONTROL_MEDIA</h5>
<p>
<b>Description </b>This command is used to control a form drawn in by the device (e.g. after reading or in case of termination of an application request).</p>
<p>
 If an eject operation is specified, it completes when the media is moved to the exit slot. A service event is generated when the media has been taken by the user.</p>
<p>
<b>Input Param</b> <code>LPDWORD  lpdwMediaControl;</code></p>

 <i>lpdwMediaControl</i><BR>Pointer to a value which specifies the manner in which the media should be handled, as a combination of the following bit-flags:</p>
