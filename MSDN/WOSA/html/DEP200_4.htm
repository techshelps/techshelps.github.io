2. Depository Unit</h4>
<p>
This specification describes the functionality of the services provided by the Depository (DEP) services under WOSA/XFS, by defining the service-specific commands that can be issued, using the<b> WFSGetInfo,</b> <b>WFSAsyncGetInfo</b>, <b>WFSExecute</b> and <b>WFSAsyncExecute</b> functions.</p>
<p>
A Depository is used for the acceptance and deposit of media into the device or terminal. There are two main types of depository: an envelope depository for the deposit of media in envelopes and a night safe depository for the deposit of bags containing bulk media.</p>
<p>
An envelope depository accepts media, prints on the media and deposits the media into a holding container or bin. Some envelope depositories offer the capability to dispense an envelope to the customer at the start of a transaction. The customer takes this envelope, fills in the deposit media, possibly inscribes it and puts it into the deposit slot. The envelope is then accepted, printed and transported into a deposit container.</p>
<p>
The envelope dispense mechanism may be part of the envelope depository device mechanism with the same entry/exit slot or it may be a separate mechanism with separate entry/exit slot.</p>
<p>
Envelopes dispensed and not taken by the customer can be retracted back into the device. When the dispenser is a separate mechanism the envelope is retracted back into the dispenser container. When the dispenser is a common mechanism the envelope is retracted into the depository container.</p>
<p>
A night safe depository normally only logs the deposit of a bag and does not print on the media.</p>
