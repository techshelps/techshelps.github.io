1.2 Strategies</h5>
<p>
The following key strategies have been adopted by the Banking Solutions Vendor Council to implement the objectives defined above:</p>
<ul>
<li>
Use the Microsoft&reg; Windows™  operating systems family as the strategic platform for client-server computing.<p>
</li>
<li>
Adopt the Windows Open Service Architecture (WOSA) family of open interfaces and associated services for the integration of Windows and Windows-based applications into enterprise computing solutions.<p>
</li>
<li>
Utilize existing WOSA elements wherever possible, defining new elements, or extensions to existing elements, only when no suitable candidate(s) exist in the evolving WOSA family that meet the needs of financial services computing.  In all cases, existing formal or de facto standards will be utilized to the maximum degree possible.<p>
</li>
<li>
Enhance WOSA with the Extensions for Financial Services to meet the special requirements of financial applications for access to services and devices.<p>
</li>
<li>
Maintain the highest possible level of compatibility of both the API and SPI specifications as the Extensions for Financial Services evolve to include new and enhanced capabilities.</li>
</ul>
<p>
WOSA comprises a family of stable, open-ended interfaces for enterprise computing environments that hides system complexities from users and application developers.  WOSA allows the integration of Windows and Windows-based applications seamlessly with all the services and enterprise capabilities that application developers and users need.  It includes such interfaces as:</p>
<ul>
<li>
Open Database Connectivity (ODBC) for standard access to databases,<p>
</li>
<li>
Messaging Application Programming Interface (MAPI) for standard access to messaging services, and<p>
</li>
<li>
communications support, including Windows SNA, RPC, and Sockets.  </li>
</ul>
<p>
Each of the elements of WOSA includes a set of Application Program Interfaces (APIs) and Service Provider Interfaces (SPIs), with associated supporting software.  The architecture of WOSA is shown below:</p>
<p>
For additional information on WOSA, see the <i>WOSA Backgrounder</i> (Microsoft part number 098-34801).  </p>
<p>
The Extensions for Financial Services extend WOSA by defining a Windows-based client-server architecture for financial applications.  The extensions (as with the other elements of WOSA) include a set of APIs and SPIs common to multiple financial applications.  </p>
<p>
The WOSA Extensions for Financial Services are planned to include specifications for access to financial peripherals (such as passbook/journal/receipt printers, magnetic card readers/writers, PIN pads, etc.), financial transaction messaging and management, as well as related services for financial networks such as network and systems management and security.  All these capabilities are specified for access from the familiar, consistent Microsoft Windows user interface and programming environments.  Whenever possible, the capabilities will be incorporated into the family of standard WOSA elements, and will utilize existing formal and de facto standards.</p>
