2.3. Cash Dispensers</h5>
<p>
<b>Class Name</b> <b>CDM</b></p>
<p>
<b>Class Identifier</b> <b>WFS_SERVICE_CLASS_CDM = 3</b></p>
<p>
The WOSA/XFS Cash Dispenser service definition applies to both Automated Teller Safes (ATS) and Automated Teller Machines (ATM).</p>
<p>
The components of an Automated Teller Safe are a cash (bills) dispenser, a transport unit, an output unit, and in some cases it also contains a coin dispenser and an alert unit.</p>
<p>
An Automated Teller Machine contains the modules for cash dispensing plus additional modules such as magnetic card reader/writer, PIN pad, terminal, etc. The modules used for cash dispensing are essentially the same as those contained in the ATS: a bill/coupon/document dispenser, a transport module, an output module, and a coin dispenser, if available. Therefore, the cash dispensing functionality of the ATS and of the ATM is included in a single service class definition, referred to in WOSA/XFS specifications as “CDM” (cash dispenser module).</p>
<p>
The implementation of the individual commands is device dependent (ATS or ATM). This is described in the documentation of each function.</p>
