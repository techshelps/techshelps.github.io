3.1 WFS_INF_IDC_STATUS</h5>
<p>
<b>Description</b> This command reports the full range of  information available, including the information that is provided either by the service provider or, if present, by any of the security modules. In addition to that, the number of cards retained is transmitted for motor driven card reader/writer (for devices of the other categories this number is always set to zero).</p>
<p>
<b>Input Param </b>None.</p>
<p>
<b>Output Param</b> <code>LPWFSIDCSTATUS lpStatus</code>;</p>

<p>
 <i>fwDevice</i><BR>Specifies the state of the ID card device as one of the following flags:</p>
<p>
Value Meaning</p>
<p>
WFS_IDC_DEVONLINE The device is present, powered on and online (i.e., operational, not busy processing a request and not in an error state).</p>
<p>
WFS_IDC_DEVOFFLINE The device is present and powered on, but offline (not operational–e.g., an operator has switched it offline).</p>
<p>
WFS_IDC_DEVPOWEROFF The device is present but powered off.</p>
<p>
WFS_IDC_DEVBUSY The device is present and is busy processing an Execute request.</p>
<p>
WFS_IDC_DEVNODEVICE There is no device connected.</p>
<p>
WFS_IDC_DEVUSERERROR The device is present but a person is preventing proper device operation. The application should suspend the device operation or remove the device from service until the service provider generates a device state change event indicating the condition of the device has changed e.g.the error is removed (WFS_IDC_DEVONLINE) or a permanent error condition has occurred (WFS_IDC_DEVHWERROR).</p>
<p>
WFS_IDC_DEVHWERROR The device is present but inoperable due to a hardware fault that prevents it from being used.</p>
<p>
 <i>fwMedia</i><BR>Specifies the state of the ID card unit as one of the following flags:</p>
<p>
Value Meaning</p>
<p>
WFS_IDC_MEDIAPRESENT Media is present in the device, not in the entering position and not jammed.</p>
<p>
WFS_IDC_MEDIANOTPRESENT Media is not present in the device and not at the entering position.</p>
<p>
WFS_IDC_MEDIAJAMMED Media is jammed in the device; operator intervention is required.</p>
<p>
WFS_IDC_MEDIANOTSUPP Capability to report media position is not supported by the device (e.g., a typical swipe reader).</p>
<p>
WFS_IDC_MEDIAUNKNOWN The media state cannot be determined with the device in its current state (e.g., the value of <i>fwDevice</i> is WFS_IDC_DEVNODEVICE, WFS_IDC_DEVPOWEROFF, WFS_IDC_DEVOFFLINE, or WFS_IDC_DEVHWERROR).</p>
<p>
WFS_IDC_MEDIAENTERING Media is at the entry/exit slot of a motorized device.</p>
<p>
 <i>fwRetainBin</i><BR>Specifies the state of the ID card unit retain bin as one of the following flags:</p>
<p>
Value Meaning</p>
<p>
WFS_IDC_RETAINBINOK The retain bin of the ID card unit is not full.</p>
<p>
WFS_IDC_RETAINBINFULL The retain bin of the ID card unit is full.</p>
<p>
WFS_IDC_RETAINBINHIGH The retain bin of the ID card unit is nearly full.</p>
<p>
WFS_IDC_RETAINNOTSUPP The ID card unit does not support retain capability.</p>
<p>
<i> fwSecurity</i><BR>Specifies the state of the security unit as one of the following flags:</p>
<p>
Value Meaning</p>
<p>
WFS_IDC_SECOPEN The security module is open and ready to process cards.</p>
<p>
WFS_IDC_SECNOTREADY The security module is not ready to process cards.</p>
<p>
WFS_IDC_SECNOTSUPP No security module is available.</p>
<p>
 <i>usCards</i><BR>The number of cards retained; applicable only to motor driven ID card units. This value is persistent (i.e., it survives power failures, opens, and closes): it is reset to zero by the WFS_CMS_IDC_RESET_COUNT command.</p>
<p>
 <i>lpszExtra</i><BR>Points to a list of vendor-specific, or any other extended, information. The information is returned as a series of &quot;<i>key=value&quot;</i> strings so that it is easily extensible by service providers. Each string is null-terminated, with the final string terminating with two null characters.</p>
<p>
<b>Error Codes</b> There are no additional error codes generated by this command.</p>
<p>
<b>Comments</b> Applications which require or expect specific information to be present in the <i>lpszExtra</i><b> </b>parameter may not be device or vendor-independent.</p>
