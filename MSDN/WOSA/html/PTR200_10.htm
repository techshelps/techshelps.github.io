<p>
WFS_PTR_MEDIAUNKNOWN The state of the print media cannot be determined with the device in its current state.</p>
<p>
WFS_PTR_MEDIANOTSUPP The capability to report the state of the print media is not supported by the device.</p>
<p>
WFS_PTR_MEDIAENTERING Media is at the entry/exit slot of the device.</p>
<p>

<p>
WFS_PTR_PAPERUNKNOWN Capability cannot be determined with device in its current state.</p>
<p>
 <i>fwToner</i><BR>Specifies the state of the print device as one of the following flags:</p>
<p>
Value Meaning</p>
<p>
WFS_PTR_TONERFULL The toner supply is full.</p>
