3.6 Closing a Session </h5>
<p>
When an application no longer requires the use of a particular service, it issues a <b>WFSClose </b>or<b> WFSAsyncClose</b> request. The WOSA/XFS subsystem then closes that session as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>
The XFS Manager calls the service provider's <b>WFPClose</b> function.<p>
</li>
<li>
The service provider schedules the request for deferred processing, and returns immediately to the XFS Manager.  Note that at this point the service handle, <i>hService</i>, is no longer valid.<p>
</li>
<li>
At some point, the service provider processes the deferred close request, communicating with the service as necessary to accomplish the request.<p>
</li>
<li>
Requests that were issued by the application before the close are executed.<p>
</li>
<li>
If the calling application has the service locked under the same <i>hService</i>, the service provider unlocks it automatically (following the standard lock policy as defined in Section 3.8).<p>
</li>
<li>
The service cleans up its administrative information (removes <b>WFSRegister</b> entries etc.).</li>
</ul>
<p>
If the WOSA/XFS subsystem loses connection to an application, it closes the session as described above, and:</p>
<ul>
<li>
An “application disconnect” event (SYSTEM_EVENT class) is generated.<p>
</li>
<li>
Since messages can no longer be posted to the application, any command completion and event notification messages from this service for the application are converted to “undeliverable message” events (SYSTEM_EVENT class).</li>
</ul>
<p>
Note that it is required that some application have registered for system events, or these events are effectively not reported. </p>
