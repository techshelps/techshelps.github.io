2.1. Printers</h5>
<p>
<b>Class Name</b> <b>PTR</b></p>
<p>
<b>Class Identifier</b> <b>WFS_SERVICE_CLASS_PTR = 1</b></p>
<p>
The WOSA/XFS printer service defines and supports four types of banking printers through a common interface:</p>
<p>
<FONT FACE="Symbol">&#183;</FONT><b> Receipt Printer</b></p>
<p>
The receipt printer is used to print cut sheet documents. It may or may not require insert or eject operations, and often includes an operator identification device, e.g., Teller A and Teller B lights, for shared operation.</p>
<p>
<FONT FACE="Symbol">&#183;</FONT><b> Journal Printer</b></p>
<p>
The journal is a continuous form device used to record a hardcopy audit trail of transactions, and for certain report printing requirements.</p>
<p>
<FONT FACE="Symbol">&#183;</FONT><b> Passbook Printer</b></p>
<p>
The passbook device is physically and functionally the most complex printer. The WOSA/XFS definition supports automatic positioning of the book, as well as read/write capability for an optional integrated magnetic stripe. The implementation also manages the book geometry - i.e. the margins and centrefolds - presenting the simplest possible application interface while delivering the full range of functionality.</p>
<p>
<FONT FACE="Symbol">&#183;</FONT><b> Document Printer</b></p>
<p>
Document printing is similar to receipt printing -- a set of fields are positioned on an inserted sheet of paper -- but the focus is on full-size forms. It should be noted that the WOSA/XFS environment only implements the printing of text fields from the application. The electronic printing of the form image itself is not supported; but can be delivered as an added-value extension by the vendor.</p>
<p>
Additional hardware components, like scanners, stripe readers, OCR readers, and stamps, normally attached directly to the printer are also controlled through this interface. </p>
