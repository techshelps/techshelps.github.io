1.  Introduction</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<b>This is Revision 1.11 of the service class specifications for check readers and scanners; part of the Windows Open Services Architecture, Extensions for Financial Services (WOSA/XFS).  The other relevant specifications are the overall API/SPI specification and the other four service class specifications (banking printers, magnetic stripe readers/writers, PIN pads and cash dispensers) that have been defined thus far.  These specifications are part of the Software Development Kit (SDK), which supplies the components and tools to allow the implementation of compliant applications and services.  These specifications are distributed to the financial services community for continuing review and comment, to allow them to provide input to the ongoing enhancement of WOSA/XFS.</b><p>
</li>
<li>
<b>The members of the Banking Solutions Vendor Council encourage banks and other financial services companies world-wide, as well as their technology suppliers, to get updated information on the status of the project, and to submit comments, questions, and requests for the specification and SDK.  This may be done via one of the Council members or on CompuServe—see the WOSA/XFS message section and library in the Windows Extensions forum (“GO WINEXT”).  Note that the most recent versions of the WOSA/XFS specifications may be downloaded from this library.   </b><p>
