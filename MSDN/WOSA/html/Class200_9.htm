2.6. Depository Unit</h5>
<p>
<b>Class Name</b> <b>DEP</b></p>
<p>
<b>Class Identifier</b> <b>WFS_SERVICE_CLASS_DEP = 6</b></p>
<p>
The WOSA/XFS depository service defines and supports two types of depository modules through a common interface:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Envelope </b>depository for the deposit of media in envelopes;<p>
</li>
<li>
<b>Night Safe</b> depository for the deposit of bags containing bulk media.</li>
</ul>
<p>
An envelope depository accepts media, prints on the media and deposits the media into a holding container or bin. Some envelope depositories offer the capability to dispense an envelope to the customer at the start of a transaction. The customer takes this envelope, fills in the deposit media, possibly inscribes it and puts it into the deposit slot. The envelope is then accepted, printed and transported into a deposit container.</p>
<p>
The envelope dispense mechanism may be part of the envelope depository device mechanism with the same entry/exit slot or it may be a separate mechanism with separate entry/exit slot.</p>
<p>
Envelopes dispensed and not taken by the customer can be retracted back into the device. When the dispenser is a separate mechanism the envelope is retracted back into the dispenser container. When the dispenser is a common mechanism the envelope is retracted into the depository container.</p>
<p>
A night safe depository normally only logs the deposit of a bag and does not print on the media.</p>
