 <i>fwDevice</i><BR>Specifies the state of the Depository device as one of the following flags:</p>
<p>
Value<b> </b>Meaning</p>
<p>
WFS_DEP_DEVONLINE The device is on-line. The device is present and operational (i.e. not busy processing a request and does not have a hardware error).</p>
<p>
WFS_DEP_DEVOFFLINE The device is off-line. The device is present and powered on but it is not operational (e.g. a switch may have been used to change it to an off-line state).</p>

<p>
WFS_DEP_DEVUSERERROR The device is present but a person is preventing proper operation. The application should suspend the device operation or remove the device from service until the service provider generates a device state change event indicating the condition of the device has changed i.e. the error is removed (WFS_DEP_DEVONLINE) or a permanent error condition has occurred (WFS_DEP_DEVHWERROR).</p>
