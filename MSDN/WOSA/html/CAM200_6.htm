<b>Description</b> This command reports the full range of information available, including the information that is provided by the service provider.</p>
<p>
<b>Input Param </b>None.</p>
<p>
<b>Output Param</b> <code>LPWFSCAMSTATUS lpStatus;</code></p>
<pre><FONT FACE="COURIER NEW" SIZE=2>typedef struct _wfs_cam_status<BR> {<BR> WORD   fwDevice;<BR> WORD   fwMedia;<BR> WORD   fwCameras[WFS_CAM_CAMERAS_SIZE];<BR> USHORT   usPictures;<BR> LPSTR   lpszExtra;<BR> } WFSCAMSTATUS, * LPWFSCAMSTATUS;</FONT></pre>
<p>
 <i>fwDevice</i><BR>Specifies the state of the Camera device as one of the following flags:</p>
<p>
Value<b> </b>Meaning</p>
<p>
WFS_CAM_DEVONLINE The device is on-line. The device is present and operational (i.e. not busy processing a request and does not have a hardware error).</p>
<p>
WFS_CAM_DEVOFFLINE The device is off-line. The device is present and powered on but it is not operational (e.g. a switch may have been used to change it to an off-line state).</p>
<p>
WFS_CAM_DEVPOWEROFF The device is powered off. The device is present, but is currently powered off.</p>
<p>
WFS_CAM_DEVBUSY The device is busy processing a request. The device is present and an EXECUTE request is currently being processed.</p>
<p>
WFS_CAM_DEVNODEVICE There is no device connected.</p>
<p>
WFS_CAM_DEVHWERROR The device is inoperable due to a hardware error. The device is present but a hardware fault prevents it from being used. </p>
<p>
WFS_CAM_DEVUSERERROR The device is present but a person is preventing proper operation. The application should suspend the device operation or remove the device from service until the service provider generates a device state change event indicating the condition of the device has changed i.e. the error is removed (WFS_CAM_DEVONLINE) or a permanent error condition has occurred (WFS_CAM_DEVHWERROR).</p>
<p>
 <i>fwMedia</i><BR>Specifies the state of the recording media. Specified as one of the following flags:</p>
<p>
Value<b> </b>Meaning</p>
<p>
WFS_CAM_MEDIAOK The media is in a good state.</p>
<p>
WFS_CAM_MEDIAHIGH The media is almost full (threshold).</p>
<p>
WFS_CAM_MEDIAFULL The media is full.</p>
<p>
WFS_CAM_MEDIAUNKNOWN Due to a hardware error or other condition, the state of the media cannot be determined.</p>
<p>
 <i>fwCameras[...]</i><BR>Specifies the state of the cameras. A number of cameras are defined below. The maximum camera index is WFS_CAM_CAMERAS_MAX.</p>
<p>
 <i>fwCameras[WFS_CAM_ROOM]</i><BR>Specifies the state of the camera that monitors the whole self-service area. Specified as one of the following flags:</p>
<p>
Value<b> </b>Meaning</p>
<p>
WFS_CAM_CAMNOTSUPP The camera is not supported.</p>
<p>
WFS_CAM_CAMOK The camera is in a good state.</p>
<p>
WFS_CAM_CAMINOP The camera is inoperative.</p>
<p>
WFS_CAM_CAMUNKNOWN Due to a hardware error or other condition, the state of the camera cannot be determined.</p>
<p>
 <i>fwCameras[WFS_CAM_PERSON]</i><BR>Specifies the state of the camera that monitors the person standing in front of the self-service machine. Specified as one of the following flags:</p>
<p>
Value<b> </b>Meaning</p>
<p>
WFS_CAM_CAMNOTSUPP The camera is not supported.</p>
<p>
WFS_CAM_CAMOK The camera is in a good state.</p>
<p>
WFS_CAM_CAMINOP The camera is inoperative.</p>
<p>
WFS_CAM_CAMUNKNOWN Due to a hardware error or other condition, the state of the camera cannot be determined.</p>
<p>
 <i>fwCameras[WFS_CAM_EXITSLOT]</i><BR>Specifies the state of the camera that monitors the exit slot(s) of the self-service machine. Specified as one of the following flags:</p>
<p>
Value<b> </b>Meaning</p>
<p>
WFS_CAM_CAMNOTSUPP The camera is not supported.</p>
<p>
WFS_CAM_CAMOK The camera is in a good state.</p>
<p>
WFS_CAM_CAMINOP The camera is inoperative.</p>
<p>
WFS_CAM_CAMUNKNOWN Due to a hardware error or other condition, the state of the camera cannot be determined.</p>
<p>
<i> usPictures</i><BR>Specifies the number of pictures stored on the recording media.</p>
<p>
 <i>lpszExtra</i><BR>Specifies a list of vendor-specific, or any other extended, information.
