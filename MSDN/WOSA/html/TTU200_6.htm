 <i>fwDevice<BR></i>Specifies the state of the text terminal unit as one of the following flags:</p>
<p>
Value<b> </b>Meaning</p>
<p>
WFS_TTU_DEVONLINE The device is on-line. The device is present and operational (i.e. not busy processing a request and not having a hardware error).</p>
<p>
WFS_TTU_DEVOFFLINE The device is off-line. The device is present and powered on but it is not operational (e.g. a switch may have been used to change it to an off-line state).</p>
<p>
WFS_TTU_DEVPOWEROFF The device is powered off. The device is present, but is currently powered off.</p>
<p>
WFS_TTU_DEVBUSY The device is busy processing a request. The device is present and an EXECUTE request is currently being processed.</p>
<p>
WFS_TTU_DEVNODEVICE There is no device connected.</p>
<p>
WFS_TTU_DEVHWERROR The device is inoperable due to a hardware error. The device is present but a hardware fault prevents it from being used. <BR></p>
<p>
WFS_TTU_DEVUSERERROR The device is present but a person is preventing proper operation. The application should suspend the device operation or remove the device from service until the service provider generates a device state change event indicating the condition of the device has changed i.e. the error is removed (WFS_TTU_DEVONLINE) or a permanent error condition has occurred (WFS_TTU_DEVHWERROR).</p>
<p>
 <i>wKeyboard</i><BR>Specifies the state of the keyboard in the text terminal unit as one of the following flags:</p>
<p>
Value<b> </b>Meaning</p>
<p>
WFS_TTU_KBDON The keyboard is activated.</p>
<p>
WFS_TTU_KBDOFF The keyboard is not activated.</p>
<p>
WFS_TTU_KBDNA The keyboard is not available.</p>
<p>
 <i>wKeyLock</i><BR>Specifies the state of the keyboard lock of the text terminal unit as one of the following flags:</p>
<p>
Value<b> </b>Meaning</p>
<p>
WFS_TTU_KBDLOCKON The keyboard lock switch is activated.</p>
<p>
WFS_TTU_KBDLOCKOFF The keyboard lock switch is not activated.</p>
<p>
WFS_TTU_KBDLOCKNA The keyboard lock switch is not available.</p>
<p>
 <i>wLEDs [WFS_TTU_LEDS_MAX]<BR></i>Specifies the state of the LEDs. The maximum guidance light index is WFS_TTU_LEDS_MAX. The number of available LEDs can be retrieved with the WFS_INF_TTU_CAPABILITIES info command. All member elements in this array are specified as one of the following flags:</p>
<p>
Value<b> </b>Meaning</p>
<p>
WFS_TTU_LEDNA The status is not available.</p>
<p>
WFS_TTU_LEDOFF The LED is turned <b>off</b>.</p>
<p>
WFS_TTU_LEDSLOWFLASH The LED is <b>blinking</b> <b>slowly</b>.</p>

WFS_TTU_LEDMEDIUMFLASH The LED is <b>blinking</b> <b>medium frequency</b>.</p>
<p>
WFS_TTU_LEDQUICKFLASH The LED is <b>blinking</b> <b>quickly</b>.</p>
<p>
WFS_TTU_LEDCONTINUOUS The light is turned on <b>continuous</b> (steady).</p>
<p>
 <i>wDisplaySizeX</i><BR>Specifies the horizontal size of the display of the text terminal unit (the number of columns that can be displayed).</p>
<p>
 <i>wDisplaySizeY</i><BR>Specifies the vertical size of the display of the text terminal unit (the number of rows that can be displayed).</p>
<p>
<i> lpszExtra</i><BR>Specifies a list of vendor-specific, or any other extended, information. The information is returned as a series of &quot;<i>key=value&quot;</i> strings so that it is easily extensible by service providers.
