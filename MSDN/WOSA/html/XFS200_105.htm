11. Appendix A - Planned Enhancements and Extensions</h4>
<p>
This section describes functions and facilities that are not fully defined in this version of the WOSA Extensions for Financial Services specification; modifications and complete definitions will be supplied in later versions.  Vendor and user input is encouraged on these functions and facilities, as well as suggestions as to additional functionality.</p>
<p>
WOSA/XFS currently includes specifications for access to the key classes of financial peripherals for attended and self-service environments.  These existing specifications will be extended and enhanced based on vendor and user experience with them.  The Service Class Definition Document lists the classes of devices or services that, together with others that customers and vendors request, will be evaluated for inclusion in future versions of this specification.</p>
<p>
Also to be considered for future versions of WOSA/XFS are other types of services, such as financial transaction messaging and management, as well as related services for financial networks such as network and systems management and security.  As with the current specification, all these capabilities will be specified for access from the familiar, consistent Microsoft Windows user interface and programming environments.  Whenever possible, the capabilities will be incorporated into the family of standard WOSA elements, and will utilize existing formal and de facto standards.</p>
<p>
Another portion of the WOSA WOSA/XFS API set will deal with administration issues.</p>
