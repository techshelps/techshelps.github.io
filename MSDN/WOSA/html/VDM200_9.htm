4.1 WFS_CMD_VDM_ENTER_MODE_REQ</h5>
<p>
<b>Description</b> This command is issued by an application to indicate a logical request to enter Vendor Dependent Mode. The VDM Service Provider will then indicate the request to all registered applications by sending a WFS_SRVE_VDM_ENTER_MODE_REQ Event message and then wait for an acknowledgement back from each registered application before putting the system into Vendor Dependent Mode. The Service Class status will change to WFS_VDM_ENTERPENDING on receipt of this command and will prevail until all applications have acknowledged, at which time the status will change to WFS_VDM_ACTIVE and the WFS_CMD_VDM_ENTER_MODE_REQ completes.</p>
<p>
 If the command fails when the status is WFS_VDM_ENTERPENDING, the status is changed to WFS_VDM_INACTIVE and a WFS_SYSE_VDM_MODEEXITED Event message is sent to all registered applications.</p>
