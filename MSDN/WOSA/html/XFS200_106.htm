11.1 Event and System Management</h5>
<p>
The WOSA/XFS subsystem will need additional facilities for managing exception conditions (i.e., those that are not anticipated in the error codes, events, etc., that are defined in this specification).  One general facility for this is the system event capability, as described in Sections 3.11 and 9.  This will utilize a combination of one or more functions provided by the XFS Manager and other methods for applications, the XFS Manager, service providers, and services to report exception conditions in special circumstances (e.g., when the XFS Manager is not available).  Such conditions would presumably be monitored by a system management agent responsible for logging and reporting them via a network management facility.</p>
