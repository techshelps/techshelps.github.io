The WOSA/XFS camera service defines the functions provided by banking camera systems.</p>
<p>
Banking camera systems usually consist of a recorder, a video mixer and one or more cameras. If there are several cameras, each camera focuses a special place within the self-service area (e.g. the room, the customer or the cash tray). If there is only one camera that can switches to take photos from different positions, it is presented by the service providers as a set of cameras, one for each of its possible positions. By using the video mixer it can be decided, which of the cameras should take the next photo. Furthermore data can be given to be inserted in the photo (e.g. date, time or bankcode).</p>
