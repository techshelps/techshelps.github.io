3.3.1 Asynchronous Functions</h5>
<p>
<u>Asynchronous mode</u> is used for operations which may take an indeterminate amount of time to complete.  Performing an operation in an asynchronous, as opposed to a synchronous, mode allows the application to operate in Windows' native event-driven, message-based manner.  The processing of an asynchronous request (e.g., <b>WFSAsyncExecute) </b>is as follows: </p>
<ul>
<li>
The application calls the XFS Manager.<p>
</li>
<li>
The XFS Manager generates a sequence number, the <i>RequestID</i>, assigns it to the request, and calls the service provider.<p>
</li>
<li>
The service provider schedules the request for deferred processing and immediately returns to the XFS Manager.<p>
</li>
<li>
The XFS Manager returns the <i>RequestID</i> to the application, with a status indicating that the request has been initiated and is being processed.<p>
</li>
<li>
At some point, the service provider processes the deferred request.<p>
</li>
<li>
On completion, the service provider posts a completion message to the window handle specified by the application in its original call.  (For flexibility, an application using asynchronous functions can specify a different window for each request.)  The message contains a pointer to a WFSRESULT data structure defining the results of the request, including the <i>RequestID</i>, the status code and the other relevant data.  </li>
</ul>
