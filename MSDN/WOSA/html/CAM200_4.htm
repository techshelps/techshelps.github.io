<h4>
2. Banking Cameras</h4>
<p>
This specification describes the functionality of the services provided by the Camera (CAM) services under WOSA/XFS, by defining the service-specific commands that can be issued, using the<b> WFSGetInfo,</b> <b>WFSAsyncGetInfo</b>, <b>WFSExecute</b> and <b>WFSAsyncExecute</b> functions.</p>
<p>
Banking camera systems usually consist of a recorder, a video mixer and one or more cameras. If there are several cameras, each camera focuses a special place within the self-service area (eg. the room, the customer or the cash tray). By using the video mixer it can be decided, which of the cameras should take the next photo. Furthermore data can be given to be inserted in the photo (eg. date, time or bankcode).</p>
<p>
If there is only one camera that can switch to take photos from different positions, it is presented by the service provider as a set of cameras, one for each of its possible positions.</p>
