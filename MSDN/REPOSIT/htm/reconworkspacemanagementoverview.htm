<h1><a name="reconworkspacemanagementoverview"></a>Workspace Management Overview</h1>
<p>
Each Repository can contain workspaces. A workspace is a restricted view of the Repository's contents. The view is restricted for two reasons:
<ol type=1>
<li>
A workspace can contain only those Repository object versions that you explicitly include in it. Thus, if you set up a workspace to apply to a functional area, you can include in that workspace only objects that pertain to that area.<br><br></li>
<li>
A workspace can contain only one version of any Repository object. Thus, the workspace provides you with a simple view of the Repository's data in which only one version of each object exists. In effect, operating within a workspace simplifies things because you do not need to choose among several versions of the same object. When you retrieve an object from a workspace, Repository simply returns the specific version of that object that is present in the workspace.</li>
</ol>
<p>
Although a workspace's view of the Repository data is restricted, operating in the context of a workspace is liberating for two reasons:
<ol type=1>
<li>
A workspace reveals only the objects that are important to you – effectively yielding a custom view of the Repository.<br><br></li>
<li>
Because a workspace contains at most one version of any object, your within-workspace operations can avoid much of the complexity of the multi-version environment.</li>
</ol>
