<h1><a name="reconworkspacecontext"></a>Workspace Context</h1>
<p>
When you operate within a workspace, the workspace provides a specific context for your work. That context includes the workspace's Versions-of-Workspace collection and its Checkouts-of-Workspace collection. If an object version is not part of either of these collections, it is not part of a workspace's context.</p>
<p>
When you invoke a Repository method, the method's behavior can vary depending on whether you invoked the method from within the context of a workspace or from within the more general context of a Repository instance. For example, if you materialize the ObjectInstances collection for a class, the collection can consist of two different sets of items:
<ul>
<li>
If you are operating within the context of a workspace, the collection contains one item for each object <i>in that workspace</i> conforming to that class.<br><br></li>
<li>
If you are operating within the more general context of a Repository instance, the collection contains one item for each object <i>in the Repository</i> conforming to that class.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Similarly, if you invoke <b>get_Object</b>, two different things can happen:
<ul>
<li>
If you are operating within the context of a workspace, Repository's resolution strategy yields whatever version of that object is present in the workspace.<br><br></li>
<li>
If you are operating within the more general context of a Repository instance, Repository's resolution strategy yields the latest version of the object.</li>
</ul>
