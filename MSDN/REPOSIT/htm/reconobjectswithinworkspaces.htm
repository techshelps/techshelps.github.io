<p>
An object version can participate in a workspace in two ways:
<ul>
<li>
An object version can be present in the workspace. That is, the workspace can contain the object version.<p>
Each workspace has a Versions-of-Workspace collection containing the object versions present in the workspace. Use the <b>Add</b> method to include an object version in a workspace; use <b>Remove</b> to exclude an object version.
<p>
<b>Note&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>An object version can be present in more than one workspace. Each object version has a Workspaces-of-Version collection containing the workspaces in which the object is present.
</li>
<li>
An object version can be <i>checked out</i> to a workspace.<p>
When an object version is checked out to a workspace, you can modify that object version only while operating in the workspace. Each workspace has a Checkouts-of-Workspace collection containing the object versions checked out to the workspace. Use the <b>Checkout</b> and <b>Checkin</b> methods to control the contents of the Checkouts-of-Workspace collection.
<p>
<b>Note&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>An object version can be checked out to at most one workspace, and it can be checked out only to a workspace in which it is already present. Even when you check out an object version to a workspace, that object version can remain present in many other workspaces.
</li>
</ul>
