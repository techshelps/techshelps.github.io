<p>
A version-to-version relationship is a relationship that associates a particular version of the origin object with a particular version of the destination object. At run time, the Repository object model never presents an individual version-to-version relationship to you. That is, from within a COM or Automation program, you cannot materialize an object corresponding to a version-to-version relationship. Instead, you can materialize an object corresponding to a versioned relationship.</p>
<p>
The following figure shows versioned relationships.</p>
<p>

<p>
The preceding figure shows two versioned relationships; however, five version-to-version relationships are evident, as shown in the following figure.</p>

<p>
In the preceding figure, each line is a version-to-version relationship. The top line indicates that <i>Version 1-of-Bruce</i> is in the TargetVersions collection of the versioned relationship owned by <i>Version 3-of-Main</i>. It also indicates that <i>Version 3-of-Main</i> is in the TargetVersions collection of the versioned relationship owned by <i>Version 1-of-Bruce</i>. The complete TargetVersions collection of the versioned relationship owned by <i>Version 1-of-Bruce</i> might include other items. That is, there might be other version-to-version relationships between <i>Version 1-of-Bruce</i> and individual versions of <i>Main</i>.</p>
<p>
The following figure shows that <i>Version 1-of-Bruce</i> has version-to-version relationships to <i>Version 1-of-Main</i>, <i>Version 2-of-Main</i>, and <i>Version 3-of-Main</i>.</p>
