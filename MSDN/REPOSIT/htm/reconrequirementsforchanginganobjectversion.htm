<h1><a name="reconrequirementsforchanginganobjectversion"></a>Requirements for Changing an Object Version</h1>
<p>
An object version is <i>unchangeable</i> if it is frozen or if it is checked out to a workspace and the attempt to change it does not occur within the context of that workspace.</p>
<p>
<b>Note&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>This restriction applies when Repository automatically attempts to change an object version for you. Repository can automatically change an object during delete propagation, when a propagated deletion of a destination object version can reduce the TargetVersions collection of a corresponding origin object version’s origin relationship. In effect, the origin object version has been modified automatically by Repository.</p>
<p>
This restriction also applies when you attempt explicitly to modify an object — by setting one of its properties, for example.</p>
