<h1><a name="reconsourceobjectsandtargetobjects"></a>Source Objects and Target Objects</h1>
<p>
Each relationship collection is attached to an object through an interface. This object is the <i>source</i> object for each relationship in the collection. Each relationship in the collection also has a <i>target</i> object — the object related to the source object. </p>
<p>
The words source and target convey the potential for browsing. The source object of a relationship is the object for which you retrieved the collection. The target object of a relationship is the object that can become the target of a step from the source object, through the relationship, to the target object.</p>
<p>
<b>Note&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>Source-and-target terminology differs from origin-and-destination terminology. The origin and destination do not change based upon which collection is being used to access a relationship; the source and target <i>do</i> change.</p>
<p>
For example, the relationship between Frank and bug 15 has these two articulations:
<ul>
<li>
Frank <i>discovers</i> bug 15.<br><br></li>
<li>
Bug 15 <i>is discovered by</i> Frank.</li>
</ul>
<p>
For this relationship, the origin object is always Frank, and the destination object is always bug 15. The source and target objects, however, depend upon which collection is used to access the relationship. The two relationship collections that contain this relationship are:
<ul>
<li>
The collection of discoverers of bug 15. The object that represents bug 15 is the source object for this collection.<br><br></li>
<li>
The collection of bugs discovered by Frank. The object that represents Frank is the source object for this collection.</li>
</ul>
