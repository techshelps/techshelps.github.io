<h1><a name="reconrelationships"></a>Relationships</h1>
<p>
A relationship is an association between two objects. In every Repository relationship, one object participates as the <i>origin</i> and one object participates as the <i>destination</i>. The terms origin and destination refer to the relative roles of the two objects. </p>
<p>
For a given type of relationship, the assignment of one particular role as the origin and the other role as the destination is arbitrary; the origin role, however, is usually assigned to the object that acts or operates on the other object. For example, in a relationship of the type <i>person-manages-project</i>, <i>person</i> is the origin, and <i>project</i> is the destination.</p>
<p>
You can use relationships to navigate through the Repository's contents. With each relationship, you can retrieve either of the two Repository objects that the relationship associates.</p>
