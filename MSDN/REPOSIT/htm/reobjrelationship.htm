A relationship connects two Repository objects in the Repository database. In this release of the Microsoft<sup>®</sup> Repository, relationships are versioned. That is, every relationship is a <a href="reobjversionedrelationship.htm">VersionedRelationship object</a>. A versioned relationship can connect a particular version of a Repository object to one or more specific versions of the target object. Because every relationship is a <b>VersionedRelationship</b> object, you can declare any relationship with the following line:</p>
<pre><code>Dim <i>myRship</i>   As VersionedRelationship
</code></pre>
<p>
In earlier releases of the Repository, the object model included the <b>Relationship</b> object, but not the <b>VersionedRelationship</b> object. If you have Visual Basic<sup>®</sup> programs written against earlier releases of the Microsoft Repository, those programs might include declarations like the following:</p>
<pre><code>Dim <i>oldRship</i>   As Relationship
</code></pre>
<p>
These programs will still work, because the Repository's object model still includes the <b>Relationship</b> object. Visual Basic still recognizes the preceding declaration as valid. But remember, <i>every</i> relationship is a versioned relationship. So the object <i>oldRship</i> has the same members as any versioned relationship has. In effect, the following two lines of code are equivalent:</p>
<pre><code>Dim <i>myRship</i>   As Relationship
Dim <i>myRship</i>   As VersionedRelationship
</code></pre>
<p>
Even though all relationships are now versioned relationships, the Repository object model includes the <b>Relationship</b> object so that you do not need to rewrite your Visual Basic programs that declare objects as <b>Relationship</b> objects. </p>
