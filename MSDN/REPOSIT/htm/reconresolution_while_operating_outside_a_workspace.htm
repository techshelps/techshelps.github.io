<p>
If you do not request a specific version and you are not operating within a workspace, Repository generally returns the most recently created version of an object. In one situation, however, Repository first tries to find another, preferable version of the requested object. If you are navigating from an origin object to a destination object, and there is a pinned version of the target object, Repository returns an interface pointer to the pinned version. If there is no pinned version, Repository simply returns an interface pointer to the most recently created version of the target object that participates in the relationship.</p>
<p>
Some basic facts about pinning:
<ul>
<li>
Repository can return a pinned version (see Example 1).<br><br></li>
<li>
If there is not a pinned version, Repository can return the most recent version (see Example 2).<br><br></li>
<li>
A destination object version can be pinned to several origin object versions (see Example 3).<br><br></li>
<li>
If a target object version is pinned for one versioned relationship, it is not necessarily pinned for others (see Example 4).<br><br></li>
<li>
You can pin at most one version of the destination object for each relationship.<br><br></li>
<li>
You can pin a version of the destination object only; you cannot pin an item within the target versions collection of a destination relationship.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Pinning Example One</h2>
<p>
The following figure shows a two-item collection:  <i>TestSuites-of-Version 3-of-Main</i>. The two items are <i>SuiteB</i> and <i>SuiteC</i>. If you are not operating in a workspace and you navigate to <i>SuiteB</i>, Repository discovers a pinned version of the target object. (The figure shows the pinned version with a dashed arrow.) Thus, Repository returns <i>Version 2-of-SuiteB</i> to your program, even though <i>Version 3-of-SuiteB</i> was created more recently and is related to the source object version.</p>

<h2>Pinning Example Two</h2>
<p>
The following figure shows a two-item collection:  <i>TestSuites-of-Version 3-of-Main</i>. The two items are <i>SuiteB</i> and <i>SuiteC</i>. If you are not operating in a workspace and you navigate to <i>SuiteC</i>, Repository finds no pinned version, so it returns <i>Version 2-of-SuiteC</i>.</p>
<p>
<b>Note&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>Although <i>Version 3-of-SuiteC</i> was created more recently, Repository does not return it because there is no relationship between it and the source object version (<i>Version 3-of-ProductX</i>). Repository returns <i>Version 2-of-SuiteC</i> because, among the versions related to the source object version, <i>Version 2-of-SuiteC</i> is the most recently created version.</p>

<h2>Pinning Example Three</h2>
<p>
A destination object version can be pinned to any number of origin object versions. For example, the following figure shows that <i>Version 3-of-SuiteD</i> is the pinned destination object version of two different items.</p>
<p>

<h2>Pinning Example Four</h2>
<p>
If a target object version is pinned for one versioned relationship, it is not necessarily pinned for others. For example, the following figure simultaneously shows three versions of <i>Product Z</i>, each of which has a collection containing <i>Suite D</i>. All three versions of <i>Product Z</i> use <i>SuiteD</i> as the target object. The top item uses <i>Version 3-of-SuiteD</i> as the pinned version of the target object. The middle item, even though it includes the same version (Version 3) of the target object, does not have it pinned; it uses <i>Version 5-of-SuiteD</i> as the pinned version of the target object. The bottom item includes both <i>Version 3</i> and <i>Version 5</i> of <i>SuiteD</i>, but it includes no pinned version at all.</p>
