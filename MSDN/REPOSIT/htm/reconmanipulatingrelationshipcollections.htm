<h1><a name="reconmanipulatingrelationshipcollections"></a>Manipulating Relationship Collections</h1>
<p>
You cannot add or delete a relationship collection after it is created. A relationship collection might consist of zero relationships, but the collection still exists. If you retrieve such a relationship collection, the Repository returns an interface pointer to a relationship collection, just as it would return for any other relationship collection.</p>
<p>
The following figure shows four projects; each project has a collection of relationships that associate it with its subprojects.</p>
<p>

<ul>
<li>
Genome project — the collection has two relationships. <br><br></li>
<li>
Grant proposal 108 project — the collection has one relationship.<br><br></li>
<li>
General research project — the collection has zero relationships.</li>
</ul>
