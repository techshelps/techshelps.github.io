<p>
You can explicitly delete an object version with the <b>Delete</b> method. Similarly, Repository can automatically delete an object version by performing a propagated deletion operation on it. In either case, the object version is deleted only if it satisfies the basic requirements for object-version deletion.</p>
<p>
If an object version you are trying explicitly to delete does not satisfy these requirements, the <b>Delete</b> method returns an error. If an object version that Repository is trying to delete through propagation does not satisfy these requirements, Repository does not return an error. Instead, Repository continues with the delete propagation operation. That is, Repository continues to consider performing propagated deletion operations on other object versions. (See <a href="reconrequirementsforobjectversiondeletion.htm">Requirements for Object-Version Deletion</a>.)</p>
<p>
Whether an explicit deletion or a propagated deletion is attempted, Repository deletes the object version and any of its relationships if the object version satisfies the requirements for object-version deletion.</p>
<p>
<b>Note&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>Some of these deleted relationships can be delete-propagating origin relationships. Repository considers performing one or more propagated deletions for each. (See <a href="reconpropagationafterremovinganoriginrelationship.htm">After Removing an Origin Relationship</a>.)</p>
