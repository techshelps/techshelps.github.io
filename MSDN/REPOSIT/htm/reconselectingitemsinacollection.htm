<h1><a name="reconselectingitemsinacollection"></a>Selecting Items in a Collection</h1>
<p>
You can select the items of a collection by index, by sequence, by enumerator, or by name. If you get a collection for an origin object — that is, if you plan to move from an origin object to a destination object, all of these selection options are available. If you get a collection for a destination object — that is, if you plan to move from a destination object to an origin object, you have fewer selection options.</p>
<p>
You can select collection items in the following ways:
<ul>
<li>
By index — choose the <i>nth</i> item in the collection, where <i>n</i> is a number between one and the size of the collection.<p>
COM: use the <b>get_Item</b> method of the <b>IRelationshipCol</b> interface or the <b>ITargetObjectCol</b> interface.
<p>
Automation:  use the syntax <i>collection(index)</i>, as for any Automation collection.
</li>
<li>
By sequence — Use the same programming statements to select by sequence as you use to select by index. The distinction between the two depends only on how the Repository orders the items in the collection. In most cases, the Repository uses an arbitrary order. But if the collection is a sequenced collection, the Repository orders the collection items according to the defined sequence.<p>
You can select by sequence only from a collection belonging to an origin object. You cannot select by sequence from a collection belonging to a destination object, because the Repository does not sequence collections belonging to destination objects.
</li>
<li>
With an enumerator — That is, at the COM level you can get an enumerator object for a collection, and then use the standard enumerator functions (<b>Next</b>, <b>Skip</b>, <b>Reset</b>, and <b>Clone</b>). Use the <b>_NewEnum</b> method of the <b>IRelationshipCol</b> interface or the <b>ITargetObjectCol</b> interface to obtain an interface pointer to an enumerator object.<p>

</li>
<li>
By name — If the collection is a naming collection, you can select the item whose name matches the name you supply.<p>
COM: use the <b>get_Item</b> method of the <b>IRelationshipCol</b> interface or the <b>ITargetObjectCol</b> interface.
<p>
Automation: use the syntax <i>myCollection("name")</i>.
<p>
<b>Note</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You cannot select by name from a collection belonging to a destination object, because the Repository does not support the naming of origin objects.
<p>
If the naming collection is not a unique-naming collection, and there are multiple items with the same name, the Repository will return the first item that it finds with the specified name.

</ul>
