<h1><a name="reconcommonmanipulationofobjects"></a>Common Manipulation of Objects</h1>
<p>
You move to an object because you want to manipulate it. You can get or set a property, delete an object, delete a relationship between two objects, or add a relationship between two objects. The software bug-reporting example illustrates some common manipulations:
<ul>
<li>
Get a property — retrieve a bug's description for filling out a bug report.<br><br></li>
<li>
Set a property — change a bug's priority from Moderate to Urgent.<br><br></li>
<li>
Delete an object — delete a new bug because it replicates an already reported bug.<br><br></li>
<li>
Delete an object — disassociate a program from a bug when an employee associates a bug with a program before the bug has been accurately diagnosed.<br><br></li>
<li>
Add a relationship between two objects — associate an existing but previously undiagnosed bug with a program.</li>
</ul>
