<p>
Because the objects in your information model are associated through relationships, you can move among them. The first step must be from the Repository's root object to an object in your information model. To enable this first step, include in your information model a relationship type whose instances will associate the root object with objects stored in your information model. Create a relationship type with these characteristics:
<ul>
<li>
The relationship type's origin collection type is a member of an interface implemented by the <b>ReposRoot</b> class.<br><br></li>
<li>
The relationship type's destination collection type is a member of an interface implemented by a class of the information model.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<b>To create this relationship type</b>
<ol type=1>
<li>
Create a new interface and add it to the set of interfaces implemented by the <b>ReposRoot</b> class.<br><br></li>
<li>
Create a relationship type associating the newly created interface with some interface implemented by a class of your information model. Choose an interface implemented by a fundamental class — a class whose instances are good objects from which to begin moving to other objects of the information model.</li>
</ol>
