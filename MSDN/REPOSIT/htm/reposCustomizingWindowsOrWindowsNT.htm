<h1><a name="reposcustomizingwindowsorwindowsnt"></a>Customizing Windows or Windows NT</h1>
<p>
There are many ways you can customize Windows or Windows NT to make your computer more accessible.
<ul>
<li>
Beginning with Windows 95, accessibility features are built in to Windows. These features are useful for individuals who have difficulty typing or using a mouse, have moderately impaired vision, or who are deaf or hard-of-hearing. The features can be installed during setup, or you can add them later from your Windows 95 installation disks. Look up "accessibility" in the Windows Help Index for information about installing and using these features.<br><br></li>
<li>
Many of the features which make Windows 95 more accessible can be added to Windows NT, earlier versions of Microsoft Windows, and MS-DOS through Access Packs. You can download these files by modem, or you can order them on disks from Microsoft.<br><br></li>
<li>
You can also use Control Panel and other built-in features to adjust the appearance and behavior of Windows or Windows NT to suit varying vision and motor abilities. These include adjusting colors and sizes, sound volume, and the behavior of the mouse and keyboard.<br><br></li>
<li>
Dvorak keyboard layouts make the most frequently typed characters on a keyboard more accessible if you have difficulty using the standard "QWERTY" layout. There are three Dvorak layouts: one if you are a two-handed user, one if you type with your left hand only, and one if you type with your right hand only. You do not need to purchase any special equipment to use these features.</li>
</ul>
<p>
The specific features available, and whether they are built-in or must be obtained separately, depend on which operating system you are using.</p>
<p>
For full documentation on the accessibility features available in the operating system you are using, obtain the appropriate application notes listed below. Accessibility features are also documented in the Microsoft Windows 95 Resource Kit and the Microsoft Windows NT Resource Kit.</p>
<h2>Which Files to Download or Order</h2>
