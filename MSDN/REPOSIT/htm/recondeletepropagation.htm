<h1><a name="recondeletepropagation"></a>Delete Propagation</h1>
<p>
When you delete an object version or relationship, Microsoft Repository sometimes automatically deletes other object versions and their attendant relationships. The automatic removal of an object version is called a <i>propagated deletion</i>. The process by which Repository first determines what propagated deletions are necessary and then performs those propagated deletions is called d<i>elete propagation</i>.</p>
<p>
Repository performs propagated deletions only when you remove a relationship whose corresponding origin collection type has the COLLECTION_PROPAGATEDELETE flag set. Such relationships are called <i>delete-propagating</i> relationships.</p>
<p>
A single delete propagation can result in the removal of <i>many</i> object versions. There are several reasons for this:
<ul>
<li>
A to-be-removed delete-propagating relationship can have a TargetVersions collection containing <i>many</i> items. <br><br></li>
<li>
A to-be-removed object version can have <i>many</i> delete-propagating origin relationships.<br><br></li>
<li>
An object version to be removed automatically (that is, by propagated deletion) can itself have delete-propagating origin relationships.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Delete propagation can happen whenever you do any of these things:
<ul>
<li>
