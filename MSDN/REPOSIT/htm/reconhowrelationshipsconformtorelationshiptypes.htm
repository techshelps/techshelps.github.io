<h1><a name="reconhowrelationshipsconformtorelationshiptypes"></a>How Relationships Conform to Relationship Types</h1>
<p>
When you store a relationship, the meaning of what you store has three aspects:
<ul>
<li>
Which two objects are related to each other?<p>
For example, when you store the relationship indicating that Herman Melville wrote <i>Moby Dick</i>, you relate the object describing Herman Melville and the object describing <i>Moby Dick</i>.
</li>
<li>
How are the two objects related?<p>
For example, when you store the relationship indicating that Herman Melville wrote <i>Moby Dick</i>, you indicate that Melville <i>wrote </i>the book, not that he <i>reads</i> it or <i>criticizes</i> it. You indicate that Melville wrote the book by creating a relationship that conforms to the "Authorship" relationship type.
</li>
<li>
What role does each object play in the relationship?<p>
For example, when you store the relationship indicating that Herman Melville wrote <i>Moby Dick</i>, you indicate that Melville wrote <i>Moby Dick</i>, not that <i>Moby Dick</i> wrote Melville. The object representing Melville plays the role of the thing performing the writing, and the object representing <i>Moby Dick</i> plays the role of the thing that was written.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
The following figures evaluate whether potential relationships conform to the two relationship types: <i>Authorship</i> (of book by person) and <i>Publication</i> (of book by publisher).</p>
<p>
<b>Potential relationship</b></p>

<b>Does the relationship conform?</b></p>
<p>
Kraig Brockschmidt publishes <i>Inside OLE</i>: No, the relationship does not conform to either relationship type. The Publication relationship type allows you to save a relationship indicating that a <i>publisher</i> publishes a book. This data indicates that a <i>person</i> publishes a book.</p>

<b>Does the relationship conform?</b></p>
<p>
<i>Inside OLE</i> publishes Microsoft Press: No, the relationship does not conform to either relationship type. Although this relationship uses two objects of the correct type, it does not conform because it uses those objects in the wrong roles.</p>
