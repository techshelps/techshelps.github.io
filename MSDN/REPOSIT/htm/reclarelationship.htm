A relationship connects two Repository objects in the Repository database. In this release of the Microsoft Repository, relationships are versioned. That is, every relationship is a <a href="reobjversionedrelationship.htm">VersionedRelationship object</a>. A versioned relationship can connect a particular version of a Repository object to one or more specific versions of the target object. Because every relationship is a <b>VersionedRelationship</b> object, you can declare any relationship with the following line of Visual Basic<sup>®</sup>:</p>
<pre><code>Dim <i>myRship</i>   As VersionedRelationship
</code></pre>
<p>
In earlier releases of the Repository, the object model included the Relationship class, but not the <b>VersionedRelationship</b> class. If you have Visual Basic programs written against earlier releases of the Microsoft Repository, those programs might include declarations like the following:</p>
<pre><code>Dim <i>oldRship</i>   As Relationship
</code></pre>
<p>
These programs will still work, because the Repository’s object model still includes the Relationship class. Visual Basic still recognizes preceding the declaration as valid. But remember that in this release of Microsoft Repository, <i>every</i> relationship is a versioned relationship. So the object <i>oldRship</i>, even though it is declared as a Relationship, must conform to the <b>VersionedRelationship</b> class. </p>
<p>
To ensure that objects declared as Relationships conform to the VersionedRelationship class, the Repository uses the same Class Factory for both classes. In this way, any object that you declare as a Relationship implements the exact same methods as any object you declare as a <b>VersionedRelationship</b>. In effect, the following two lines of Visual Basic code are identical:</p>
<pre><code>Dim <i>myRship</i>   As Relationship
Dim <i>myRship</i>   As VersionedRelationship</code></pre>
