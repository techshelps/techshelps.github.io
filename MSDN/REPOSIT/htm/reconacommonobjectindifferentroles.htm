<p>
The following figure shows employees and their managers. </p>

<p>
From this data the set of relationships shown in the following figure does <i>not</i> constitute a valid relationship collection.</p>
<p>
<img src="repgmg02.gif" border=0></p>
<p>
Every relationship in the preceding figure is of the same relationship type, the "manages" type. And all the relationships have an object in common: the object describing Frank. One relationship, however, has Frank in the role of person being managed, whereas the other relationships have Frank in the role of person who is managing someone else. Because the relationships do not all use the same object in the same role, they do not constitute a valid relationship collection.</p>
<p>
The three relationships in the following figure do constitute a valid collection because Frank is in the manager role for all three relationships.</p>
