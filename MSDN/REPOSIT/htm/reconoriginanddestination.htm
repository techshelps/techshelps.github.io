<h1><a name="reconoriginanddestination"></a>Origin and Destination</h1>
<p>
In every Repository relationship, one object participates as the <i>origin</i> <i>object</i> and the other as the <i>destination</i> <i>object</i>. Consequently, the two collections in which the relationship itself belongs are called the <i>origin collection</i> and the <i>destination collection</i>. Every origin collection conforms to a collection type called an <i>origin collection type</i>, and every destination collection conforms to a collection type called a <i>destination collection type</i>.</p>
<p>
When you define a relationship type and its attendant collection types, you must declare one collection type as the origin. The distinction between origin and destination is important because naming collections, unique-naming collections, and sequenced collections can only be defined as origin collections.</p>
