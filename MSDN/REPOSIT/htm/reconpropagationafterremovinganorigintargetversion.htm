<h1><a name="reconpropagationafterremovinganorigintargetversion"></a>After Removing an Origin Target Version</h1>
<p>
If you remove an object version from the TargetVersions collection of a delete-propagating destination relationship, Repository considers performing a propagated deletion.</p>
<p>
Delete propagation always occurs from the origin object toward a destination object.  Thus, in this situation, Repository considers performing a propagated deletion on the object version that was the <i>source</i> of the relationship whose TargetVersions collection you modified. Repository performs a propagated deletion on the source object version if all of the following conditions hold:
<ul>
<li>
The item you removed was the last item in its TargetVersions collection.<br><br></li>
<li>
The source object version has no other destination relationship of the same type as the destination relationship whose TargetVersions collection you modified.<br><br></li>
<li>
The source object satisfies the basic requirements for object-version deletion. (See <a href="reconrequirementsforobjectversiondeletion.htm">Requirements for Object-Version Deletion</a>.)</li>
</ul>
