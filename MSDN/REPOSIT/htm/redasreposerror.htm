Repository methods return an <b>HRESULT</b> value that indicates whether or not the method completed successfully. If a Repository method fails to complete successfully, an error object is created that contains details about the failure. The <b>REPOSERR</b> data structure contains the following details.</p>
<pre><code>struct REPOSERROR
{
   ULONG    iSize;
   ULONG    fFlags;
   HRESULT  hr;
   TCHAR    rcMsg[REPOSERROR_MSG_SIZE];
   TCHAR    rcHelpFile[_MAX_PATH];
   ULONG    dwHelpContext;
   long     iNativeError;
   TCHAR    rcSqlState[6];
   short    iReserved;
   OBJID    sObjID;
   GUID     clsid;
   GUID     iid;
};
