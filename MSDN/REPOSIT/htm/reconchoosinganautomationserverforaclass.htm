<h1><a name="reconchoosinganautomationserverforaclass"></a>Choosing an Automation Server for a Class</h1>
<p>
After you add your information model to the Repository, you can run your tool. Periodically, your tool will invoke the <b>CreateObject</b> method to create an instance of one of the classes of your information model. <b>CreateObject</b> must create a run-time object (that is, an Automation object). To create the run-time object, the Repository calls <b>CoCreateInstance</b>, using as a parameter the ClassID you provided as a property of the class.</p>
<p>
When the Repository calls <b>CoCreateInstance</b> with the ClassID, the system registry is checked to determine which Automation server contains the required class factory. For most classes in your information model, a generic Automation server for Repository objects, Repodbc.dll, suffices. To use the generic server as the Automation server for a class, specify Repodbc.dll in the entry for that class in the registry.</p>
<p>
Although Repodbc.dll suffices as the Automation server for most Repository classes, you will occasionally create a class whose instances require special treatment. For example:
<ul>
<li>
A class of your information model requires input validation.<p>
You can validate the property values or collections of each instance of a class by writing a special Automation server for that class.
</li>
<li>
A class of your information model replicates some properties retained in another file format outside the Repository.<p>
Suppose your information model includes a class whose instances describe Microsoft<sup>®</sup> Word documents. Each instance describes a Word document, indicating specifically its title, subject, and author. Your class-specific Automation server must include special code to ensure that the values of the Repository properties match the values of title, subject, and author stored in the Word file.
</li>
<li>
A class of your information model requires some class-specific behavior that you implement in a method.<p>
Suppose your information model includes a class whose instances describe modem pools. Each instance describes a particular modem pool, including its phone number. Your class-specific Automation server can include a method to automatically dial the number and establish a connection.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<b>Note&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>At this time, Microsoft Repository supports in-process Automation servers only (that is, dynamic-link libraries).</p>
