<h1><a name="reconminimumandmaximumcollectionsize"></a>Minimum and Maximum Collection Size</h1>
<p>
The most important way that a collection can conform to a collection type is in its size. That is, a collection type describes the size limitations on any collection conforming to it. In the following table, each instance of the collection type Publisher-of-book describes the collection of publishers of a particular book. A typical instance of this collection type is "Publisher-of-Inside-OLE." In the table, each book has only one publisher.</p>

<p>
The collection type can define this restriction. That is, the Publisher-of-book collection type can impose on each collection conforming to it a maximum size of one. Similarly, the collection type can define a minimum-size restriction.</p>
<p>
The following list contains some other examples:
<ul>
<li>
Publisher-of-book (zero, one)<p>
The minimum size is zero because not every book has a publisher. The maximum size is one because no book can have two or more publishers.
</li>
<li>
Books-of-publisher (zero, many)<p>
The minimum size is zero because a publisher can exist before it actually publishes any books. The maximum size is "many" because some publishers can publish more than one book.
</li>
<li>
Books-of-person (zero, many)<p>
The minimum size is zero because not every person is an author. The maximum size is "many" because some people can write more than one book.
</li>
<li>
Authors-of-book (zero, many)<p>
The minimum size is zero because the authors of some books are anonymous. The maximum size is many because more than one person can co-author a book.
</li>
</ul>
