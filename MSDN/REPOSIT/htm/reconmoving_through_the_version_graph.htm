<h1><a name="reconmoving_through_the_version_graph"></a>Moving Through the Version Graph</h1>
<p>
Repository helps you move through the version graph in the following ways:
<ul>
<li>
Every object version has a collection of successor versions – the other versions of the same object that immediately follow in the version graph. In the following figure, Version 5 has two successor versions, Version 9 and Version 7. An object version's set of successor versions can be null. For example, Version 11 has no successors.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
Every object version has a collection of predecessor versions – the other versions of the same object that immediately precede it in the version graph. In the preceding figure, for example, Version 11 has three predecessor versions:  Version 9, Version 7, and Version 10.<br><br></li>
<li>
Every object version (except Version 1) has a predecessor creation version – the predecessor version from which the current object version was created. For example, of Version 11's three predecessor versions, only Version 9 is its predecessor creation version.<br><br></li>
<li>
Every object version has a collection of object versions – the entire set of versions of the object.</li>
</ul>
