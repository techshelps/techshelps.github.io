<h1><a name="mdac200mdacoverview"></a>Microsoft Data Access Components Overview</h1>
<p>
The Microsoft Data Access Components are part of the Microsoft Data Access SDK, which is integrated into the Platform SDK. You can find the Microsoft Data Access Components under Microsoft Developer Network Library Edition\SDK Documentation\Platform SDK\Database and Messaging Services\Microsoft Data Access SDK. The Microsoft Data Access Components include the following: </p>
<h3>ActiveX Data Objects (ADO)</h3>
<p>
<a href="mk:@MSITStore:ado200.chm::/sdkadooverview_4piv.htm">Microsoft ActiveX Data Objects (ADO)</a> is the strategic application programming interface (API) to data and information. ADO provides consistent, high-performance access to data and supports a variety of development needs, including the creation of front-end database clients and middle-tier business objects that use applications, tools, languages, or Internet browsers. ADO is designed to be the one data interface needed for single and multitier client/server and Web-based data-driven solution development. The primary benefits of ADO are ease of use, high speed, low memory overhead, and a small disk footprint. </p>
<p>
ADO provides an easy-to-use interface to OLE DB, which provides the underlying access to data. ADO is implemented with minimal network traffic in key scenarios, and a minimal number of layers between the front end and data source—all to provide a lightweight, high-performance interface. ADO is easy to use because it uses a familiar metaphor—the COM automation interface, available from all leading Rapid Application Development (RAD) tools, database tools, and languages on the market today.</p>
<p>
You can find the Microsoft ActiveX Data Objects Reference under Microsoft Developer Network Library Edition\Platform SDK\Database and Messaging Services\Microsoft Data Access SDK\Microsoft ActiveX Data Objects (ADO)\ADO Programmer's Reference. </p>
<h3>OLE DB</h3>
<p>
<a href="mk:@MSITStore:oledb200.chm::/sdkoledboverview_0cs7.htm">OLE DB</a> is the Microsoft strategic system-level programming interface to data across the organization. OLE DB is an open specification designed to build on the success of ODBC by providing an open standard for accessing all kinds of data. Whereas ODBC was created to access relational databases, OLE DB is designed for relational and nonrelational information sources, including mainframe ISAM/VSAM and hierarchical databases; e-mail and file system stores; text, graphical, and geographical data; custom business objects; and more. </p>
<p>
OLE DB defines a collection of COM interfaces that encapsulate various database management system services. These interfaces enable the creation of software components that implement such services. OLE DB components consist of <i>data providers</i>, which contain and expose data<i>; data consumers</i>, which use data; and <i>service components</i>, which process and transport data (such as query processors and cursor engines). OLE DB interfaces are designed to help components integrate smoothly so that OLE DB component vendors can bring high-quality OLE DB components to market quickly. In addition, OLE DB includes a bridge to ODBC to enable continued support for the broad range of ODBC relational database drivers available today. </p>
<p>
You can find the Microsoft OLE DB Reference under Microsoft Developer Network Library Edition\Platform SDK\Database and Messaging Services\Microsoft Data Access SDK\OLE DB\OLE DB Programmer's Reference.</p>
<h3>Open Database Connectivity (ODBC)</h3>
<p>
The <a href="mk:@MSITStore:odbc200.chm::/sdkodbcoverview_4vcn.htm">Microsoft Open Database Connectivity (ODBC)</a> interface is an industry standard and a component of Microsoft<sup>®</sup> Windows<sup>®</sup> Open Services Architecture (WOSA). The ODBC interface makes it possible for applications to access data from a variety of database management systems (DBMSs). ODBC permits maximum interoperability—an application can access data in diverse DBMSs through a single interface. Furthermore, that application will be independent of any DBMS from which it accesses data. Users of the application can add software components called drivers, which create an interface between an application and a specific DBMS.</p>
