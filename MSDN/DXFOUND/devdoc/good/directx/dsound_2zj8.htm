<h3><a name="_dx5_creating_the_directsoundcapture_object_dsound"></a>Creating the DirectSoundCapture Object</h3>
<p>
You create the DirectSoundCapture object by calling the <a href="dsound_2yuc.htm"><b>DirectSoundCaptureCreate</b></a> function, which returns a pointer to an <a href="dsound_56ck.htm"><b>IDirectSoundCapture</b></a> COM interface. </p>
<p>
You can also use the <b>CoCreateInstance</b> function to create the object. The procedure is similar to that for the DirectSound object; see <a href="dsound_18f9.htm">Creating the DirectSound Object</a>. If you use <b>CoCreateInstance</b>, then the object is created for the default capture device selected by the user on the multimedia control panel. </p>
<p>
If you want DirectSound and DirectSoundCapture objects to coexist, then you should create and initialize the DirectSound object before creating and initializing the DirectSoundCapture object. Some audio devices aren't configured for full duplex audio by default. If you have problems with creating and initializing both a DirectSound object and a DirectSoundCapture object, you should check your audio device to ensure that two DMA channels are enabled.</p>
