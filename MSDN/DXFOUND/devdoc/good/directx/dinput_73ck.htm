<h4><a name="_dx5_buffered_mouse_data_dinput"></a>Buffered Mouse Data</h4>
<p>
To retrieve buffered data from the mouse, you must first set the buffer size (see <a href="dinput_94tw.htm">Device Properties</a>). The default size of the buffer is zero, so this step is essential. You then declare an array of <a href="dinput_5cms.htm"><b>DIDEVICEOBJECTDATA</b></a> structures with the same number of elements as the buffer size. </p>
<p>
After acquiring the device, you can examine and flush the buffer anytime by using the <a href="dinput_74ms.htm"><b>IDirectInputDevice::GetDeviceData</b></a>method.<b> </b>(See <a href="dinput_0p4k.htm">Buffered and Immediate Data</a>.)</p>
<p>
Each element in the <b>DIDEVICEOBJECTDATA</b> array represents a change in state for a single object on the mouse. For instance, a typical mouse contains four objects or input sources: x-axis, y-axis, button 0 and button 1. If the user presses button 0 and moves the mouse diagonally, the array passed to <a href="dinput_74ms.htm"><b>IDirectInputDevice::GetDeviceData</b></a> will have three elements filled in: an element for button 0 being pressed, an element for the change in the x-axis, and an element for the change in the y-axis.</p>
<p>
You can determine which object an element in the array refers to by checking the <b>dwOfs</b> member of the <a href="dinput_5cms.htm"><b>DIDEVICEOBJECTDATA</b></a> structure against the following values:
<ul>
<li>
DIMOFS_BUTTON0 <i>to</i> DIMOFS_BUTTON3</li>
<li>
DIMOFS_X</li>
<li>
DIMOFS_Y</li>
<li>
DIMOFS_Z</li>
</ul>
<p>
Each of these values is derived from the offset of the data for the object in a <a href="dinput_0bas.htm"><b>DIMOUSESTATE</b></a> structure. For example, DIMOFS_BUTTON0 is equivalent to the offset of <b>rgbButtons[0]</b> in the <b>DIMOUSESTATE</b> structure. With the macros you can use simple comparisons to determine which device object is associated with an item in the buffer. For example:</p>
<pre><code>DIDEVICEOBJECTDATA  *lpdidod; 
int                 n; 
. 
. 
. 
/* MouseBuffer is an array of DIDEVICEOBJECTDATA structures 
   that has been set by a call to GetDeviceData. 
   n is incremented in a loop that examines all filled elements 
   in the array. */ 
lpdidod = &amp;MouseBuffer[n]; 
if (( (int) lpdidod-&gt;dwOfs == DIMOFS_BUTTON0) 
      &amp;&amp; (lpdidod-&gt;dwData &amp; 0x80)) 
{ 
 ;  // do something in response to left button press 
} 
 </code></pre>
<p>
The data for the change of state of the device object is located in the <b>dwData</b> member of the <a href="dinput_5cms.htm"><b>DIDEVICEOBJECTDATA</b></a> structure. For axes, the coordinate value is returned in this member. For button objects, only the low byte of <b>dwData</b> is significant; the high bit of this byte is set if the button was pressed and clear if the button was released. In other words, the button was pressed if (<b>dwData</b> &amp; 0x80) is non-zero. </p>
<p>
For more information on the other members of the <b>DIDEVICEOBJECTDATA</b> structure, see <a href="dinput_79o4.htm">Time Stamps and Sequence Numbers</a>.</p>
