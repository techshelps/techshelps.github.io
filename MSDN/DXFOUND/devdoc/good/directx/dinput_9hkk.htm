<h3><a name="_dx5_ramp_forces_dinput"></a>Ramp Forces</h3>
<p>
A ramp force is a force with defined starting and ending magnitudes and a finite duration. A ramp force may continue in a single direction, or it may start as a strong push in one direction, weaken, stop, and then strengthen in the opposite direction. </p>
<p>
The following diagram shows a ramp force that starts at a magnitude of -5,000 and ends at 5,000:</p>

<p>
You can apply an <a href="glossary_8yb7.htm#_dx5_envelope_glos">envelope</a> to a ramp force in order to shape it further. The following diagram shows the effect of applying an envelope, shown in green, to the ramp force in the previous diagram. </p>
<p>

<p>
Note that during the <a href="glossary_5583.htm#_dx5_sustain_glos">sustain</a> portion of the envelope, the magnitude of the effect follows the same straight line as before the envelope was applied. For the duration of the <a href="glossary_2wc3.htm#_dx5_attack_glos">attack</a> and <a href="glossary_2ysz.htm#_dx5_fade_glos">fade</a>, the slope of the ramp is modified by the attack and fade levels. </p>
<p>
You cannot apply an offset to a ramp force.</p>
<p>
To create a ramp force, pass GUID_RampForce to the <a href="dinput_92d0.htm"><b>IDirectInputDevice2::CreateEffect</b></a> method. You can also pass any other GUID obtained by the <a href="dinput_3i5w.htm"><b>IDirectInputDevice2::EnumEffects</b></a> method, provided the low byte of the <b>dwEffType</b> member of the <a href="dinput_5m7o.htm"><b>DIEFFECTINFO</b></a> structure (<b>DIEFT_GETTYPE</b>(<b>dwEfftype</b>)) is equal to DIEFT_RAMPFORCE. In this way you can use hardware-specific ramp forces designed by the manufacturer.</p>
<p>
A ramp force uses a <a href="dinput_567p.htm"><b>DIRAMPFORCE</b></a> structure to define the starting and ending magnitude of the force, while the duration is taken from the <a href="dinput_6l2s.htm"><b>DIEFFECT</b></a> structure. Duration must never be set to INFINITE. </p>
