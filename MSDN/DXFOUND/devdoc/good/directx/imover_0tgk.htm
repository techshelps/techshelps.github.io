<h2><a name="_dx5_using_execute_buffers_d3d"></a>Using Execute Buffers</h2>
<p>
As was pointed out earlier, there are two ways to use Immediate Mode: you can use the DrawPrimitive methods or you can work with <a href="glossary_8yb7.htm#_dx5_execute_buffer_glos">execute buffers</a> (display lists). Most developers who have never worked with Immediate Mode before will use the DrawPrimitive methods. Developers who already have an investment in code that uses execute buffers will probably continue to work with them. For more information about the DrawPrimitive methods, see <a href="imover_4of8.htm"><b>The DrawPrimitive Methods</b></a>. </p>
<p>
Execute buffers are complex to understand and fill and are difficult to debug. On the other hand, they allow you to maximize performance. Since communicating with the driver is slow, it makes sense to perform the communication in batches—that is, by using execute buffers.</p>
<p>
This section of the documentation describes the contents of execute buffers and how to use them.
