<h3><a name="_dx5_doppler_factor_dsound"></a>Doppler Factor</h3>
<p>
DirectSound applies Doppler-shift effects to sounds, based on the relative velocity of the listener and the <a href="glossary_5583.htm#_dx5_sound_buffer_glos">sound buffer</a>. (For an overview, see <a href="dsound_7ftw.htm">Doppler Shift</a>.) The Doppler shift can be ignored, exaggerated, or given the same effect as in the real world, depending on a variable called the Doppler factor. </p>
<p>
The Doppler factor can range from DS3D_MINDOPPLERFACTOR to DS3D_MAXDOPPLERFACTOR, currently defined in Dsound.h as 0.0 and 10.0 respectively. A value of 0 means no Doppler shift is applied to a sound. Every other value represents a multiple of the real-world Doppler shift. In other words, a value of 1 (or DS3D_DEFAULTDOPPLERFACTOR) means the Doppler shift that would be experienced in the real world is applied to the sound; a value of 2 means two times the real-world Doppler shift; and so on. </p>
<p>
The Doppler factor can be set and retrieved with the <a href="dsound_6zqc.htm"><b>IDirectSound3DListener::SetDopplerFactor</b></a> and <a href="dsound_5750.htm"><b>IDirectSound3DListener::GetDopplerFactor</b></a> methods.</p>
