<p>
DirectDraw uses software emulation to perform the DirectDraw functions not supported by the user's hardware. To accelerate performance of your DirectDraw applications, you should determine the capabilities of the user's display hardware after you have created a DirectDraw object, then structure your program to take advantage of these capabilities when possible.</p>
<p>
You can determine these capabilities by using the <a href="ddref_748n.htm"><b>IDirectDraw2::GetCaps</b></a> method. Not all hardware features are supported in emulation. If you want to use a feature only supported by some hardware, you must also be prepared to supply some alternative for systems with hardware that lacks that feature.</p>
