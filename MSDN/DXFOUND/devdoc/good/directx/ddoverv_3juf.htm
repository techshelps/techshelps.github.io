<h3><a name="_dx5_setting_focus_and_device_windows_ddraw"></a>Setting Focus and Device Windows</h3>
<p>
You set a DirectDraw object's focus and device windows by calling the <a href="ddref_3z5j.htm"><b>IDirectDraw2::SetCooperativeLevel</b></a> method, specifying the DDSCL_SETDEVICEWINDOW or DDSCL_SETFOCUSWINDOW flags. (The <b>SetCooperativeLevel</b> method also accepts the DDSCL_CREATEDEVICEWINDOW flag, for more information about this flag, see <a href="ddoverv_103b.htm">Default Device Windows</a>.) </p>
<p>
<b>Note:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;Remember, setting the focus window and the device windows only applies if you will be taking full-screen exclusive access with multiple monitors. If you are only going to take exclusive access to the primary device and monitor, you can call <b>SetCooperativeLevel</b> as you always have (by specifying only the DDSCL_FULLSCREEN and DDSCL_EXCLUSIVE flags in the <i>dwFlags</i> parameter). </p>
<p>
Setting the focus and device windows is a two-step process. After creating the DirectDraw object for a device, you must first set its focus window. The focus window is the same for all the DirectDraw objects in your application, and you set it by calling the <b>SetCooperativeLevel</b> method. For the call, the first parameter is the window handle of the window to receive keyboard messages, and second parameter is the DDSCL_SETFOCUSWINDOW flag.</p>
<p>
After setting the DirectDraw object's focus window, you set the device window and the cooperative level (in this case, full-screen exclusive mode). You do this with another call to <b>SetCooperativeLevel</b>. When making the second call, the first parameter is the window handle of the window that DirectDraw will resize to fit the screen, and the second parameter is a combination of the DDSCL_SETDEVICEWINDOW, DDSCL_FULLSCREEN, and DDSCL_EXCLUSIVE flags. </p>
<p>
Although you must specify a focus window that you created, you can allow DirectDraw to handle the creation and management of your device windows. For more information, see <a href="ddoverv_103b.htm">Default Device Windows</a>.</p>
