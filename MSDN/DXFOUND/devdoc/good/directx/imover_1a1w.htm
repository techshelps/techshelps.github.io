<h3><a name="_dx5_texture_wrapping_d3d"></a>Texture Wrapping</h3>
<p>
The <a href="glossary_95pv.htm#_dx5_texture_coordinates_glos">texture coordinates</a> of each face define the region in the texture that is mapped onto that particular face. Your application can use a wrap to calculate texture coordinates.</p>
<p>
Your application can use the <b>D3DRENDERSTATE_WRAPU</b> and <b>D3DRENDERSTATE_WRAPV</b> render states (from the <a href="d3dimref_3pk4.htm"><b>D3DRENDERSTATETYPE</b></a> enumerated type) to specify how the rasterizer should interpret texture coordinates. The rasterizer always interpolates the shortest distance between texture coordinates—that is, a line. The path taken by this line, and the valid values for the u- and v-coordinates, varies with the use of the wrapping flags. If either flag is set, the line can wrap around the texture edge in the u- or v- direction, as if the texture had a cylindrical  topology. If both flags are set, the texture has a toroidal topology.
<ul>
<li>
In flat wrapping mode, in which neither of the wrapping flags is set, the plane specified by the u- and v-coordinates is an infinite tiling of the texture. In this case, values greater than 1.0 are valid for u and v. The shortest line between (0.1, 0.1) and (0.9, 0.9) passes through (0.5, 0.5).</li>
<li>
If either D3DRENDERSTATE_WRAPU or D3DRENDERSTATE_WRAPV is set, the texture is an infinite cylinder with a circumference of 1.0. <a href="glossary_95pv.htm#_dx5_texture_coordinates_glos">Texture coordinates</a> greater than 1.0 are valid only in the dimension that is not wrapped. The shortest distance between texture coordinates varies with the wrapping flag; if D3DRENDERSTATE_WRAPU is set, the shortest line between (0.1, 0.1) and (0.9, 0.9) passes through (0, 0.5).</li>
<li>
If both D3DRENDERSTATE_WRAPU and D3DRENDERSTATE_WRAPV are set, the texture is a torus. Because the system is closed, texture coordinates greater that 1.0 are invalid. The shortest line between (0.1, 0.1) and (0.9, 0.9) passes through (0, 0).</li>
</ul>
<p>
Although <a href="glossary_95pv.htm#_dx5_texture_coordinates_glos">texture coordinates</a> that are outside the valid range may be truncated to valid values, this behavior is not defined.</p>
<p>
Typically, applications set a wrap flag for cylindrical wraps when the intersection of the texture edges does not match the edges of the face, and do not set a wrap flag when more than half of a texture is applied to a single face.</p>
