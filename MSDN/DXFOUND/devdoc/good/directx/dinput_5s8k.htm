<h3><a name="_dx5_basic_concepts_of_force_feedback_dinput"></a>Basic Concepts of Force Feedback</h3>
<p>
A particular instance of force feedback is called an <i>effect</i>, and the push or resistance is called the <i>force</i>. Most effects fall into one of the following categories:
<ul>
<li>
<i>Constant force</i>. A steady force in a single direction.</li>
<li>
<i>Ramp force</i>. A force that steadily increases or decreases in magnitude.</li>
<li>
<i>Periodic effect</i>. A force that pulsates according to a defined wave pattern.</li>
<li>
<i>Condition</i>. A force that occurs only in response to input by the user. Two examples are a friction effect that generates resistance to movement of the joystick, and a spring effect that tends to move the stick back to a certain position after it has been moved from that position.</li>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<p>
The strength of the force is called its <i>magnitude</i>. Magnitude is measured in units ranging from zero (no force) to 10,000 (maximum force for the device, defined in Dinput.h as DI_FFNOMINALMAX). A negative value indicates force in the opposite direction. Magnitudes are linear: a force of 10,000 is twice as great as one of 5,000.</p>
<p>
Ramp forces have a beginning and ending magnitude. For a periodic effect, the basic magnitude is the force at the peak of the wave.</p>
<p>
The <i>direction</i> of a force is the direction from which it comes; just as a north wind comes from the north, a positive force on an given axis pushes from the positive toward the negative.</p>
<p>
Effects also have <i>duration</i>, measured in microseconds. Periodic effects have a <i>period</i>, or the duration of one cycle, also measured in microseconds. The <i>phase</i> of a periodic effect is the point along the wave where playback begins.</p>
<p>
The following diagram represents a sawtooth periodic effect with a magnitude of 5,000, or half the maximum force for the device. The horizontal axis represents the duration of the effect, and the vertical axis represents the magnitude. Points above the center line represent positive force in the direction defined for the effect, and points below the center line represent negative force, or force in the opposite direction.</p>

<p>
A force may be further shaped by an <i>envelope</i>. An envelope defines an <i>attack value</i> and a <i>fade value</i>, which modify the beginning and ending magnitude of the effect. Attack and fade also have duration, which determines how long the magnitude takes to reach or fall away from the <i>sustain value</i>, the magnitude in the middle portion of the effect. </p>
<p>
The following diagram represents an envelope. The attack level is set to 8,000 and the fade level to 1,000. The sustain level will be defined by the basic magnitude of the force to which the envelope is being applied; in the example it is 5,000. Note that in this case the attack is greater than the sustain, giving the effect an initial strong kick. Both the attack and the fade level can be either greater or lesser than the sustain level.</p>

<p>
The next diagram shows the result of the envelope being applied to the periodic effect in the first diagram. Note that the envelope is mirrored on the negative side of the magnitude. An attack value of 8,000 means that the initial magnitude of the force in either direction will be 80 percent of the maximum possible.</p>

<p>
Periodic effects and conditions can also be modified by the addition of an <i>offset</i>, which defines the amount by which the waveform is shifted up or down from the base level. The practical effect of applying a positive offset to the sawtooth example would be to strengthen the positive force and weaken the negative one—in other words, the force would peak more strongly in one direction than in the other.</p>
<p>
Finally, the overall magnitude of an effect can be scaled by <i>gain</i>, which is analogous to a volume control in audio. A single gain value can be applied to all effects for a device; you might want to do this to compensate for stronger or weaker forces on different hardware, or to accommodate the user's preferences.</p>
