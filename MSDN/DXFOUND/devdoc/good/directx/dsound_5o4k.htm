<h3><a name="_dx5_using_hardware_mixing_dsound"></a>Using Hardware Mixing</h3>
<p>
Most sound cards support some level of hardware mixing if there is a DirectSound driver for the card. The following tips will allow you to make the most of hardware mixing:
<ul>
<li>
Use static buffers for sounds that you want to be mixed in hardware. DirectSound will attempt to use hardware mixing on static buffers.</li>
<li>
Create sound buffers first for the sounds you use the most. There is a limit to the number of buffers that can be mixed by hardware.</li>
<li>
At run time, use the <a href="dsound_8eec.htm"><b>IDirectSound::GetCaps</b></a> method to determine what formats are supported by the sound-accelerator hardware and use only those formats if possible.</li>
<li>
To create a static buffer, specify the DSBCAPS_STATIC flag in the <b>dwFlags</b> member of the <a href="dsound_1010.htm"><b>DSBUFFERDESC</b></a> structure when you create a secondary buffer. You can also specify the DSBCAPS_LOCHARDWARE flag to force hardware mixing for a buffer, however, if you do this and resources for hardware mixing are not available, the <a href="dsound_0604.htm"><b>IDirectSound::CreateSoundBuffer</b></a> method will fail. </li>
</ul>
