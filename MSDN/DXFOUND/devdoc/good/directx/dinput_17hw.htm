<h1><a name="_dx5_about_directinput_dinput"></a>About DirectInput</h1>
<p>
Microsoft® DirectInput® provides support for input devices including the mouse, keyboard, and joystick, as well as for force-feedback (input/output) devices. Like other DirectX® components, DirectInput is based on the Component Object Model (COM).</p>
<p>
This release of DirectInput is the first to provide COM-based services for the joystick and other devices such as game pads, flight yokes, and virtual-reality headgear. These new services supersede the Win32® Application Programming Interface (API) functions centered on <b>joyGetPosEx</b>, which were previously documented as part of DirectInput.</p>
<p>
Also new are the services for the force-feedback devices that are starting to appear in the game market.</p>
