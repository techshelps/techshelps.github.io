<h2><a name="_dx5_idirect3d2_interface_d3d"></a>IDirect3D2 Interface</h2>
<p>
The <b>IDirect3D2</b> interface is the starting point for creating other Direct3D Immediate Mode interfaces. It is implemented by the DirectDraw object and can be obtained by calling the <a href="dxintro_0pgv.htm"><b>IDirectDraw2::QueryInterface</b></a> method.</p>
<p>
<b>IDirect3D2</b> lets you find and enumerate the types of Direct3D devices supported by a particular DirectDraw object. It also has methods to create other Direct3D Immediate Mode objects, such as viewports, materials and lights. </p>
<p>
The most important difference between <b>IDirect3D2</b> and its predecessor, <b>IDirect3D</b>, is that <b>IDirect3D2</b> implements an <a href="d3dimref_0dus.htm"><b>IDirect3D2::CreateDevice</b></a> method. This method creates a Direct3D device that supports the DrawPrimitive methods. For more information about the devices created by the <b>CreateDevice</b> method, see <a href="imover_5r50.htm">Devices</a>.</p>
