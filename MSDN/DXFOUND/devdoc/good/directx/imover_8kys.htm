<p>
To get the best rendering performance during execution, you should try to work with primitives in batches and keep the number of render-state changes as low as possible. For example, if you have an object with two textures, group the triangles that use the first texture and follow them with the necessary render state to change the texture, then group all the triangles that use the second texture. The simplest hardware support for Direct3D is called with batches of render states and batches of primitives through the hardware-abstraction layer (HAL). The more effectively the instructions are batched, the fewer HAL calls are performed during execution.</p>
