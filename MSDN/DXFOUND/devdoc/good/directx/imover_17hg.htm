<h2><a name="_dx5_the_drawprimitive_methods_and_execute_buffers_d3d"></a>The DrawPrimitive Methods and Execute Buffers</h2>
<p>
DirectX 5 introduced a radically new way to use Direct3D Immediate Mode. Previously, you had to fill and execute the execute buffers to accomplish any task. Now, you can use the DrawPrimitive methods, which allow you to draw primitives directly.</p>
<p>
The <b>IDirect3DDevice</b> interface supports execute buffers. The <b>IDirect3DDevice2</b> interface supports the DrawPrimitive methods. Despite the names of these interfaces, <b>IDirect3DDevice2</b> is not a COM iteration of the <b>IDirect3DDevice</b> interface. Although there is some overlap in the functionality of the interfaces, they are separate implementations. This means that you cannot call <a href="dxintro_0pgv.htm"><b>IDirect3DDevice::QueryInterface</b></a> to retrieve an <b>IDirect3DDevice2</b> interface. You must call the <a href="d3dimref_0dus.htm"><b>IDirect3D2::CreateDevice</b></a> method, instead. </p>
