<h2><a name="_dx5_directx_programmer_s_reference_components_dxintro"></a>DirectX Programmer's Reference Components</h2>
<p>
The DirectX Programmer's Reference includes several components that address the performance issues of programming Windows-based games and high-performance applications. This section lists these components and provides a link for more information on each component.
<ul>
<li>
DirectDraw® accelerates hardware and software animation techniques by providing direct access to bitmaps in off-screen display memory, as well as extremely fast access to the blitting and buffer-flipping capabilities of the hardware. For more information, see <a href="ddoverv_3kqf.htm">About DirectDraw</a> in the DirectDraw documentation.</li>
<li>
DirectSound® enables hardware and software sound mixing and playback. For more information, see <a href="dsound_0r50.htm">About DirectSound</a> in the DirectSound documentation.</li>
<li>
DirectPlay® makes connecting games over a modem link or network easy. For more information, see <object id=alink_1 type="application/x-oleobject"
	classid="clsid:adb880a6-d8ff-11cf-9377-00aa003b7a11">
<PARAM name="Command" value="ALink,MENU">
<PARAM name="DefaultTopic" value="../../notopic_0pk4.htm">
<PARAM name="Item1" value="">
<PARAM name="Item2" value="dx5_about_directplay_dplay">
</object><a href=JavaScript:alink_1.Click()>About DirectPlay</a> in the DirectPlay documentation.</li>
<li>
Direct3D® provides a high-level Retained-Mode interface that allows applications to easily implement a complete 3-D graphical system, and a low-level Immediate-Mode interface that lets applications take complete control over the rendering pipeline. For more information about Immediate Mode, see <a href="imover_4wmc.htm">About Direct3D Immediate Mode</a>. For more information about Retained Mode, see <object id=alink_2 type="application/x-oleobject"
	classid="clsid:adb880a6-d8ff-11cf-9377-00aa003b7a11">

<PARAM name="Item2" value="dx5_about_retained_mode_d3drm">
</object><a href=JavaScript:alink_2.Click()>About Retained Mode</a>.</li>
<li>
DirectInput® provides input capabilities to your game that are scalable to future Windows-based hardware-input APIs and drivers. Currently the joystick, mouse, keyboard, and force feedback devices are supported. For more information, see <a href="dinput_17hw.htm">About DirectInput</a> in the DirectInput documentation.</li>
<li>
DirectSetup provides a one-call installation procedure for DirectX. For more information, see <a href="dsetup_8dkg.htm">About DirectSetup</a> in the DirectSetup documentation.</li>
<li>
AutoPlay is a Windows 95 feature that starts an installation program or game automatically from a compact disc when you insert the disc in the CD-ROM drive. For more information, see <a href="autoplay_2rsp.htm">About AutoPlay</a> in the AutoPlay documentation.</li>
</ul>
<p>
The AutoPlay feature is part of the Microsoft Win32® API in the Platform SDK and is not unique to DirectX.</p>
<p>
Among the most important parts of the documentation for the DirectX Programmer's Reference is the sample code. Studying code from working samples is one of the best ways to understand DirectX. Sample applications are located in the Sdk\Samples folder of the Platform SDK or in the DirectX code samples under the Platform SDK References section.</p>
