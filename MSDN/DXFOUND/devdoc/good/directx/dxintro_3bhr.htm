<p>
The Microsoft® DirectX® Programmer's Reference provides a finely tuned set of application programming interfaces (APIs) that provide you with the resources you need to design high-performance, real-time applications. DirectX technology will help build the next generation of computer games and multimedia applications.</p>
<p>
Microsoft developed DirectX so that the performance of applications running in the Microsoft Windows® operating system can rival or exceed the performance of applications running in the MS-DOS® operating system or on game consoles. This Programmer's Reference was developed to promote game development for Windows by providing you with a robust, standardized, and well-documented operating environment for which to write games.</p>
<p>
DirectX provides you with two important benefits:
<ul>
<li>
<a href="dxintro_0lbj.htm">Benefits of Developing DirectX Windows Applications</a></li>
<li>
<a href="dxintro_89kf.htm">Providing Guidelines for Hardware Development</a></li>
</ul>
