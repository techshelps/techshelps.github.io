<p>
The <b>DirectXSetup</b> function can tell when DirectX components, display drivers, and audio drivers need to be upgraded. It can also distinguish whether or not these components can be upgraded without adversely affecting the Windows operating system. This is said to be a "safe" upgrade. It is important to note that the upgrade is safe for the operating system, not necessarily for the applications running on the computer. Some hardware-dependent applications can be negatively affected by an upgrade that is safe for Windows.</p>
<p>
By default, the <b>DirectXSetup </b>function performs only safe upgrades. If the upgrade of a device driver may adversely affect the operation of Windows, the upgrade is not performed.</p>
<p>
During the setup process, DirectSetup creates a backup copy of the system components and drivers that are replaced. These can typically be restored in the event of an error.</p>
<p>
When display or audio drivers are upgraded, the <b>DirectXSetup</b> function utilizes a database created by Microsoft to manage the process. The database contains information on existing drivers that are provided by Microsoft, the manufacturers of the hardware, or the vendors of the hardware. This database describes the upgrade status of each driver, based on testing done at Microsoft and other sites.</p>
