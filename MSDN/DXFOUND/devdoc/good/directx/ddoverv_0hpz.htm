<h3><a name="_dx5_creating_surfaces_ddraw"></a>Creating Surfaces</h3>
<p>
The DirectDrawSurface object represents a surface that usually resides in the display memory, but can exist in system memory if display memory is exhausted or if it is explicitly requested.</p>
<p>
Use the <a href="ddref_9ign.htm"><b>IDirectDraw2::CreateSurface</b></a> method to create one surface or to simultaneously create multiple surfaces (a <a href="glossary_0xbn.htm#_dx5_complex_surface_glos">complex surface</a>). When calling <b>CreateSurface</b>, you specify the dimensions of the surface, whether it is a single surface or a complex surface, and the pixel format (if the surface won't be using an indexed palette). All these characteristics are contained in a <a href="ddref_8hbr.htm"><b>DDSURFACEDESC</b></a> structure, whose address you send with the call. If the hardware can't support the requested capabilities or if it previously allocated those resources to another DirectDrawSurface object, the call will fail.</p>
<p>
Creating single surfaces or multiple surfaces is a simple matter that requires only a few lines of code. There are four main scenarios for creating surfaces. Each scenario requires a little more preparation than the one before it, but none are difficult. The following four scenarios are discussed:
<ol>
<li>
<a href="ddoverv_0myf.htm">Creating the Primary Surface</a></li>
<li>
<a href="ddoverv_065z.htm">Creating an Off-Screen Surface</a></li>
<li>
<a href="ddoverv_2rhz.htm">Creating Complex Surfaces and Flipping Chains</a></li>
<li>
<a href="ddoverv_8caf.htm">Creating Wide Surfaces</a></li>
</ol>
<p>
By default, DirectDraw attempts to create a surface in local video memory. If there isn't enough local video memory available to hold the surface, DirectDraw will try to use non-local video memory (on some AGP-equipped systems), and fall back on system memory if all other types of memory are unavailable. You can explicitly request that a surface be created in a certain type of memory by including the appropriate flags in the associated <a href="ddref_7mlz.htm"><b>DDSCAPS</b></a> structure when calling <b>CreateSurface</b>.</p>
