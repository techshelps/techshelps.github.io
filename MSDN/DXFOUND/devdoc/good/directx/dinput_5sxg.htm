<h3><a name="_dx5_step_5_playing_an_effect_dinput"></a>Step 5: Playing an Effect</h3>
<p>
The effect created in the previous step starts in response to the press of a button. In order to create an effect that is to be played in response to an explicit call, you need to go back to Step 4 and modify the <b>dwTriggerButton</b> member of the <a href="dinput_6l2s.htm"><b>DIEFFECT</b></a> structure, as follows:</p>
<pre><code>diEffect.dwTriggerButton = DIEB_NOTRIGGER;
 </code></pre>
<p>
Now, suppose you want to make a chain saw that actually starts and keeps going. This is simply a matter of changing the <b>dwDuration</b> member as follows:</p>
<pre><code>diEffect.dwDuration = INFINITE;
 </code></pre>
<p>
Starting the effect is very simple:</p>
<pre><code>g_lpdiEffect-&gt;Start(1, 0);
 </code></pre>
<p>
The effect will keep running until you stop it:</p>
<pre><code>g_lpdiEffect-&gt;Stop();
 </code></pre>
<p>
Note that you don't need to change the <a href="glossary_8yb7.htm#_dx5_envelope_glos">envelope</a> you created in the previous step. The <a href="glossary_2wc3.htm#_dx5_attack_glos">attack</a> is played as the effect starts, but the <a href="glossary_2ysz.htm#_dx5_fade_glos">fade</a> value is ignored.</p>
