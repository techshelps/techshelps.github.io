<h3><a name="_dx5_using_the_registry_autoplay"></a>Using the Registry</h3>
<p>
The registry is a feature of Windows that supersedes the initialization (.ini) and application configuration files. For information about application programming interfaces that manipulate the registry, see the documentation included with the Platform SDK.</p>
<p>
If your product records and uses initialization information, you can use the registry to store and retrieve this information. Your startup application can use the information in the registry to determine whether the product needs to be installed. If there are no registry entries for your product—which means your product is being used for the first time—you could display a dialog box that lists the setup options. If your product is listed in the registry—which means it has already been installed—you could skip the setup options.</p>
<p>
By changing the system registry, you can cause a computer to read the Autorun.inf file from a floppy disk. This feature of implementing AutoPlay on a floppy disk is provided only to help you debug your Autorun.inf files before you burn the compact disc. AutoPlay is intended for public distribution on compact disc only. To implement AutoPlay on a floppy disk, carry out the following procedure:
<ol>
<li>
In Registry Editor (Regedit.exe), click <b>Edit</b>, and then click <b>Find</b>.</li>
<li>
In the <b>Find What</b> box, type the following, and then click <b>Find Next</b>:<p>
<b>NoDriveTypeAutoRun</b>
</li>
<li>
Click <b>Edit</b>, and then click <b>Modify</b>.</li>
<li>
Change the data of the NoDriveTypeAutoRun value from 0000 95 00 00 00 to 0000 91 00 00 00, and then click <b>OK</b>.<p>
This enables AutoPlay on any drive. You must, however, start AutoPlay manually when it is installed on a floppy disk. To do this, double-click the floppy disk icon, or right-click the floppy disk icon, and then click <b>AutoPlay</b>.
</li>
<li>
After you complete your tests of Autorun.inf, reset the value of NoDriveTypeAutoRun to 0000 95 00 00 00.</li>
</ol>
<p>
<b>Important</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;Because implementing AutoPlay on a floppy disk provides an easy way to spread computer viruses, it is appropriate to suspect that any publicly distributed floppy disk that contains Autorun.inf files is contaminated.</p>
