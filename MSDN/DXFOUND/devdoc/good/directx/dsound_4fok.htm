<h3><a name="_dx5_buffer_control_options_dsound"></a>Buffer Control Options</h3>
<p>
When creating a <a href="glossary_5583.htm#_dx5_sound_buffer_glos">sound buffer</a>, your application must specify the control options needed for that buffer. This is done with the <b>dwFlags</b> member of the <a href="dsound_1010.htm"><b>DSBUFFERDESC</b></a> structure, which can contain one or more DSBCAPS_CTRL* flags. DirectSound uses these options when it allocates hardware resources to sound buffers. For example, a device might support hardware buffers but provide no pan control on those buffers. In this case, DirectSound would use hardware acceleration only if the DSBCAPS_CTRLPAN flag was not specified.</p>
<p>
To obtain the best performance on all sound cards, your application should specify only control options it will use.</p>
<p>
If your application calls a method that a buffer lacks, that method fails. For example, if you attempt to change the volume by using the <a href="dsound_0f38.htm"><b>IDirectSoundBuffer::SetVolume</b></a> method, the method succeeds if the DSBCAPS_CTRLVOLUME flag was specified when the buffer was created. Otherwise the method fails and returns the <a href="dsound_9y3p.htm#_dx5_dserr_controlunavail_dsound">DSERR_CONTROLUNAVAIL</a> error code. Providing controls for the buffers helps to ensure that all applications run correctly on all existing or future sound devices.</p>
