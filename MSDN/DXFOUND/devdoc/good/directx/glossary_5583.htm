<h1><a name="_dx5_s_glos"></a>S</h1>

<dl>
<dt>
<a name="_dx5_saturation_glos"></a><b>saturation</b></dt>
<dd>
Adjustment to the extreme value of a range when the actual value approaches the extreme. If the maximum value in a range is 1,000 and the maximum saturation point is set to 900, then any value greater than 899 is adjusted to 1,000.</dd>
<dt>
<a name="_dx5_scene_glos"></a><b>scene</b></dt>
<dd>
The entire set of objects that make up a virtual environment, including visible objects, sounds, lights, and frames. In Direct3D, the entire set of objects is contained by a <a href="glossary_14qb.htm#_dx5_root_frame_glos">root frame</a>.</dd>
<dt>
<a name="_dx5_secondary_sound_buffer_glos"></a><b>secondary sound buffer</b></dt>
<dd>
A section of audio memory that stores individual sounds that are played throughout an application. The sound can be played as a single event or as a looping sound that plays repeatedly. Secondary buffers can also play sounds that are larger than available sound-buffer memory; the buffer serves as a queue that stores the portions of the sound about to be played.</dd>
<dt>
<a name="_dx5_service_provider_glos"></a><b>service provider</b></dt>
<dd>
A dynamic-link library used by DirectPlay to communicate over a network. The service provider contains all the network-specific code required to send and receive messages. Online services and network operators can supply service providers to use specialized hardware, protocols, communications media, and network resources.</dd>
<dt>
<a name="_dx5_session_glos"></a><b>session</b></dt>
<dd>
In DirectPlay, an instance of several applications on remote machines communicating with each other.</dd>
<dt>
<a name="_dx5_sound_buffer_glos"></a><b>sound buffer</b></dt>
<dd>
A segment of memory that stores DirectSound audio data. Sound buffers can be primary or secondary, static or streaming.</dd>
<dt>
<a name="_dx5_source_color_key_glos"></a><b>source color key</b></dt>
<dd>
A color that, in the case of blitting, will not be copied, or, in the case of overlays, not be visible on the destination.</dd>
<dt>
<a name="_dx5_specular_property_glos"></a><b>specular property</b></dt>
<dd>
The material property that determines how a point of light on a shiny object corresponds to the reflected light source. The specular property of a material is one of two properties that determines how a material reflects light. <i>See also</i> <a href="glossary_8yb7.htm#_dx5_emissive_property_glos">emissive property</a>.</dd>
<dt>
<a name="_dx5_spotlight_glos"></a><b>spotlight</b></dt>
<dd>
A light source that emits a cone of light. Only objects within the cone are illuminated. The cone produces light of two degrees of intensity, with a central brightly lit section (the <a href="glossary_367n.htm#_dx5_umbra_glos">umbra</a>) that acts as a point source, and a surrounding dimly lit section (the <a href="glossary_33qr.htm#_dx5_penumbra_glos">penumbra</a>) that merges with the surrounding deep shadow.</dd>
<dt>
<a name="_dx5_static_sound_buffer_glos"></a><b>static sound buffer</b></dt>
<dd>
A section of memory that contains a complete sound. These buffers are convenient because the entire sound can be written once to the buffer.</dd>
<dt>
<a name="_dx5_sticky_focus_glos"></a><b>sticky focus</b></dt>
<dd>
In DirectSound, the capability to play <a href="#_dx5_sound_buffer_glos">sound buffers</a> when the owning application does not have the input focus. For example, a DirectSound application could continue to play a sound buffer while the user was working in another application.</dd>
<dt>
<a name="_dx5_streaming_sound_buffer_glos"></a><b>streaming sound buffer</b></dt>
<dd>
A small sound buffer that can play lengthy sounds because the application dynamically loads audio data into the buffer as it plays. For example, an application could use a buffer that can hold 3 seconds of audio data to play a 2-minute sound. A streaming buffer requires much less memory than a static buffer.</dd>
<dt>
<a name="_dx5_stretching_glos"></a><b>stretching</b></dt>
<dd>
Blitting an image into a destination with different dimensions. This operation is supported directly by some hardware.</dd>
<dt>
<a name="_dx5_stride_glos"></a><b>stride</b></dt>
<dd>
Synonymous with <a href="glossary_33qr.htm#_dx5_pitch_glos">pitch</a>. <i>See also </i><a href="glossary_1777.htm#_dx5_width_glos">width</a>.</dd>
<dt>
<a name="_dx5_surface_glos"></a><b>surface</b></dt>
<dd>
Memory that represents visual images. This is often display memory, but it can be system memory. <i>See also</i> <a href="glossary_0xbn.htm#_dx5_complex_surface_glos">complex surface</a>, <a href="glossary_938z.htm#_dx5_off_screen_surface_glos">off-screen surface</a>, <a href="glossary_938z.htm#_dx5_overlay_surface_glos">overlay surface</a>, <i>and</i> <a href="glossary_33qr.htm#_dx5_primary_surface_glos">primary surface</a>.</dd>
<dt>
<a name="_dx5_sustain_glos"></a><b>sustain</b></dt>
<dd>
The period when the basic magnitude of a force feedback effect is attained, after the <a href="glossary_2wc3.htm#_dx5_attack_glos">attack</a> and before the <a href="glossary_2ysz.htm#_dx5_fade_glos">fade</a>.</dd>
