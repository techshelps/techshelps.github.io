<h2><a name="_dx5_the_directinputdevice_object_dinput"></a>The DirectInputDevice Object</h2>
<p>
Each DirectInputDevice object represents one input device such as a mouse, keyboard, or joystick. (In this documentation, the term "joystick" includes other game devices that behave similarly, such as steering wheels and game pads.)</p>
<p>
You create a DirectInputDevice instance by calling the <a href="dinput_4jw4.htm"><b>IDirectInput::CreateDevice</b></a> method, which returns a pointer to the <a href="dinput_2mus.htm"><b>IDirectInputDevice</b></a> interface. The <b>IDirectInputDevice</b> methods are used to get information about the device, set its properties, and get data from it.</p>
<p>
<b>Note</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;A physical device that is really a combination of different types of input devices, such as a keyboard with a trackball, may be represented by two or more DirectInputDevice objects. A force feedback device is represented by a single joystick object that handles both input and output.</p>
