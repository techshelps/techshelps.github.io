<p>
The world management of Immediate Mode is based on vertices, polygons, and commands that control them. It allows immediate access to the transformation, lighting, and rasterization 3-D graphics pipeline and provides emulation for missing hardware functionality. (The programmer is always told which capabilities are in hardware and which are being emulated.) Developers with existing 3-D applications and developers who need to achieve maximum performance by maintaining the thinnest possible layer between their application and the hardware should use Immediate Mode instead of Retained Mode.</p>
<p>
There are two ways to use Immediate Mode: you can use the DrawPrimitive methods or you can work with <a href="glossary_8yb7.htm#_dx5_execute_buffer_glos">execute buffers</a> (display lists). Most developers who have never worked with Immediate Mode before will use the DrawPrimitive methods. Developers who already have an investment in code that uses execute buffers will probably continue to work with them. Neither technique is faster than the other — which you choose will depend on the needs of your application and your preferred programming style. For more information about these two ways to work with Immediate Mode, see <a href="imover_4of8.htm">The DrawPrimitive Methods</a> and <a href="imover_0tgk.htm">Using Execute Buffers</a>.</p>
<p>
Immediate Mode allows a low-overhead connection to 3-D hardware; there is no data translation between Direct3D and the Direct3D hardware-abstraction layer (HAL) for rendering operations. This low-overhead connection comes at a price; you must provide explicit calls for transformations and lighting, you must provide all the necessary matrices, and you must determine what kind of hardware is present and what its capabilities are.</p>
