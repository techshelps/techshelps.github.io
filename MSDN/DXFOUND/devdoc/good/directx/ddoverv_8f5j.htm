<h4><a name="_dx5_video_frames_and_fields_ddraw"></a>Video Frames and Fields</h4>
<p>
Video can be interlaced or non-interlaced. When a video signal is interlaced, each <a href="glossary_76pf.htm#_dx5_video_frame_glos">video frame</a> is made of two <a href="glossary_2ysz.htm#_dx5_field_glos">fields</a> of image data. Each field is a collection of every other scan line in an image, starting with the first or second scan line. The first field, referred to as the <a href="glossary_938z.htm#_dx5_odd_field_glos">odd field</a> (or field 1), contains the data for the first scan line and skips every other scan line to the end of the image. Similarly, the <a href="glossary_8yb7.htm#_dx5_even_field_glos">even field</a> (or field 2), carries every other scan line starting with the second. The "even-ness" or "odd-ness" of a field is referred to as its <a href="glossary_2ysz.htm#_dx5_field_polarity_glos">field polarity</a>. </p>
<p>
When video is not interlaced, each field contains all of a frame's scan lines. Typically, video signals are sent at a rate of 30 frames per second; in the case of interleaved video, this means the rate is 60 fields per second.</p>
<p>
The fields that make up a frame do not always reflect the same moment in time. For example, if the frames are separated by 1/30 of a second then the two fields of a frame may be separated by 1/60 of a second. Because a television displays each field individually, no two fields are simultaneously visible, and the difference between fields adds to the illusion of movement.</p>
