The <b>DDSCAPS</b> structure defines the capabilities of a DirectDrawSurface object. This structure is part of the <a href="ddref_1a9j.htm"><b>DDCAPS</b></a> and <a href="ddref_8hbr.htm"><b>DDSURFACEDESC</b></a> structures.</p>

Capabilities of the surface. One or more of the following flags: 
<table cellspacing=4 cols=2>
<tr valign=top>
<td colspan=2 width=100%>DDSCAPS_3D</td>

<tr valign=top>
<td width=10%></td>
<td width=90%>Unsupported. Use the DDSCAPS_3DDEVICE instead.</td>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td colspan=2 width=100%>DDSCAPS_3DDEVICE </td>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=10%></td>
<td width=90%>Indicates that this surface can be used for 3-D rendering. Applications can use this flag to ensure that a device that can only render to a certain heap has <a href="glossary_938z.htm#_dx5_off_screen_surface_glos">off-screen surfaces</a> allocated from the correct heap. If this flag is set for a heap, the surface is not allocated from that heap. </td>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td colspan=2 width=100%>DDSCAPS_ALLOCONLOAD </td>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=10%></td>
<td width=90%>Indicates that memory for the surface is not allocated until the surface is loaded by using the <a href="d3dimref_0vc4.htm"><b>IDirect3DTexture::Load</b></a> method. </td>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td colspan=2 width=100%>DDSCAPS_ALPHA </td>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=10%></td>
<td width=90%>Indicates that this surface contains alpha-only information. </td>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td colspan=2 width=100%>DDSCAPS_BACKBUFFER </td>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=10%></td>
<td width=90%>Indicates that this surface is the <a href="glossary_6wtv.htm#_dx5_back_buffer_glos">back buffer</a> of a surface flipping structure. Typically, this capability is set by the <a href="ddref_9ign.htm"><b>IDirectDraw2::CreateSurface</b></a> method when the DDSCAPS_FLIP flag is used. Only the surface that immediately precedes the DDSCAPS_FRONTBUFFER surface has this capability set. The other surfaces are identified as <a href="glossary_6wtv.htm#_dx5_back_buffer_glos">back buffers</a> by the presence of the DDSCAPS_FLIP flag, their attachment order, and the absence of the DDSCAPS_FRONTBUFFER and DDSCAPS_BACKBUFFER capabilities. If this capability is sent to the <a href="ddref_9ign.htm"><b>IDirectDraw2::CreateSurface</b></a> method, a stand-alone <a href="glossary_6wtv.htm#_dx5_back_buffer_glos">back buffer</a> is being created. After this method is called, this surface could be attached to a <a href="glossary_2ysz.htm#_dx5_front_buffer_glos">front buffer</a>, another <a href="glossary_6wtv.htm#_dx5_back_buffer_glos">back buffer</a>, or both to form a <a href="glossary_2ysz.htm#_dx5_flipping_surface_glos">flipping surface</a> structure. For more information, see <a href="ddref_09pz.htm"><b>IDirectDrawSurface3::AddAttachedSurface</b></a>. DirectDraw supports an arbitrary number of surfaces in a flipping structure. </td>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td colspan=2 width=100%>DDSCAPS_COMPLEX </td>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=10%></td>
<td width=90%>Indicates that a <a href="glossary_0xbn.htm#_dx5_complex_surface_glos">complex surface</a> is being described. A <a href="glossary_0xbn.htm#_dx5_complex_surface_glos">complex surface</a> results in the creation of more than one surface. The additional surfaces are attached to the root surface. The complex structure can be destroyed only by destroying the root. </td>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td colspan=2 width=100%>DDSCAPS_FLIP </td>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=10%></td>
<td width=90%>Indicates that this surface is a part of a surface flipping structure. When this capability is passed to the <a href="ddref_9ign.htm"><b>IDirectDraw2::CreateSurface</b></a> method, a <a href="glossary_2ysz.htm#_dx5_front_buffer_glos">front buffer</a> and one or more <a href="glossary_6wtv.htm#_dx5_back_buffer_glos">back buffers</a> are created. DirectDraw sets the DDSCAPS_FRONTBUFFER bit on the front-buffer surface and the DDSCAPS_BACKBUFFER bit on the surface adjacent to the front-buffer surface. The <b>dwBackBufferCount</b> member of the <a href="ddref_8hbr.htm"><b>DDSURFACEDESC</b></a> structure must be set to at least 1 in order for the method call to succeed. The DDSCAPS_COMPLEX capability must always be set when creating multiple surfaces by using the <a href="ddref_9ign.htm"><b>IDirectDraw2::CreateSurface</b></a> method. </td>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td colspan=2 width=100%>DDSCAPS_FRONTBUFFER </td>

<tr valign=top>
<td width=10%></td>
<td width=90%>Indicates that this surface is the <a href="glossary_2ysz.htm#_dx5_front_buffer_glos">front buffer</a> of a surface flipping structure. This flag is typically set by the <a href="ddref_9ign.htm"><b>IDirectDraw2::CreateSurface</b></a> method when the DDSCAPS_FLIP capability is set. If this capability is sent to the <a href="ddref_9ign.htm"><b>IDirectDraw2::CreateSurface</b></a> method, a stand-alone <a href="glossary_2ysz.htm#_dx5_front_buffer_glos">front buffer</a> is created. This surface will not have the DDSCAPS_FLIP capability. It can be attached to other <a href="glossary_6wtv.htm#_dx5_back_buffer_glos">back buffers</a> to form a flipping structure by using <a href="ddref_09pz.htm"><b>IDirectDrawSurface3::AddAttachedSurface</b></a>. </td>

</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td colspan=2 width=100%>DDSCAPS_LOCALVIDMEM</td>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=10%></td>
<td width=90%>Indicates that this surface exists in true, local video memory rather than non-local video memory. If this flag is specified then DDSCAPS_VIDEOMEMORY must be specified as well. This flag cannot be used with the DDSCAPS_NONLOCALVIDMEM flag.</td>

<tr valign=top>
<td colspan=2 width=100%>DDSCAPS_MIPMAP </td>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=10%></td>
<td width=90%>Indicates that this surface is one level of a <a href="glossary_129f.htm#_dx5_mipmap_glos">mipmap</a>. This surface will be attached to other DDSCAPS_MIPMAP surfaces to form the <a href="glossary_129f.htm#_dx5_mipmap_glos">mipmap</a>. This can be done explicitly by creating a number of surfaces and attaching them by using the <a href="ddref_09pz.htm"><b>IDirectDrawSurface3::AddAttachedSurface</b></a> method, or implicitly by the <a href="ddref_9ign.htm"><b>IDirectDraw2::CreateSurface</b></a> method. If this capability is set, DDSCAPS_TEXTURE must also be set. </td>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td colspan=2 width=100%>DDSCAPS_MODEX </td>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=10%></td>
<td width=90%>Indicates that this surface is a 320&times;200 or 320&times;240 <a href="glossary_129f.htm#_dx5_mode_x_glos">Mode X</a> surface. </td>

<td width=90%>Indicates that this surface is an overlay. It may or may not be directly visible depending on whether it is currently being overlaid onto the <a href="glossary_33qr.htm#_dx5_primary_surface_glos">primary surface</a>.
