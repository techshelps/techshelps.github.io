<p>
The <a href="dsound_8mw4.htm"><b>IDirectSound3DBuffer</b></a> and <a href="dsound_2e3o.htm"><b>IDirectSound3DListener</b></a> interfaces are designed to work together with Direct3D®. The positioning information used by Direct3D to arrange objects in a virtual environment can also be used to arrange sound sources. The <a href="d3dimref_8ht0.htm"><b>D3DVECTOR</b></a> and <a href="d3dimref_9jj8.htm"><b>D3DVALUE</b></a> types that are familiar to Direct3D programmers are also used in the <b>IDirectSound3DBuffer</b> and <b>IDirectSound3DListener</b> interfaces. The same left-handed coordinate system used by Direct3D is employed by DirectSound. (For information about coordinate systems, see <a href="imover_5p5w.htm">3-D Coordinate Systems</a>, in the Direct3D overview material.)</p>
<p>
You can use the system callback mechanism of Direct3D to simplify the implementation of 3-D sound in your application. For example, you could use the D3DRMFRAMEMOVECALLBACK sample function to monitor the movement of a frame in an application and change the sonic environment only when a certain condition has been reached.</p>
