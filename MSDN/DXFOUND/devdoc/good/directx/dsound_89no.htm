<h3><a name="_dx5_matching_buffer_formats_dsound"></a>Matching Buffer Formats</h3>
<p>
The DirectSound mixer converts the data from each secondary buffer into the format of the primary buffer. This conversion is done on the fly as data is mixed into the primary buffer, and costs CPU cycles. You can eliminate this overhead by ensuring that your secondary buffers (that is, wave files) and primary buffer have the same format. </p>
<p>
Because of the way DirectSound does format conversion, you only need to match the sample rate and number of channels. It doesn't matter if there is a difference in sample size (8-bit or 16-bit). </p>
