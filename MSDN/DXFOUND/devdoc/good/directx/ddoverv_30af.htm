<p>
<a href="glossary_33qr.htm#_dx5_page_flipping_glos">Page flipping</a> is key in multimedia, animation, and game software. Software page flipping is analogous to the way cartoon artists animate their images. For example, the artist draws a figure on a sheet of paper, then sets it aside to work on the next frame. With each frame, the artist changes the figure slightly, so that when you flip between sheets rapidly the figure appears animated.</p>
<p>
Page flipping in software is very similar to this process. Initially, you set up a series of DirectDraw surfaces that are designed to "flip" to the screen the way artist's paper flips to the next page. The first surface is referred to as the <a href="glossary_33qr.htm#_dx5_primary_surface_glos">primary surface</a>, and the surfaces behind it are called <a href="glossary_6wtv.htm#_dx5_back_buffer_glos">back buffers </a>. Your application writes to a back buffer, then flips the primary surface so that the back buffer appears on screen. While the system is displaying the image, your software is again writing to a back buffer. The process continues as long as you're animating, allowing you to animate images quickly and efficiently.</p>
<p>
DirectDraw makes it easy for you to set up <a href="glossary_33qr.htm#_dx5_page_flipping_glos">page flipping</a> schemes, from a relatively simple double-buffered scheme (a primary surface with one back buffer) to more sophisticated schemes that add additional back buffers. For more information see <a href="ddoverv_59o7.htm">DirectDraw Tutorials</a> and <a href="ddoverv_45vb.htm">Flipping Surfaces</a>.</p>
