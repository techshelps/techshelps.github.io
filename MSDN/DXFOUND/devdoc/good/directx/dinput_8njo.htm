<h3><a name="_dx5_relative_and_absolute_axis_coordinates_dinput"></a>Relative and Absolute Axis Coordinates</h3>
<p>
Axis coordinates may be returned as relative values; that is, the amount by which they have changed since the last call to the <a href="dinput_0aes.htm"><b>IDirectInputDevice::GetDeviceState</b></a> method or, in the case of buffered input, since the last item was put in the buffer.</p>
<p>
Absolute axis coordinates are a running total of all the relative coordinates returned by the system since the device was acquired; in other words, they show the position of the axis in relation to a fixed point.</p>
<p>
By default, mouse axes are reported as relative coordinates and joystick axes as absolute coordinates. You can use the <a href="dinput_24vo.htm"><b>IDirectInputDevice::SetProperty</b></a> method to change the default behavior of any axis or all the axes of a device.</p>
