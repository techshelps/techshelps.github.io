<h3><a name="_dx5_clip_lists_ddraw"></a>Clip Lists</h3>
<p>
DirectDraw manages <a href="glossary_0xbn.htm#_dx5_clip_list_glos">clip lists</a> by using the DirectDrawClipper object. A clip list is a series of rectangles that describes the visible areas of the surface. A DirectDrawClipper object can be attached to any surface. A window handle can also be attached to a DirectDrawClipper object, in which case DirectDraw updates the DirectDrawClipper clip list with the clip list from the window as it changes.</p>
<p>
Although the clip list is visible from the DirectDraw HAL, DirectDraw calls the HAL only for blitting with rectangles that meet the clip list requirements. For instance, if the upper-right rectangle of a surface was clipped and the application directed DirectDraw to blit the surface onto the <a href="glossary_33qr.htm#_dx5_primary_surface_glos">primary surface</a>, DirectDraw would have the HAL do two blits, the first being the upper-left corner of the surface, and the second being the bottom half of the surface.</p>
<p>
Through the <a href="ddref_8z7b.htm"><b>IDirectDrawClipper::SetClipList</b></a> method, you can passing an entire <a href="glossary_0xbn.htm#_dx5_clip_list_glos">clip list</a> to the driver (if the driver supports this) rather than calling the driver multiple times, once for each rectangle in the clip list. Additionally, you can set the clipper to a single window by calling the <a href="ddref_3ktz.htm"><b>IDirectDrawClipper::SetHWnd</b></a> method, specifying the target window's handle. If you set a clipper using a window handle, you cannot set additional rectangles.</p>
<p>
Clipping for overlay surfaces is supported only if the overlay hardware can support clipping and if <a href="glossary_4xtf.htm#_dx5_destination_color_key_glos">destination color keying</a> is not active.</p>
