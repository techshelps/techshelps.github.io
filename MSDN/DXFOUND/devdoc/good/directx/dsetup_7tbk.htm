<p>
The application-defined DirectXSetupCallbackFunction can be used to:
<ul>
<li>
<i>Display a user interface that is customized for the application</i>. A game, for example, could display the progress of DirectX installation as a flying saucer descending toward a planet. When setup is complete, the saucer could land and an amusing alien could disembark carrying a sign reading, "Success!"</li>
<li>
<i>Suppress the display of status and error messages.</i> Designers of programs for novice users may want to suppress error messages from being displayed to the user. Error messages can be handled by the setup program. This requires a larger-than-normal development effort for the setup program, but may be appropriate for the target audience. </li>
<li>
<i>Automatically handle status and error conditions.</i> Setup programs that suppress error messages should handle them automatically. If the users are not given error information, they should not be required to intervene when an error occurs.</li>
<li>
<i>Allow the user greater control when status and error messages occur.</i> It is often appropriate to allow knowledgeable users greater control than normal over the setup process. Caution should be taken, however, when using this approach. Allowing users greater-than-normal control over the setup process increases the chances that their system will be adversely affected during or after the setup.</li>
<li>
<i>Override the default behavior of the <b>DirectXSetup</b> function. </i>Although this is not recommended, it can be done. The user is typically notified when a setup program does this.</li>
</ul>
