<h2><a name="_dx5_architectural_overview_dsound"></a>Architectural Overview</h2>
<p>
DirectSound implements a new model for playing and capturing digital sound samples and mixing sample sources. As with other object classes in the DirectX API, DirectSound uses the hardware to its greatest advantage whenever possible, and it emulates hardware features in software when the feature is not present in the hardware.</p>
<p>
DirectSound playback is built on the <a href="dsound_2r8k.htm"><b>IDirectSound</b></a> component object model (COM) interface and on other interfaces for manipulating sound buffers and 3-D effects. These interfaces are <a href="dsound_317o.htm"><b>IDirectSoundBuffer</b></a>, <a href="dsound_8mw4.htm"><b>IDirectSound3DBuffer</b></a>, and <a href="dsound_2e3o.htm"><b>IDirectSound3DListener</b></a></p>
<p>
DirectSound capture is based on the <a href="dsound_56ck.htm"><b>IDirectSoundCapture</b></a> and <a href="dsound_24bo.htm"><b>IDirectSoundCaptureBuffer</b></a> COM interfaces.</p>
<p>
Another COM interface, <a href="dsound_5mn8.htm"><b>IKsPropertySet</b></a>, provides methods that allow applications to take advantage of extended capabilities of sound cards.</p>
<p>
Finally, the <a href="dsound_55us.htm"><b>IDirectSoundNotify</b></a> interface is used to signal events when playback or capture has reached a certain point in the buffer.</p>
<p>
For more information about COM concepts that you should understand to create applications with the DirectX APIs, see <a href="dxintro_2q9b.htm">The Component Object Model</a>.</p>
