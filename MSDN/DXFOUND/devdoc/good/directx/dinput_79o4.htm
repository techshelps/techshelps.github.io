<p>
When DirectInput input data is buffered (see <a href="dinput_0p4k.htm">Buffered and Immediate Data</a>), each <a href="dinput_5cms.htm"><b>DIDEVICEOBJECTDATA</b></a> structure contains not only information about the type of event and the device object associated with it, but also a time stamp and a sequence number.</p>
<p>
The <b>dwTimeStamp</b> member contains the system time in milliseconds at the time the event took place. This is equivalent to the value that would have been returned by the Win32 <b>GetTickCount</b> function.</p>
<p>
The <b>dwSequence</b> member contains a sequence number assigned by DirectInput. The DirectInput system keeps a single sequence counter, which is incremented by each non-simultaneous buffered event from any device. You can use this number to compare events from different devices and see which came first. The <a href="dinput_27g4.htm"><b>DISEQUENCE_COMPARE</b></a> macro takes wraparound into account.</p>
<p>
Simultaneous events are assigned the same sequence number. If a mouse or joystick is moved diagonally, for example, the changes in the x-axis and the y-axis have the same sequence number.</p>
<p>
<b>Note</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;Events are always placed in the buffer in chronological order, so you don't need to check the sequence numbers just to sort the events from a single device.</p>
