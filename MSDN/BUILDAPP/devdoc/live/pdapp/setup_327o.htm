<h2><a name="_win32_register_document_types_pt"></a>Register Document Types</h2>
<p>
Your installation program should register every file type used that is not provided by the system:
<ul>
<li>
For the files of interest to the user, such as document types, the installation program should register both an icon and a description. It should provide good OLE/shell verbs and also add a "ShellNew" entry so your document type shows up in the "New" menu. This menu is available when the user clicks mouse button 2 on any container or chooses the File menu in a folder window.</li>
<li>
For files that the user would have a good reason to double-click, the installation program should provide the file with a good icon and description and also a registered "open" action so that the user can double-click it.</li>
<li>
For files that are less interesting to the user, such as .INI or configuration files, the installation program should provide the file with a good icon and description. The best way to do this is to consistently use predefined filename extensions, such as .INI, .SYS, and .TXT.</li>
<li>
For files of little interest to the user, the installation program should minimally register a file type so that there is a decent description in "Details" view (and possibly an icon). If the program does not register the type, the file is identified by whatever the filename extension may be. Registering the type ensures that the file is identified by the description and related icon.</li>
</ul>
