<p>
System services functions that give applications access to the resources of the computer and the features of the underlying operating system, such as memory, file systems, devices, processes, and threads. An application uses system services functions to manage and monitor the resources that it needs to complete its work. For example, an application uses memory management functions to allocate and free memory and uses process management and synchronization functions to start and coordinate the operation of multiple applications or multiple threads of execution within a single application.</p>
<p>
System services functions provide access to files, directories, and input and output (I/O) devices. The file I/O functions give applications access to files and directories on disks and other the storage devices on a given computer and on computers in a network. These functions support a variety of file systems, from the FAT file system to the CD-ROM file system (CDFS) to NTFS. </p>
<p>
System services functions provide methods for applications to share code or information with other applications. For example, you can make useful procedures available to all applications by placing these procedures in DLLs. Applications access these procedures by using DLL functions to load the libraries and retrieve the addresses of the procedures. Communications functions read from and write to communications ports as well as control the operating modes of these ports. There are several methods of interprocess communication (IPC), such as DDE, pipes, mailslots, and file mapping. For operating systems that provide security features, the security functions give applications access to secure data as well as protect data from intentional or unintentional access or damage. </p>
<p>
System services functions provide access to information about the system and other applications. System information functions let applications determine specific characteristic about the computer, such as whether a mouse is present and what dimensions elements of the screen have. Registry and initialization functions let applications store application-specific information in system files so that new instances of the application or even other applications can retrieve and use the information. </p>
<p>
System services functions provide features that applications can use to handle special conditions during execution, such as handling errors, logging events, and handling exceptions. There are features that applications can use to debug and improve performance. For example, debugging functions permit single-step control of the execution of other processes, and performance monitoring allows for detailing the path of execution through a process. </p>
<p>
System services functions provice features you can use to create other types of applications, such as console applications and services.</p>
