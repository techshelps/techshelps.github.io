<h2><a name="_errmsgguide_dialog_and_popup_message_guidelines"></a>Dialog and Popup Message Guidelines</h2>
<p>
This type of message is often very confusing to users. A dialog box has appeared on the screen and will not go away until they click the "OK" or "Cancel" button. </p>
<p>
Users often feel they have "broken" something on the computer and are not sure what to do next. </p>
<p>
When writing this type of message, consider the following: 
<ul>
<li>
Does the message give the user a clear, non-technical explanation of the problem? </li>
<li>
Does the message include steps or a clear explanation of what to do to prevent the problem from occurring again? </li>
<li>
If a long explanation is needed, point the user to a Help file and index item to search for more information. </li>
<li>
If it is a critical problem, be sure to leverage the Event Log and write out the error. </li>
</ul>
