<ul>
<li>
If you are processing a file sequentially, use a page at a time to reduce the number of calls you have to make to the file system. If you are randomly accessing small amounts of data, you may wish to use memory-mapped files. </li>
<li>
In MS-DOS-based systems, there is a limit on the number of files the system can have open at one time. Therefore, many applications open and close files frequently. Because of the additional protection and security in Windows NT, opening a file uses more resources. Therefore, on Windows NT, open files when you first need them, and close them when you are finished with them. The number of files you can open is limited only by the amount of non-paged pool in the system. The system stores information for all open objects in non-paged pool. </li>
