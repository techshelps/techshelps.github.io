<p>
Autorun is a feature that is supported on CD-ROM drives. When the user loads a compact disc (CD) into the drive, the system automatically runs a file on the CD. The file to run must be specified in an AUTORUN.INF file located in the CD's root directory. The following example shows a typical entry in an AUTORUN.INF file.</p>
<pre><code>[AutoRun] 
OPEN=myprog.exe 
 </code></pre>
<p>
The autorun feature can be disabled by the device manager or by an entry in the SYSTEM.INI file. Your application must not rely on the autorun feature being available. Also, the autorun feature should not be used to automatically install your application on a user's hard disk without the user being asked first. </p>
<p>
If you provide your application on a CD, your installation program should give the user the choice of running the application from the CD or installing it on the hard disk. You should keep the following points in mind when using the autorun feature:
<ul>
<li>
Even if the user chooses to run your application from the CD, your program will need to copy some files to the hard disk (for example, writable files and files containing the user's preferences).</li>
<li>
If you include a shortcut on the desktop, your application should display a message when the user selects the shortcut and the CD is not loaded.</li>
</ul>
