<p>
Users almost always prefer simple sentences that use simple present or past tense and active voice. For example: </p>
<pre><code>Registry Editor cannot create the subkey.
   NOT:  ...could not create...

Setup cannot start Program Manager.
   NOT:  Setup was unable to activate Program Manager.

Floppy disk sector ID field does not match floppy disk controller track address. 
   NOT:  Mismatch between the floppy disk sector ID field and the
         floppy disk controller track address.

CHKDSK encountered an error during... 
   NOT:  An error was encountered during...

Cannot find %1.
   NOT:  Could not find... 

Modem does not respond.
   NOT:  Modem not responding. 
</code></pre>
<p>
However, using active voice and a simple constructions is less important than making your message searchable. Use passive voice and more complex constructions if you need to in order to place search-relevant words at the beginning of the message. For example: </p>
<pre><code>Log file size cannot be adjusted.
   NOT:  Cannot adjust the size of the log file.
   NOT:  Was unable to adjust the size of the log file.

Printing of %1 cannot resume.
   NOT:  Cannot resume printing %1.
   NOT:  Could not resume printing %1.</code></pre>
