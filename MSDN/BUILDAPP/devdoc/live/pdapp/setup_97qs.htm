<p>
Your installation program should determine the hardware and software configuration of the user's computer before copying files and setting the environment. It is important for the installation program to verify that everything needed to successfully run the application is available. For example, if your application depends on specific hardware or software, your installation program should make sure the hardware or software is present. If it is not, the program should notify the user immediately and recommend a course of action. By using <object id=alink_1 type="application/x-oleobject"

Your installation program should always tell the user how much disk space is needed. For custom setup, the installation program should adjust the "space needed" figure as the user selects and deselects options. Your installation program should verify that enough disk space is present for the options that the user selects. If there is not enough free space, the program should notify the user but give the user the option to override the warning.  Microsoft installer technology provides a comprehensive method for determining available disk space and required disk space.</p>
<p>
Your installation program should always determine whether any of the files to be installed are already on the hard disk. This is especially important for shared files, such as commonly used dynamic-link libraries (DLL). If the files already exist, your installation program should check the version number to ensure that it is not replacing a file with an older version. In other words, the installation program should always make sure the most recent version of a file is installed on the user's disk. Microsoft installer technology has a configuration database that keeps track of all of the components and files needed for all applications that use Microsoft installer technology on a particular computer. This makes it easy to check component versions and ensure that shared components are installed properly.</p>
