<h1><a name="asinstallingprebuiltpackages"></a>Installing Pre-built MTS Packages</h1>
<p>
A pre-built package consists of a <a href="vipdef01_1yih.htm#asdefpackagedefinitionfile">package file</a> and the component files (.<a href="vipdef01_1yih.htm#asdefdll">dll</a> and .<a href="vipdef01_1yih.htm#asdeftypelibrary">tlb</a>) associated with the package. Use the MTS Explorer to install and deploy pre-built packages developed by third party or enterprise developers. </p>
<p>
Note that after you install any package, the <i>minimum</i> configuration for your package includes controlling access to objects stored by MTS, mapping users to <a href="vipdef01_1yih.htm#asdefrole">roles</a>, and setting security levels for packages. See the <a href="install_9kvt.htm">Enabling MTS Package Security</a> topic for more information on how to configure security for your package. </p>
<h5><img src="images/prcarrow.gif" border=0>To install a pre-built package:</h5>
<ol>
<li>
In the left pane of the Explorer, select the computer on which you want to create a package.</li>
<li>
Open the <b>Packages Installed</b> folder for that computer.</li>
<li>
On the <b>Action</b> menu, click <b>New</b>. You can also select the <b>Create new object</b> button on the MTS toolbar, or right-click on the <b>Packages</b> <b>Installed</b> folder and select <b>New</b> and then <b>Package</b>. </li>
<li>
Click the <b>Install pre-built packages</b> button.</li>
<li>
In the <b>Select Package Files</b> dialog box, click <b>Add</b> to browse the network for available package files. Select a package file (.pak), click <b>Open</b>, and then click <b>Next</b>. Note that you can install multiple packages at the same time. The component files that are included in the package must be located in the same directory as the package file.</li>
<li>
Specify the package identity in the <b>Set Package Identity </b>dialog box, and then click <b>Next</b>. The default selection is <b>Interactive User</b>. The interactive user is the user that logged on to the Windows NT account for the computer that runs a package. You can select a different user by selecting the <b>This user</b> option and entering details for a specific Windows NT user or group.</li>
<li>
In the Installation Options dialog box, specify the installation directory. The component files are copied from the package file directory to the installation directory. You can accept the default directory, or click <b>Browse</b> to search for another location. </li>
<li>
If the package file you are installing contains defined Windows NT users, the <b>Add Windows NT users saved in the Package File</b> option will be available. Clicking this box adds these users to the new package.</li>
<li>
Click <b>Finish</b>. The Explorer hierarchy now shows the new package in the right pane. If you install multiple packages, the options you choose in steps 6 and 7 apply to all the packages.</li>
</ol>
<p>
On Windows NT, you can also install a pre-built package by dragging a package file from the Windows NT Explorer to the right pane of the MTS Explorer while the <b>Packages</b> folder of a computer is open.</p>
