<h1><a name="asconmonitoringtransactions"></a>Monitoring Transaction Statistics</h1>
<p>
You can use the <a href="vipdef01_1yih.htm#asdefmicrosofttransactionserverexplorer">Microsoft Transaction Server Explorer</a> to monitor commit and abort statistics for <a href="vipdef01_1yih.htm#asdeftransaction">transactions</a>.</p>
<p>
You can experiment with the MoveMoney and Account <a href="vipdef01_1yih.htm#asdefvipercomponent">components</a> to see how transactions are committed and aborted as you provide user input with the Bank client.</p>
<h5><img src="images/prcarrow.gif" border=0>To monitor transactions</h5>
<ol>
<li>
On the <b>Window</b> menu of the Transaction Server Explorer, click <b>New Window</b>.</li>
<li>
In the left pane, click <b>Transaction Statistics</b>.</li>
<li>
On the <b>Action</b> menu, click <b>Scope Pane</b> to hide the left pane of the Explorer.</li>
<li>
Make sure that the <a href="vipdef01_1yih.htm#asdefdtc">Microsoft Distributed Transaction Coordinator (MS DTC)</a> is running on your SQL Server computer. You can start MS DTC from the Transaction Server Explorer or from SQL Server.</li>
<li>
Also make sure that you have the ODBC <a href="vipdef01_1yih.htm#asdefdsn">data source</a> set up, and that SQL Server is running. Click <a href="settingup_7grw.htm"><img src="images/chiclet.gif" border=0></a> to get information on how to do this.</li>
<li>
Start the Bank client.</li>
</ol>
<p>
Rearrange the windows so that you see the two Microsoft Transaction Server Explorer windows and the Bank client window.</p>
<p>
To monitor a commit, click <b>Submit</b> in the Bank client. The Transaction Statistics window first indicates that one transaction is active, and indicates that one transaction was committed.</p>
<p>
To monitor an abort, click <b>Debit</b> in the Bank client, and enter an amount for the transaction that is greater than the balance on your account. Click <b>Submit</b>. The Transaction Statistics window first indicates that one transaction is active, and then indicates that one transaction was aborted.</p>
<p>
Try experimenting with <b>Transfer</b>. Verify that both objects are running within the same transaction by checking the balance of two accounts and performing a transfer that would overdraw from an account. Notice that both the credit and the debit are aborted.</p>
