<h1><a name="assettinguptheadministrationobjectsamplescripts"></a>Setting Up the MTS Administrative Sample Scripts</h1>
<p>
The administration object sample scripts demonstrate how to write scripts in an Automation-compatible language (such as Visual Basic Scripting Edition (VBScript) that automate procedures in the MTS Explorer. The sample scripts automate deployment for the Sample Bank application. </p>
<p>
In order to run the sample scripts, you must first install the Windows Scripting Host (WSH). Note that these scripts will only run on Microsoft Windows NT and Alpha platforms. </p>
<p>
<b><img src="images/prcarrow.gif" border=0>To install the Windows Scripting Host from the Windows NT 4.0 Option Pack:</b>
<ol>
<li>
If you have not already installed WSH, open the <b>Start</b> menu, choose the <b>Microsoft Internet Information Server</b> option, and click<b> Internet Information Server Setup</b>. </li>
<li>
Choose the <b>Add/Remove</b> option from the setup program. </li>
<li>
Find the Windows Scripting Host option in the list of components, and select the checkbox. </li>
<li>
Click <b>Finish</b>. The Windows NT 4.0 Option Pack setup program will install WSH on your computer.</li>
</ol>
<p>
Once you have WSH installed, you can use the administration object sample scripts. The following sample scripts are located in your \MTS\Samples\WSH sub-directory:
<ul>
<li>
InstDLL.vbs</li>
</ul>
<p>
Deletes existing versions of Sample Bank, creates a new package named Sample Bank, installs components from the Sample Bank Visual Basic, Visual C++, and Visual J++ DLLs into the new package, changes transaction attributes, and adds a new role. You must modify the file path before running the script.</p>
<p>
Note this script requires that the computer registry contain all components’ programmatic identifiers (progIDs). Therefore, you must use the Visual Studio 97 ActiveX Wizard to register your Java components before you run this script.
<ul>
<li>
InstPak.vbs</li>
</ul>
<p>
Installs the Sample Bank package into the MTS run-time environment. You must modify the file path before running the script.
<ul>
<li>
Uninst.vbs</li>
</ul>
<p>
Uninstalls the Sample Bank package from the MTS run-time environment. You must modify the file path before running the script.
<ul>
<li>
InstDllCLI.vbs</li>
</ul>
<p>
Allows you to run the InstDll.vbs script from a console window and enter the file path as a parameter to delete existing versions of Sample Bank, create a new package named Sample Bank, install components from the Sample Bank Visual Basic, Visual C++, and Visual J++ DLLs into the new package, change transaction attributes, and add a new role.
<ul>
<li>
InstPakCLI.vbs</li>
</ul>
<p>
Allows you to run the InstPak.vbs script from a console window and enter the file path as a parameter to install the Sample Bank package into the MTS run-time environment. </p>
<p>
For more information about the scriptable administration objects and the sample scripts, refer to the <a href="scriptable_5bjn.htm">Automating MTS Administration</a> topic in the <i>MTS Administrator’s Guide</i>.</p>
<p>
Limitations of the Administrative Sample Scripts
<ul>
<li>
Java components must be registered using the Visual Studio 97 ActiveX Wizard before running the InstDLL.vbs script. </li>
<li>
Installing Java components using the sample scripts is only supported on an Alpha or i386 computer. Alpha users should remove the Java component importing code from InstDLL.vbs before running the script. </li>
</ul>
