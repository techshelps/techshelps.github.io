<p>
The MTS run-time infrastructure makes application development, deployment, and management easy by providing the application developer and system administrator a comprehensive but easy-to-use set of system services that include:
<ul>
<li>
Distributed transactions. A <i>transaction</i> is a unit of work that is done as an atomic operation&nbsp;— that is, the operation succeeds or fails as a whole.</li>
<li>
Automatic management of processes and threads.</li>
<li>
Object instance management.</li>
<li>
A distributed security service to control object creation and use.</li>
<li>
A graphical interface for system administration and component management.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Application developers who rely upon these system services to make their applications scalable and robust can focus on solving their business problems rather than on developing a system infrastructure.</p>
<p>
MTS works with any application development tool capable of producing ActiveX dynamic-link libraries (DLLs). For example, developers can use Microsoft Visual Basic, Microsoft Visual C++, Microsoft Visual J++, or any other ActiveX tool to develop MTS applications.</p>
<p>
MTS is designed to work with a wide variety of resource managers, including relational database systems, file systems, and document storage systems. This allows developers and independent software vendors to select from a wide range of resource managers and to easily use two or more resource managers within a single application while enjoying the benefits of local or distributed transactions.</p>
