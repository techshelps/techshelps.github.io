<h1><a name="assettingtransactionproperties"></a>Setting MTS Transaction Properties</h1>
<p>
You should determine if you want your application to support <a href="vipdef01_1yih.htm#asdeftransaction">transaction</a> at design time, and then use the <a href="vipdef01_1yih.htm#asdefmicrosofttransactionserverexplorer">Microsoft Transaction Server Explorer</a> during deployment to set the component transaction property. The <b>Transaction </b>tab on the property sheet determines how a component supports transactions. You can select one of the following settings for component transaction properties:
<ul>
<li>
<b>Requires a transaction</b> This indicates that the component's objects must execute within the scope of a transaction. When a new object is created, its object context inherits the transaction from the context of the client. If the client doesn't have a transaction, MTS automatically creates a new transaction for the object.</li>
<li>
<b>Requires a new transaction</b> This indicates that the component's objects must execute within their own transactions. When a new object is created, Transaction Server automatically creates a new transaction for the object, regardless of whether its client has a transaction.</li>
<li>
<b>Supports transactions</b> This indicates that the component's objects can execute within the scope of their client's transactions. When a new object is created, its object context inherits the transaction from the context of the client. If the client doesn't have a transaction, the new context is also created without one.</li>
<li>
<b>Does not support transactions</b> This indicates that the component's objects shouldn't run within the scope of transactions. When a new object is created, its object context is created without a transaction, regardless of whether the client has a transaction.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Whenever an instance of a component is created, MTS checks the component's transaction attribute to determine whether the instance should run in a transaction. </p>
<p>
Not all components are designed to support transaction processing. If your component is not designed to use transaction processing, make sure that the transaction attribute on the component's <b>Transaction </b>tab is set to <b>Does not support transactions</b>. </p>
<p>
Note that you cannot modify transaction attributes if components in the package have been <i>locked</i>. For more details, see <a href="create_96p1.htm">Locking Your Package</a>. </p>
