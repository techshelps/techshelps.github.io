<h1><a name="asaddinganewusertoarole"></a>Managing Users for MTS Roles</h1>
<p>
As an <a href="vipdef01_1yih.htm#asdefadministrator">administrator</a>, you will have manage a <a href="vipdef01_1yih.htm#asdefrole">role's</a> Windows NT users and groups of users by:
<ul>
<li>
Adding a new user or group to a role</li>
<li>
Removing a user or group from a role</li>
<li>
Moving a user or group from one role to another</li>
</ul>
<p>
As clients of your server packages increase, use the MTS Explorer to map the new users to roles for the package. For more information about mapping new users to a role, refer to the <a href="install_9qwj.htm">Mapping MTS Roles to Users and Groups</a> topic.</p>
<p>
You may have to remove users from a role, or move users or groups of users from an existing role to a newly created role. For example, if an employee leaves the company, you would remove that user from the roles with which the former employee was associated. </p>
<p>
When you create new roles for an existing package, you may have to move a user or a group of users from one role to another. For example, if you create a Clerk role for an Accounting package, you may have to move some users or a group of users from the existing Manager role (with read and write privileges for Accounting data) to the Clerk role (with read-only privileges). In order to move users or groups of users, you must remove the user or group of users from the role and then map them to the new role.</p>
