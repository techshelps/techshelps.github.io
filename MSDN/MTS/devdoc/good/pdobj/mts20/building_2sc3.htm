<h1><a name="asdebuggingmtscomponents"></a>Debugging MTS Components</h1>
<p>
This document describes techniques for debugging MTS components written in Microsoft® Visual Basic®, Microsoft Visual C++®, and Microsoft Visual J++™. These techniques are just suggestions for successfully debugging MTS components; you can choose your debugging environment and techniques according to your application needs.</p>
<p>
If you are using MTS components in a distributed environment, it is recommended that you debug your components on a single computer before deploying to multiple servers. Components that function without error in a package on a local computer usually run successfully over a distributed network. If you do encounter problems with distributed components, you must test and debug both the client and server machines to determine the problem. It is also recommended that you stress test your application with as many clients as possible. You can build a test client that simulates multiple clients to perform the stress test on your application.</p>
