The transaction is aborting. MS DTC is notifying all participants that the transaction must abort.</p>

It is not possible to change the transaction outcome at this point.</p>

<td width=35%><img src="images/aborted.gif" border=0></td>
<td width=65%><b>Aborted</b><p>
The transaction has aborted. All participants have been notified. Once a transaction has aborted, it is immediately removed from the list of transactions in the MS DTC Transactions window.</p>
<p>
It is not possible to change the transaction outcome at this point.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=35%><img src="images/preprng.gif" border=0></td>
<td width=65%><b>Preparing</b><p>
The client application has issued a commit request. MS DTC is collecting prepare responses from all participants.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=35%><img src="images/prepard.gif" border=0></td>
<td width=65%><b>Prepared</b><p>

<tr valign=top>
<td width=35%><img src="images/indoubt.gif" border=0></td>
<td width=65%><b>In Doubt</b><p>
The transaction is prepared, is coordinated by a different MS DTC, and the coordinating MS DTC is inaccessible. The system administrator can force the transaction to commit or abort by right-clicking in the Transactions window and choosing the <b>Resolve/Commit</b> or <b>Resolve/Abort</b> command. Once an outcome is forced, the transaction is designated as forced commit or forced abort.</p>
<p>
<b>Caution</b>  Do not manually force an <a href="vipdef01_1yih.htm#asdefindoubttransaction">in-doubt transaction</a> until you have read the <a href="transactions_3yer.htm">Resolving MTS Transactions</a> topic.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=35%><img src="images/txforced.gif" border=0></td>
<td width=65%><b>Forced Commit</b><p>
The administrator forced the in-doubt transaction to commit (see the <a href="transactions_3yer.htm">Resolving MTS Transactions</a> topic).</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=35%><img src="images/forceab.gif" border=0></td>

</td>

<tr valign=top>
<td width=35%><img src="images/notifyc.gif" border=0></td>
<td width=65%><b>Committing</b><p>
The transaction has prepared successfully and MS DTC is notifying participants that the transaction has been committed. MS DTC does not end the transaction until all participants have acknowledged receiving (and logging) the commit request.</p>
<p>
It is not possible to change the transaction outcome at this point.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=35%><img src="images/aborting.gif" border=0></td>
<td width=65%><b>Cannot Notify Aborted</b><p>
MS DTC has notified all connected participants that the transaction has aborted. The only participants not notified are those that are currently inaccessible.</p>
<p>
This transaction state occurs when MS DTC must inform any resource manager (such as an IBM LU 6.2 system) that a transaction has aborted but is unable to do so because the connection to the IBM system is down.</p>
<p>
The system administrator can force MS DTC to forget the transaction by right-clicking in the Transactions window and choosing the <b>Resolve/Forget</b> command.</p>
<p>
<b>Caution</b>  Do not manually forget a transaction until you have read the <a href="transactions_3yer.htm">Resolving MTS Transactions</a> topic.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=35%><img src="images/onlyfail.gif" border=0></td>
<td width=65%><b>Cannot Notify Committed</b><p>
MS DTC has notified all connected participants that the transaction has committed. The only participants not notified are those that are currently inaccessible.</p>
<p>
The system administrator can force MS DTC to forget the transaction by right-clicking in the Transactions window and choosing the <b>Resolve/Forget </b>command.</p>
<p>
<b>Caution</b>  Do not manually forget a transaction until you have read the <a href="transactions_3yer.htm">Resolving MTS Transactions</a> topic. </p>

</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=35%><img src="images/comit.gif" border=0></td>
