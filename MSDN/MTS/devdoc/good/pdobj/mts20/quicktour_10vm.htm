<h1><a name="aswhatismicrosofttransactionserver"></a>What Is Microsoft Transaction Server?</h1>
<p>
MTS is a component-based transaction processing system for building, deploying, and administering robust Internet and intranet server applications. In addition, MTS allows you to deploy and administer your MTS server applications with a rich graphical tool (MTS Explorer). </p>
<p>
MTS provides the following features:<b>‹</b></p>

<tr valign=top>
<td width=6%><img src="images/chiclet.gif" border=0></td>
<td width=94%>Application programming interfaces and <i>resource dispensers </i>for making applications scalable and robust. Resource dispensers<i> </i>are services that manage non-durable shared state on behalf of the application components within a process.</td>

<td width=6%><img src="images/chiclet.gif" border=0></td>
<td width=94%>Three sample applications that demonstrate how to use the application programming interface (API) to build MTS components, and use scriptable administration objects to automate deployment procedures in the MTS Explorer.</td>

<p>
The MTS programming model provides a framework for developing <a href="vipdef01_1yih.htm#asdefvipercomponent">components</a> that encapsulate business logic. The MTS run-time environment is a middle-tier platform for running these components. You can use the MTS Explorer to register and manage components executing in the MTS run-time environment.</p>
<p>
The three-tiered programming model provides an opportunity for developers and administrators to move beyond the constraints of two-tier client/server applications. You have more flexibility for deploying and managing three-tiered applications because:
<ul>
<li>
The three-tier model emphasizes a logical architecture for applications, rather than a physical one. Any service may invoke any other service and may reside anywhere.</li>
<li>
These applications are distributed, which means you can run the right components in the right places, benefiting users and optimizing use of network and computer resources.</li>
</ul>
