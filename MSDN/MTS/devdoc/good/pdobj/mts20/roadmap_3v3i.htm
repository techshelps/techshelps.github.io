<p>
After the <a href="vipdef01_1yih.htm#asdefcomponent">components</a> of an MTS application have been built and packaged, you then distribute the application to clients.You distribute applications in the following ways:
<ul>
<li>
Push components from your server computer to a system or Web site administrator’s server computer using the MTS Explorer. In this case, it is required that both server computers be running MTS.</li>
<li>
Use the <a href="vipdef01_1yih.htm#asdefapplicationexe">application executable utility</a> in the MTS Explorer to automatically generate application executables that reference a remote server. The client application does not have be running MTS.</li>
</ul>
<p>
It is recommended that you use the MTS Explorer application executable utility to distribute your server package to clients who may or may not have MTS on their computers. The application executable automatically configures a client computer to access components running on a remote MTS server. You can also configure remote components manually using the MTS Explorer.</p>
<p>
Although using the application executable utility does not require programming knowledge, MTS application distributors should be thoroughly familiar with the implications of packaging and shipping client and server applications. For example, improper packaging of your application may result in providing clients with server application code in the client executable.</p>
