<h1><a name="aswhatsnewinmts"></a>What's New in MTS</h1>
<p>
Microsoft Transaction Server (MTS) version 2.0 contains many new features that facilitate deploying robust and scalable Internet and intranet applications. This section provides a summaries of new features in MTS.</p>
<p>
<b>Complete integration with Internet Information Server (IIS) version 4.0</b></p>
<p>
MTS 2.0 is tightly integrated with IIS 4.0, creating the best platform for business applications on the Web. New features from the integration of MTS and IIS include:
<ul>
<li>
Transactional Active Server Pages</li>
</ul>
<p>
Scripts in Active Server Pages can now execute within an MTS-managed transaction. This extends the benefits of MTS transaction protection to the entire Web application.
<ul>
<li>
Crash Protection for IIS Applications</li>
</ul>
<p>
IIS Web applications can now execute within their own MTS package, providing process isolation and crash protection for Web applications.
<ul>
<li>
Transactional Events</li>
</ul>
<p>
Developers can embed commands into scripts on Active Server Pages, enabling customization of Web application response based on transaction outcome.
<ul>
<li>
Object Context for IIS Built-In Objects</li>
</ul>
<p>
The MTS object context mechanism, which masks the complexity of tracking user state information from the application developer, can now track state information managed by the IIS built-in objects. This extends the simplicity of the MTS programming model to Web developers. 
<ul>
<li>
Common Installation and Management</li>
</ul>
<p>
MTS and IIS now share common installation and a common management console, lowering the complexity of deploying and managing business applications on the Web.</p>
<p>
<b>Support for the XA transaction protocol, including native support for Oracle</b>
<ul>
<li>
MTS 2.0 supports the XA transaction protocol, which enables MTS applications to work with IBM DB2, Informix, and other XA-compliant databases running on Windows NT Server and non-Microsoft operating systems (including versions of UNIX) via ODBC. </li>
<li>
Vendors of XA-compliant databases are in the process of testing their ODBC drivers for XA interoperability with MTS 2.0; contact your database vendor for more information.</li>
<li>
MTS 2.0 includes a revision to Microsoft’s ODBC driver for Oracle, enabling MTS applications to directly manage transactions with Oracle version 7.3 or greater via ODBC.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<b>Desktop Operating System Support</b></p>
<p>
MTS 2.0 can be used with both the Windows NT version 4.0 and Windows 95 operating systems. MTS support for Microsoft’s desktop operating systems enables businesses to deploy stand-alone versions of their MTS applications.
<ul>
<li>
Windows 95 can be used as a development platform for developing MTS components prior to deployment on a Windows NT server. A Windows 95 computer can also be used as an administration client for a MTS server application running on Windows NT. In addition, MTS provides the runtime environment for the Personal Web Server (PWS), which runs on Windows 95.</li>
<li>
Due to the differences between Windows NT and Windows 95, MTS on Windows 95 does not support Microsoft Cluster Server or MTS role-based security. You cannot remotely administer a Windows 95 machine running MTS from a computer running Windows NT or Windows 95. Also, the Microsoft Visual Basic Scripting Edition (VBScript) samples demonstrating how to automate MTS administration are not installed with MTS on Windows 95 computers.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<b>Microsoft Cluster Server Support</b></p>
<p>
MTS 2.0 supports Microsoft Cluster Server (MSCS), which enables automatic failover of MTS packages in a cluster. Automatic failover enables high availability for MTS applications.</p>
<p>
<b>Support for CICS and IMS transactions via LU 6.2 Sync Level 2</b></p>
<p>
MTS 2.0 enables businesses to deploy MTS applications that support CICS and IMS transactions on MVS. MTS offers full support for beta 2 or later of Cedar, the SNA Server component that provides interoperability between MTS and CICS/MVS and IMS/MVS.</p>
<p>
<b>Administration Enhancements</b></p>
<p>
MTS 2.0 provides administration enhancements that facilitate deploying and administering MTS packages, including:
<ul>
<li>
Snap-in MTS Explorer</li>
</ul>
<p>
The MTS Explorer is now a Microsoft Management Console (MMC) snap-in. You can manage your MTS packages in the same administrative console as other products, such as IIS. For more information about MMC and using snap-ins, see the MMC documentation. 
<ul>
<li>
Shut-down of individual server processes</li>
</ul>
<p>
In MTS 2.0, you can shut down individual packages in the MTS Explorer without shutting down the MTS server process. Shutting down a package terminates that application’s server process. 
<ul>
<li>
Improved activation settings for packages</li>
</ul>
<p>
In MTS 2.0, activation is only set at the package level. MTS no longer allows mixed activation for components in a package. In addition, you cannot run your package with the remote activation setting. Packages are either set at <b>Server</b> (local activation of components) or <b>Library</b> (client caller process activation of components).</p>
<p>
MTS 1.0 packages containing components that are all marked in-process will be automatically upgraded to a Library package when installing MTS 2.0. MTS 1.0 packages containing components that are all marked with the local activation setting will be automatically upgraded to a Server package. MTS 1.0 packages with mixed component activation must be manually configured as a Library or Server package.
<ul>
<li>
Multi-select capability for updating properties</li>
</ul>
<p>
You can select and modify the properties of multiple items in the MTS Explorer at the same time.
<ul>
<li>
Move components between packages</li>
</ul>
<p>
Components can be moved between packages by dragging and dropping the component from one package to another.</p>
<p>
<b>Programming enhancements</b></p>
<p>
MTS 2.0 has made it easier to build MTS applications with programming enhancements that include:
<ul>
<li>
New and updated MTS sample applications</li>
</ul>
<p>
Along with an updated Sample Bank application, MTS now offers two new sample applications. The Tic-Tac-Toe sample application demonstrates non-transactional components managing shared state in a simple multiuser game. The administrative sample scripts show you how to use the scriptable administration objects to automate procedures in the Explorer in a Windows Scripting Host script. 
<ul>
<li>
Scriptable Administration Objects</li>
</ul>
<p>
Package deployment and maintenance in the MTS Explorer can be automated using the scriptable administration objects. Using any Automation-compatible language, you can automate administrative procedures such as installing a package using a simple script.
<ul>
<li>
MTS application design and implementation documentation</li>
</ul>
<p>
The <i>MTS Programmer’s Guide</i> provides design and implementation guidance for creating an MTS application. Topics range from enacting business logic in components todiagnosing and debugging problems. </p>
