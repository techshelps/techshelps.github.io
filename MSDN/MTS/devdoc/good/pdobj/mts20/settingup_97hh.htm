<h1><a name="asvalidatingtictactoe"></a>Setting Up the MTS Tic-Tac-Toe Sample Application</h1>
<p>
The Tic-Tac-Toe sample application is a game that can be played with the computer or with another user on a remote MTS computer. Running the Tic-Tac-Toe application allows you to test your installation of MTS without SQL Server as well as practice package deployment and administration. The Tic-Tac-Toe sample application is located in the \MTS\Samples sub-directory.</p>
<p>
To run the Tic-Tac-Toe sample application, you need to:
<ul>
<li>
Install Microsoft Transaction Server.</li>
<li>
Run the Tic-Tac-Toe client, and play against the computer or another user.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<b><img src="images/prcarrow.gif" border=0>To start the Tic-Tac-Toe client</b>
<ol>
<li>
Run tClient.exe, located in the top-level of your MTS installation.</li>
<li>
Type your name in the <b>Your Name is…</b> box, and choose if you would like to play against the computer (Deep Viper) or another user. To learn how to play against a remote user, refer to the <a href="distribute_8p6b.htm">Working with Remote MTS Computers</a> topic.</li>
</ol>
<p>
After you start playing the game, go back to the MTS Explorer. Notice that the Tic-Tac-Toe server component icon is now spinning, indicating that it is activated and that your MTS installation is correct. If you stop the game, the icon stops spinning because the Tic-Tac-Toe client is no longer using the Tic-Tac-Toe server component. </p>
<p>
If you click the <b>Status view</b> command on the <b>View</b> menu, you can see usage information about the Tic-Tac-Toe component.</p>
