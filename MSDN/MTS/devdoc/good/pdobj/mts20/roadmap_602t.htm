<h1><a name="asroadmaptothemtsadministratorsguide"></a>Roadmap to the MTS Administrator’s Guide</h1>
<p>
The MTS Administrator’s Guide<i> </i>describes how and when to use the <a href="vipdef01_1yih.htm#asdefmicrosofttransactionserverexplorer">Microsoft® Transaction Server Explorer</a> to create, install, distribute, and maintain <a href="vipdef01_1yih.htm#asdefpackage">packages</a>. This guide contains information for the following users:
<ul>
<li>
System administrators</li>
<li>
Web administrators </li>
<li>
Application developers</li>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<p>
Developers can refer to the procedures when creating, deploying, and distributing MTS applications. System and Web administrators can use the task-oriented procedures for the MTS Explorer to deploy, administer and maintain MTS applications. </p>
<p>
The following sections describe what it means to deploy and administer packages with the MTS Explorer, and provide links to more detailed procedural topics:<i> </i>

<h2>MTS Explorer on Windows 95</h2>
<p>
You can manage your MTS packages using the MTS Explorer on the Windows® 95 operating system. However, MTS administration on Windows 95 has the following limitations:
<ul>
<li>
You can use a Windows NT computer to remotely administer a Windows 95 computer if you run the Remote Registry service on the Windows 95 computer. The Remote Registry service allows you to change registry entries for a remote Windows 95 computer (given the appropriate permissions). </li>
</ul>
<p>
To obtain the Remote Registry service, go to the \Admin\Nettols\Remotereg sub-directory on the Windows 95 CD. Review the Regserv.txt file for instructions on installing the Remote Registry service, and then run the Remote Registry setup program (Regserv.exe).
<ul>
<li>
You cannot remotely administer MTS running on Windows 95 from another Windows 95 computer nor a Windows NT computer.</li>
<li>
The left tree pane in the MTS Explorer does not appear. To navigate, double-click icons to move down the hierarchy and then click the <b>Up one level</b> toolbar button to move up the hierarchy.</li>
<li>
Because the <a href="vipdef01_1yih.htm#asdefapplicationexe">application executable utility</a> is not supported on Windows 95, you cannot use the MTS Explorer to generate executables. For more information on the application executable utility, see the <a href="distribute_70ab.htm">Generating MTS Executables</a> topic.</li>
<li>
Windows 95 administration does not support MTS security properties or roles. Therefore, you will not be able to view the Roles, Role Membership, or Users folders in the Explorer.</li>
<li>
<a href="vipdef01_1yih.htm#asdefcomponent">Components</a> running on Windows 95 cannot be accessed remotely from a client on another computer. </li>
<li>
Because Windows 95 does not have a system event log, event log entries are written to an HTML file named Transaction Server.html, which is located in the \MTSLogs subdirectory in the Windows directory. You can use this HTML file to monitor any significant occurrence in the system or a program.</li>
</ul>
