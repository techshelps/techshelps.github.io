<tr valign=top>
<td width=11%>m1.1</td>
<td width=89%>During recovery, the resource manager first does the Resource Manager Start Up procedure described above. As a result of these start-up steps, the resource manager obtains a pointer to the <b>IResourceManager</b> interface.</td>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=11%>m1.2</td>
<td width=89%>The resource manager reads its log file and determines which transactions are in-doubt. For each of these transactions it calls the <b>IResourceManager::Reenlist</b> method. The resource manager passes in both the prepare information it was originally given by the transaction manager and a time-out value which indicates how long the resource manager is willing to wait to learn the outcome of the transaction.</td>

<tr valign=top>
<td width=11%>m2</td>
<td width=89%>The MS DTC proxy communicates this information to the transaction manager.</td>

<tr valign=top>
<td width=11%>m3</td>
<td width=89%>The transaction manager determines the outcome of the transaction, if possible, and returns the transaction outcome to the MS DTC proxy.</td>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=11%>m4</td>
<td width=89%>The MS DTC proxy responds to the resource manager indicating whether the in-doubt transaction was committed or aborted. If the transaction’s outcome cannot be determined before the time-out expires, then a re-enlistment time-out error is returned to the resource manager.</td>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=11%>m5.1</td>
<td width=89%>The resource manager records each transaction’s outcome by writing a commit or abort record in the resource manager log file.</td>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=11%>m5.2</td>
<td width=89%>When the resource manager has determined the outcome of all in-doubt transactions, it invokes the <b>IResourceManager::ReenlistmentComplete</b> method. The resource manager uses this method to inform the transaction manager that the resource manager knows the outcome of all in-doubt transactions  in which it is involved.</td>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=11%>m6</td>
<td width=89%>The MS DTC proxy informs the transaction manager that recovery is complete.</td>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=11%>m7</td>
<td width=89%>The transaction manager discards any information it was keeping regarding committed transactions that this resource manager might have been involved in.</td>
