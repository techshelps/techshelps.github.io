<h1><a name="asmicrosoftdistributedtransactioncoordinator"></a>Microsoft Distributed Transaction Coordinator</h1>
<p>
Microsoft® Distributed Transaction Coordinator (MS DTC) is a distributed transaction facility for Microsoft Windows NT® and Microsoft Windows 95. MS DTC uses proven transaction processing technology: it is robust despite system failures, process failures, and communication failures; it exploits loosely coupled systems to provide scalable performance; and it’s easy to install, configure, and manage. To meet its design objectives, MS DTC:
<ul>
<li>
Lowers the cost of Enterprise computing—MS DTC provides a sophisticated, low cost distributed transaction facility for users of networked commodity-priced PCs and servers.</li>
<li>
Simplifies application development—MS DTC transactions greatly simplify the application programmer’s task of preserving consistency, despite failures that can occur when updating application data.</li>
<li>
Provides a consistent transaction model—MS DTC supports a variety of resource managers, including relational databases, object-oriented databases, file systems, document storage systems, and message queues.</li>
<li>
Enables software development using distributed, object-oriented, software components—MS DTC is based on the OLE Transactions interface standard, which provides a simple, object-oriented application programming interface for initiating and controlling transactions.</li>
</ul>
<p>
With MS DTC version 1.0:
<ul>
<li>
Application programs can reliably update data residing on two or more OLE Transactions-compliant resource managers. The client application may reside on a Windows 95 or Windows NT system, and the resource managers may reside on one or more Windows NT systems.</li>
<li>
You can use an OLE Transactions-compliant resource manager with an X/Open-compliant Transaction Processing monitor, such as Encina, TopEnd, and Tuxedo.</li>
</ul>
<p>
MS DTC is not recommended for replicating a database for decision support or high availability. Microsoft recommends that you use the data replication services provided with your relational database application. For more information, see <a href="rmguidetug_4w38.htm">Data Replication for Decision Support</a>.</p>
<p>
MS DTC is also not recommended for applications that tolerate data inconsistency. MS DTC is not a cost-effective solution for these types of applications.</p>
