<td width=84%>When MS DTC is installed, the Setup program generates a GUID that uniquely identifies this instance of the MS DTC transaction manager. Setup permanently records this GUID (guidTM) in the system registry. This is done on every system on which an MS DTC transaction manager is installed. As a result, each MS DTC transaction manager on each system has a guidTM that uniquely identifies it.</td>

<td width=84%>When the resource manager setup program is run, it generates a GUID that uniquely identifies the resource manager. Setup permanently records this GUID (guidRM) in a place where the resource manager can easily retrieve it. Alternatively, the resource manager can generate and record a guidRM when it is first executed. In either case, each resource manager on each system has a guidRM that uniquely identifies it.</td>
