<p>
At any one time, a resource is either in use or not in use, and is either enlisted or not enlisted in a transaction. This yields four possible resource states.</p>
<h5>Resources in Unenlisted Inventory</h5>
<p>
A resource which is not in use by a object and not enlisted in a transaction is in <i>unenlisted inventory</i>. A resource in general inventory is available for assignment.</p>
<h5>Resources in Enlisted Inventory</h5>
<p>
A resource which is not in use by a object but is enlisted in a transaction is in <i>enlisted inventory</i>. Such a resource is available for assignment only to objects running in the same transaction. A resource moves from enlisted inventory to unenlisted inventory when MTS Executive notifies DispMan that the transaction is complete.</p>
<h5>Resources In Unenlisted Use</h5>
<p>
If a resource is assigned to a object, and the instance is not running in a transaction, or the resource dispenser has identified the resource as not transactional, then this resource is in <i>unenlisted use</i>.</p>
<h5>Resources In Enlisted Use</h5>
<p>
If a resource is assigned to a object, and the instance is running in a transaction, and the resource dispenser has successfully enlisted the resource in the transaction, then this resource is in <i>enlisted use</i>.</p>
