<h1><a name="asenlistmentobject"></a>Enlistment Object</h1>
<p>
The <i>enlistment object</i> represents the relationship between a resource manager and a transaction object on which the resource manager has enlisted. An enlistment object is created each time a resource manager enlists in a transaction. MS DTC uses the enlistment object to determine which resource managers to involve in the two-phase commit process.</p>
<table cellspacing=5 cols=2>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=20%>Origin:</td>
<td width=80%>A resource manager creates an enlistment object by calling the<i> </i><b>IResourceManager::Enlist</b> method. The resource manager typically does this as part of importing a transaction.</td>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=20%>Occurrences:</td>
<td width=80%>One instance of the enlistment object is present for each call to the <b>IResourceManager::Enlist</b> method. Typically, a resource manager enlists in each transaction only once. However, MS DTC permits a resource manager to enlist in a transaction as many times as it chooses. Multiple enlistments could occur, for example, if the same transaction is imported to the resource manager from more than one RM proxy.</td>

<tr valign=top>
<td width=20%>Duration:</td>
<td width=80%>The enlistment object exists for the life of the transactions. It should be released when the transaction completes.</td>
