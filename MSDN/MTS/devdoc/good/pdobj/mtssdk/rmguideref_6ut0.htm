<b>Parameters</b></p>
<p>
<i>pboidReason</i> [in]<br>
An optional BOID that indicates why the transaction is being aborted. This argument may be NULL indicating that no abort reason is provided.</p>
<p>
<i>fRetaining</i> [in]<br>
Must be FALSE.</p>
<p>
<i>fAsync</i> [in]<br>
When <i>fAsync</i> is TRUE, an asynchronous abort is performed and the caller must use <b>ITransactionOutcomeEvents</b><i> </i>to learn the outcome of the transaction.</p>
<p>
<b>Return Values</b></p>
<p>
S_OK<br>
Success: the transaction was successfully aborted.</p>
<p>
XACT_S_ASYNC<br>

<p>
XACT_E_NOTRANSACTION<br>
Unable to abort the transaction because it had already been committed or aborted. This call was ignored.</p>
<p>
XACT_E_ALREADYINPROGRESS<br>
A <b>Commit</b> operation was already in progress. This call was ignored.</p>
<p>
XACT_E_CANTRETAIN<br>
Retaining <b>Abort</b> is not supported. This call was ignored.</p>
<p>
E_FAIL<br>
The transaction failed to abort for an unspecified reason.</p>
<p>
E_UNEXPECTED<br>
An unexpected error has occurred. The transaction status is unknown.</p>
<p>
XACT_S_ABORTING<br>
An <b>Abort</b> operation was already in progress. This call was ignored.</p>
<p>
XACT_E_INDOUBT<br>
The transaction status is in-doubt. A communication failure has occurred or a transaction manager or resource manager has failed. </p>
<p>
XACT_E_CONNECTION_DOWN<br>
No longer able to communicate with the transaction manager because the connection to the transaction manager failed. The transaction state is unknown.</p>
<p>
<b>Comments</b></p>
<p>
The initiator of the transaction may abort the transaction as may any resource manager enlisted on the transaction.</p>
<p>
<b>Abort</b> may be invoked on a transaction repeatedly. XACT_S_ABORTING HRESULT will be returned following the first invocation of <b>Abort</b>.</p>
<p>
If a communication failure occurs during a call to <b>Commit</b> or <b>Abort</b>, the status of the transaction is unknown.</p>
