<h1><a name="asenlistinginnewtransactions"></a>Enlisting in New Transactions</h1>
<p>
The resource manager can start enlisting in new transactions after it establishes a relationship with MS DTC. The resource manager then obtains an <b>ITransaction</b> interface to a transaction and enlists in this transaction by invoking the <b>IResourceManager::Enlist</b> method. One of the parameters to this method is an instance of <b>ITransactionResourceAsync</b>. Once the resource manager has enlisted in a transaction, it is expected to participate in the <i>two-phase commit</i> protocol. When the initiator of the transaction invokes the <b>ITransaction::Commit</b> method, MS DTC initiates the voting phase of the two-phase commit protocol. The first phase notifications are delivered to each participant (such as a resource manager) that is enlisted in the transaction. This notification is delivered by invoking the <b>ITransactionResourceAsync::PrepareRequest</b> method. The resource manager then performs the relevant work to move from an <i>active</i> state to a <i>prepared</i> state and on moving to the prepared state invokes the <b>ITransactionEnlistementAsync::PrepareRequestDone</b> method. Similarly, the decision phase notification is provided to each enlisted participant by the invocation of the <b>ITransactionResourceAsync::CommitRequest</b> method. A resource manager responds to this notification by invoking the <b>ITransactionEnlistment::CommitRequestDone</b> method. The <b>Abort</b> notification also works the same way as the first phase notification. However, there is no second phase in the case of an <b>Abort</b>.</p>
<p>
A resource manager can obtain the <b>ITransaction</b> interface for enlistment in the following ways:
<ol>
<li>
A resource manager can initiate a transaction. The resource manager obtains the MS DTC transaction by invoking the <a href="rmguideref_9zn2.htm"><b>ITransactionDispenser::BeginTransaction</b></a> method.</li>
<li>
An in-process application component can initiate a transaction. See the <a href="rmguidetug_9iic.htm">Transaction Initiated by an In-Process Component</a> topic for more information.</li>
<li>
Propagation of a transaction. See the <a href="rmguidetug_52jy.htm">Transaction Propagation</a> topic for more information</li>
</ol>
