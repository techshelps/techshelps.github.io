<h1><a name="asinterfaceandfunctionsummary"></a>Interface and Function Summary</h1>
<p>
The OLE Transactions interfaces and functions can be divided into the following groups based on the functions they provide:
<ol>
<li>
<a href="rmguideref_64tv.htm">Utility Interfaces and Functions</a>듯sed to establish the initial connection to MS DTC and to locate the<b> </b>MS DTC proxy core object given a transaction object.</li>
<li>
<a href="rmguideref_4y0j.htm">Transaction Initiation and Control Interfaces</a>듯sed by application programs and resource managers to begin, commit, and abort transactions, and to determine the status of transactions.</li>
<li>
<a href="rmguideref_31rn.htm">Transaction Propagation Interfaces</a>듯sed by the RM proxy and resource managers to propagate transactions between processes and between systems.</li>
<li>
<a href="rmguideref_3lpv.htm">Resource Manager Interfaces</a>듯sed by transaction managers and resource managers to communicate. The resource manager uses these interfaces to enlist in transactions and to recover transactions following a failure. The resource manager implements one of these interfaces as a <i>callback</i> interface. The resource manager is called on this interface if the transaction manager fails.</li>
<li>
<a href="rmguideref_8kz7.htm">Transaction Coordination (Two-phase Commit) Interfaces</a>듯sed by transaction managers and resource managers to perform the two-phase commit protocol.</li>
<li>
<a href="rmguideref_1gz7.htm">Transaction Voter Interfaces</a>듯sed to notify application servers of distributed transaction outcomes and to veto atomic commitment during the first phase of the two-phase commit protocol.</li>
</ol>
