<h1><a name="asparticipantsinanoletransactions"></a>Participants in OLE Transactions</h1>
<p>
The following are participants in an OLE transaction:
<ul>
<li>
Client application program</li>
<li>
Resource manager proxy</li>
</ul>
<p>
Most resource managers include application programming interfaces that application programs may invoke to perform resource manage functions. The application programming interfaces are customarily packaged as dynamic link library routines. We refer to this collection of interfaces as the resource manager proxy.
<ul>
<li>
Resource manager</li>
</ul>
<p>
A subsystem that implements a transaction-protected resource. The resource manager typically provides services to application programs or other resource managers. Examples of such resource managers include: relational databases, object-oriented databases, file systems, document storage systems, and message queues.
<ul>
<li>
Microsoft Distributed Transaction Coordinator proxy</li>
</ul>
<p>
The MS DTC proxy contains the methods that application programs and resource managers invoke to participate in MS DTC transactions. The MS DTC proxy is a set of dynamic link libraries provided as a part of MS DTC. The MS DTC proxy library is present on each Windows NT system containing a resource manager and each Windows NT or Windows '95 system containing an application program that initiates an MS DTC transaction.
<ul>
<li>
Microsoft Distributed Transaction Coordinator transaction manager</li>
</ul>
<p>
The MS DTC transaction manager is the process responsible for coordinating MS DTC transactions. One MS DTC transaction manager process is present on each Windows NT system containing a resource manager. Each MS DTC transaction manager maintains an MS DTC log file on its local system. The log file records the outcome of all transactions in which the MS DTC transaction manager participates.</p>
<p>
The following figures illustrate three types of OLE transactions:
<ul>
<li>
Application program-initiated OLE transaction</li>
<li>
Resource manager-initiated OLE transaction</li>
<li>
Application program-initiated OLE transaction involving two resource managers and a remote transaction coordinator</li>
</ul>
