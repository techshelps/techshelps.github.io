<h1><a name="asoletransactionsmodel"></a>OLE Transactions Model</h1>
<p>
The OLE Transactions standard supports conventional, <i>flat transactions</i>. A transaction may be initiated by a client on a Windows 95 or a Windows NT system. Only the <i>transaction initiator</i> may commit the transaction, and may abort the transaction at any time by calling <b>Abort</b> (provided it has not previously called <b>Commit</b>.)</p>
<p>
The client who initiates a transaction may propagate the transaction to one or more resource managers. These resource managers may reside on a single Windows NT system, or they may be distributed across a network of Windows NT systems. A resource manager may propagate the transaction to other resource managers, and any participating resource manager may abort that transaction.</p>
<p>
Microsoft intends to extend the OLE Transactions model by:
<ul>
<li>
Supporting transactions that can retain <i>locks</i> and <i>cursors</i> across transaction boundaries.</li>
<li>
Enabling an application component invoked as part of a larger transaction to abort and undo its work without causing the entire transaction to abort.</li>
<li>
Supporting distributed two-phase commit on non-Microsoft platforms.</li>
<li>
Supporting heuristic commit or abort of in-doubt transactions. (Currently, the system administrator must resolve in-doubt transactions using the MS DTC administrative interface.)</li>
</ul>
