<td width=89%>The resource manager does the work necessary to commit the transaction. This includes releasing all locks held on behalf of the transaction. The resource manager then writes a Commit record for the transaction to the resource manager’s log file. If it chooses, the resource manager can do a lazy log file write to economize on log I/Os. When the write to the log finishes, the resource manager proceeds to the next step.</td>

<td width=89%>When all of the resource managers on the system have completed their phase two processing, the resource manager’s transaction manager writes a Forget record to its local transaction manager log file. If it chooses, the transaction manager can do a lazy log file write to economize on log I/Os. After the log write completes, the transaction manager forgets the transaction and proceeds to the next step.</td>
