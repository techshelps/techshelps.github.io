<h3><a name="_mq_reading_messages_with_cursors"></a>Reading Messages with Cursors</h3>
<p>
Cursors are used to read messages that are not necessarily at the front of the queue. Cursors can be application-defined or implied, depending on the development platform you are using. </p>
<p>
Using any number of application-defined cursors, C applications can navigate through a queue. Each cursor is independent of all other cursors, including those generated by other applications. Moving one cursor has no effect on where another cursor points.</p>
<p>
ActiveX applications cannot use multiple, application-defined cursors. They have a single, implied cursor to navigate through the queue. Each application's implied cursor is, however, independent of other application's cursors.</p>
<p>
Regardless of the development platform, there is no limit to the number of applications that can use cursors to navigate through a queue.</p>
