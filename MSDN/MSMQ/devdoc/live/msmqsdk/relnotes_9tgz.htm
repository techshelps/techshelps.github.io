<h1><a name="_mq_changes_in_activex_components"></a>Changes in ActiveX Components</h1>
<p>
When developing applications, you must use new names when specifying some of the parameters and properties of the ActiveX components supplied by the MSMQ and MSMQ Mail SDKs.</p>
<p>
These new ActiveX objects are not compatible with ActiveX objects that shipped in preliminary releases of MSMQ. All ActiveX binaries must be recompiled against the new MSMQ 1.0 components, and you may also need to edit source code due to object model changes.</p>
<p>
In addition to some entirely new names, the naming convention used with the MSMQ 1.0 ActiveX component implementation has removed Hungarian notation prefixes from the old names of all methods, properties, and parameters. </p>
<p>
If your applications use the MSMQ ActiveX components included with any of the MSMQ beta releases, you must edit the appropriate ActiveX methods, properties, and parameter names before running your application on MSMQ 1.0. This renaming requires that you edit many, if not all, of your existing programs. </p>
