<h2><a name="_mq_sending_messages_offline"></a>Sending Messages Offline</h2>
<p>
While the client computer is offline, the application can still send and read messages from its local queues. Messages sent while a computer is offline are stored locally and sent to their final destination when the client computer is reconnected to the network.</p>
<p>
When a message is sent, its message timers (<i>time-to-reach-queue</i> and <i>time-to-be-received</i>) start ticking as soon as the send operation succeeds, even if the client computer is offline.</p>
<p>
<b>Caution</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;Messages must be sent in <a href="msmqglos_3wvm.htm#_mq_recoverable_gly">recoverable</a> mode if the offline client computer is to be turned off. Messages sent in <a href="msmqglos_3wv9.htm#_mq_express_gly">express</a> mode are held in RAM and will be lost when the computer is turned off. To send recoverable messages, set the delivery property (<a href="mqprop_28e1.htm">PROPID_M_DELIVERY</a> or <b>MSMQMessage.<a href="mqactx_64ft.htm">Delivery</a></b>) of the message to MQMSG_DELIVERY_RECOVERABLE.</p>
