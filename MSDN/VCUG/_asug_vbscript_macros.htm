<p>
A VBScript macro is a procedure that contains VBScript commands and takes no parameters. A VBScript macro begins with a <code>Sub</code> statement, continues with VBScript commands that represent tasks you want to accomplish, and ends with an <code>End Sub</code> statement.</p>
<p>
You create a VBScript macro by recording it or writing it manually. The easiest way to create one is to record it. When you record a macro, the recorder tracks your actions, converts them into VBScript commands, and then inserts the commands into the macro.</p>
<p>
When you finish recording the macro, it is stored in a text file known as a macro file. You choose this file before you start writing or recording.</p>
<p>
To use a VBScript macro, you run it. If you expect to run it regularly, assign it to a toolbar button or to a key sequence. Then, you can run the macro by simply clicking the button or pressing the keys.</p>
