<p>
With add-ins or <a href="_asug_overview.3a_.vbscript_macros.htm">VBScript macros</a>, you can automate routine tasks in the Visual C++ Developer Studio environment. For example, you can update a project by automatically opening the project, changing some project files, saving the changes, and then rebuilding the project.</p>
<p>
You automate tasks by using Automation (formerly OLE Automation). With Automation, the Visual C++ environment and its components become objects you can control programmatically. For example, windows become objects you can activate and size programmatically. Similarly, documents become objects you can open, edit, and close programmatically.</p>
<p>
With add-ins, you automate tasks by adding commands to the Visual C++ environment. Each add-in can add one or more commands, and each command can perform one or more tasks. The number of commands and tasks is up to you.</p>
<p>
Optionally, add-ins can provide toolbar buttons and key sequences to carry out their commands. Without buttons or key sequences, however, you must carry out the commands from the command line.</p>
<p>
Creating an add-in is a three-step process. First, you write the code for the add-in. Second, you write code for adding commands, toolbar buttons, and key sequences. And third, you build and test the DLL for the add-in.</p>
<p>
After creating an add-in, you connect it to the environment. As it connects, the add-in adds its commands, toolbar buttons, and key sequences to the development environment. Later, if the add-in is not needed, you can remove its commands, buttons, and key sequences by disconnecting the add-in.</p>
<p>
To use an add-in, you carry out its commands by running them from the command line or by using the toolbar buttons or key sequences assigned to the commands.</p>
