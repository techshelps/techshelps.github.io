<p>
Whether you are editing or debugging, the windows for the Visual C++ workspaces and document views are fully adjustable. You can position windows for a project according to your preferences. Each project can have its own settings.</p>
<p>
Two common window types are document windows and docking windows. The position and size of document windows can be changed within the Visual C++ window. They can be maximized and minimized. Docking windows, however, attach to the borders of the application window, or float anywhere on your screen. </p>
<p>
To see an example of a document window, you can create or open a text file. Examples of docking windows are the Project Workspace window, the Output window, and debugging windows, such as Variables, Watch, and Locals. </p>
<p>
The layout for window types&nbsp;— that is, their visibility, position, and size&nbsp;— is associated either with a project, in the case of document windows, or with editing or debugging operations, in the case of docking windows.</p>
<p>
Once you have chosen a layout, the settings for that layout are retained with the project you are working on. If you close a project and later open it again, the document windows have the last layout that you used: The same windows are open, and they have the same sizes and positions. When you create layouts of docking windows or toolbars, either for editing, debugging, or viewing in full-screen mode, those layouts are used for all subsequent sessions until you change them again.</p>
<p class=indent>
<B><b>Note</b></B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some windows are neither document windows nor docking windows. For example, when you use a utility program listed on the Tools menu, such as Spy++, the characteristics of its windows are determined by the utility program. </p>
