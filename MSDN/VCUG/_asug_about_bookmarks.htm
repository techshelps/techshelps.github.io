You can set bookmarks to mark frequently accessed lines in your source file. Once a bookmark is set, you can use menu or keyboard commands to move to it. You can remove a bookmark when you no longer need it.</p>
<p>
You can use both named and unnamed bookmarks. Named bookmarks are saved between editing sessions. Once you create a named bookmark, you can jump to that location whether or not the file is open. Named bookmarks store both the line number and the column number of the location of the cursor when the bookmark was created. This location is adjusted whenever you edit the file. Even if you delete the characters around the bookmark, the bookmark remains in the correct location.</p>
<p>
Unnamed bookmarks are temporary. They are removed when the file containing them is closed or reloaded. Unnamed bookmarks store only the current line, not the column offset of the cursor. When a line containing an unnamed bookmark is deleted, the bookmark is also removed. You can jump to an unnamed bookmark by activating the file and using either the <b>BookmarkNext</b> or <b>BookmarkPrev</b> command. The advantage of unnamed bookmarks is that they are very easy to set (just use <b>BookmarkToggle</b>), and they provide you with visible feedback in the selection margin of your document.</p>
