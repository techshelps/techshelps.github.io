<p>
Before you create an add-in, you should consider the following design issues:
<ul type=disc>
<li>
What tasks will the add-in perform?<br><br></li>
<li>
Could you use a VBScript macro to perform these tasks?<p class=tl>
You can write a macro more quickly and easily than you can write an add-in. Before you begin, carefully consider the <a href="_asug_differences_between_vbscript_macros_and_developer_studio_add_ins.htm">differences</a> between macros and add-ins.</P></li>
<li>
What commands will the add-in use to perform its tasks?<br><br></li>
<li>
Which Developer Studio objects will you reference in the add-in's commands?<br><br></li>
<li>
Which Developer Studio methods and properties will you use in the add-in's commands?<br><br></li>
<li>
How many add-ins will you need?<p class=tl>
If you need several, you can combine them in the same DLL.</P></li>
<li>
Will the add-in display windows or dialog boxes?<p class=tl>
An add-in can display modal windows or dialog boxes; however, it cannot display modeless windows or dialog boxes. For details, see the <a href="_asug_enablemodeless_method.htm">EnableModeless</a> method.</P></li>
<li>
Will the add-in handle events?<p class=tl>
An add-in can handle events fired by Developer Studio objects. Additionally, an add-in can display a dialog box containing ActiveX controls that fire events in the add-in. The controls' container (the dialog box or add-in) can handle the events.</P></li>
<li>
Will the add-in control another application?<p class=tl>
An add-in can control another executable file (.EXE) by serving as an out-of-process controller for the other application.</P></li>
<li>
Will the add-in have more than one thread?<p class=tl>
If you create a multithreaded add-in, the results are unpredictable. An add-in can have multiple threads if none of them has a message pump and only one thread accesses the Developer Studio object model.</P></li>
<li>
Will the add-in carry out another add-in's commands?<br><br></li>
<li>
Will the add-in have a Help file?<p class=tl>
Visual C++ cannot display a Help file created for an add-in. The add-in must expose a dedicated command to display a Help file.</P></li>
</ul>
