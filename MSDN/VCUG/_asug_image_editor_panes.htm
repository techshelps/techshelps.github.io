The Image Editor window typically displays a image in two panes separated by a split bar. One view is actual size, and the other is enlarged (the default enlargement factor is 6). The views in these two panes are updated automatically: changes you make in one pane are immediately shown in the other. The two panes make it easy for you to work on an enlarged view of your image, in which you can distinguish individual pixels and, at the same time, observe the effect of your work on the actual-size view of the image.</p>
<p>
If the image is 200 x 200 pixels or larger, however, only one pane is displayed initially. Move the split bar to display both panes.</p>
<p>
You can change the magnification in a pane using the Magnify tool and the magnification factor in the options selector.</p>
<p>
You can use the two panes in other ways. For example, you might enlarge the smaller pane and use the two panes to show different regions of a large image. Click in the pane to select it. </p>
<p>
You can change the relative sizes of the panes by positioning the pointer on the split bar and moving the split bar to the right or left. The split bar can move all the way to either side if you want to work on only one pane.</p>
<p>
If the Image-editor pane is enlarged by a factor of 4 or greater, you can display a grid that delimits the individual pixels in the image.</p>
