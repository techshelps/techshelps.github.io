With toolbars you can organize the commands in Visual C++ the way you want to so you can find and use them quickly. You can easily customize toolbars — for example, you can add and remove menus and buttons, change the image or text for a button, create your own custom toolbars, hide or display toolbars, resize, and move toolbars. In previous versions of Visual C++, toolbars only contained buttons. Now toolbars can contain buttons, menus, or a combination of both.</p>
<p>
The <b>Menu Bar</b> is a special toolbar at the top of the screen that contains menus such as <b>File</b>, <b>Edit</b>, and <b>Build</b>. You can customize the <b>Menu Bar</b> the same way you customize any toolbar; for example, you can quickly add and remove buttons and menus. You can add existing commands to these menus and delete commands. If you delete a default command (a command supplied with the Visual C++ user interface) from a menu, you can choose later to put it back or add it to a different menu or toolbar.</p>
<p>
The only differences between the <b>Menu Bar</b> and other toolbars are:
<ul type=disc>
<li>
The <b>Menu Bar</b> always spans the full width of the window when docked horizontally.<br><br></li>
<li>
You cannot hide the <b>Menu Bar</b>, except when you are editing in full-screen mode. When you begin editing full-screen mode, the <b>Menu Bar</b> is hidden automatically, but you can choose to display it.</li>
</ul>
<p>
A menu displays a list of commands. Some of these commands have images next to them so you can more quickly identify the command you want. You can create a toolbar button, which may make the command easier to use.</p>
<p>
Depending on your workspace preferences, and the size of your screen, you can display as many toolbars as you want, or none at all. You can move the <b>Menu Bar</b>, even when you cannot hide it.</p>
