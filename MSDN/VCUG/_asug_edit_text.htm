With the Text editor, you can cut, copy, and paste selected text using menu commands or drag-and-drop operations. You can also undo and redo selected editing actions.</p>
<p>
The Text editor provides the following editing commands:
<ul type=disc>
<li>
Cutting, copying, pasting, and deleting text<br><br></li>
<li>
Undoing and redoing editing actions<br><br></li>
<li>
Using the drag-and-drop feature<br><br></li>
<li>
Specifying column blocks for editing</li>
</ul>
<p>
All editing commands require a selection in order to work. Some of the commands can make a selection based on the current cursor location. Command names that begin with an object (such as <b>WordCapitalize</b>) assume that object for a default selection; otherwise, the default selection will be the character adjacent to the cursor. For example, the <b>Delete</b> command removes the character to the right of the cursor if there is no selection.</p>
<p class=indent>
<B><b>Note</b></B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can enable the <b>Copy</b> command to work on the current line even if there is no selection. From the <b>Tools</b> menu, choose <b>Options</b>. Select the <b>Compatibility</b> tab, and click the <b>Enable copy without selection</b> option. This enables the <b>Copy</b> command to work on the current line if there is no selection.</p>
<p>
When you cut text from the file, the text is removed from your file and placed on the Clipboard. When you delete text from the file, the text is removed from your file, and the Clipboard is not used. All Windows applications share the same Clipboard. Commands that use the Clipboard overwrite whatever was previously placed onto the Clipboard by other commands or other Windows applications. This single-Clipboard behavior is true even when emulating an editor (such as Epsilon) that supports multiple Clipboards.</p>
