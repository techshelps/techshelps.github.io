<p>
You can automate tasks from within the Visual C++ Developer Studio environment by creating VBScript macros and Developer Studio add-ins. You can also automate tasks from other applications such as Visual Basic and Excel.</p>
<p>
You automate tasks by manipulating the environment (Developer Studio) and its components as objects. For example, you open, edit, and close a document by manipulating it as an object. Similarly, you activate or size a window by manipulating it as an object.</p>
<p>
You manipulate objects by using methods, properties, and events associated with the objects. Methods represent actions you take against the objects. Properties represent characteristics of the objects, such as their type or size. And, events represent conditions under which actions are taken against the objects.</p>
