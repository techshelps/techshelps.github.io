<p>
Even when WizardBar is not tracking context, you can use all the navigational and code–creation functionality available from WizardBar. The combo lists remain accessible, as do the <b>Action</b> control and the <b>Action</b> menu.</p>
<p>
There are several valid scenarios when WizardBar does not track your location in code.
<ul type=disc>
<li>
The current file may not belong to the active project.<p class=tl>
If your project contains a sub-project (dependent project), or if you have multiple projects open in the workspace, the file that has focus may not belong to the active project. In this case, you can <a href="vchowsettingactiveproject.htm">change the active project</a>.</P></li>
<li>
The current file may not be part of the project.<p class=tl>
The file you are viewing may belong to a separate project in the workspace, to another workspace entirely, or be included in the project for building purposes, but not actually belong to the project. For example, selecting <b>Open Include</b> from the WizardBar <b>Action</b> menu provides a list of all header files included in the current file. These header files may or may not belong to the project. Merely opening a file does not add the file to the project. </P><p class=tl>
If you decide to <a href="_asug_adding_and_removing_files_from_projects.htm#_asug_add_files_to_a_project">add the file to your project</a>, WizardBar then tracks the members in the file.</P></li>
<li>
The current file may be included in the project, but not written in a programming language.<p class=tl>
Non-buildable files such as plain text files, document server objects such as Excel spreadsheets, and so forth fall into this category.</P></li>
<li>
The window you are in might not support tracking.<p class=tl>
WizardBar tracking is not supported in product windows other than the Text editor or the Dialog editor. If focus is in a window such as the Output window or ClassView, WizardBar tracking is disabled.</P></li>
<li>
You might have multiple instances of the IDE opened simultaneously, and be viewing the same active project.<p class=tl>
In this case, WizardBar and ClassView both are available only in the first instance you open.</P></li>
</ul>
