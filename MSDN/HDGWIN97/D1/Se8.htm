<H2 CLASS="h1">Overview for Video Components</H2><P CLASS="t">This section presents the key design issues for video components under Microsoft Windows. New applications that require MPEG and other video playback for games or advanced graphics applications require high-performance support in the video hardware. </P>
<P CLASS="t">Key design issues for basic video requirements:</P>
<UL><LI>Power management for video devices. Under the OnNow design initiative, specifications are being developed for standard interpretation of the four standard device power states (D0 – D4) plus a set of minimum power capabilities for devices in this class. These specifications will cover power consumption, command latency, device functionality, and Wakeup event definitions.</LI><LI>Connection with consumer-electronics video devices, such as TV, VCR, camcorder, and so on.</LI><LI>High-quality playback of multiple audio/video source streams:

<UL><LI>DVD-ROM and CD-ROM movies, games, and applications</LI><LI>Digital broadcast satellite input</LI><LI>Internet, using ISDN, cable modem, ATM, DVB, and so on</LI><LI>Video conferencing</LI></UL></LI></UL><P CLASS="t">Key design issues for Entertainment PC 97:</P>
<UL><LI>For TV and movie watching, the system must provide full image quality, smooth playback, stereo or surround audio, and synchronized audio and video.
<P CLASS="lt1">This also means support for large-screen VGA monitors that offer higher resolution and better image quality than televisions offer. Large-screen VGA monitors will ensure a high-quality user experience for family-oriented and multiplayer computer entertainment applications. </P></LI><LI>Non-exclusive operation — that is, other tasks running in the system don't interrupt video. This is necessary for the PC to carry on background management tasks, such as downloading e-mail or handling an incoming telephone call, without impacting TV or movie playback. 
<P CLASS="lt1">For PCs at Entertainment PC 97 price level, customers expect that software should be capable of multitasking while providing more functionality and dramatically better content. Windows-based PCs can't deliver this if the CPU and PCI bus are overused. Therefore, the end-to-end video subsystem, from input source to rendering, must be capable of sustaining full quality playback and display for complex applications.</P></LI></UL></BODY></HTML>
