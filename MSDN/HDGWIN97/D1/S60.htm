<P CLASS="spacing"><BR></P><P CLASS="t">The Cable Power Distribution model for IEEE 1394 makes it easy to implement devices that serve as the source or consume cable power by defining specific requirements for power source, power sink and self-powered devices. This model reduces cabling constraints for end users while helping to ensure power availability for both managed and unmanaged IEEE 1394 environments. The power distribution model makes it easy to use cable power by reducing the likelihood of power-fault conditions while ensuring device interoperability and power-independent cabling. </P>
<P CLASS="t">The power distribution model also helps to provide a Plug and Play-compatible cabling environment for both managed and unmanaged power environments. Requirements in this specification enable unmanaged default configurations to function. Alternately, these requirements enable managed environments with an active PC bus manager to provide an enhanced Plug and Play experience.</P>
<P CLASS="h4"><B>9. Devices and controllers comply with "1394 Power Specification" from Microsoft</B></P>

<P CLASS="spacing"><BR></P><P CLASS="t">This specification addresses both cable (bus) powered and self-powered (AC powered) devices. The device power management architecture defines a standard Command and Status Register (CSR) protocol and IEEE 1394 device power states necessary for an intelligent bus manager to effectively manage device power consumption. Benefits include consistent device behavior, power conservation and instant ("OnNow") availability for end-user applications. </P>
<P CLASS="t">The IEEE 1394 power management architecture defines a framework for Soft Power_On, Soft Power_Shutdown, and Remote Wakeup. The architecture applies a number of key features defined in the IEEE 1394 standard to implement device power management including four standard device power states (D0 – D3), power status CSRs, and device wakeup signaling. Together, these capabilities enable power conservation while providing for OnNow-compatible device environments.</P></BODY></HTML>
