<H2 CLASS="h1">I</H2><P CLASS="h4"><B>IDE</B></P>
<P CLASS="t">Acronym for Integrated Device Electronics. A type of disk-drive interface where the controller electronics reside on the drive itself, eliminating the need for a separate adapter card.</P>
<P CLASS="h4"><B>IHV</B></P>
<P CLASS="t">Acronym for independent hardware vendor.</P>
<P CLASS="h4"><B>I/O</B></P>
<P CLASS="t">Acronym for input/output. Two of the three activities that characterize a computer: input, processing, and output. This refers to the complementary tasks of gathering data for the microprocessor to work with and making the results available to the user through a device such as the monitor, disk drive, or printer.</P>
<P CLASS="h4"><B>INF file</B></P>
<P CLASS="t">A file created for a particular adapter that provides the Windows Setup program with the information required to set up that device, such as&nbsp;a list of valid logical configurations for the device, the names of driver files associated with the device, the values to be added or changed in the registry, and so on.</P>
<P CLASS="h4"><B>integrated devices</B></P>
<P CLASS="t">Any devices, such as parallel ports, graphics adapters, and so on, that are designed on the system board rather than on an expansion card.</P>
<P CLASS="h4"><B>IPL</B></P>
<P CLASS="t">Acronym for initial program load. A device used by the system during the boot process to load&nbsp;an operating system into memory.</P>
<P CLASS="h4"><B>IrDA</B></P>
<P CLASS="t">Acronym for Infrared Data Association. </P>
<P CLASS="h4"><B>IRP</B></P>
<P CLASS="t">Acronym for I/O request packet. Data structures that drivers use to communicate with each other.</P>
<P CLASS="h4"><B>IRQ</B></P>
<P CLASS="t">Acronym for interrupt request. A method by which a device can request to be serviced by the device's software driver. The system board uses a&nbsp;programmable interrupt controller (PIC) to monitor the priority of the requests from all devices. When a request occurs, the microprocessor suspends the current operation and gives control to the device driver associated with the interrupt number issued. The lower the number for example, IRQ 3, the higher the priority of the interrupt.</P>
<P CLASS="h4"><B>ISA</B></P>
<P CLASS="t">Acronym for Industry Standard Architecture bus. An expansion bus that provides a buffered interface from devices on expansion cards to the PC internal bus.</P>
<P CLASS="h4"><B>isolation</B></P>
<P CLASS="t">The process by which cards on an ISA bus are distinguished from each other after system startup.</P></BODY></HTML>
