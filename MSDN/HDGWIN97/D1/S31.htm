<H2 CLASS="h1">Overview for Workstation PC 97</H2><P CLASS="t">This section presents the key design features for Workstation PC 97. <I>PC&nbsp;97 Hardware Design Guide</I> provides the first definition of this PC category for the "Designed for Microsoft Windows" logo program.</P>
<P CLASS="t">Although the design requirements for Workstation PC&nbsp;97 can support running either the Windows&nbsp;95 or Windows NT operating system, these requirements are optimized to support complex Win32-based applications, which usually run on Windows&nbsp;NT Workstation, for users whose principal computing work involves using mission-critical networked applications, engineering or scientific applications, or media-authoring or software development tools. Although Windows&nbsp;NT Workstation is used on standalone systems, the PC&nbsp;97 requirements support the more common use of Windows&nbsp;NT Workstation as a platform for network productivity.</P>
<P CLASS="t">These are the key design issues for Workstation PC&nbsp;97:</P>
<UL><LI>PC&nbsp;97 requirements for implementing the new Advanced Configuration and Power Interface (ACPI), new bus class and device class power management requirements, and implementing USB in the system.</LI><LI>Recommendations for input components and graphics adapter capabilities, based on the intended use of the workstation.</LI></UL><P CLASS="it"><FONT CLASS="ih"><B>Important</B></FONT>  The system requirements defined in <I>PC&nbsp;97 Hardware Design Guide</I> provide guidelines for designing PC systems that best run Windows&nbsp;95 and Windows&nbsp;NT. These design requirements are not the basic system requirements for running the Windows operating system. Also, hardware features are described as <I>Required</I>, <I>Recommended</I>, or <I>Optional</I> for the "Designed for Microsoft Windows" logo program:</P>
<UL><LI><B>Required: </B>These are the basic hardware features that must be implemented to qualify for the "Designed for Microsoft Windows" logo. 
<P CLASS="lt1"><B>Recommended: </B>These features add functionality supported by the Windows operating systems. For "Designed for Microsoft Windows" logo testing, if a recommended feature is implemented, it must meet the standards for that feature as defined in this guide. Some recommended features might become requirements under the logo program in the future. </P></LI><LI><B>Optional: </B>These features are neither required nor recommended, but if the feature is implemented in a PC&nbsp;97 system, it must meet the specified requirements. These features will not become requirements under the logo program in the future.</LI></UL></BODY></HTML>
