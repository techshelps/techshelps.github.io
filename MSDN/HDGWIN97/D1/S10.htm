<H2 CLASS="h1">OnNow Design Initiative and PC Evolution</H2><P CLASS="t">For 1997 and beyond, platform advancements will focus in these areas:</P>
<UL><LI>Ease of use. The combination of hardware, software, and operating system interfaces still make it difficult for a novice to walk up and effectively use a PC for the first time. </LI><LI>Serviceability. This relates to the availability and simplicity of the PC for performing tasks that the customer may encounter in everyday life. </LI><LI>Extensibility and accessibility. PC systems must be capable of easily incorporating new technologies, rather than becoming obsolete as new technologies are introduced. New capabilities must be as easy to implement in a PC system for the user as plugging in a power cord. </LI></UL><P CLASS="t">Although the industry has come far with Plug and Play and other recent advancements to make the PC platform easier to use, customers — and potential customers — want the PC to be even more convenient to use. To enable the PC to become a much more integral part of daily life both in the office and the home, the PC must be instantly available to answer the phone, display new e-mail, or browse the Internet, but appear to be off when not in use. </P>
<P CLASS="t">The goal of the OnNow initiative is to advance the PC platform to a high level of usability and robustness that will allow the PC to deliver these new capabilities. To meet the goals of this initiative, it is essential that all system components work together to ensure the PC operates as the user would expect. </P>
<P CLASS="t">The following describes how the OnNow PC platform is expected to work:</P>
<UL><LI>The PC is ready for use immediately when the user presses the power button.</LI><LI>The PC is perceived to be off when not in use but is still capable of responding to wakeup events. In this context, appearing off means that the PC seems to be off according to what the user hears and sees, but also that the user is confident that the PC is not consuming excess energy and that data and programs are reliably saved. Wakeup events might be triggered by a device receiving some input such as a phone ringing or a timed alarm set by software.</LI><LI>Software adjusts its behavior when the PC's power state changes. The operating system and applications work together intelligently to operate the PC in accordance with the user's current needs and expectations and to deliver effective power management. For example, applications will not inadvertently keep the PC busy when it is unnecessary and instead will proactively participate in shutting down the PC to conserve energy and reduce noise. </LI><LI>All devices connected to the PC or added by the user participate in the device power management scheme. Any new device can have its power state changed as system usage dictates.</LI></UL><P CLASS="t">To achieve this set of capabilities requires a comprehensive, system-wide approach that affects all aspects of the PC. New requirements for the operating system, applications, device drivers, and hardware must be incorporated into the PC system to deliver transparent power management and improved integration of components. The necessary changes are the following:</P>
<UL><LI><B>Enhanced core operating system functionality for power management</B>. In&nbsp;the OnNow architecture, the operating system assumes the central role of coordinating power management activities at all levels and takes responsibility for defining the power state transitions for the system. It is planned for both Windows 95 and Windows NT to incorporate these changes in 1997.</LI><LI><B>A unified device driver model for power management and Plug and Play</B>. This involves the creation of a device driver model that supports per-device power management and Plug and Play for both Windows and Windows NT. The Win32 Driver Model is designed to fill this need.</LI><LI><B>A new system interface for power management and Plug and Play</B>. A&nbsp;design is required for implementing operating system-directed power management and enabling per-device power management of devices on the system board. The design defined by the Advanced Configuration and Power Interface meets this need and also provides future extensibility and improved system integration.</LI><LI><B>Device and bus hardware power management advances</B>. In the same way that Plug and Play unified configuration mechanisms throughout the PC, OnNow provides a framework for defining power management interfaces and state definitions. For example, new power management specifications have been developed for PCI, USB, and IEEE 1394 buses.</LI><LI><B>An application architecture that integrates applications into power management</B>. Building on the existing Plug and Play mechanisms for applications, it is necessary to further improve the flow of control and information through the application interface so that the user's environment is much more smoothly integrated with the underlying PC capabilities.</LI></UL></BODY></HTML>
