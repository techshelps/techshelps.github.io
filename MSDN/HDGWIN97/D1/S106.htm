All configuration settings must be capable of being made through software, with no system reboot required. Changing or adding this device to the system must not require changing jumpers or switches on either the adapter or the system board to set resource assignments. In the event of an irreconcilable conflict with other devices on the system, the system must be able to disable the device to prevent the system from stalling. The device must not claim any resources while disabled.</P></BODY></HTML>
