<H2 CLASS="h1">Visual Displays and Indicators</H2><P CLASS="t">Visual display is the predominant form of display on today's computers. This includes the standard display screen, LED or LCD icon displays on or near the keyboard, and special visual indicators on peripheral devices. For people with low vision or blindness, these displays can pose a barrier to computer use.</P>
<P CLASS="t">When information is displayed on the standard computer screen, special screen-magnification software can increase the image size for people with low vision. Similarly, software "screen readers" can access the information and read it aloud to users who are blind. Information provided by indicator lights or small LCD mini-displays, however, must also be made available and readable by using screen readers or another mechanism.</P>
<P CLASS="t">Hardware design strategies for providing greater access to information presented visually includes the following:</P>
<OL><LI>Minimize glare.
<P CLASS="lt1">Glare caused by reflections or mismatched color combinations, overly bright indicators, and so on, might present problems for users with low vision. Minimizing glare allows these users greater access to displays. </P></LI><LI>Avoid 5 to 50 Hz range for the refresh rate or flicker rate.
<P CLASS="lt1">Allows users with photosensitive epilepsy, who might have a seizure if exposed to strong stimuli in the 50 Hz range, to more safely use the system.</P></LI><LI>If possible, make LCD and LED indicators, warning lights, and alert lights readable from software.
<P CLASS="lt1">Allows users who are blind to use their screen reading-software to access important indicators, warnings, and notices.</P></LI></OL><P CLASS="t">The following standard design practices also facilitate access and use by users with disabilities: </P>
<OL><LI>Provide contrast and brightness control.
<P CLASS="lt1">Important for users with low vision and color blindness so they can adjust the display to accommodate their needs and preferences.</P></LI><LI>Provide a display connector for an external or additional monitor.
<P CLASS="lt1">Users with low vision often need to augment the system with a larger monitor to take full advantage of their screen enlargement software. This is especially true for users of mobile PCs.</P></LI><LI>Make the monitor position and angle adjustable.
<P CLASS="lt1">Users with physical disabilities adjust the monitor to suit their seating position and approach to the system. Other users with low vision often adjust the monitor to reduce any glare that results from ambient light sources.</P></LI></OL></BODY></HTML>
