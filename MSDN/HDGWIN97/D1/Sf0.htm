<H2 CLASS="h1">DVD Playback Requirements</H2><P CLASS="t">The items in this section are requirements related to video and audio playback capabilities for a PC system that includes a DVD-ROM device and software support for DVD-Video playback. For more information about DVD requirements, see the "Storage and Related Peripherals" chapter in Part&nbsp;4 of this guide. </P>

<P CLASS="spacing"><BR></P><P CLASS="t">All PC 97 systems that include DVD-ROM drives and support for DVD-Video playback using software or hardware audio/video decodes must provide DVD data format audio/video decoding and rendering using the Microsoft ActiveMovie multimedia architecture, according to the following guidelines:</P>
<UL><LI><B>Video requirements.</B> The system must decode MPEG-2 Main Profile, Main Level video streams, including the following:

<UL><LI>ISO/IEC 13818-2 (video) specification at Main Profile and Main Level.</LI><LI>10 megabit/second sustained input as the peak rate for DVD-Video content for Basic PC&nbsp;97 and Workstation PC&nbsp;97.</LI></UL><P CLASS="lt1">For Entertainment PC&nbsp;97, the full 15 megabit/second rate specified by the MPEG-2 industry standard is required for forward compatibility with future MPEG-2 streams, such as digital satellite broadcast.</P>


<UL><LI>720x576x30 (H/V/F) maximum sampling density.</LI><LI>Test procedures defined by ISO/IEC 13818-4.</LI></UL></LI><LI><B>Audio requirements.</B> DVD MPEG-2 and Dolby AC-3 audio must be decoded and digitally downmixed to Dolby ProLogic-encoded stereo (2 channels, minimum). Either the original multi-channel streams or the downmixed stereo surround 2-channel streams must be available to software in PCM format. Output can use a digital connection (USB or IEEE 1394) or an analog audio connection. 
<P CLASS="lt1">DVD audio must be mixed with other PC audio streams. Microsoft recommends digital mixing.</P>

<P CLASS="lt1">The system must support MPEG-2 audio decode and output as follows:</P>


<UL><LI>ISO/IEC 13818-3 (audio) specification at Layer II.</LI><LI>1130 kilobit/second sustained input.</LI><LI>Test procedures defined by ISO/IEC 13818-4.</LI></UL></LI><LI><B>Synchronized audio and video.</B> Audio and video decoders and rendering mechanisms must be in synch, but this requirement does not define whether the solution is implemented in software or hardware. A general broadcast industry guideline is that audio must not be out of synch with video by more than 45 milliseconds late (that is, 1.5 frames at 30 fps) and no more than 20 milliseconds early (0.66&nbsp;of a frame at 30 fps).</LI><LI><B>Independent audio/video streams supported by decoder subsystem.</B> This is necessary for support of interactive DVD titles, plus MPEG-2 and AC-3 content from CD-ROM, the Internet, and so on.</LI><LI><B>WDM for MPEG-2 acceleration.</B> For both Windows&nbsp;95 and Windows&nbsp;NT, MPEG-2 decode hardware acceleration must be supported using a Win32 Driver Model (WDM) audio/video decoder minidriver. </LI></UL><P CLASS="h4"><B>16. No dropped or duplicated frames </B></P>

<P CLASS="spacing"><BR></P><P CLASS="lt1">No MPEG-2 video frames can be dropped or duplicated during full-screen playback. This implies that the video frame rate and VGA refresh rate are locked. This requirement guarantees a user experience equivalent to lower cost, dedicated consumer-electronics devices such as DVD players and VCRs. </P>
<P CLASS="lt1">It is generally accepted in the video broadcast industry that any level of frame slippage will be noticeable to viewers and will be considered an annoyance compared to the smooth viewing experience provided by standard broadcast television, VCRs, and so on.</P>
<P CLASS="h4"><B>17. Background tasks do not interfere with DVD playback</B></P>

<P CLASS="spacing"><BR></P><P CLASS="lt1">Normal background tasks that occur during foreground, full-screen DVD playback should not interfere with the audio or video playback. This applies to background tasks initiated by applications included with the PC, such as home control, and so&nbsp;on.</P>
<P CLASS="lt1">This is a critical requirement for Entertainment PC 97 designs, whose users will rely on the PC to perform normal day-to-day operations simultaneously with non-interactive (linear) movie playback. Some specific examples of operations that must not interfere with DVD playback are the following:</P>
<P CLASS="lt1">Answering the telephone to receive voicemail or fax. This applies only to telephony software included with the PC, not third-party software installed by the user. Notice that telephone answering must not be automatically disabled during DVD playback unless explicitly configured by the user.</P>
<P CLASS="lt1">Running scheduled communications tasks such as automatic connection using the modem, ISDN, or LAN to transfer e-mail and faxes, download cached Internet content, and so on.</P>
<P CLASS="nt"><FONT CLASS="nh"><B>Note</B></FONT>  Programs that make intensive use of system resources or that are designed for interactive foreground operation are excluded from this requirement. This includes games, video and audio playback, speakerphone, and disk utilities, such as error checking, defragmentation, and virus protection.</P>
<P CLASS="h4"><B>18. Subpicture compositing, if DVD drive supports video discs</B></P>

<P CLASS="spacing"><BR></P><P CLASS="t">Because of possible legal requirements to support closed captioning, DVD-<BR>Video – enabled PCs must fully support "subpictures" as defined in the DVD specification. This includes the ability to overlay an animated bitmap with the correct pixel aspect ratio onto the decoded active video with alpha blending. This might be implemented with a display adapter that has two overlay surfaces (one of which must be alpha blended), or it might be implemented by compositing in the MPEG decoder subsystem.</P>
