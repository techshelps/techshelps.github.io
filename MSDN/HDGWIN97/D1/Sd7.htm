<H2 CLASS="h1">Overview for Graphics Adapters</H2><P CLASS="t">This section presents the key design issues for graphics adapters under Microsoft Windows. Graphics-related issues for PC&nbsp;97 are based on the needs of the system to provide fast, high-quality graphics rendering. New games applications that require 3-D graphics or advanced graphics applications such as CAD require improved support in the graphics hardware. </P>
<P CLASS="t">Key PC&nbsp;97 issues for graphics adapters in general:</P>
<UL><LI>Design features for a high-performance graphics adapter with hardware acceleration.</LI><LI>Optimized hardware support for DirectDraw and Direct3D.</LI><LI>Support for TV output for a large TV or VGA monitor. </LI><LI>Enhanced Plug and Play capabilities, including multiple-adapter/monitor support.</LI><LI>Power management for graphics adapters.</LI></UL><P CLASS="t">Key issues for Workstation PC 97:</P>
<UL><LI>Optimized hardware support for high-definition graphics. </LI></UL><P CLASS="t">Key issues for Entertainment PC 97:</P>
<UL><LI>Optimized hardware support for high-performance graphics, chiefly for Direct3D applications and MPEG-1 and DVD video playback.</LI></UL><P CLASS="t">DirectDraw is the Windows system component that allows direct manipulation of video display memory, hardware block transfers (bit-blters), hardware overlays, and page flipping. DirectDraw performs the common functions required by both hardware and software emulation implementations, while maintaining compatibility with the Windows GDI. This provides compatibility with existing applications and device drivers created for Windows. The user will experience the highest quality performance when using new hardware that provides built-in DirectDraw acceleration and rendering capabilities. </P>
<P CLASS="t">Direct3D is a DirectX technology that provides access to hardware acceleration for 3-D rendering. Some basic and general 3-D capabilities will become pervasive in entertainment software by the end of 1997 and should be provided in all graphic cards to improve the performance of 3-D games, business graphics, Internet 3-D file (VRML) viewing, and professional 3-D applications.</P>
<P CLASS="t">Microsoft ActiveMovie provides access to hardware acceleration for MPEG-1 playback, which will become increasingly important to provide high-performance video in the context of games, Internet content viewing, computer-based training, and desktop video conferencing. Some PC&nbsp;97 hardware requirements ensure support for video playback on all PCs running Windows operating systems.</P>
<P CLASS="t">OpenGL technology is an open industry standard 3-D graphics API used to support 3-D graphics capabilities. This is primarily for high-end or professional 3-D applications such as engineering, modeling, simulation, visualization, animation, 3-D clip art and Internet content (VRML) viewing. OpenGL has some higher requirements for visual rendering precision than general Direct3D devices, but it can also take advantage of appropriate Direct3D hardware. There is also a class of high-end, 3-D graphics hardware specifically targeted at the OpenGL developer which requires an OpenGL client driver rather than or in addition to a Direct3D driver. </P></BODY></HTML>
