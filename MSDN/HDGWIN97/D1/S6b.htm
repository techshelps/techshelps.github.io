<H2 CLASS="h1">Overview of PCI Design Issues</H2><P CLASS="t">Microsoft supports the PCI effort within the PC industry. The effort to support PCI has uncovered related issues during operating system development and testing. Microsoft has developed some solutions for these in Windows 95 and Windows&nbsp;NT. Microsoft is also working on solutions for future versions of Windows and Windows NT. This chapter describes some of these issues and solutions, especially with regard to hardware design requirements.</P>
<P CLASS="t">The PCI architecture has become the most common method used to extend the PC for add-in adapters. Windows&nbsp;95 and Windows NT use the basic PCI infrastructure to gain information about devices attached to the PCI bus. The ability of PCI to supply such information makes it an integral part of the Plug and Play architecture in Windows.</P></BODY></HTML>
