This requirement ensures that the system correctly supports the Plug and Play and power management functionality described in Part&nbsp;1 of this guide. ACPI support includes the following:</P>
<UL><LI>Power management timer.</LI><LI>Power button — must comply with the ACPI definition. A separate reset switch is an acceptable alternative to the ACPI-specified override mechanism.</LI><LI>Real-Time Clock alarm —wake-up due to a scheduled time and day of month.</LI><LI>The S4 "soft off" state, as required in the ACPI specification, plus at least one of the sleep states: S1, S2, or S3.

<UL><LI>Thermal model and fan control. This is recommended as a means of running the PC quietly while working and turning the fan off while sleeping. </LI><LI>Support the interface defined in the Intel/Duracell Smart Battery System Specification for reporting battery information. Although other battery interfaces will also be supported, Windows&nbsp;95 and Windows NT will optimize driver and user interface support to exploit the capabilities of this interface.</LI></UL><P CLASS="t"><B>Note</B>  Any other system board power management or Plug and Play features must be implemented compliant with ACPI, even if a particular feature is not a specific PC&nbsp;97 requirement or recommendation.</P>

<P CLASS="spacing"><BR></P><P CLASS="t">Elements of the OnNow design initiative ensure that the operating system and device drivers control the state of individual devices and the system board. The following support is required for PC&nbsp;97 hardware:</P>
<UL><LI>The user experiences the PC as "off" when it is in Sleeping state.</LI><LI>At a minimum, the hard disks, CD drives, display, sound, input devices, and fans must be perceived as off while the system is in a Sleeping state (for example, no noise and no lights other than the status indicator). However, it is recognized that some CPUs have integrated fans that use CPU power and, hence, the fan cannot be controlled while the CPU is powered. Such CPU fans are exempt from this requirement, as long as the system Sleeping noise requirement is met.</LI><LI>The user can easily see whether the PC is Working or Sleeping.</LI><LI>This can be implemented as LED status indicators on the front panel, or another solution can be used. At a minimum, the PC&nbsp;97 system must provide one or more indicators to show whether the system is in the Working or Sleeping state. If telephone answering-machine capabilities are built into the system, then a Message Waiting indicator must also be included on desktop systems. However, the Message Waiting indicator is only a recommendation for mobile systems.</LI><LI>The user can easily control power through switches and software.</LI><LI>The system must provide an easily accessible power switch that can be controlled by software and that supports the functionality required in the ACPI specification. </LI><LI>If the power switch is provided on the keyboard, the hot keys must be labeled clearly and must consist of a single key for turning on the PC. (Two keystrokes are permissible for turning the PC off.) The single keystroke ensures accessibility for persons with disabilities.</LI><LI>This requirement does not preclude power-control capabilities related to actions such as closing the lid on a mobile PC.</LI><LI>The following shows the scan code for the keyboard power switch:
<P CLASS="spacing"><BR></P>
<pre><code>VK_POWER = 5E<BR>Set1-Make: E0, 5E    Set1-Break: E0, DE<BR>Set2-Make: E0, 37    Set2-Break: F0, 37<BR></code></pre></LI><LI>Power management is supported for all of these buses present on the system: PCI, USB, IEEE 1394, and PC Card.
<P CLASS="lt1">Any of these buses present in the system must support power management requirements in the related bus standard, as defined in Part&nbsp;3 of this guide.</P></LI><LI>Each device supports the power management specifications for its class. 
<P CLASS="lt1">Each device on the system board or included with the system as an add-on device (either internally or externally) must support the power management reference specification for its device class and be controllable through either ACPI or its bus. </P>

<P CLASS="lt1">The device functionality expected in each OnNow power state and the possible Wakeup event definitions for the class are defined in power management specifications for each device class. For more information about these requirements, see the power management sections in the related device class chapters in Part&nbsp;4 of this guide.</P></LI></UL><P CLASS="h4"><B>6. BIOS support for OnNow initiative for x86-based systems</B></P>

<P CLASS="spacing"><BR></P><P CLASS="t">This requirement applies only for x86-based systems. For PC&nbsp;97, the OnNow initiative requires the following additional BIOS support:</P>
<UL><LI><B>Fast power-on self test</B> <B>(POST).</B> The system must be available to the user quickly. Although a specific time is not required, the basic recommendation is that power-on to bootstrap loader occurs within five seconds plus hard disk ready-time. The following are recommendations for ways to reduce processing overhead to make system boot time as fast as possible:

<UL><LI>No video memory test and limited test for DRAM size.</LI><LI>No tests for serial or parallel port.</LI><LI>No floppy disk test or media check (boot from hard disk only).</LI><LI>No tests for hard disk controller or drive type (if the system does not include swappable drives).</LI><LI>Test execution controlled using a Windows-based control panel or application that can be scheduled to run periodically at off hours.</LI><LI>Fast POST mode for BIOS can be disabled by user for troubleshooting.</LI></UL></LI><LI><B>Minimal time for Resume from Sleeping state. </B>Resume from Sleeping state to operating system handoff must occur within 500 milliseconds. </LI><LI><B>Minimal startup display. </B>System startup draws the end user's attention only in case of errors or when there is a need for user action.
<P CLASS="lt1">The default configuration must allow a beep during the boot process only in case of an error, and the only screen display allowed is the OEM splash screen, which can include information such as copyright notices. By default, the system must be configured so that the screen display does not display memory counts, device status, and so on, but present a "clean" BIOS startup so that the end user is not presented with cryptic and unnecessary information. However, this requirement does not preclude the following:</P>


<UL><LI>Presenting a blank startup screen</LI><LI>Providing a "hot key" override to display screen messages for troubleshooting or user-definable CMOS settings. </LI><LI>Presenting text-based end-user action messages — for example, messages to display the setup hot key, system help hot key, password entry, network login for remote booting, and so on.</LI><LI>Presenting manufacturer branding messages.</LI><LI>Providing a CMOS option to turn the "clean startup screen" off and on.</LI></UL><P CLASS="lt1">The intention for this requirement is to ensure that the end user is not presented with confusing information and unnecessary visual display, but that access to error information is still available using a hot key.</P></LI></UL><P CLASS="h4"><B>7.
