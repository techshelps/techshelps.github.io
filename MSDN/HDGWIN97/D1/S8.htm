<H2 CLASS="h1">Logo Program at Microsoft for Hardware</H2><P CLASS="t">The "Designed for Microsoft Windows" logo on PC hardware provides end users with the assurance that this hardware will work well with Windows and that it takes advantage of features built in to the operating system. Products that receive this logo go through a rigorous series of tests administered by the Windows Hardware Quality Labs (WHQL) to determine that the hardware meets all "Designed for Microsoft Windows" criteria. </P>
<P CLASS="t">The first "Designed for Microsoft Windows&nbsp;95" logo program was based on requirements defined specifically for Windows&nbsp;95. Under the requirements for the first logo program, part of the logo testing requirements have been that a product be tested under Windows NT, with the requirement being that the product must run successfully on both Windows 95 and Windows NT unless prevented by architectural differences between the two operating systems. This guide defines the specific differences for drivers or other support under the two operating systems.</P>
<P CLASS="t">The collection of categories for PC 97 system types are the following:</P>
<UL><LI><B>Basic PC 97: </B>Defines a standard PC (both desktop and mobile) that sets a baseline of features and performance for users in all categories. The Basic PC&nbsp;97 system is designed to best support typical Windows-based applications running under either Windows&nbsp;95 or Windows&nbsp;NT Workstation. However, these requirements represent much more than the minimum system requirements for the operating systems, which are much lower in order to support a large base of older, less capable hardware.</LI><LI><B>Workstation PC&nbsp;97: </B>Defines enhanced components for a PC system designed to support the more complex requirements of Win32&reg;-based applications that have strenuous graphics or computational demands. A Workstation PC&nbsp;97 system can run either Windows&nbsp;95 or Windows&nbsp;NT Workstation, but its design is optimized to support Windows&nbsp;NT Workstation when used for complex applications such as CAD or engineering computing, software development, and content authoring for the Internet or applications.</LI><LI><B>Entertainment PC&nbsp;97: </B>Defines enhanced components for a PC system designed as an interactive multimedia system optimized for games, education, personal communications, Internet activities, and video playback. Key features that differentiate Entertainment PC&nbsp;97 from other system types include support for advanced game playing 3-D graphics and audio, high-performance graphics and video including full motion MPEG-2 video, high-fidelity audio, and connections to consumer-electronics devices such as home stereos, telephones, VCRs, camcorders, digital satellite systems, and so on. </LI></UL><P CLASS="t">The PC 97 requirements for each system type are defined in Part&nbsp;2 of this guide. In addition, there are additional specific logo criteria for each bus and device class, as defined in Part&nbsp;3, "Bus Design for PC&nbsp;97," and Part 4, "Device Design Guidelines," in this guide. </P>
<P CLASS="t">Notice that mobile PCs are not defined as a separate system category, as mobile PC designs could be implemented under each PC&nbsp;97 system type. The "Basic PC&nbsp;97" chapter presents a summary list of specific design issues for mobile PCs and docking stations. Also, PC&nbsp;97 Hardware Design Guidelines do not apply for so-called personal digital assistants (PDAs) or other sub-PC form factor designs.</P>
<P CLASS="t">Microsoft will continue to have a single logo for all categories of computers defined for PC 97. However, for systems submitted under the Workstation and Entertainment PC categories, in 1997 Microsoft will be announcing and offering additional marketing programs for those specific categories. </P></BODY></HTML>
