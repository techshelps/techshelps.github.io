<H3 CLASS="h2">Multiple Adapter and Multiple Monitor Support for PC&nbsp;97</H3><P CLASS="t">This section defines the requirements for ensuring system support for multiple adapters and multiple monitors. This required support ensures that if the user adds a second adapter, resources will automatically be available and that the operating system can automatically manage multiple display adapters. </P>
<P CLASS="t">The actual implementation a user might employ could be one of the following:</P>
<UL><LI>Multiple adapters added to the PC system</LI><LI>A single adapter with a single controller supporting two monitors</LI><LI>A single adapter with multiple controllers supporting multiple monitors</LI><LI>Any combinations of these scenarios</LI></UL><P CLASS="t">The support planned for both Windows 95 and Windows NT requires multiple-adapter compatibility in both the graphics adapter and its driver. With this new multiple adapter/multiple monitor support, a single adapter that supports multiple monitors can display independent screen images. This is support beyond the current simultaneous display features for some mobile PCs, which show the same Windows desktop on two displays at the same time.</P>
<P CLASS="t">The operating system support for multiple adapters/multiple monitors requires allowing any secondary graphics adapters to be enabled in VGA mode, thus requiring that VGA for the previous adapter be temporarily disabled.</P>
<P CLASS="t">The support for multiple monitors also assumes that for monitors attached to the same system but showing different images simultaneously, the different displays might have differing X,Y resolution, color depths, and refresh rates plus differing display capabilities.</P>
<P CLASS="t">For technical details about designing for multiple monitor/multiple adapter support, see http://www.microsoft.com/hwdev/devdes/.</P>

<P CLASS="spacing"><BR></P><P CLASS="t">To ensure Plug and Play for multiple adapter/multiple monitor capabilities, all <BR>non – VGA standard display resources (also known as extended resources, such as register sets and so on) must be capable of being dynamically relocated after system boot.</P>
<P CLASS="t">This is an extension of the earlier requirement, "Graphics operations use relocatable registers only," and is an addition to the basic Plug and Play requirements defined later in this chapter.</P>
<P CLASS="h4"><B>15. VGA resources can be disabled by software</B></P>

<P CLASS="spacing"><BR></P><P CLASS="t">A means must be provided to allow a driver to disable its adapter from decoding standard VGA addresses. The purpose of this requirement is to ensure the adapter is independent of all other graphics adapters in the system. The adapter must remain fully functional without the VGA addresses. See also the earlier requirement, "Graphics operations use relocatable registers only."</P>
<P CLASS="h4"><B>16. Provide alternate mechanization to Int 10 for initialization</B></P>

<P CLASS="spacing"><BR></P><P CLASS="t">The purpose of this requirement is to avoid problems that occur with multiple ROM mappings at C0000h. </P>
<P CLASS="t">Microsoft is investigating providing an alternate standard for ROM format. Based on such a standard, data tables from the ROM could be used by the driver to program the graphics adapter. A generic mode setting routine could be provided by the operating system to initialize the graphics adapter.</P></BODY></HTML>
