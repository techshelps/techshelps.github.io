<H2 CLASS="h1">Designing with New Bus and Device Support</H2><P CLASS="t">New cross-platform support for PC&nbsp;97 includes the following:</P>
<UL><LI>Support for ACPI and the OnNow initiative for power management and Plug and Play support, as described in the "OnNow and WDM for PC&nbsp;97" chapter.</LI><LI>Support for the new Win32 Driver Model (WDM), with binary compatibility for new drivers across both operating-system platforms, as described in the "OnNow and WDM for PC&nbsp;97" chapter.</LI><LI>Support for new universal serial bus (USB) and IEEE 1394 (sometimes called "firewire").
<P CLASS="lt1">USB is a serial protocol that runs at 1–12 megabits per second, making it an appropriate bus for input devices, modems, digital audio, and digital image input devices.</P>

<P CLASS="lt1">IEEE 1394 is a serial protocol that runs at speeds ranging from 100 – 400 megabits per second, depending upon the implementation. Devices that are prime candidates for IEEE 1394 include digital camcorders and VCRs, digital audio amplifiers, and video teleconferencing.</P>

<P CLASS="lt1">All new buses supported for PC&nbsp;97 will support Plug and Play functionality and will include WDM system drivers for both Windows&nbsp;95 and Windows&nbsp;NT.</P></LI><LI>Support in both operating systems for new hardware, including:

<UL><LI>DVD.</LI><LI>Digital image input devices.</LI><LI>Network communications devices such as ISDN and cable modems.</LI><LI>Connectivity to consumer-electronic devices such as the home stereo, digital VCR and camcorder, digital satellite, and cable TV.</LI></UL></LI><LI>Support for new Microsoft APIs, including:

<UL><LI>DirectDraw&trade; and Direct3D&trade; APIs for 2-D and 3-D graphics acceleration.</LI><LI>DirectSound&trade; for sound acceleration.</LI><LI>ActiveMovie&trade; and ActiveVRML&trade; for full-motion video, MPEG-1 acceleration, and other multimedia streaming for both PC-based and Internet applications.</LI><LI>Telephony functions for conferencing, voice mail, and fax.</LI><LI>Support for multiple monitors, large monitors, and higher quality video&nbsp;display.</LI></UL></LI></UL></BODY></HTML>
