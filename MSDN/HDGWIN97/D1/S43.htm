<H2 CLASS="h1">Industrial Design Requirements for Entertainment PC 97</H2><P CLASS="t">This section summarizes the physical design requirements for Entertainment PC&nbsp;97 systems. These requirements are in addition to those related to the OnNow initiative for power-state indicators and easily accessible power switches.</P>
<P CLASS="h4"><B>4. All expansion slots in the system accessible for users to insert cards</B></P>

<P CLASS="spacing"><BR></P><P CLASS="t">The expansion slots cannot be physically blocked by components or devices provided with the system. This does not exclude configurations that allow space for only half-height cards for some slots or passive back planes used for connectors, and so on. (This requirement applies only if the system does not implement a "sealed case" design as described later in this section.)</P>
<P CLASS="h4"><B>5. Audible noise meets PC 97 standards</B></P>

<TABLE COLS="3" BORDER="0" CELLPADDING="7"><COLGROUP><COL WIDTH="25%" VALIGN="TOP"><COL WIDTH="25%" VALIGN="TOP"><COL WIDTH="25%" VALIGN="TOP"></COLGROUP><TBODY><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP">Required</TD><TD VALIGN="TOP"></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP"></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>
<P CLASS="spacing"><BR></P><P CLASS="t">An Entertainment PC&nbsp;97 system must be "silent" in the Sleeping state and must also be quiet during active operations, including hard-disk seek activities. </P>
<P CLASS="t">Recommended test procedures and measurements will be documented by Microsoft.</P>
<P CLASS="t">The need to limit audible noise comes from the OnNow design initiative. A&nbsp;PC that uses OnNow technologies will be active even when not under direct operation by the user. For example, entertainment PCs are likely to perform scheduled and background tasks such as receiving faxes and voice mail, checking e-mail, and downloading TV program guide information and Internet web pages using a digital satellite connection or modem. These operations must happen silently so as not to interfere with other activities in the home.</P>
<P CLASS="h4"><B>6. "Sealed case" design with external expansion for all components</B></P>

<P CLASS="spacing"><BR></P><P CLASS="t">The entire PC case can be "sealed," with no user-serviceable parts inside. It&nbsp;is recognized that computers will continue to need service and that literally sealing the case would prohibit servicing the PC. The term "sealed case" refers to a PC system designed with the assumption that the <I>user</I> will never need to open the case. All expansion capabilities should be made available using options such as USB or IEEE 1394, with support for removable devices provided using PC Card or other design options to allow adding more storage or other devices. </P>
<P CLASS="t">Modular designs can be used to support RAM and CPU upgrades; however, such designs are not required as part of the "sealed case" recommendation.</P>
<P CLASS="t">This recommendation is intended to make the PC more usable and accessible for end users by ensuring that system components can be upgraded or added without using a screwdriver or other special tools. For more information about the "sealed case" concept, see "PC&nbsp;97 Design Issues" in Part 1 of this guide.</P></BODY></HTML>
