<H2 CLASS="h1">D</H2><P CLASS="h4"><B>DDC </B></P>
<P CLASS="t">Acronym for display data channel, the communications channel between a monitor and the display adapter to which it is connected. This channel provides a method for the monitor to convey its identity to the display adapter.</P>
<P CLASS="h4"><B>device</B></P>
<P CLASS="t">Any circuit that performs a specific function, such as a parallel port or graphics adapter.</P>
<P CLASS="h4"><B>device ID</B></P>
<P CLASS="t">A device identification string, in many cases beginning with a three-letter standard EISA identifier, that distinguishes each logical device and bus from all others on the system.</P>
<P CLASS="h4"><B>device node</B></P>
<P CLASS="t">The basic data structure for a given device, built by Configuration Manager in Windows 95; sometimes called devnode. Device nodes are built into memory at system startup for each device and enumerator with information about the device, such as currently assigned resources. The complete representation of all device nodes is referred to as the hardware tree.</P>
<P CLASS="h4"><B>DIB</B></P>
<P CLASS="t">Acronym for device-independent bitmap.</P>
<P CLASS="h4"><B>digital signal processor (DSP)</B></P>
<P CLASS="t">An integrated circuit designed for high-speed data manipulations, used in audio, communications, image manipulation, and other data-acquisition and data-control applications.</P>
<P CLASS="h4"><B>direct memory access (DMA)</B></P>
<P CLASS="t">A method of moving data from a device to memory (or vice versa) without the help of the microprocessor. The system board uses a DMA controller to handle a fixed number of "channels," each of which can be used by only one device at a&nbsp;time.</P>
<P CLASS="h4"><B>disk I/O controller</B></P>
<P CLASS="t">A special-purpose chip and circuitry that directs and controls reading from and writing to a computer's disk drive.</P>
<P CLASS="h4"><B>DLL</B></P>
<P CLASS="t">Acronym for dynamic-link library. A programming interface (API) routine that user-mode applications access through ordinary procedure calls. The code for the API routine is not included in the user's executable image. Instead, the operating system automatically modifies the executable image to point to DLL procedures at run time.</P>
<P CLASS="h4"><B>DMA</B></P>
<P CLASS="t">See <I>direct memory access</I>.</P>
<P CLASS="h4"><B>dock</B></P>
<P CLASS="t">To insert a portable computer into a base unit. Cold docking means the computer must begin from a power-off state and restart after docking. Hot docking means the computer can be docked while running at full power.</P>
<P CLASS="h4"><B>docking station</B></P>
<P CLASS="t">The base computer unit into which a user can insert a portable computer to expand it to a desktop equivalent. A typical dock provides drive bays, expansion slots, all the ports on the desktop computer, and AC power.</P>
<P CLASS="h4"><B>dongle</B></P>
<P CLASS="t">A physical device attached to a PC I/O port to add hardware capabilities.</P>
<P CLASS="h4"><B>DSP</B></P>
<P CLASS="t">See <I>digital signal processor</I>.</P>
<P CLASS="h4"><B>dynamic detection</B></P>
<P CLASS="t">The process by which a Plug and Play system can detect that a new device has been added or removed from the PC. This process allows the operating system and applications to begin using the added devices immediately or stop using the removed devices without rebooting the system.</P></BODY></HTML>
