<P CLASS="spacing"><BR></P><P CLASS="t">This feature is recommended for implementation where applicable. Caller ID is generally available only in North America and is not legal in some countries. This feature will never become a design requirement.</P>
<P CLASS="t">In the U.S. implementation, Calling Number/Name ID conveys the number from which a call originates. In addition, the directory name, date, and time of day is transmitted.</P>
<P CLASS="t">If reliable call-waiting subscriber alerting tone technology is available, the identity of a second caller can be conveyed as described in the Bellcore "Calling Identity Delivery on Call Waiting" document listed below. This gives the customer the same Caller ID capabilities on both incoming calls when call waiting is available. Caller ID might not be implemented in the same fashion in all jurisdictions—that is, an implementation can employ DTMF signaling not preceded by a ring.</P>
<P CLASS="t">A modem should support Caller ID information as a text string reported between rings, as defined in TIA-695 for use in modem states other than +FCLASS=8. If voice features are also supported in the modem, then the appropriate TIA-695 DLE sequences must also be supported.</P>

<P CLASS="spacing"><BR></P><P CLASS="t">In addition to the dial string characters described in V.25ter or TIA-602, use of the dollar-sign character ($) is recommended to wait for the calling-card prompt tone (so-called "bong tone"). Bellcore's BOC Notes on the Network (SR-TSV-002275, Issue 2, April 1994, Section 5 Signaling, page 6 – 218) describes this tone for North American LECs. Some European administrations are also implementing this capability.</P>

<P CLASS="spacing"><BR></P><P CLASS="t">This feature is recommended for implementation where applicable. As a general rule, modem events should be reported in all configurations of speakerphone and handset. In-band responses are also known as events, as described in the related TIA-695 documents. Alternatives to the serial asynchronous connection between DCE and DTE exist. The use of in-band responses with a separate voice data path is optional. The MDK describes waveform driver development for such an alternative architecture.</P>

<P CLASS="spacing"><BR></P><P CLASS="t">This feature is recommended for implementation where applicable. Cellular telephone systems are widely deployed around the industrialized world and are now being deployed everywhere else. In North America, analog cellular systems (TIA-553) are currently predominant, although two types of digital cellular systems will also be deployed: Code Division Multiplexed Access (CDMA, TIA IS-95) and Time Division Multiplexed Access (TDMA, IS-136). In Europe and the rest of the world, the GSM digital cellular system is widely deployed.</P>
<P CLASS="t">In both analog and digital systems, there have been problems with implementing data and facsimile communications. For analog cellular, the problem is that the noise, fade, and signal drop-out problems tolerated by human speakers will cripple ordinary data modems. In the case of digital cellular, the problem is that the voice coding algorithms used cannot pass modem carriers intact at all.</P>
<P CLASS="t">In North America, standards have been developed for the modem-to-modem protocols to survive analog cellular impairments, such as Microcom's MNP 10 and AT&amp;T Enhanced Cellular Protocol (ECP). These are helpful and recommended where applicable. Also, modern modem technologies such as V.34 are better able to get some useful data bandwidth on analog cellular connections than V.32bis or V.22bis modems.</P>
<P CLASS="t">There is also a new standard extended command set, defined in TIA-678, for general wireless modem control, with specific extensions for supporting analog cellular connections and analog cellular phones. (Notice that TIA-678 is technically identical to PCCA STD-101 and Annexes A, F, and I.)</P>
<P CLASS="t">For all three digital cellular systems, the system design has been extended to offer data, fax, voice, and short messaging (SMS) services to mobile users. In all cases, a modem pool is added to the ground stations, where connection is made to the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN). Access to the logical serial ports of these modems is made using the digital error-controlled radio link to the equipped mobile phone and is exposed on a serial port or associated PC&nbsp;Card.</P>
<P CLASS="t">The AT command sets for these digital cellular phone systems are contained in the following standards.</P>

<P CLASS="spacing"><BR></P><P CLASS="t">The modem should clear its blacklisted and delayed number tables if the associated handset goes off hook.</P>
<P CLASS="t">During certain international PTT certification processes, modems must support the blacklisted and delayed numbers feature. That means that when the modem fails to dial a specific number for a certain number of times, the dialed number is stored in an internal list. Any subsequent automated dialing operation to this number is then either delayed for a time (delayed) or might be forbidden until some form of manual intervention occurs (blacklisted). The international certification processes specify that manual intervention using an external device is required in order to clear these numbers.</P></BODY></HTML>
