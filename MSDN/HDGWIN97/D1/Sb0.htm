<P CLASS="spacing"><BR></P><P CLASS="t">The system must be capable of automatically assigning, disabling, and relocating the resources used by this device when necessary, using the method required for the related bus class. Changing or adding this device to the system must not require changing jumpers or switches on either the adapter or the system board. In the event of an irreconcilable conflict with other devices on the system, the system must be able to disable the device to prevent the system from stalling. </P>
<P CLASS="t">If there is a conflict when more than one port or device of the same type is detected on the system, one of two methods can be used to resolve them:</P>
<UL><LI>The first method is to completely disable the built-in port or device. For example, if there is a conflict when a second serial port is added to a desktop system, the expansion card overrides the system board device. Using this method, the system disables the device on the system board and only enables the expansion card. This is the recommended method for conflict resolution for add-on serial, parallel, MIDI, and joystick devices.</LI><LI>The second method allows both ports or devices to remain active, while resolving any conflict by relocating the resources of one or both devices. Using this method, either device can be used.</LI></UL></BODY></HTML>
