<P CLASS="t">These are the key issues for input devices for PC&nbsp;97:</P>
<UL><LI>Easy connectivity is important in common situations where devices might be interchanged on a regular basis. For this purpose, system designers are encouraged to take advantage of USB and to implement wireless capabilities for all input components.
<P CLASS="lt1">USB support is required for PC&nbsp;97 systems. If USB is implemented as the connection for any input device, the device must support the USB Human Input Device Class Specification.</P></LI><LI>Non-USB input devices must have device drivers that support the Microsoft DirectInput 3.0 APIs. DirectInput provides low-latency support for analog and digital joysticks, along with support for alternate input devices for user interaction. Extended capabilities also provide support for rudder pedals, flight yokes, steering devices, virtual-reality headgear, and other devices.
<P CLASS="lt1">Non-USB input devices that provide hardware acceleration should expose these features in their device drivers, so that these capabilities can be used to advantage in applications that use Microsoft DirectX features.</P></LI><LI>Windows and Application Logo keys are recommended for keyboards.</LI></UL></BODY></HTML>
