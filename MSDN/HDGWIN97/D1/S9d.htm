<H2 CLASS="h1">Overview for PC&nbsp;Card</H2><P CLASS="t">Windows supports PC Card I/O cards. Memory PC Cards are only supported as legacy devices. For any PC Card device to work effectively with Windows, the manufacturer must implement a minimum set of tuples documented in the PC Card Standard. Windows&nbsp;uses these tuples to identify and configure any PC Card.</P>
<P CLASS="t">For PC&nbsp;97, the new design concerns for PC Card are the following:</P>
<UL><LI>New design guidelines for CardBus host controllers and cards.</LI><LI>New power management guidelines, including requirements for the PC Card controller to meet new PCMCIA class power-management specifications being developed as part of the OnNow design initiative.</LI></UL><P CLASS="t">These new design details are discussed in this chapter.</P>
<P CLASS="t"><B>Note</B>  Because CardBus implementations are just beginning, additional requirements might arise. As implementation details become available, Microsoft will provide information about revisions to the hardware requirements and recommendations at http://www.microsoft.com/hwdev/.</P></BODY></HTML>
