<P CLASS="spacing"><BR></P><P CLASS="t">To ensure conflict resolution for resource allocation, the device must conform to the Plug and Play specifications for the bus it uses as described in Part 3 of this guide. The system must have a method for automatically disabling or relocating the resources used by the device if conflicts occur when an expansion card is added to the system. </P>
<P CLASS="t">Devices must be capable of being disabled with software settings only — that is, without requiring rebooting or jumper setting changes. Disabling the device must result in freeing all of its resources for use by other devices. DIP switches on boot devices can be used for an initial power-on default state or for non – Plug and Play system compatibility, but must be able to be overridden by software configuration after system power up. </P>
