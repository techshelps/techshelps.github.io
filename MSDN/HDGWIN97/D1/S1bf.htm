<P CLASS="h4"><B>local bus</B></P>
<P CLASS="t">Generally refers to a system bus directly connected to the microprocessor on a system board. Used colloquially to refer to system board buses located closer to the microprocessor than are ordinary expansion buses (that is, with less buffering), which are therefore capable of greater throughput. The PCI bus is often referred to as a local bus.</P></BODY></HTML>
