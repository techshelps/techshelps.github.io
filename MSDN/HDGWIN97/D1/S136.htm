<H2 CLASS="h1">Overview for Network Communications</H2><P CLASS="t">This section presents the key PC 97 design issues for network communications devices under Microsoft Windows. </P>
<P CLASS="t">Under Microsoft Windows, the seamless integration of network software components should be supplemented by device support for Plug and Play and NDIS 4.0 capabilities, so that the user has to supply a minimal amount of information to achieve optimal configuration.</P>
<P CLASS="t">For PC&nbsp;97, all network communications devices are based on the same NDIS 4.0 requirements. These are the key PC 97 design issues for network communications:</P>
<UL><LI>Complete Plug and Play capabilities, with a supporting NDIS 4.0 miniport driver.</LI><LI>Automatic cable sense and transceiver auto-detection capabilities, plus support for power management capabilities under the OnNow design initiative.</LI></UL><P CLASS="t"><B>Tips for Selecting High-Performance Network Adapters.</B> For PC manufacturers who want to select high-performance components, these are design features to look for in network adapters:</P>
<UL><LI>Adapter supports bus mastering, especially for use with Pentium Pro-class processors.</LI><LI>PCI adapter properly supports higher-level PCI commands for intelligent data transfer.</LI><LI>Drivers tuned for 32-bit performance.</LI></UL></BODY></HTML>
