Drivers must <BR>be installed using Windows methodology only; however, any software applications included with the device can be installed using an alternate Windows-based installation method.</LI><LI>Driver files provided by the vendor must not use the same file names as used by files included in Microsoft operating systems, unless specifically agreed with Microsoft.</LI><LI>Only 32-bit protected-mode components are installed. No real-mode components are provided in order to operate under Windows, except for any Windows&nbsp;95 .DRV file.
<P CLASS="lt1">For Windows&nbsp;95, the display driver (.DRV) component that is loaded and called by the Windows GDI is a Win16 module.</P></LI><LI>Manufacturer-provided control panel applications do not disable default Windows functionality, including refresh rate setting.</LI><LI>Driver does not bypass any Microsoft-provided system components, including Gdi.exe, Kernel.exe, User.exe, Dibeng,dll, Mmsystem.dll, Ddraw.dll, D3d*.dll, and so on.</LI></UL><P CLASS="t">For complete details about standard installation requirements for drivers, see "Basic PC&nbsp;97" in Part 2 of this guide.</P>
