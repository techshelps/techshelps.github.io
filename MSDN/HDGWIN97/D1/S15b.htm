<P CLASS="spacing"><BR></P><P CLASS="t">All parallel hardware must comply with the Plug and Play requirements for parallel ports, as defined in the "Serial, Parallel, and Wireless Support" chapter in this guide. This includes implementing the required support in the Plug and Play Parallel Port Devices Specification v. 1.0b.</P>
<P CLASS="t">These requirements and recommendations ensure that a parallel device has complete Plug and Play capabilities. For example, a user must be able to attach any parallel peripheral to any parallel connector; the operating system should recognize it automatically, load and initialize the appropriate drivers, and then make the device available for use.</P>
<P CLASS="t">Each parallel scanner or digital camera must have a Plug and Play device identifier for an IEEE 1284 peripheral. At a minimum, the device-ID string <BR>must contain these keys: MANUFACTURER, MODEL, CLASS, and DESCRIPTION.</P>
<UL><LI>The CLASS key value for scanners is SCANNER.</LI><LI>The CLASS key value for digital cameras is DIGCAM.</LI></UL><P CLASS="t">A parallel device can also be designed to meet the recommendation to support <BR>the COMPATIBLE key in the device identification string, as defined in the "Serial, Parallel, and Wireless Support" chapter.</P></BODY></HTML>
