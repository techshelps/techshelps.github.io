<H2 CLASS="h1">Sound</H2><P CLASS="t">Sound is increasingly being used to convey information important to the operation of a computer. This includes alerts in addition to speech and other complex audio feedback. This can pose problems for any user on an airplane or in other noisy environments, and it can pose a problem for those who are deaf or hard of hearing.</P>
<P CLASS="t">Hardware design strategies for providing greater access to information presented in this fashion include the following:</P>
<OL><LI>Provide a headphone jack.
<P CLASS="lt1">Allows users with reduced hearing to block out background noise and make the output louder by using headphones or by directly connecting their hearing aids.</P></LI><LI>Maximize the range of volume adjustment.
<P CLASS="lt1">Allows users with reduced hearing to adjust the volume to suit their needs.</P></LI><LI>Face speakers towards the user.
<P CLASS="lt1">Maximizes the signal-to-noise ratio for all users. This is especially important for users with hearing loss.</P></LI><LI>Provide a visually distinct indicator for all alerts or warning sounds created by hardware.
<P CLASS="lt1">Makes recognizing alerts easier for users working in loud environments or for users with deafness or reduced hearing. (Software-generated alerts should be handled by software.)</P></LI><LI>Provide visual indication of important sounds generated in normal computer operation.
<P CLASS="lt1">Some natural sounds, such as those generated by a disk drive or printer, can be important to operation of the systems. Where this is true, some visual indication of the sound should be provided that accomplishes the same purpose so users in loud environments or users with reduced hearing or deafness can effectively use these systems.</P></LI><LI>Send hardware-generated beeps to the operating system.
<P CLASS="lt1">Allows visual display of the beeps for users in loud environments, located in another room, or with reduced hearing or deafness. Examples include beeps related to the keyboard and printer.</P></LI><LI>Place microphone in the orientation recommended by the microphone manufacturer.
<P CLASS="lt1">Along with speech recognition software, this makes the computer more accessible to users who are blind, have low vision, or are physically disabled (including those with Repetitive Strain Injury [RSI] and carpal tunnel syndrome), and for others who have difficulty writing.</P></LI><LI>Include a speech-capable sound system.
<P CLASS="lt1">Provides speech capabilities for nonspeaking persons and also the necessary hardware support for a speech-based access system for people with low vision, blindness, or reading problems.</P></LI><LI>Make operation of internal components quiet.
<P CLASS="lt1">Increases ability of users with neural hearing loss or hearing aids to converse or use computer sound-based features.</P></LI></OL></BODY></HTML>
