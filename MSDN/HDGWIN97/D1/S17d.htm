<H2 CLASS="h1">Labeling</H2><P CLASS="t">The ability to read labels is important to ensure that users are able to detect and recognize controls, connectors, and media interfaces. Users with low vision or blindness often have difficulty if these labels are simply printed in small or low-contrast type. All users have difficulty when these small printed labels are on the back or in hard-to-view areas of a product.</P>
<P CLASS="t">Hardware design strategies for providing greater access to labels include the following:</P>
<OL><LI>Use large, high-contrast, bold stroke, sans serif letters, and avoid artwork behind the text.
<P CLASS="lt1">Allows users with low vision and older users with reduced vision to more easily see the lettering.</P></LI><LI>Use tactually distinct icons for controls, connectors, and legends (raised at least 1/32 inch).
<P CLASS="lt1">Allows users who are blind to more easily discern an item's label by touch. Also allows any user to identify a component located out of view (such as connectors in the back of the unit).</P></LI><LI>Provide optional Braille and tactile labels.
<P CLASS="lt1">Allows users who are blind the option of customizing the labels on the items.</P></LI></OL></BODY></HTML>
