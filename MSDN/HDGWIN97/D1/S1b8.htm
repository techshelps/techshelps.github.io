<H2 CLASS="h1">C</H2><P CLASS="h4"><B>Card select number</B></P>
<P CLASS="t">The handle created by the system BIOS or the operating system through the isolation process, and assigned to each Plug and Play card on the ISA bus as a unique identifier.</P>
<P CLASS="h4"><B>Card Services</B></P>
<P CLASS="t">A system component that is a protected-mode VxD, linked with the PC Card bus driver. The Card Services component passes the event notification from socket services to the PC Card bus driver, provides information from the computer's cards to the PC Card bus driver, and sets up the configuration for cards in the adapter sockets.</P>

<P CLASS="t">Compact disc file system, which controls access to the contents of CD-ROM drives.</P>
<P CLASS="t"></P>
<P CLASS="h4"><B>class</B></P>
<P CLASS="t">For hardware, the manner in which devices and buses are grouped for purposes of installing and managing device drivers and allocating resources. The hardware tree is organized by device class, and Windows&nbsp;95 uses class installers to install drivers for all hardware classes.</P>
<P CLASS="h4"><B>codec</B></P>
<P CLASS="t">Compression/decompression technology for digital video and stereo audio.</P>
<P CLASS="h4"><B>Compatibility mode</B></P>
<P CLASS="t">An asynchronous, host-to-peripheral parallel port channel defined in the IEEE 1284-1994 standard. This mode is compatible with existing peripherals that attach to the Centronics-style PC parallel port. </P>
<P CLASS="h4"><B>Configuration Manager</B></P>
<P CLASS="t">The central component of a Plug and Play system that drives the process of locating devices, setting up their nodes in the hardware tree, and running the resource allocation process. Each of the three phases of configuration management — boot time (BIOS), real mode, and protected mode — has its own configuration manager.</P>
