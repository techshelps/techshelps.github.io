<H3 CLASS="h2">What Is Accessibility?</H3><P CLASS="t">Accessibility means making computers accessible to a wider range of users than would otherwise be the case. Special needs can be addressed in several ways:</P>
<UL><LI>New features built into hardware and operating systems that help make them accessible to users with and without specialized needs. These solutions are often referred to as "electronic curb cuts." These solutions are preferred because the features are available on all workstations and can be used with all applications.</LI><LI>Usability features that can be built into mainstream products, making them easier to use for people with disabilities. Examples include customizable colors and keyboard accelerators. In many cases these features also benefit people who do not have disabilities.</LI><LI>Utilities that modify the system to help make it more usable by more people, but are not installed on all computers. Examples of utilities include Braille output systems for people who are blind or software that modifies the behavior of the keyboard and mouse.</LI><LI>Specialized applications, such as a word processor designed to integrate voice and text, to help individuals with limited reading and writing skills.</LI></UL><P CLASS="t">A wide variety of hardware and software products have been designed to help people with disabilities make use of personal computers. Among the different types of products available for the Microsoft Windows operating system are the following: </P>
<UL><LI>Programs that enlarge or alter the color of information on the screen for people with visual impairments</LI><LI>Programs that describe information on the screen in Braille or synthesized speech for people who are blind or have difficulty reading</LI><LI>Hardware and software utilities that modify the behavior of the mouse and the keyboard</LI><LI>Programs that enable users to "type" using a mouse or their voice</LI><LI>Word or phrase prediction software that allows typing more quickly with fewer keystrokes</LI><LI>Alternate input devices, such as single-switch or puff-and-sip devices, for those who cannot use a mouse or a keyboard</LI></UL><P CLASS="t">The following sections summarize issues of computer design directly related to a wide range of individual needs for lowering barriers to computer use.</P></BODY></HTML>
