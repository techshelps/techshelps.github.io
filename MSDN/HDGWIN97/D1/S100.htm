<H2 CLASS="h1">Overview for Audio Components</H2><P CLASS="t">For PC 97, the important design issues for basic audio under Microsoft Windows are to ensure a complete Plug and Play experience for end users and to ensure that audio capabilities meet minimum standards. </P>
<P CLASS="t">Microsoft DirectSound technology provides APIs for low-latency mixing, hardware acceleration, and direct access to the sound device, while maintaining compatibility with earlier Windows-based applications and device drivers. DirectSound provides a device-independent interface that application developers can use to take advantage of any hardware capabilities. The device driver reports the capabilities of the hardware to DirectSound and passes DirectSound requests to the hardware. </P>
