<H2 CLASS="h1">Overview for ISA</H2><P CLASS="t">This section summarizes the basic requirements for a PC system that includes Industry Standard Architecture (ISA). In PC 97, ISA must be implemented with full support for Plug and Play ISA boot devices. For any ISA device that cannot meet the resource requirements specified for its device class, the device and driver must implement IRQ sharing, as described later in this chapter.</P>
<P CLASS="t">In addition to expansion cards designed to use ISA, the following are also ISA devices:</P>
<UL><LI>8042 and similar controllers, ports, keyboards, and mice</LI><LI>Direct memory access (DMA) controllers and slaves</LI><LI>Floppy disk controllers (FDC)</LI><LI>Interrupt controllers</LI><LI>Legacy parallel and serial ports </LI><LI>Math coprocessors</LI><LI>Programmable interrupt timers (PIT)</LI><LI>VGA controllers</LI></UL><P CLASS="t">Any such devices located at I/O addresses under 100h can use fixed resources and are exempt from Plug and Play requirements for unique IDs, flexible resource configuration, and dynamic disable capabilities. </P>
<P CLASS="t">The following ISA devices have additional requirements defined in this guide:</P>
<UL><LI>8042 port and device requirements are defined in the "Input Components" chapter in Part&nbsp;4 of this guide. </LI><LI>Legacy FDC requirements are defined in the "Storage and Related Peripherals" chapter in Part&nbsp;4 of this guide.</LI><LI>Legacy parallel and serial ports and related device requirements are defined in the "Serial, Parallel, and Wireless Support" chapter in Part&nbsp;4 of this guide.</LI></UL></BODY></HTML>
