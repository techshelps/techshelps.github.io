<H3 CLASS="h2">Mobile PC Design Exceptions and Clarifications</H3><P CLASS="t">A few design exceptions are called out in the Basic PC&nbsp;97 requirements in regards to capabilities that cannot be met on mobile PCs because of form factors issues or limitations in chip designs for mobile units. Exceptions and clarifications for general system design and general device requirements for mobile PCs are the following:</P>
<UL><LI><B>All expansion slots are accessible: </B>It is recognized that the fan and heat sink on the CPU or Overdrive processor might block full-sized add-on devices from being installed in some slots in mobile PCs or other small form factor system boards. However, notice that it is acceptable to allow space for only half-height cards for some slots or passive back planes used for connectors, and so on.</LI><LI><B>Hardware support for OnNow initiative: </B>

<UL><LI>The power switch control requirements do not preclude power-control capabilities related to closing the lid on the mobile unit. </LI><LI>The Message Waiting indicator is only a recommendation for mobile PCs.</LI></UL></LI><LI><B>General device requirements: </B>The battery in a mobile unit is a device that must meet the requirements defined in "General Device Requirements for Basic PC 97" in this chapter.</LI><LI><B>User cannot physically connect devices incorrectly: </B>Connector icons can wrap to the bottom of the mobile unit or inside an access door when they don't fit on the back of the case.</LI></UL><P CLASS="t">Exceptions and clarifications for system buses on mobile PCs are the following:</P>
<UL><LI><B>Universal Serial Bus: </B>The refinements to the USB specifications for power and timing for mobile PCs are PC&nbsp;97 requirements for power management. For mobile units, USB must be built into the PC, not provided solely by port replications or docking stations, although these units can provide extra USB connectors.
<P CLASS="lt1">For Entertainment PC 97, it is recognized that there might be no room for two USB connectors on a mobile PC unit. However, for a docking pair, a second USB connector can be provided on the docking station.</P></LI><LI><B>Other high-speed expansion bus: </B>A mobile PC design can include an expansion bus for connecting a docking station or port replicator.</LI></UL><P CLASS="t">Exceptions and clarifications for I/O devices on mobile PCs are the following:</P>
<UL><LI><B>Connections for external keyboard and pointing device: </B>The requirement for external connections for the keyboard and pointing device can be met by implementing a single PS/2 port and providing a special cable that allows both the external keyboard and the mouse to use the single port.
<P CLASS="lt1">The external connection can also be implemented on the port replicator for a mobile unit that includes such a device.</P>

<P CLASS="lt1">A second serial port is not a recommended design solution for an external mouse connection on a mobile PC.</P></LI><LI><B>Connection for external parallel and serial devices: </B>These capabilities can be provided on a port replicator or on the docking station for a docking pair.</LI><LI><B>Audio meets PC 97 requirements: </B>It is recognized that baseline audio is built into the mobile unit on the system board. For mobile PCs, the signal-to-noise requirement is 75 dB from 20&nbsp;Hz to 15&nbsp;kHz, A-weighted, as noted in the "Audio Components" chapter in Part&nbsp;4 of this guide.</LI></UL><P CLASS="t">Exceptions and clarifications for graphics on mobile PCs are the following:</P>
<UL><LI><B>Display adapter resolution minimum: </B>Minimum resolution is specified as 640x480x8&nbsp;bpp for small LCD displays such as those used for the internal display on mobile PCs. The display adapter for external displays must meet the resolution requirements and all other minimum requirements as defined in the "Graphics Adapters" chapter in Part 4 of this guide. </LI><LI><B>Hardware support for video playback. </B>Hardware arithmetic stretching and YUV off-screen surfaces for color space conversion are recommended but not required for the internal display on mobile PCs.</LI><LI><B>ICC color matching for monitors. </B>This is a recommendation for LCD, color plasma displays, or other flat panel devices. This will become a requirement.</LI></UL></BODY></HTML>
