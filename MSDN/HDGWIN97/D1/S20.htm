<H3 CLASS="h2">Docking Station Requirements</H3><P CLASS="t">Docking systems for mobile PCs allow docking of a PC with additional hardware capabilities. A docking station adds capability to a mobile PC that allows the end user to add other devices to the system — for example, sound, network adapter, hard disks, CD-ROM, different display adapter, SCSI, modems, and so on. </P>
<P CLASS="t">Resource conflicts can occur with a mobile PC that is paired with a docking station if the docking station contains an expansion bus that allows users to add non-proprietary expansion cards to the system. For a mobile PC-and-docking station pair, the system designer must ensure that the docking system is capable of arbitrating resources for conflicts that might occur if an expansion card is added to the docking station. However, the system designer does not need to add to the mobile PC&nbsp;unit all of the Basic PC&nbsp;97 resource-arbitration capabilities.</P>

<P CLASS="spacing"><BR></P><P CLASS="t">The mobile PC unit that is part of a docking system does not require all of the resource-arbitration capabilities required for expandable PC systems. However, the system as a whole must be capable of dynamically disabling add-on devices completely and freeing all the resources used by that device when the mobile unit is docked. (This requirement excludes fixed-resource devices, such as the DMA controller, interrupt controller, and so on.)</P>
<P CLASS="t">With this capability, individual devices in the mobile PC will be disabled when it is docked, allowing the appropriate devices in the docking station to be enabled. </P>
<P CLASS="t">The system could fail if an add-on card requires resources that conflict with a device on either the mobile PC or the docking station. The mobile/docking station combination must be able to resolve resource conflicts between all the devices in the docking system. </P>
<P CLASS="t">This means that docking-station devices must be available to replace disabled devices in the mobile PC, and these devices must meet the basic resource arbitration requirements for PC&nbsp;97, as described earlier in this chapter. However, it is up to the design engineer of a mobile/docking station combination to determine which component (mobile or docking station) will resolve the conflict when the mobile unit is docked. </P>

<P CLASS="spacing"><BR></P><P CLASS="t">The system must provide a fail-safe system for docking and undocking the mobile unit. Working in conjunction with the operating system and ACPI, the mechanism for fail-safe docking must ensure the following:</P>
<UL><LI>The undock button signals the user's intent to the system.</LI><LI>Docking can occur only when the mobile unit is in the correct power state. (The power state depends on whether the system is designed to support cold, warm, or hot docking.)</LI><LI>The user can initiate undocking through Windows-based software choices. Notice, however, that a hardware "button" must also be provided, because experience shows that users often do not find the software option and remove mobile units without operating-system notification.</LI><LI>The undock button or software choice sends signal to the operating system, so that the user is warned if resources in use are in danger of being lost.</LI><LI>A safe undock indicator is provided so that user can identify when it is safe to remove the mobile unit. This can be an LED light or any other mechanism chosen by the vendor. If a physical mechanism automatically undocks the mobile PC or if hot docking is supported, then the "safe undock" indicator is not required.</LI></UL><P CLASS="t">There is no requirement for mechanical lockout to block the user from removing the mobile unit without operating system notification.</P></BODY></HTML>
