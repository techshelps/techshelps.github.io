<P CLASS="t">There is only one change to Plug and Play specifications from those defined in 1995: the addition of SCANNER and DIGCAM as new CLASS key values for Plug and Play parallel devices.</P>

<P CLASS="spacing"><BR></P><P CLASS="t">Each device connected to an expansion bus must be able to supply its own unique identifier. Each type of bus contains different information for uniquely identifying devices on expansion cards. For more information, see the chapters for particular bus designs in Part 3 of this guide.</P>
<UL><LI>Each separate function or device on the system board must be enumerated separately, so each must provide a device identifier in the manner required for the bus it uses.</LI><LI>If a device on an expansion card is enumerated by the BIOS, it must have a unique identifier and its own resources according to the PC&nbsp;97 device-ID requirements for the bus to which the card is connected.

<UL><LI>Legacy devices attached to the ISA bus on the system board do not have unique Plug and Play identifiers (for example, serial ports, parallel ports, or PS/2-compatible port devices).

<P CLASS="spacing"><BR></P><P CLASS="t">This requirement applies only for x86-based systems for any devices that might use option ROM, whether the device is present on the system board or provided through an expansion card. Related option ROM requirements are also defined for specific bus classes and specific devices, such as SCSI and graphics adapters, respectively.</P>
<P CLASS="t">For x86-based systems, option ROMs are usually located on cards used as system boot devices. During the boot process, option ROMs initialize the boot devices, which provide the primary input, primary output, and IPL device to boot the system. However, Plug and Play option ROMs can be used to supply the Plug and Play expansion header to devices other than boot devices, enabling them to initialize both devices when the system boots.</P>
<P CLASS="t">To design an option ROM with Plug and Play capabilities, follow the requirements described in the Plug and Play BIOS Specification, which discusses the Plug and Play expansion header and the interaction between the system BIOS and the option ROM. In particular, note the following points from the specification:</P>
<UL><LI>The header contains information that identifies the type of boot device connected to the expansion card and allows the system BIOS to prioritize the boot devices. Shadowed copies of the option ROM must also contain the Plug and Play expansion headers.</LI><LI>A Plug and Play option ROM must be able to determine whether the system BIOS complies with Plug and Play. If the system ROM is not Plug and Play compliant, the option ROM should immediately initialize the card and hook the proper interrupt as though it were a non – Plug and Play option ROM. This allows the expansion card to be used in non – Plug and Play systems.</LI><LI>Option ROMs can use the system BIOS run-time functions, but these functions are not available until after the POST process has completed and Int&nbsp;19 has been called. In particular, an option ROM must not hook the following interrupts until the system BIOS calls the boot connection vector contained in the Plug and Play expansion header: Int&nbsp;9h, Int&nbsp;10h, Int&nbsp;13h, Int&nbsp;18h, or Int&nbsp;19h. Option ROM routines must not try to use these run-time functions until that time, because the results can be unpredictable.</LI></UL><P CLASS="t">Option ROM requirements for specific devices are defined in the "ATA and ATAPI" and "SCSI" chapters in Part&nbsp;3, and also in the "Graphics Adapters" chapter in Part&nbsp;4 of this guide.</P>

<P CLASS="spacing"><BR></P><P CLASS="t">All ISA and other legacy devices not enumerated by the system board interface must not use "PNP" in their Vendor and Device codes. The "PNP" vendor code is reserved for Microsoft and the vendors whose hardware is specifically assigned a particular ID. Other hardware can only use a "PNP" code when defining a device's CompatibleID after first indicating the device's HardwareID in the Plug and Play header. </P>
<P CLASS="t">For non-BIOS enumerated ISA devices, rather than using "PNP" in the vendor ID code, vendors must register any new vendor IDs by sending e-mail to pnpid@microsoft.com. For information about using "PNP" CompatibleIDs, see Appendix&nbsp;B<B>, "</B>Device Identifiers." </P>
<P CLASS="t">Use of CompatibleIDs is strongly recommended for devices that use device drivers provided with the Windows operating system, such as a "Standard PC COM Port" (PNP0500) or "Sound Blaster 16-compatible Sound Device" (PNPB003).</P>

<P CLASS="spacing"><BR></P><P CLASS="t">Each device must support a unique I/O port address in the 16-bit address range. This requirement means, at a minimum, the upper address lines A10&nbsp;–&nbsp;A15 can be used as device enable, so the device does not respond to addresses outside of the 10-bit address range. CardBus controllers and cards must meet the requirements defined in the "PC Card" chapter in Part&nbsp;3 of this guide.</P>
<P CLASS="t">Devices that that use less than 16-bit I/O decode create conflicts that cannot be resolved by a Plug and Play operating system. Phantom (alias) addressing is not supported by the Windows operating system and cannot be used to meet the PC&nbsp;97 requirements. </P>
<P CLASS="t">Notice, however, that this requirement does not apply for the three ISA auto-configuration registers used during device enumeration and configuration. The ADDRESS, WRITE_DATA, and READ_DATA registers will continue to use 12-bit decoding as described in the ISA Plug and Play specification.</P>

<P CLASS="lt1">In all cases, however, changing configuration settings still must not require jumper changes.</P></LI><LI>Software setting are available for configuring all resources.
<P CLASS="lt1">All buses and devices on both the system board and all expansion cards must be capable of being configured by the operating system and by software such as Device Manager in Windows&nbsp;95, so the user does not need to open the PC case to change the configuration. DIP switches on boot devices can be used for an initial power-on default state or for non – Plug and Play system compatibility, but must be able to be overridden by software configuration after power-up.</P>

<P CLASS="lt1"><B>Note</B>  This does not exclude jumper settings that the OEM configures to define CPU speed, select a keyboard, or make other system-related settings. This requirement excludes only jumper settings that the end user must make to configure the hardware.</P></LI><LI>Dynamic disable capabilities are supported for all devices.
<P CLASS="lt1">All devices must be capable of being disabled automatically by the system. Also, disabling the device must result in freeing all its resources for use by other devices.</P>

<P CLASS="lt1">The following devices are exempt from the requirement for dynamic disable capabilities: all legacy devices using the I/O range under 100h, keyboard controller, floppy disk controller, hard disk controller, VGA memory and I/O addresses, and any BIOS memory ranges required for legacy boot support.</P></LI></UL><P CLASS="h4"><B>22.
