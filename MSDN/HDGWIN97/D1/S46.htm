<P CLASS="h4"><B>8. USB, with two easily accessible connectors</B></P>

<P CLASS="spacing"><BR></P><P CLASS="t">Universal Serial Bus (USB) provides a bidirectional, isochronous, dynamically attachable serial interface for adding peripheral devices such as game controllers, communications devices, and input devices on a single bus.</P>
<P CLASS="t">To ensure that it is as easy as possible for end users to add and remove devices, expansion capabilities must be provided by including USB in the PC system. The Entertainment PC&nbsp;97 system must include two USB ports. At least one USB connector must be in an easily accessible location (not on the rear panel) to support connection of auxiliary input devices such as game pads, joysticks, and trackballs. The recommended location for an easily accessible connector is to place the port on the front of the PC system. It is also recommended that at least one USB connector be placed on the rear panel.</P>
<P CLASS="t">The USB must meet the requirements defined in USB specifications, plus any additional requirements for PC&nbsp;97 defined in the "USB" chapter in Part&nbsp;3 of this guide.</P>
<P CLASS="h4"><B>9. IEEE 1394 with easily accessible connector</B></P>

<P CLASS="spacing"><BR></P><P CLASS="t">Recommended: 2 connectors. At least one 1394 port is required on the Entertainment PC&nbsp;97 system to connect 1394-based camcorders and other digital consumer electronics. To be easily accessible, the connection must not be on the rear panel. The recommended location is to place a port on the front of the PC system. If a second port is included, this connector can be placed on the rear for static connections to devices such as home stereos. For information about PC&nbsp;97 requirements for this bus, see the "IEEE 1394" chapter in Part&nbsp;3 of this guide.</P>
<P CLASS="h4"><B>10. Support for other high-speed expansion capabilities</B></P>

<P CLASS="spacing"><BR></P><P CLASS="t">Support for additional expansion capabilities can be provided using PCI v. 2.1, CardBus, or other high-speed expansion bus. Any expansion bus implemented in the system must meet the requirements defined in the related chapter in Part&nbsp;3 of this guide.</P>
<P CLASS="nt"><FONT CLASS="nh"><B>Note</B></FONT>  For Entertainment PC&nbsp;97, IEEE 1394 is required to&nbsp;support most high-speed expansion capabilities. PCI and ISA are not recommended buses for providing expansion capabilities, because such buses do not allow end users to easily add and remove devices without screwdrivers. </P>
<P CLASS="h4"><B>11. If present, PCI bus meets PCI v. 2.1 and higher, plus PC&nbsp;97 requirements</B></P>
