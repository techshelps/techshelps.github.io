<p>
In the SETUP directory of the DAO SDK you will find a setup template that can be combined into your own InstallShield-based installation program. The files are:</p>
<table border=1 cellpadding=5 cols=2 frame=below rules=rows width=587>
<tr valign=top>
<td class=label width=35%><b>File</b></td>
<td class=label width=65%><b>Description</b></td>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=35%>Daomin.rul</td>
<td width=65%>Template InstallShield setup script</td>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=35%>Rega.dll</td>
<td width=65%>Directory with source files for rebuilding the setup support DLL that has been provided </td>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=35%>Daosetup.rtf</td>
<td width=65%>Detailed instructions on creating your own setup program from scratch</td>
</tr>
</table><br>
<p>
This script assumes that you are using the InstallShield program that comes with Microsoft Visual C++. InstallShield has a version that is sold separately which provides more functionality, including functions that remove the need for the support DLL (specifically, the ability to register DLLs that have a <b>DLLRegisterServer</b> entry point and to automatically uninstall them using <b>DLLUnregisterServer</b>).</p>
<p>
Refer to the documentation that comes with InstallShield for how to use it. The tools that it comes with allow you to ‘unpack’ the compressed files that comprise the SDK and tailor the packaging for your own setup. This allows you to distribute support for certain specific file formats, for example, rather than the supplied “all or none” options.</p>
