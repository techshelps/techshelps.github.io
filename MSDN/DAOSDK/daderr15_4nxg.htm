<p>
The member of the <a href="daglos03_0alw.htm">replica set</a> you are attempting to use has been removed because either it has not been synchronized within the required number of days (retention period) or it has been synchronized with a second <a href="daglos01_0zoy.htm">Design Master</a>. The member should be deleted from your computer.</p>
<p>
If there is data in the member that has not been synchronized with any other member in the replica set, manually enter that data in another member. You can determine which records have unsynchronized data by examining the s_Generation field in each table. A value of 0 in the s_Generation field indicates the record is inserted or updated and has not been synchronized with another <a href="daglos03_9b4x.htm">replica</a> in the set.</p>
