<h1><a name="dahowparadoxinitializationsettings"></a>Paradox Initialization Settings</h1>
<p>
The Jet\3.5\Engines\Paradox folder includes initialization settings for the Mspdox35.dll driver, used for access to external Paradox data. Typical settings for the entries in this folder are shown in the following example.</p>
<pre><code>win32=&lt;path&gt;\MSPDOX35.dll
PageTimeout=600
CollatingSequence=ASCII
DataCodePage=OEM
ParadoxUserName=Kimberly
ParadoxNetPath=P:\PDOXDB
ParadoxNetStyle=4.X
</code></pre>
<p>
The Microsoft Jet database engine uses the Paradox folder entries as follows.</p>
<table border=1 cellpadding=5 cols=2 frame=below rules=rows width=587>
<tr valign=top>
<td class=label width=30%><b>Entry</b></td>
<td class=label width=70%><b>Description</b></td>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=30%>win32</td>
<td width=70%>The location of Mspdox35.dll. The full path is determined at the time of installation. Values are of type String for Windows 95 and Windows NT 4.0, and of type REG_SZ for Windows NT 3.51.</td>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=30%>PageTimeout</td>
<td width=70%>The length of time between when data is placed in an internal cache and when it is invalidated. The value is specified in 100 millisecond units. The default is 600 units or 60 seconds. Values are of type DWORD for Windows 95 and Windows NT 4.0, and of type REG_DWORD for Windows NT 3.51.</td>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=30%>CollatingSequence</td>
<td width=70%>The collating sequence for all Paradox tables created or opened using the Microsoft Jet database engine. Possible values are ASCII, International, Norwegian-Danish, and Swedish-Finnish. The CollatingSequence entry must match the collating sequence used when the Paradox table was built. The default is ASCII. Values are of type String for Windows 95 and Windows NT 4.0, and of type REG_SZ for Windows NT 3.51.</td>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=30%>DataCodePage</td>
<td width=70%>An indicator of how text pages are stored. Possible settings are:<ul type=disc>
<li>
OEM ? OemToAnsi and AnsiToOem conversions done.<br><br></li>
<li>
ANSI ? OemToAnsi and AnsiToOem conversions not done.</li>
</ul>
<p>
The default is OEM. Values are of type String for Windows 95 and Windows NT 4.0, and of type REG_SZ for Windows NT 3.51.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=30%>ParadoxUserName</td>
<td width=70%>The name to be displayed by Paradox if a table is locked by the Paradox ISAM and an interactive user accessing the data from Paradox (rather than the ISAM) attempts to place an incompatible lock. This entry isn't added if the computer isn't on a network. Values are of type String for Windows 95 and Windows NT 4.0, and of type REG_SZ for Windows NT 3.51.<p class=indent>
<B><b>Note</b></B> If you indicate a ParadoxUserName, you must also specify a ParadoxNetPath and a ParadoxNetStyle or you'll receive an error when trying to access external Paradox data. Also, if you're accessing a Paradox database in multi-user mode over the network, you'll have to add or modify this registry entry manually.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=30%>ParadoxNetPath</td>
<td width=70%>The full path to the directory containing the PARADOX.NET file (for Paradox 3.x) or the PDOXUSRS.NET file (for Paradox 4.x). This entry isn't added if the computer isn't on a network. Usually, you need to change the initial setting (added by the Setup program), which is a best guess at where the file might be. The full ParadoxNetPath (including the drive letter) must be consistent for all users sharing a particular database (directory). Values are of type String for Windows 95 and Windows NT 4.0, and of type REG_SZ for Windows NT 3.51.<p class=indent>
<B><b>Note</b></B> If you indicate a ParadoxNetPath, you must also specify a ParadoxUserName and a ParadoxNetStyle or you'll receive an error when trying to access external Paradox data. Also, if you're accessing a Paradox database in multi-user mode over the network, you'll have to add or modify this registry entry manually.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=30%>ParadoxNetStyle</td>
<td width=70%>The network access style to use when accessing Paradox data. Possible values are:<ul type=disc>
<li>
3.x<br><br></li>
<li>
4.x</li>
</ul>
<p class=indent>
<B><b>Note</b></B> that Paradox 3.x users can't set this to 4.x or the driver will use the wrong locking method. Paradox 5.0 users must use the 4.x ParadoxNetStyle setting to ensure proper locking behavior.</p>
<p>
This entry isn't added if the computer isn't on a network. This entry should correspond to whatever version of Paradox the users in the group are using. It must be consistent for all users sharing a particular database (directory). The default is 4.x. Values are of type String for Windows 95 and Windows NT 4.0, and of type REG_SZ for Windows NT 3.51.</p>
<p class=indent>
<B><b>Note</b></B> If you indicate a ParadoxNetStyle, you must also specify a ParadoxUserName and a ParadoxNetPath or you'll receive an error when trying to access external Paradox data.</p>
