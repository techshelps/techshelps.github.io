Other versions of the dbDAO DLL may be built that vary with respect to the following capabilities:
<ul type=disc>
<li>
Use of ANSI or Unicode strings.<br><br></li>
<li>
Built-in debugging functionality.<br><br></li>
<li>
Use of shared or static Microsoft Foundation Classes (MFC) DLLs.</li>
</ul>
<p>
The MakeFile that is installed with the DAO SDK (Dbdao.mak) provides you with four pre-built dbDAO DLLs, and subprojects to build them, plus four others. The four pre-built DLLs are:
<ul type=disc>
<li>
Release\Ddao35.dll (dbDAO –  Win32 Release) — This is the ANSI version of the dbDAO classes. It dynamically links with the MFC DLL, making Ddao35.dll smaller and allowing it to share the MFC DLLs on a user's system with other applications that also use MFC 4.2 or later. Developers writing applications with this DLL must ensure that their setup program distributes the MFC DLLs. The DAO SDK Setup program installs this file into your system directory.<br><br></li>
<li>
Releaseu\Ddao35u.dll (dbDAO –  Win32 Release Unicode) — This is the Unicode version of the dbDAO classes. It is otherwise identical to Ddao35.dll. The DAO SDK Setup program installs this file into your system directory.<br><br></li>
<li>
Debug\Ddao35d.dll (dbDAO – Win32 Debug) — This is the debug ANSI version of Ddao35.dll. It is intended for developers who have to debug into the dbDAO source code. Developers should not ship this version, as it is slower and has debug functionality that users will not want.<br><br></li>
<li>
Debugu\Ddao35ud.dll (dbDAO – Win32 Debug Unicode) — This is the debug Unicode version of Ddao35u.dll. It is intended for developers who have to debug into the dbDAO source code. Developers should not ship this version, as it is slower and has debug functionality that users will not want.</li>
</ul>
<p>
The other four subprojects defined in the dbDAO MakeFile are:
<ul type=disc>
<li>
Releases\Ddao35.dll (dbDAO – Win32 Release Static MFC) — This file is for ANSI applications that are statically linked to the MFC library. It has the MFC class library built into it.<br><br></li>
<li>
Releaseus\Ddao35u.dll (dbDAO – Win32 Release Unicode Static MFC) — This file is for Unicode applications that are statically linked to the MFC library. It has the MFC library built into it.<br><br></li>
<li>
Debugs\Ddao35d.dll (dbDAO – Win32 Debug Static MFC) — This is the debug version for ANSI applications that are statically linked to the MFC library. Developers should not ship this version, as it is slower and has debug functionality that users will not want.<br><br></li>
<li>
Debugus\Ddao35ud.dll (dbDAO – Win32 Debug Unicode Static MFC) — This is the debug version for Unicode applications that are statically linked to the MFC library. Developers should not ship this version, as it is slower and has debug functionality that users will not want.</li>
</ul>
