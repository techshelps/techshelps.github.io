<h1><a name="_win32_platform_sdk_release_notes"></a>Platform SDK Release Notes</h1>
<p>
The April 1998 release of the Microsoft® Platform Software Development Kit (SDK) documentation describes the application programming interfaces (API) you need to write Win32®-based applications. The Platform SDK contains a variety of components. These components are integrated into functional groups within the SDK, making them easier to find. </p>
<p>
The Platform SDK documentation contains APIs that depend on the version of the operating system or other components that are installed. After you have determined that a system has installed support for a particular API, you can use its functionality. When you build your application, use the new header files and import libraries from the Platform SDK. </p>
<p>
The following topics describe the new features introduced in each release of the Platform SDK. 
<ul>
<li>
<a href="relnotes_12lt.htm">Release Notes for Windows NT 5.0 Beta 1</a></li>
<li>
<a href="relnotes_4xgz.htm">Release Notes for Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 3</a></li>
</ul>
<p>
Later versions of this SDK documentation will be made available on <B><A HREF = "http://www.microsoft.com/msdn/sdk">http://www.microsoft.com/msdn/sdk</A></B>.</p>
