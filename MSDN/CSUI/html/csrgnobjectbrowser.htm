Displays the classes, properties, methods, events, and constants available for packages and object libraries and the procedures in your project. You can use it to find and use objects you create, as well as objects from other applications.</p>
<p>
<b>Note</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The contents of the Object Browser are application-specific. When an application is loaded into memory, it may fill the browser with specific contents. Therefore, you may not see the same contents you saw during your last session. Once you create a project or select a command that uses a particular application, the contents of the Object Browser specific to that application may appear and remain available as long as the application remains in memory. Common items are available all of the time.</p>
<p>
You can obtain help for the Object Browser by pressing CTRL+F1 or by choosing Object Browser help from the shortcut menu.</p>
