<p>
The Microsoft® Site Server Search SDK contains COM objects that can be programmed to automate the catalog building process for conducting searches. You can fully administer all the components of a Search system and also invoke catalog building whenever document content changes.</p>
<p>
In addition to developing applications with user interfaces, developers can provide administrators with Windows® Scripting Host (WSH) scripts for performing quick configurations and for gathering statistical information.</p>
<p>
The Search SDK does not provide objects for initiating search requests or for managing search results. See the main Microsoft Site Server documentation for information about using the <b>Query</b> and <b>Utility</b> objects, SQL queries, and how to use ADO objects for data processing the search results. </p>
<h3>Search System Overview</h3>
<p>
Programmers are encouraged to read about Search in the Microsoft Site Server product documentation to get a thorough understanding of the technology; however, here is a brief overview of the Search system components.</p>
<p>
A Search host is a Microsoft® Windows NT® Server on which Search is installed. A Search system comprises one or more hosts that work together to create, maintain, and store your catalogs.</p>
<p>
Hosts are divided into the following functions:
<ul type=disc>
<li>
<b>Catalog Build Server.</b> Contains catalog definitions, which are the user-defined settings for a catalog. Based on these settings, this server gathers information and builds catalogs.<br><br></li>
<li>
<b>Search Server. </b>Stores completed catalogs for searching.</li>
</ul>
<p>
A host can function as both a catalog build server and a search server.</p>
<p>
In the Microsoft Management Console under Search, these two servers are represented as icons under each host in the system. </p>
<h4>Propagating Catalogs</h4>
<p>
After a catalog build server has built a catalog from a catalog definition, it propagates the completed catalog to the selected search servers. A catalog can be propagated to as many as 32 search servers, where site visitors can search the completed catalog.</p>
<p>

<p>
Although you can use just one host for both building and searching catalogs, propagating catalogs to other hosts can be useful.
<ul type=disc>
<li>
You can dedicate one server to building catalogs, and dedicate multiple servers to searching catalogs. Because building a catalog can consume system resources, site visitors can search catalogs quicker on dedicated search servers.<br><br></li>
<li>
If your site experiences a high volume of use, multiple search servers can distribute the load with a round-robin approach.<br><br></li>
<li>
By using multiple hosts, you can increase the reliability of your system; for example, if one host goes down, other hosts will continue to function.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Terminology</h3>
<p>
The Search SDK naming conventions are slightly different than what is used is the Search product documentation and administrative tools. The following table shows the relationship between the two.</p>
