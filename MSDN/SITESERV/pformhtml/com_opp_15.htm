<h2><a name="com_opp_lpcm"></a><sup></sup>The Pipeline Editor</h2>
<p>
Pipelines are described in pipeline configuration (.pcf) files. You create and configure these files using either the Active Server Pages (ASP)-based HTML Pipeline Editor or the Win32®-based Pipeline Editor.</p>
<p>
The <a href="com_tools_1.htm">Pipeline Editor</a> displays a tree, outlining the stages implemented by the default OPP, as well as the components that can be used in each stage of processing.</p>
<p>
Stages and components are executed by the OPP in the order in which they are included in the tree.</p>
<p>
Certain components are said to have an <i>affinity</i> with certain stages. This means that the component can function within that stage. Commerce Server does not enforce this stage/component association. You can include in any stage any component that can sensibly coordinate with other components in that stage.</p>
<h5>Note</h5>
<p>
If you use the Commerce Server Pipeline Editor to display the components that have an affinity with a given stage, you will see the <b>DCOMTransport</b> and <b>Scriptor</b> components listed. These components have an affinity with all stages.</p>
