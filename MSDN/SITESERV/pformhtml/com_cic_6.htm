<h1><a name="com_cic_zihm"></a><sup></sup>The Commerce Interchange Pipelines</h1>
<p>
A business-to-business scenario often involves two Commerce Interchange pipelines. One of these pipelines, the <i>Transmit pipeline</i>, packages an order and transmits it over a network or to a pipeline on the same computer. The second pipeline, a <i>Receive pipeline</i>, receives and reads the data, and performs various <i>unpacking</i> operations, such as decrypting the data, verifying the digital signature, and mapping the data to a format that can be read by an application.</p>

<p>
The configuration of a particular pipeline is saved in a <i>pipeline configuration (.pcf) file</i>. The pipeline configuration contains the following component types:
<ul>
<li>
&upsilon;<b>Mapping Components. </b>Converts the contents of a business data object to a transmissible format, or converts received data to the object in which it was originally stored.</li>
<li>
<b>&upsilon;Add/Open Header. </b>Adds/removes elements to and from the Transport Dictionary including sender and receiver addresses and receipt requests.</li>
<li>
&upsilon;<b>Digital Signature component.</b> Determines the type of digital signature used (if any) to digitally sign a business data object, or to verify its signature.</li>
<li>
&upsilon;<b>Encryption/Decryption component.</b> Determines how to encrypt or decrypt the contents of the business data object, using certificates.</li>
<li>
&upsilon;<b>Audit Components.</b> Writes various pieces of the business data object to the audit database.</li>
<li>
&upsilon;<b>Transport connector.</b> Designed and configured to transmit or receive a business data object.</li>
<li>
&upsilon;<b>Application Integration.</b> Invokes an application to process the received business data object.</li>
</ul>
<p>
For each stage and component in the Transmit pipeline, there is usually a counterpart in the Receive pipeline (in reverse order).</p>
