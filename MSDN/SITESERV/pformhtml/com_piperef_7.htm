<h2><a name="com_tools_gdbj"></a><sup></sup>DBOrderPromoADO</h2>
<p>
The <b>DBOrderPromoADO</b> component, which usually appears in the Order Adjust Price stage of an order processing pipeline, runs a query to retrieve data about price promotions from the database and then adjusts item prices accordingly. 
<ul>
<li>
&upsilon;<b>Query</b>. Specifies either the full SQL text of the query that is executed by this component or the name of a query whose full SQL text is defined in the site’s Global.asa file.</li>
<li>
&upsilon;<b>Connection string</b>. Specifies the connection string used for connecting to the database. The connection string must include either the full connection string (the data source name (DSN), database login ID, and database password) or the name of a named connection stored in the connection map. If this field is blank, the default connection string is used.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Remarks</h4>
<p>
The <b>DBOrderPromoADO</b> component executes a query to determine if the promotional conditions defined in a database table have been met by items in the <b>OrderForm</b>. If they have, <b>DBOrderPromoADO</b> applies the promotion to the <b>OrderForm</b> by initializing the <code>item</code>._<code>oadjust</code>_<code>adjustedprice</code> and <code>item._n_unadjusted</code> name/value pairs for the item affected by the promotion.</p>
<p>
The <code>item</code>._<code>oadjust</code>_<code>adjustedprice</code> name/value pair reflects the total cost of a given item, adjusted for promotions. The <code>item._n_unadjusted</code> name/value pair contains the number of items that were not affected by the promotion.</p>
<p>
Suppose, for example, that you define a promotion in which a customer who purchases one of <b>Item A</b> gets one of <b>Item B</b> at half-price. Suppose further that the following conditions exist.
<ul>
<li>
&upsilon;The customer has purchased one of <b>Item A</b>.</li>
<li>
&upsilon;The customer has purchased three of <b>Item B</b>.</li>
<li>
&upsilon;<b>Item B</b> has a regular price of 1.00.</li>
</ul>
<p>
When the <b>DBOrderPromoADO</b> component is run, the user will, by the terms of the promotion, get two of the items at the regular price of one dollar. However, the customer will get the third item at fifty percent off. Thus, the <code>item</code>._<code>oadjust</code>_<code>adjustedprice</code> for <b>Item B</b> will equal 2.50 cents.</p>
<p>
In addition, because only one of the three <b>Item B</b> products will have been promotionally adjusted, the <code>item</code>.<code>_n_nadjusted</code> name/value pair will be initialized to two. This initialization is critical, because once an item has had its price adjusted, the price cannot be adjusted again.</p>
<p>
In this example, one of <b>Item B</b> had its price adjusted. The other two <b>Item B</b> items did not. Consequently, no matter how many of the three items qualify for a promotional adjustment under a later <b>DBOrderPromoADO</b> component, only the two previously unadjusted <b>Item B</b> items can be adjusted.</p>

<h4>The Promotions Table</h4>
<p>
Because the <b>DBOrderPromoADO</b> component expects the query that you supply to reference a specific group of table columns, the table in which you store promotions must have a given structure.</p>
<p>
The database query must return at least the following columns:</p>
<p>
<b>cond_column.</b> Contains the name of the item attribute against which the promotion condition is checked. For example, in the Volcano Coffee sample site’s vc30_promo_price table, this column contains the value _<code>product</code>_<code>pfid</code>, indicating that this name/value pair on the <code>item</code> <b>Dictionary</b> will be evaluated for each item in the <code>items</code> list.</p>
<p>
<b>cond_op.</b> A comparison operator that compares <i>cond_column</i> to <i>cond_value</i>; for example <code>=</code> or <code>&lt;&gt;</code>.</p>
<p>
<b>cond_value.</b> A value that identifies the item being promoted. For example, in the Volcano Coffee site, the <b>cond_column</b> is _<code>product</code>_<code>pfid</code>, the <b>cond_op</b> is “=” and the <b>cond_value</b> is 22. If an item in the items list has a _<code>product</code>_<code>pfid</code> that evaluates to 22, that item meets the condition set.</p>
<p>
If this value is a number, it must be an integer value; floating point numbers (for example, 10.0) are not accepted.</p>
<p>
<b>cond_all.</b> Optional field. If set to 1 (True), any product in the set of products to be purchased will trigger this promotion. Otherwise, this promotion will be triggered only by products that meet the criteria defined in <b>cond_column</b>, <b>cond_op</b>, and <b>cond_value</b><code> </code>(the condition set). Products are removed from the condition and award sets after they have been involved in a promotion to prevent a single product from being a participant in multiple promotions.</p>
<p>
<b>award_column.</b> The <i>award_column</i>, coupled with the <i>award_op</i> and <i>award_value</i>, define the <i>award set</i> for the promotion. The award column contains a value indicating the name/value pair that defines the award criteria.</p>
<p>
For example, in the Volcano Coffee sample site’s vc30_promo_price table, this column contains the value _product_dept_id, the <i>award_op</i> column contains “=”, and the <i>award_value</i> column contains 2.</p>
<p>
This means that if the condition set is met, then _product_dept_id is evaluated for each item in the items list. If a product in the items list contains a _product_dept_id name/value pair with a value of 2, then the promotion applies to that item.</p>
<p>
<b>award_op.</b> Comparison operator that compares <b>award_column</b> with <b>award_value</b>; for example <code>=</code> or <code>&lt;&gt;</code>.</p>
<p>
<b>award_value.</b> Indicates the value of the element referenced by <b>award_column</b>.</p>
<p>
<b>award_all.</b> Optional field. If set to one (True), then the award can be applied to any product. Otherwise, this award will be applied only to products that meet the criteria defined in <b>award_column</b>, <b>award_op</b>, and <b>award_value</b> (the award set).</p>
<p>
<b>shopper_column.</b> Value indicating the customer-specific information; can be <code>@</code> (a wildcard value) indicating all customers are eligible for the promotion.</p>
<p>
<b>shopper_op.</b> Should be set to <code>=</code> if a customer is specified; otherwise, it is <code>@</code>.</p>
<p>
<b>shopper_value.</b> Value indicating the type of customer; if it is any customer, set it to <code>@</code>.</p>
<p>
<b>shopper_all.</b> Optional field indicating whether this promotion is available to all customers. If this value is 0 (False), the promotion is available only to customers who meet the criteria defined in <b>shopper_column</b>, <b>shopper_op</b>, and <b>shopper_value</b>.</p>
<p>
<b>cond_min.</b> A value, in cents (or other currency unit), or a number of units of the minimum purchase necessary to be eligible for the promotion. The interpretation of <b>cond_min</b> depends upon the value referenced in <b>cond_basis</b>. For example, if cond_basis contains “P”, <b>cond_min</b> is assumed to measure price. If <b>cond_basis</b> contains “Q”, <b>cond_min</b> is assumed to measure quantity.</p>
<p>
<b>cond_basis.</b> Value indicating whether <b>cond_min</b> is measured in price or quantity (<code>P</code> or <code>Q</code>, respectively).</p>
<p>
<b>award_max.</b> Size of the award set.</p>
<p>
<b>disjoint_cond_award.</b> A number (1 or 0) indicating whether the award can be <i>disjointed</i>. If the value is 0, the award is disjointed; otherwise, it is not. The term disjointed, in this context, refers to whether or not an item can promote itself. Where the condition set and the award set do not refer to the same item, this value is ignored.<br>
<br>
Suppose, for example, that you have a promotion that dictates that if you purchase one of <b>Item A</b>, you get one of <b>Item A </b>at fifty percent off.<br>
<br>
If the award is not disjointed (disjoint_cond_award is equal to 0), then a customer needs only to purchase one of <b>Item A</b> to get that item at fifty percent off. If the award is disjointed (disjoint_cond_award is equal to 1), then a customer purchasing <b>Item A</b> will get a second <b>Item A</b> at fifty percent off, but will receive no discount until the second item is added to the basket.</p>
<p>
<b>disc_value.</b> Number indicating the amount of the discount.</p>
<p>
<b>disc_type.</b> Type of discount, either <code>%</code> or <code>$</code>.</p>
<p>
<b>date_start.</b> Optional field. The date the promotion begins, at one second after midnight.</p>
<p>
<b>date_end.</b> Optional field. The date the promotion ends, at one second after midnight. Because <b>date_start</b> and <b>date_end</b> are actually date/time pairs that specify midnight, <b>date_end</b> excludes the date specified.</p>
<p>
<b>Connection String.</b> The data source name (DSN) connection string to be used to connect to the database.</p>
<p>
An order promotion has three criteria: the customer criterion, a condition criterion, and an award criterion. If the customer <i>does not</i> match the customer criterion, the promotion is not applied. If the customer <i>does</i> match the customer criterion, then the other two criteria are applied to all the items in the order, producing two sets: the condition set (those matching the condition criterion) and the award set (those matching the award criterion).</p>
