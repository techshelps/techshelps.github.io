<h1><a name="cd_guide_replicationclient"></a>ReplicationClient</h1>
<p>
Use the <a href="cd_sdk_3.htm">ReplicationClient</a> object to have finer control over replications. You can create your own replication scheme by using the <b>ReplicationClient </b>methods and properties with <b>ReplicationItem </b>objects (see <b>ReplicationProject.EnumItems</b>). </p>
<p>
Content Deployment replications operate on entire directories. The <b>ReplicationClient</b> object lets you replicate specific files on demand. This provides more granular control over the replication process and, since it is single-file based, provides much more detailed error reporting through the <b>ReplicationClientError</b> object. </p>
<p>
You get access to a <b>ReplicationClient </b>object by calling <b>CreateObject</b>, as follows: </p>
<pre><code>Set RepClient = CreateObject("CrsApi.ReplicationClient")
</code></pre>
<p>
Once you have access to the <b>ReplicationClient </b>object, you must call the <b>Initialize </b>method, unless the object is created through a <b>ReplicationProject</b> object, in which case you need not call <b>Initialize</b>. </p>
<p>
Use the <b>Connect</b> method and the <b>Disconnect</b> method in conjunction with the <b>SendFile</b> and <b>DeleteFile</b> methods when you need to update more than one or two files. If you only need to update one or two files, use just the <b>SendFile</b> method or <b>DeleteFile</b> method without the <b>Connect</b> and <b>Disconnect</b> methods (they perform their own connections and disconnections to the destination server if the Content Deployment server isn't connected to a destination server).</p>
<p>
<b>To update a number of files</b>
<ol>
<li>
Use the <b>Connect</b> method to establish a connection to the destination server.<br><br></li>
<li>
Use the <b>SendFile</b> method to send a file to the destination server or the <b>DeleteFile</b> method to delete a file from the destination server.<br><br></li>
<li>
Use the <b>Disconnect</b> method to sever the connection to the destination server.</li>
</ol>
<p>
If your Content Deployment server is connected to the destination server and transaction processing is turned on at the destination server, file operations are not applied until you call either the <b>Disconnect</b> method<b> </b>or the <b>Commit</b> method.</p>
<p>
You can issue an <b>Abort</b> method at any time during a transaction to cancel all pending transactions. </p>
<p>
The Content Deployment component will not allow you to use both the <b>ReplicationClient </b>and <b>ReplicationServer</b> objects at the same time to run the same project. If you try to use both, Content Deployment issues the error code CRS_ERROR_PROJECT_ALREADY_RUNNING. </p>
