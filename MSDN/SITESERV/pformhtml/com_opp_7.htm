<h2><a name="com_opp_hhgk"></a>Business-to-Business Pipelines</h2>
<p>
The business-to-business OPPs are used in Commerce sites designed for the creation and transmission of purchase orders between businesses that have an established relationship. Like their business-to-consumer counterparts, these pipelines are performed at different times during the purchasing process:
<ul>
<li>
&upsilon;<a href="com_opp_8.htm"><b>Corporate Purchasing Plan</b></a><b> (CorpPurchasePlan.pct)</b>. Runs OPP components that compute the purchase order total, including all promotional discounts, taxes, shipping and handling charges. This pipeline is similar to the Plan pipeline used in business-to-consumer sites.</li>
<li>
&upsilon;<a href="com_opp_9.htm"><b>Corporate Purchasing Submit</b></a><b> (CorpPurchaseSubmit.pct)</b>. Runs OPP components that validate the purchase order requisition, transfer the purchase order to the vendor, and write the order to database storage. This pipeline is analogous to the Purchase pipeline used in business-to-consumer sites.</li>
</ul>
