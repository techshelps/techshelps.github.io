<h1><a name="pu_agentref_the_channel_agent_host"></a>The Channel Agent Scripting Host</h1>
<p>
Each <b>Channel</b> object will create an Active Scripting Host to run a specified agent.&nbsp; When doing so, it passes dispinterfaces to the host that the agent script can then access and modify in its own namespace.&nbsp; Thus, these interfaces appear as "built-in" interfaces to the agent.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
<b>Digression: Other Examples of Active Scripting Hosts</b></p>
<p>
The ActiveX Scripting Host technology is perhaps unfamiliar, at least in name, to many developers.&nbsp; To get a more concrete idea of exactly how this system works, a few common examples of ActiveX Scripting Hosts are listed below.</p>
<p>
<b>ASP</b></p>
<p>
A well known Active Scripting Host is the Active Server Pages (ASP) system that Internet Information Server (IIS) 3.0 and 4.0 support.&nbsp; In this case, the IIS server instance creates an Active Scripting Host and passes the <b>Request</b>, <b>Response</b>, <b>Server</b>, <b>Session</b>, and <b>Application</b> dispinterfaces to the host.&nbsp; The ASP script can then access these objects via these interfaces in the script without having to explicitly create them.&nbsp; The script to parse is the one identified by the client request usually with the extension ".asp"</p>
<p>
<b>Windows Scripting Host</b></p>
<p>
This host is a newcomer, but the principle is the same.&nbsp; When a user types <code>cscript.exe &lt;filename&gt;.&lt;ext&gt;</code> the executable generates an Active Scripting Host and passes the host the <b>WScript</b> dispinterface.&nbsp; Thus WSH scripts can use the built-in WScript object directly.</p>
