<h2><a name="com_compref_dwye"></a><sup></sup>AdminSite Object Overview</h2>
<p>
The <b>AdminSite</b> object provides methods for administering a site, such as specifying data sources and user accounts. The object keeps a number of properties related to the configuration in the <i>site dictionary</i>, an implementation of a <b>Dictionary</b> object called <code>MSCSSite</code>. These properties include the short and long names of the site, the secure host, the nonsecure host, and the names of other <b>Dictionary</b> objects such as lists of named connection strings and named queries.</p>
<p>
All site-related configuration properties are accessed through the site dictionary, and saved in the Site.csc file. </p>
<p>
For information about the relationship between the <b>AdminSite</b> object, the site dictionary, and the Site.csc file, see “Managing the Commerce Server Site” in <i>Architecture of a Business-to-Consumer Site</i> in the Commerce documentation..</p>
<p>
The <b>AdminSite</b> object is not used in Commerce Server sites themselves. The site configuration properties can be accessed from within Commerce Server site scripting pages by using <b>FileDocument</b> to read the properties into an instance of the site dictionary.</p>
<p>
An instance of the <b>AdminSite </b>object is usually created by WebAdmin, the Commerce Server Snap-in for the MMC, and by the Site Foundation Wizard.</p>
<p>
To create an <b>AdminSite </b>object, use the <b>Server.CreateObject </b>method, specifying <b>Commerce.AdminSite</b> as follows:</p>
<pre><code>Set AdminSite = Server.CreateObject("Commerce.AdminSite")
</code></pre>
<h5>Note</h5>
<p>
Active Server Pages (ASP) scripts that access the Microsoft® Internet Information Server (IIS) metabase require administrator privileges on the computer on which IIS is running. When you execute these scripts from a remote computer, you must connect through a secure connection, such as the Microsoft® Windows NT® Challenge/Response Authentication method. It is suggested that you create a server or directory for your administrative .asp files and set the directory security authentication method to Windows NT Challenge/Response for the server or directory. </p>
