<h2><a name="com_tools_yzqk"></a>Packaging a Site</h2>
<p>
Use the following procedure to package a site.</p>
<h5>To package a site:</h5>
<ol>
<li>
Open an MS-DOS window, change to the directory in which CommerceSitePkgr.exe is located, and run CommerceSitePkgr.exe. (Alternatively, you can double-click on the <b>CommerceSitePkgr</b> icon in the Windows NT Explorer.) <p>
By default, Setup saves CommerceSitePkgr.exe in:<br>
\Microsoft Site Server\SiteServer\Commerce\SDK\Commerce\bin\i386\
</li>
<li>
For <b>Site Directory</b>, enter the full path to the top-level directory of the site you want to package. You can click the <b>Browse</b> button to locate the directory if you aren't certain of the path. </li>
<li>
For <b>Target Directory</b>, enter the full path to the directory on your local computer into which the self-extracting executable file will be saved.<p>
After the compressed file has been saved onto your computer, you can transfer it to the remote computer using FTP, email, etc. NOTE: This directory must already exist on your computer—the program will not create it for you if it does not already exist. 
</li>
<li>
The <b>Files To Include</b> field lists additional files other than the site itself that you want to bundle with the packaged site. If you have only a single additional file, you can type its path and file name in the <b>Files To Include</b> field. At the minimum, you must include the install script that installs the site after it has been copied to the remote computer. If you have multiple files, click the <b>Multiple Files</b> button and then select the files you want to include. (To clear the list of files, click the <b>Clear Files</b> button.) Note that this field does not take wildcards. You must specify the entire path and filename, including the extension for each file. </li>
<li>
Click the drop-down arrow on the <b>Files To Include</b> field and select the install script. <p>
The name of this file now appears in the <b>Script To Execute On Install</b> field, and the <b>OK</b> button becomes available. 
</li>
<li>
The default behavior of the self-extracting executable file is to simply install transparently, presenting no user interface. If you prefer to display dialog boxes and message boxes to the user during and after the installation, click the <b>Install Options</b> button to specify the user interface options. The following steps assume that you have clicked the <b>Install Options</b> button. </li>
<li>
For <b>Title Shown On Dialog Boxes</b>, type the text string that will be displayed in the title bar of the dialog boxes that are displayed during the installation. </li>
<li>
For <b>Install Script Command Line Options</b>, type the parameters that you want to pass to your install script during the installation of the packaged site. Separate each parameter by a space. If the parameter includes a space, enclose the parameter in quotation marks. You must enter the following parameters: <ul>
<li>
&upsilon;<b>/sitename:</b> Specifies the name that will be used for naming the site's virtual directory and top-level physical directory. </li>
<li>
&upsilon;<b>/DisplayName: </b>Specifies the name of the site that is displayed on the site's pages.</li>
<li>
&upsilon;<b>/WebSiteID:</b> Specifies the number of the Web site on which the packaged site is to be installed. </li>
</ul>
<p>
For example, you might enter the following for the Volcano Coffee sample site: 
<pre><code>/sitename:vc30 /DisplayName:"Volcano Coffee" /WebSiteID:1 
</code></pre>
<p>
In addition to the above parameters, you can also specify the destination directory (the directory into which the site will eventually be installed on the remote computer). To specify this, enter the following parameter:<br>
<b>/Path:</b><br>
You must enter the full path, including the drive letter. If the path contains spaces, remember to enclose the entire path name in quotes. 
</li>
<li>
For <b>Install Prompt</b>, type the text string that will be displayed to the user at the beginning of the installation to confirm that they want to install the site. This text is displayed to the user in a dialog box with <b>Yes</b> and <b>No</b> buttons. </li>
<li>
For <b>Path To Display License</b>, enter the path to the text file that contains the site's License Agreement (if any). </li>
<li>
For <b>Post Install Command</b>, type the command that is to be used to launch a program that you want to run after the installation is finished. Type the path and filename for the executable file, plus any command-line parameters that you want to pass to the executable file. </li>
<li>
For <b>Finish Message</b>, type the text string that will be displayed to the user at the end of the installation to confirm that the site has been successfully installed. This text appears in a dialog box with an <b>OK</b> button. </li>
<li>
The <b>Hide Extraction Dialog</b> box specifies whether you want to display the animated progress indicator as the installation proceeds. Click <b>Yes</b> to hide the progress dialog box; click <b>No</b> to display it. </li>
<li>
The <b>Show Install Window</b> box controls the windows in which the installation dialog boxes are displayed. <p>
<b>Default</b> specifies the normal window settings. <b>Hidden</b> hides the window (in this case, even if you specify options for installation dialog boxes, the dialog boxes are not displayed because the window in which they would be displayed is hidden). The <b>Minimize</b> and <b>Maximize</b> options minimize or maximize the window. 
</li>
<li>
Click <b>OK</b> to close the <b>Advanced Options</b> dialog box. </li>
<li>
Click <b>OK</b> to package the site. </li>
</ol>
