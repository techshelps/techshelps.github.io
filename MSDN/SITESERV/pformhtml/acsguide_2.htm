<h1><a name="pu_guide_system_overview"></a>System Overview</h1>
<p>
The Active Channel Server system can be broken down into the following basic parts:</p>
<h3><a href="acsguide_3.htm">The COM Objects</a></h3>
<p>
Active Channel Server provides an extremely flexible set of COM/Automation compliant objects for creation and storage of channel information.&nbsp; Since they are COM compliant, <i>any</i> programming language that supports the COM can access them.&nbsp; These objects form the core of the system, and it is through these objects that the core functionality of the system is expressed.</p>
<h3><a href="acsguide_9.htm">The Refresh Cycle and the Channel Agent</a></h3>
<p>
The Channel Agents are scripts that programmatically update the data stored using the COM objects during a refresh cycle.&nbsp; They can be written in any scripting language that supports the COM and has an Active Scripting Engine available on the system.&nbsp; By default, this includes VBScript and JScript.&nbsp; The scripts are run via an Active Scripting Host built by the Active Channel Server <b>Channel </b>COM object.</p>
<h3>GUI/Web Configuration Tools</h3>
<p>
Active Channel Server provides front-end tools that users and administrators can use to configure the various aspects of the system.&nbsp; These include a snap-in for the Microsoft Management Console (MMC), a set of command-line utilities that run using the Windows Scripting Host (WSH), and ASP pages that can be accessed through the Web Administration tool.&nbsp; The MMC and Web Admin tools are designed to be fully extensible, allowing developers and users to easily make custom channel agents available for configuration through these tools.</p>
