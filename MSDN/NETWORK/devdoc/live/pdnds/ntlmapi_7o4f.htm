<p>
For OS/2-based servers, the Net functions supported by Microsoft® LAN Manager provided much of the functionality required for a network operating system; this functionality was missing from the local operating system. Windows NT, Windows 95, and Windows 98 have much of this network functionality built in. Therefore, some of the original Net functions are no longer supported. </p>
<p>
Windows NT, Windows 95, and Windows 98 support a variety of networking functions. The set of Net functions provide additional capability not covered by other networking functions. In addition, you may use these functions to monitor and administer OS/2-based LAN Manager servers. </p>
