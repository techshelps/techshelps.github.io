<h3><a name="_win32_alert_functions"></a>Alert Functions</h3>
<p>
The alert functions notify network service programs and applications of network events. An event is a particular instance of a process or state of hardware as defined by an application. The alert functions allow applications to indicate when predefined events occur. </p>
<p>
Other programs, network services, or internal network components use the <b>NetAlertRaise</b> function to raise an alert, notifying various applications or users when a particular type of event occurs. The Alert category functions, datatypes, structures, and constants are defined in the LMCONS.H, LMERR.H, and LMALERT.H header files. A source program can gain access to these definitions by defining the constants INCL_NETERRORS and INCL_NETALERT, and by including the header file LM.H.</p>
<p>
The LMALERT.H include file defines the following classes of events for which alerts are sent out:
<ul>
<li>
A network event requiring administrative assistance</li>
<li>
An entry is added to an error log file</li>
<li>
A user or application receives a broadcast message</li>
<li>
A print job completes</li>
<li>
A user accesses or uses certain applications or resources</li>
</ul>
<p>
You can define other classes of alerts for network applications as needed. For example, an application on a server routinely writes large amounts of data to a disk drive, running the risk of filling the disk. In this case, you might want the event ``no free disk space'' to trigger an alert that notifies the application to pause or terminate the process that is filling the disk.</p>
<p>
An application or network service program, also known as a client, registers a request to be notified of an event (or class of events) by calling the <b>NetAlertStart</b> function. You can register the client for several types of events by calling the <b>NetAlertStart</b> function multiple times. Each registration adds an entry to an alert table. An application or network service program receives alert messages through the use of a mailslot (registered as \mailslot\name). If a program requires detailed information about an event, register it as a mailslot. </p>
<p>
You can register an application or network service program for one type of event, or for several types, by calling the <b>NetAlertStart</b> function multiple times. For a registered application or network service program, use the <b>NetAlertStop</b> function to remove that application or network service program entry from the alert table for the particular class of event. </p>
<p>
The alert functions are:</p>
<p>
<a href="ntlmapi_8c6d.htm"><b>NetAlertRaise</b></a> <br>
<a href="ntlmapi_3ku0.htm"><b>NetAlertRaiseEx</b></a> </p>
<p>
The <a href="ntlmapi_8c6d.htm"><b>NetAlertRaise</b></a> function is used to indicate that an event has occurred.</p>
<p>
The fixed-length header contains the standard alert structure, <a href="ntlmapi_9x82.htm"><b>STD_ALERT</b></a>.</p>
<p>
Additional information is included in the following structures:</p>
<p>
<a href="ntlmapi_1m9e.htm"><b>ADMIN_OTHER_INFO</b></a><b><br>
<a href="ntlmapi_8t4i.htm">ERRLOG_OTHER_INFO</a><br>
<a href="ntlmapi_9o1e.htm">PRINT_OTHER_INFO</a><br>
<a href="ntlmapi_1jhu.htm">USER_OTHER_INFO</a></b></p>
