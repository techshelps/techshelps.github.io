<p>
When an RPC-based function fails to connect to the appropriate interface, the client-side stub may attempt to initiate a function request to activate the selected server. For most of the Win32 networking functions specified in this document, and any API where the functionality and data formats are changed only for 32-bit usage, the conversion is straightforward. For components that offer new functionality the caller of the function should generally be aware of the destination type. When the new function offers a superset of the functionality of the LAN Manager 2.x station the same function is used for both destinations, but the new function members must have either a reserved value of an associated field to inform the conversion layer the field may be ignored if going LAN Manager 2.x systems. This is required so that a function caller is not misled as to the action performed when the function was called.</p>
