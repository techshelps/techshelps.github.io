<h3><a name="_win32_connection_states"></a>Connection States</h3>
<p>
During the process of connecting to a remote server, the Remote Access Connection Manager and the RAS server on the remote computer perform several steps to establish the connection. Each of these steps is identified by a connection state. The <a href="remacces_9raq.htm"><b>RASCONNSTATE</b></a> enumeration is a set of values that correspond to these connection states. The connection states can be divided into the following three groups:</p>
<table cellspacing=4 cols=2>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=27%>Running states</td>
<td width=73%>The running states are the parts of the connection operation that RAS handles automatically, such as connecting to the necessary devices, authenticating the user, and waiting for a callback from the remote server. Unless an error occurs, the RAS client need take no action other than to pass the notification on to the user.</td>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=27%>Paused states</td>
<td width=73%>The <a href="remacces_6ldf.htm">paused states</a> occur when the remote server pauses the connection operation to get additional input from the user. During a paused state, the user can type a <a href="remacces_0yyb.htm">callback</a> number, a different user name and password if the user authentication fails, or a new password if the old one has expired.</td>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=27%>Terminal states</td>
<td width=73%>The terminal states occur when the connection has been successfully established, the connection operation has failed, or the connection has been broken by a <b>RasHangUp</b> call.</td>
</tr>
</table><br>
<p>
There are several mechanisms that a RAS client can use to determine the current state of a connection operation. When a RAS client executes the <a href="remacces_7pyk.htm"><b>RasDial</b></a> function asynchronously, the Remote Access Connection Manager sends progress notifications to the client's <a href="remacces_43g3.htm">notification handler</a> whenever the connection state changes. In addition, the client can use the <a href="remacces_9tmb.htm"><b>RasGetConnectStatus</b></a> function to get the current state of any RAS connection operation.</p>
