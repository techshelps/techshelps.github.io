<h3><a name="_win32_use_functions"></a>Use Functions</h3>
<p>
The <a href="networks_84z6.htm"><b>WNetAddConnection2</b></a>, <a href="networks_6c6q.htm"><b>WNetCancelConnection2</b></a> <a href="networks_03ad.htm"><b>WNetEnumResource</b></a>, <a href="networks_84a6.htm"><b>WNetGetConnection</b></a> functions should be used instead of the NetUse functions, which are obsolete.</p>
<p>
The use functions examine or control connections (uses) between workstations and servers. They are:</p>
<p>
<a href="ntlmapi_1cdg.htm"><b>NetUseAdd</b></a><br>
<a href="ntlmapi_1lws.htm"><b>NetUseDel</b></a><br>
<a href="ntlmapi_9dil.htm"><b>NetUseEnum</b></a><br>
<a href="ntlmapi_3crz.htm"><b>NetUseGetInfo</b></a></p>
<p>
Connections are distinguished from sessions: a session is established the first time a workstation makes a connection to a shared resource on the server; all further connections between the workstation and the server are part of this same session until the session ends. Two types of connections can be made: device-name connections (which can only be explicit) and universal-naming convention (UNC) connections (which can be explicit or implicit).</p>
<p>
Connections are made on a per-user basis. A connection made by a user is deleted when that user logs off. For this reason the NetUse functions are local only, since a connection set up by a remote user would not be accessible to any other users, even the user that was interactively logged onto that computer.</p>
<p>
The <a href="ntlmapi_1cdg.htm"><b>NetUseAdd</b></a> function creates a device-name connection or an explicit UNC connection. Implicit UNC connections are made by the function responsible for the connection.</p>
<p>
The <b>NetUseAdd</b> function establishes an explicit connection between the local computer and a resource shared on a server by redirecting a local device name to the share name of a remote server resource (\\&lt;servername&gt;\&lt;sharename&gt;). Once a device-name connection is made, users or applications can use the remote resource by specifying the local device name. To establish an implicit UNC connection, an application passes the share name of a resource to any function that accepts UNC paths. The function accepts the UNC name and makes a connection to the specified share name. All further requests on this connection require the full share name.</p>
<p>
The <a href="ntlmapi_1lws.htm"><b>NetUseDel</b></a> function ends a connection to a shared resource. The <a href="ntlmapi_9dil.htm"><b>NetUseEnum</b></a> function enumerates all current connections between the local computer and resources on remote servers. The <a href="ntlmapi_3crz.htm"><b>NetUseGetInfo</b></a> function returns information about a connection to a shared resource.</p>
<p>
The use functions are available at three information levels:</p>
<p>
<a href="ntlmapi_559u.htm"><b>USE_INFO_0</b></a> <b><br>
<a href="ntlmapi_4qnm.htm">USE_INFO_1</a></b> </p>
<p>
Information level 2 is not available if the function is accessed with a LAN Manager 2.x system. In that case, ERROR_NOT_SUPPORTED will be returned.</p>
