<h2><a name="_win32_command_control_block_addresses"></a>Command Control Block Addresses</h2>
<p>
All network addresses in the command control block, including Ethernet addresses, must be in noncanonical form. In this form, the bits of each byte appear in the reverse order from their representation on the network. </p>
<p>
A network adapter is provided with a permanent, universally administered address. Additionally, an application can provide a temporary replacement for this address and a group address for the adapter. </p>
<p>
Many commands require a station identifier. You can specify the direct station, a service access point (SAP), or a link station. The direct station is referred to by three station identifiers, which differ only in how they receive frames. The three station identifiers are as follows:</p>

<tr valign=top>
<td width=12%>0</td>
<td width=88%>Receives all frames not directed to other defined stations.</td>

<tr valign=top>
