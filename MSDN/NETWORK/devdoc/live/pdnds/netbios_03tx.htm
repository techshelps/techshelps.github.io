<h2><a name="_win32_netbios_name_table"></a>NetBIOS Name Table</h2>
<p>
NetBIOS <i>names</i> are used as the basis for communication between applications. NetBIOS maintains a <i>name table</i> for each LANA for each process that contains the names by which the process is known on the network. These names are used when forming connections between processes. </p>
<p>
Names are provided to NetBIOS by the application through the <b>ncb_name</b> member of the <a href="netbios_7y7m.htm"><b>NCB</b></a> structure. A name can be a <i>unique name</i> or a <i>group name</i>. NetBIOS checks the network to verify that a unique name is not already in use by another adapter. A group name can be used by several adapters. </p>
<p>
NetBIOS names can be up to 16 characters long. This is large enough to accommodate a text version of the media access control (MAC) address, plus a few other characters. Using the MAC address in this way results in a name that is guaranteed unique on any network. The name NAME_NUMBER_1 is always present and has the value 1. </p>
