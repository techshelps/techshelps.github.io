<h3><a name="_win32_datagram_support"></a>Datagram Support</h3>
<p>
The following are the datagram support commands: 
<ul>
<li>
NCBDGRECV (receive datagram)</li>
<li>
NCBDGRECVBC (receive broadcast datagram)</li>
<li>
NCBDGSEND (send datagram)</li>
<li>
NCBDGSENDBC (send broadcast datagram)</li>
</ul>
<p>
Datagram support provides unreliable connectionless data transfer. The message is a single data frame whose size is limited to a MAC frame minus any headers. The protocol driver ensures that the message is transmitted to the network medium. The receiver does not generate a response to the sender to indicate that the datagram was received. Therefore, unreliable connectionless data transfer requires fewer system resources than reliable connection-oriented data transfer. </p>
<p>
The NCBDGRECV and NCBDGSEND commands transfer a datagram to a specified NetBIOS name. If the specified name is a unique name, the datagram is received by the single process that registered the name. If the specified name is a group name, the datagram is received by all processes that registered the name. This process is shown in the following illustration. </p>

<p>
The NCBDGSENDBC command broadcasts a datagram to all computers on the network. The datagram is received by all processes that have issued the NCBDGRECVBC command, as shown in the following illustration. </p>
