<p>
When a RAS client application starts a connection operation, the <a href="remacces_7pyk.htm"><b>RasDial</b></a> call receives an <b>HRASCONN</b> connection handle to identify the connection. If the returned handle is not NULL, the client must eventually call the <a href="remacces_7q5s.htm"><b>RasHangUp</b></a> function to end the connection. If an error occurs during the connection operation, the client must call <b>RasHangUp</b> even though the connection was never established.</p>
<p>
The application that calls <b>RasHangUp</b> should not exit immediately, because the Remote Access Connection Manager needs time to properly terminate the connection. Instead, the application should wait until the <a href="remacces_9tmb.htm"><b>RasGetConnectStatus</b></a> function returns ERROR_INVALID_HANDLE, indicating that the connection has been deleted.</p>
<p>
A RAS client application might need to end a connection even though it does not have the handle returned by <b>RasDial</b>. For example, the application that called <b>RasDial</b> might have exited once the connection was successfully established. In this case, the disconnecting application can use the <a href="remacces_4ooj.htm"><b>RasEnumConnections</b></a> function to get all the current connections. For each connection, <b>RasEnumConnections</b> returns a <a href="remacces_7t9u.htm"><b>RASCONN</b></a> structure containing the <b>HRASCONN</b> connection handle and the phonebook entry name or phone number specified when the connection operation was started. This information can be used to display a list of connections from which the user can select the connection to end.</p>
