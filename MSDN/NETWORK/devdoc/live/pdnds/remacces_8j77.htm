<h2><a name="_win32_ras_phone_books"></a>RAS Phone Books</h2>
<p>
Phone books provide a standard way to collect and specify the information that the Remote Access Connection Manager needs to establish a remote connection. Phone books associate entry names with information such as phone numbers, COM ports, and modem settings. Each phone-book entry contains the information needed to establish a RAS connection. </p>
<p>
<b>Windows NT:</b> Phone books are stored in phone-book files, which are text files that contain the entry names and associated information. RAS creates a phone-book file called RASPHONE.PBK. The user can use the main <b>Dial-Up Networking</b> dialog box to create personal phone-book files. The Win32 API does not currently provide support for creating a phone-book file. Some RAS functions, such as the <b>RasDial</b> function, have a parameter that specifies a phone-book file. If the caller does not specify a phone-book file, the function uses the default phone-book file, which is the one selected by the user in the <b>User Preferences</b> property sheet of the <b>Dial-Up Networking</b> dialog box.</p>
<p>
Windows NT version 4.0 provides the <a href="remacces_082v.htm"><b>RasPhonebookDlg</b></a> and <a href="remacces_8iuf.htm"><b>RasEntryDlg</b></a> functions that display the built-in RAS user interface that enable users to work with phone books and phone-book entries. </p>
<p>
<b>Windows 95: </b>Dial-up networking stores phonebook entries in the registry rather than in a phonebook file. Windows 95 does not support personal phone-book files. Windows 95 does not support the functions that display the built-in RAS dialog boxes.</p>
