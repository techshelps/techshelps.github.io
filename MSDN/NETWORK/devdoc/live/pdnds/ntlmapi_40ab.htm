<h1><a name="_win32_about_net_functions"></a>About Net Functions</h1>
<p>
The Net functions supplement the networking functions built into Win32 platforms; they are not the base Win32 networking functions. The Win32 API also provides a network-independent set of network functions (<a href="networks_2kmr.htm">WNet functions</a>) that allow network functions to work across different network vendors' products. If a Win32 function or WNet function exists that could be used by your application, you should convert your code to use the WNet equivalent. There are at least two reasons to make the change: 
<ol>
<li>
The WNet functions are network independent, while the Net functions work only on Microsoft networks.</li>
<li>
Some of the Win32 functions documented in this SDK may not be supported in future releases Microsoft operating systems if they have been superseded by Win32 functions or WNet functions. Microsoft does not plan to remove specific functions unless equivalent or better functionality is available.</li>
</ol>
<p>
In this documentation, equivalent functions are listed that could be used in place of a Net function. These are the functions your application should use if at all possible.</p>
