<h1><a name="_win32_about_windows_networking"></a>About Windows Networking</h1>
<p>
Applications can use the Windows networking functions to add and cancel network connections and to retrieve information about the current configuration of the network. </p>
<p>
The following figure shows the structure of a typical network.</p>
<p>
<img src="images/csnet_01.gif" border=0></p>
<p>
In the preceding figure, the hierarchy for Microsoft Windows NT Server resources is given in detail as Network provider #1. Network resources from other providers have different hierarchical systems. An application does not need information about the hierarchy before it begins to work with a network. It can proceed from the network root (that is, the topmost container resource) and retrieve information about the network's resources as the information is required. </p>
<p>
Network resources that contain other resources are called <i>containers</i>. Container resources are in boxes in the preceding figure.</p>
<p>
Resources that do not contain other resources are <i>objects</i>. Sharepoint #1 and Sharepoint #2 in the figure are objects. A <i>sharepoint</i> is an object that is accessible across the network, such as a printer or a shared directory. </p>
