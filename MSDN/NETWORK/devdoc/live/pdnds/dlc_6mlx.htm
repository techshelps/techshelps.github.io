<h2><a name="_win32_dlc_differences_between_windows_nt_and_windows_95"></a>DLC Differences Between Windows NT and Windows 95</h2>
<p>
There are significant differences between the Win32 DLC implementation on Windows NT and the Win32 DLC implementation Windows 95 and Windows 98. These differences are as follows: 
<ul>
<li>
Windows NT provides extensions for security, multiple processors, and Unicode character strings. These are not supported by Windows 95 or Windows 98. </li>
<li>
Windows 95 and Windows 98 support the application identifier member of the command control block in the <b>uchReserved2</b> member. On Windows NT, this member and the application key member have been superseded by an optional security descriptor in the <a href="dlc_5awi.htm"><b>LLC_EXTENDED_ADAPTER_PARMS</b></a> structure. </li>
<li>
Windows 95 and Windows 98 support polling the <b>uchDlcStatus</b> member of the command control block to check for command completion. This method is unreliable on Windows NT, so an application that uses it successfully on Windows 95 or Windows 98 may fail on Windows NT. </li>
<li>
Windows 95 and Windows 98 allow an application to issue an LLC_DIR_STATUS command before it issues an LLC_DIR_OPEN_ADAPTER command. Windows NT does not support this behavior. </li>
<li>
Windows 95 and Windows 98 do not support multiple logical adapters. </li>
<li>
Windows 95 and Windows 98 do not have direct station support that is global to all applications. </li>
</ul>
