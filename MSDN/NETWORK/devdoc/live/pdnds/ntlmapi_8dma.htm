<h1><a name="_win32_at_enum_str"></a>AT_ENUM</h1>
<p>
The <b>AT_ENUM</b> structure enumerates and returns information about an entire queue of jobs that have already been submitted.</p>
<pre><code>typedef struct _AT_ENUM {
    DWORD   JobId;
    DWORD   JobTime;
    DWORD   DaysOfMonth;
    UCHAR   DaysOfWeek;
    UCHAR   Flags;
    LPWSTR  Command;
} AT_ENUM, *PAT_ENUM, *LPAT_ENUM;
 </code></pre>
<h4>Members</h4>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>JobID</b></dt>
<dd>
Job identifier of an already submitted job.</dd>
<dt>
<b>JobTime</b></dt>
<dd>
Time of day at which a job is scheduled to run. Time is a local time at a computer on which the Schedule service is running. Time is measured from midnight and is expressed in milliseconds.</dd>
<dt>
<b>DaysOfMonth</b></dt>
<dd>
Bitmask for the days of the month on which a job is scheduled to run. The bitmask is NULL if a job was scheduled to run only once at the first occurrence of <b>JobTime</b><i>.</i> For each bit that is set in the bitmask a job will run at <b>JobTime</b> on a corresponding day of the month. Bit 0 corresponds to first day of the month, and so on.</dd>
<dt>
<b>DaysOfWeek</b></dt>
<dd>
Bitmask for the days of the week on which this job is scheduled to run. The bitmask is NULL if a job was scheduled to run only once at the first occurrence of <b>JobTime</b><i>.</i> For each bit that is set in the bitmask a job will run at <b>JobTime</b> on a corresponding day of the week. Bit 0 corresponds to Monday (first day of the week), and so on.</dd>
<dt>
<b>Flags</b></dt>
<dd>
Bitmask describing job properties. For job submission (<a href="ntlmapi_77fo.htm"><b>NetScheduleJobAdd</b></a>), possible values are:
<dl>
<dt>
JOB_RUN_PERIODICALLY</dt>
<dd>
If this flag bit is set, the job runs on every day for which corresponding bits in <b>DaysOfMonth</b> or <b>DaysOfWeek</b> are set. If this flag bit is clear, the job runs only once for each bit that was set in <b>DaysOfMonth</b> or <b>DaysOfWeek</b> at the time of job submission.</dd>
<dt>
JOB_ADD_CURRENT_DATE</dt>
<dd>
When this flag bit is set, the job will also execute at the first occurrence of <b>JobTime</b> at the computer to which the job is submitted. In other words, setting this flag bit is equivalent to setting the corresponding day bit in the <b>DaysOfMonth</b> bitmask.</dd>
</dl>

<p>
For job information retrieval (<a href="ntlmapi_4lgt.htm"><b>NetScheduleJobEnum</b></a> and <a href="ntlmapi_7ze7.htm"><b>NetScheduleJobGetInfo</b></a>), possible values are:

<dl>
<dt>
JOB_RUN_PERIODICALLY</dt>
<dd>
This flag bit is equal to the original value of this flag bit when a job was submitted.</dd>
<dt>
JOB_EXEC_ERROR</dt>
<dd>
This flag bit is set whenever the Schedule service failed to execute successfully this job the last time this job was supposed to run.</dd>
<dt>
JOB_RUNS_TODAY</dt>
<dd>
This flag bit is set if <b>JobId</b> is larger than the current time of day at the computer at which this job is queued.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dt>
<b>Command</b></dt>
<dd>
Pointer to a Unicode string that contains the name of the command, batch program, or binary file to execute.
</dd>
</dl>
