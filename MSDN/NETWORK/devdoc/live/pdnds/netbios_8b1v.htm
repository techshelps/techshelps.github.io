<h2><a name="_win32_netbios_commands"></a>NetBIOS Commands</h2>
<p>
A NetBIOS application issues commands to an underlying transport driver using the <a href="netbios_4n1v.htm"><b>Netbios</b></a> function. You provide information in the <a href="netbios_7y7m.htm"><b>NCB</b></a> structure. The appropriate transport driver receives the information, performs the command, and reports status by filling in selected <b>NCB</b> members. </p>
<p>
When a command is issued synchronously, <b>Netbios</b> does not return until the protocol driver completes the command. Both the <b>ncb_retcode</b> and <b>ncb_cmd_cplt</b> members contain the return value. </p>
<p>
When a command is issued asynchronously, <a href="netbios_4n1v.htm"><b>Netbios</b></a> does not return until the protocol driver checks the command syntax, cehcks whether the session is valid, and checks whether there are sufficient available resources. Both the <b>ncb_retcode</b> and <b>ncb_cmd_cplt</b> members contain the return value. The return value is an error code if the command was not successfully queued. A return value of NRC_PENDING indicates that the protocol driver has successfully queued the command. When the protocol driver completes the command, it places the final return value in both the <b>ncb_retcode</b> and <b>ncb_cmd_cplt</b> members. If the <b>ncb_post</b> member specifies a post routine, the protocol driver calls the post routine. </p>
<p>
Post routines are called in the context of the calling process. The post routine in a Win32-based application typically posts a message to an appropriate window and then exits. The thread that receives the message uses it as an indication that the asynchronous command has been completed. The system creates an event and a worker thread for each command that uses a post routine. As a result, it is faster to use the <b>ncb_event</b> member instead of a post routine for asynchronous commands. </p>
