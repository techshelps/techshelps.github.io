<h2><a name="_com_self_registration_for_controls"></a>Self Registration for Controls</h2>
<p>
ActiveX controls must support self-registration by implementing the <b>DllRegisterServer</b> and <b>DllUnregisterServer</b> functions. ActiveX controls must register all of the standard registry entries for embeddable objects and automation servers. </p>
<p>
ActiveX Controls must use the component categories API to register themselves as a control and register the component categories that they require a host to support and any categories that the control implements, see the <a href="ctrlgde_5twz.htm">Component Categories</a> section of this appendix. In addition an ActiveX Control may wish to register the <b>control</b> keyword in order to allow older control containers such as VB4 to host them.</p>
<p>
ActiveX Controls should also register the <b>ToolBoxBitmap32</b> registry key, although this is not mandatory.</p>
<p>
The <b>Insertable</b> component category should only be registered if the control is suitable for use as a compound document object. It is important to note that a compound document object must support certain interfaces beyond the minimum <b>IUnknown</b> required for an ActiveX Control. Although an ActiveX Control may qualify as a compound document object, the control's documentation should clearly state what behavior to expect under these circumstances.</p>
