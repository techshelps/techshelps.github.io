The current release of <i>OLE Programmer's Guide</i> examines the architecture and capabilities of OLE as a whole, as well as of each of its core facilities: COM, structured storage, and uniform data transfer. A separate chapter is devoted to compound documents, the technology that inspired the original development of OLE and laid the groundwork for its evolution into a systemwide, object-based service architecture. A subsequent release of the <i>OLE Programmer's Guide</i> will include detailed instructions for developing both OLE client and server applications for compound documents that work under both Microsoft® Windows NT® and Microsoft® Windows® 95. For descriptions of specific interfaces, helper functions, data structures, and enumerations, refer to the <i>OLE Programmer's Reference. </i>For information on Automation and developing OLE controls, see the <i>Automation Programmer's Guide and Reference</i>.</p>
