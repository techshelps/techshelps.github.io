<h2><a name="_com_advantages"></a>Advantages</h2>
<p>
The advantages of implementing your application as an in-process server are speed and combining some the advantages of an object handler and a local server. In-process servers are faster than local servers for several reasons. First, because they are smaller and run in the process space of the container application, they load more quickly. Second, they are optimized to perform certain tasks. Third, communication between container and server does not rely on remote procedure calls.</p>
