<h4><a name="_com_setting_access_permissions_for_an_application"></a>Setting Access Permissions for an Application</h4>
<p>
With Dcomcnfg.exe, you can control the list of users who are granted or denied access to the methods of a particular server by setting access permissions. You can add users or groups to the list, specifying whether access permission is being granted or denied. You can also remove users from the list.</p>
<p>
When setting access permissions, you must ensure that SYSTEM is included in the list of users that are granted access. If you have granted access permissions to Everyone, SYSTEM is included implicitly. </p>
<p>
The process of setting access permissions for an application is similar to setting launch permissions. The steps are as follows.</p>
<h5><img src="../../images/wedge.gif" border=0>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To set access permissions for an application:</h5>
<ol>
<li>
With Dcomcnfg.exe running, select the application from the <b>Applications</b> page and choose the <b>Properties</b> button (or double-click the selected application).</li>
<li>
On the <b>Security</b> property page, select the <b>Use custom access permissions</b> option button and choose the <b>Edit</b> button in the same area.</li>
<li>
To remove users or groups, select the user or group you want to remove and choose the <b>Remove</b> button. The selected user or group will no longer appear in the list box. When you have finished removing user and groups, choose <b>OK</b>.</li>
<li>
If you want to add a user or a group, choose the <b>Add</b> button. </li>
<li>
If you know the fully qualified user name you want to add, type it in the Add Names text box.<p>
If you do not know the user name, you can <a href="comext_8cv9.htm"><b>browse the user database</b></a> to find it. When you have located the user name, select the user or group from the <b>Names</b> list box and choose the <b>Add</b> button. 
</li>
<li>
From the <b>Type of Access</b> list box, select the access type (either <b>Allow Access</b> or <b>Deny Access</b>). To add other users that will have the selected type of access, repeat step 5. When you have finished adding users for the selected access type, choose the <b>OK</b> button. </li>
<li>
To add users that will have a different type of access, repeat steps 5 and 6. Otherwise, choose <b>OK</b> to apply the changes.</li>
</ol>
