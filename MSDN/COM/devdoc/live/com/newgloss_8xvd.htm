<dt>
<a name="_oleglos_activation"></a><b>Activation</b></dt>
<dd>
The process of loading an object in memory, which puts it into its running state. <i>See also </i>Binding.</dd>
<dt>
<a name="_oleglos_active_state"></a><b>Active state</b></dt>
<dd>
A COM object that is in running state and has a visible user interface. <i>See also</i> Loaded state, Object state, Passive state, and Running state.</dd>
<dt>
<a name="_oleglos_absolute_moniker"></a><b>Absolute moniker</b></dt>
<dd>
A moniker that specifies the absolute location of an object. An absolute moniker is analogous to a full path.<i> See also </i>Moniker<i>.</i></dd>
<dt>
<a name="_oleglos_advisory_holder"></a><b>Advisory holder</b></dt>
<dd>
A COM object that caches, manages, and sends notifications of changes to container applications' advisory sinks. <i>See also</i> Advisory sink.</dd>
<dt>
<a name="_oleglos_advisory_sink"></a><b>Advisory sink</b></dt>
<dd>
A COM object that can receive notifications of changes in an embedded object or linked object because it implements the <b>IAdviseSink </b>or <b>IAdviseSink2</b> interface. Containers that need to be notified of changes in objects implement an advisory sink. Notifications originate in the server, which uses an advisory holder object to cache and manage notifications to containers. <i>See also </i>Advisory holder, Container application, and Object handler.</dd>
<dt>
<a name="_oleglos_aggregate_object"></a><b>Aggregate object</b></dt>
<dd>
A COM object that is made up of one or more other COM objects. One object in the aggregate is designated the controlling object, which controls which interfaces in the aggregate are exposed and which are private. This controlling object has a special implementation of <b>IUnknown</b> called the controlling <b>IUnknown</b>. All objects in the aggregate must pass calls to <b>IUnknown</b> methods through the controlling <b>IUnknown</b>. <i>See also</i> Aggregation.</dd>
<dt>
<a name="_oleglos_aggregation"></a><b>Aggregation</b></dt>
<dd>
A composition technique for implementing COM objects. It allows you to build a new object by reusing one or more existing objects' interface implementations. The aggregate object chooses which interfaces to expose to clients, and the interfaces are exposed as if they were implemented by the aggregate object. Clients of the aggregate object communicate only with the aggregate object. <i>See also</i> Aggregate object. <i>Contrast with</i> Containment.</dd>
<dt>
<a name="_oleglos_ambient_property"></a><b>Ambient property</b></dt>
<dd>
A run-time property that is managed and exposed by the container. Typically, an ambient property represents a characteristic of a form, such as background color, that needs to be communicated to a control so that the control can assume the look and feel of its surrounding environment. <i>See also</i> Run-time property.</dd>
<dt>
<a name="_oleglos_anti_moniker"></a><b>Anti-moniker</b></dt>
<dd>
The inverse of a file, item, or pointer moniker. An anti-moniker is added to the end of a file, item, or pointer moniker to nullify it. Anti-monikers are used in the construction of relative monikers. <i>See also </i>Relative Moniker.</dd>
<dt>
<a name="_oleglos_artificial_reference_counting"></a><b>Artificial reference counting</b></dt>
<dd>
A technique used to safeguard an object before calling a function or method that could prematurely destroy it. A program calls <b>IUnknown::AddRef</b> to increment the object's reference count before making the call that could free the object. After the function returns, the program calls <b>IUnknown::Release</b> to decrement the count.</dd>
<dt>
<a name="_oleglos_asynchronous_binding"></a><b>Asynchronous binding</b></dt>
<dd>
A type of binding in which it is necessary for the process to occur asynchronously to avoid performance degradation for the end user. Typically, asynchronous binding is used in distributed environments such as the World Wide Web. OLE supports asynchronous moniker classes and callback mechanisms that allow the process of locating and initializing an object in a distributed environment to occur while other operations are being carried out. <i>See also </i>Asynchronous moniker, and Binding.</dd>
<dt>
<a name="_oleglos_asynchronous_call"></a><b>Asynchronous call</b></dt>
<dd>
A call to a function that is executed separately so that the caller can continue processing instructions without waiting for the function to return. <i>Contrast with </i>Synchronous call.</dd>
<dt>
<a name="_oleglos_asynchronous_moniker"></a><b>Asynchronous moniker</b></dt>
<dd>
A moniker that supports asynchronous binding. For example, instances of the system-supplied URL moniker class are asynchronous monikers. <i>See also </i>Asynchronous binding, Moniker, and URL moniker.</dd>
<dt>
<a name="_oleglos_automation"></a><b>Automation</b></dt>
<dd>
A way to manipulate an application's objects from outside the application. Automation is typically used to create applications that expose objects to programming tools and macro languages, create and manipulate one application's objects from another applications, or to create tools for accessing and manipulating objects.</dd>
</dl>

<dl>
<dt>
<a name="_oleglos_bind_context"></a><b>Bind context</b></dt>
<dd>
A COM object that implements the <b>IBindCtx</b> interface. Bind contexts are used in moniker operations to hold references to the objects activated when a moniker is bound. The bind context contains parameters that apply to all operations during the binding of a generic composite moniker and provides the moniker implementation with access to information about its environment. <i>See also </i>Binding, Generic composite moniker, and Moniker.</dd>
<dt>
<a name="_oleglos_binding"></a><b>Binding</b></dt>
<dd>
Associating a name with its referent. Specifically, locating the object named by a moniker, putting it into its running state if it isn't already, and returning an interface pointer to it. Objects can be bound at run time (also called <i>late binding</i> or <i>dynamic binding</i>) or at compile time (also called <i>static binding</i>). <i>See also</i> Moniker and Running state.</dd>

<dt>
<a name="_oleglos_class"></a><b>Class</b></dt>
<dd>
The definition of an object in code. In C++, the class of an object is defined as a data type, but this is not the case in other languages. Because OLE can be coded in any language, class is used to refer to the general object definition. <i>See also </i>Class factory.</dd>
<dt>
<a name="_oleglos_class_factory"></a><b>Class factory</b></dt>

<dt>
<a name="_oleglos_class_identifier_clsid_"></a><b>Class identifier (CLSID)</b></dt>
<dd>
A globally unique identifier (GUID) associated with an OLE class object. If a class object will be used to create more than one instance of an object, the associated server application should register its CLSID in the system registry so that clients can locate and load the executable code associated with the object(s). Every OLE server or container that allows linking to its embedded objects must register a CLSID for each supported object definition. <i>See also</i> Class and Class factory.</dd>
<dt>
<a name="_oleglos_class_object"></a><b>Class object</b></dt>
<dd>
In object-oriented programming, an object whose state is shared by all the objects in a class and whose behavior acts on that classwide state data.

<dt>
<a name="_oleglos_containment"></a><b>Containment</b></dt>
<dd>
A composition technique for implementing COM objects. It allows one object to reuse some or all of the interface implementations of one or more other objects. The outer object acts as a client to the other objects, delegating implementation when it wishes to use the services of one of the contained objects. <i>Contrast with</i> Aggregation.</dd>
<dt>
<a name="_oleglos_control"></a><b>Control</b></dt>
<dd>
An embeddable, reusable COM object that supports, at a minimum, the <b>IOleControl</b> interface. Controls are typically associated with the user interface.

<dd>
A pointer held to—and possibly, a reference count incremented on—a running object. OLE defines two types of locks that can be held on an object: <i>strong</i> and <i>weak</i>. To implement a strong lock, a server must maintain both a pointer and a reference count, so that the object will remain "locked" in memory at least until the server calls <b>Release</b>. To implement a weak lock, the server maintains only a pointer to the object, so that the object can be destroyed by another process.</dd>
