<h2><a name="_com_irunningobjecttable_revoke"></a>IRunningObjectTable::Revoke</h2>
<p>
Removes from the Running Object Table (ROT) an entry that was previously registered by a call to <a href="if_r2z_33n6.htm"><b>IRunningObjectTable::Register</b></a>.</p>
<pre><code><b>HRESULT Revoke(
  DWORD</b><i> dwRegister  </i>//Value identifying registration to be revoked
<b>);</b>
 </code></pre>
<h4>Parameter</h4>
<dl>
<dt>
<i>dwRegister</i></dt>
<dd>
[in] Value identifying the ROT entry to revoke. This value was previously returned by <a href="if_r2z_33n6.htm"><b>IRunningObjectTable::Register</b></a>.
</dd>
</dl>
<h4>Return Values</h4>
<p>
This method supports the standard return value E_INVALIDARG, as well as the following: 
<dl>
<dt>
S_OK</dt>
<dd>
The object's registration was successfully revoked.
</dd>
</dl>
<h4>Remarks</h4>
<p>
This method undoes the effect of a call to <a href="if_r2z_33n6.htm"><b>IRunningObjectTable::Register</b></a>, removing both the moniker and the pointer to the object identified by that moniker.</p>
<h5>Notes to Callers</h5>
<p>
If you're a moniker provider (that is, you hand out monikers identifying your objects to make them accessible to others), you must call the <b>IRunningObjectTable::Revoke</b> method to revoke the registration of your objects when they stop running. You must have previously called <a href="if_r2z_33n6.htm"><b>IRunningObjectTable::Register</b></a> and stored the identifier returned by that method; you use that identifier when calling <b>IRunningObjectTable::Revoke</b>. </p>
<p>
The most common type of moniker provider is a compound-document link source. This includes server applications that support linking to their documents (or portions of a document) and container applications that support linking to embeddings within their documents. Server applications that do not support linking can also use the ROT to cooperate with container applications that support linking to embeddings.</p>
<p>
If you're writing a container application, you must revoke a document's registration when the document is closed. You must also revoke a document's registration before re-registering it when it is renamed. </p>
<p>
If you're writing a server application, you must revoke an object's registration when the object is closed. You must also revoke an object's registration before re-registering it when its container document is renamed (see <b>IOleObject::SetMoniker</b>). </p>
