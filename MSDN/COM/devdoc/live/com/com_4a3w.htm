<h2><a name="_com_choosing_the_threading_model"></a>Choosing the Threading Model</h2>
<p>
Choosing the threading model for an object depends on the object's function. An object that does extensive I/O might support free-threading to provide maximum response to clients by allowing interface calls during I/O latency. On the other hand, an object that interacts with the user might support apartment threading to synchronize incoming COM calls with its window operations. </p>
<p>
It is easier to support apartment threading in single-threaded apartments because COM provides synchronization. Supporting free-threading is more difficult because the object must implement synchronization, but response to clients may be better because synchronization can be implemented for smaller sections of code. In single-threaded apartments, COM provides synchronization on a per-call basis.</p>
