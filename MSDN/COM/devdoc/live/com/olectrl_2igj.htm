<h1><a name="_com_properties_and_methods"></a>Properties and Methods</h1>
<p>
Like any OLE object, a control provides much of its functionality through a set of incoming interfaces with properties and methods.</p>
<p>
A control exposes properties and methods through OLE automation so that containers can access them under the control of a container-supplied programming language.</p>
<p>
To support access to properties through a user interface, a control provides property pages, support for OLEIVERB_PROPERTIES, per property browsing, and data binding through property change notfications.
<ul>
<li>
Through property pages a control can display its properties, independent of its container, if necessary.</li>
<li>
By supporting OLEIVERB_PROPERTIES, the Properties item is displayed on the container's menu. Then, the end user can select the Properties item to view the control's property pages and modify the properties.</li>
<li>
Per property browsing supports a container that can display the control's properties as part of a larger property sheet that may include properties from several controls in the container.</li>
<li>
Through property change notification, a control can notify a client that its properties have change, allowing the client to take any necessary actions as a result.</li>
</ul>
<p>
See the <a href="proppage_7u2b.htm">Property Pages and Property Sheets</a> chapter for more information on these features.</p>
