<h4><a name="_com_types_of_cloaking"></a>Types of Cloaking</h4>
<p>
There are two types of cloaking: <i>static </i>cloaking and <i>dynamic </i>cloaking:
<ul>
<li>
With static cloaking (EOAC_STATIC_CLOAKING), the server sees the thread token from the first call from a client to the server. For the first call, if the proxy identity was previously set during a call to <b>CoSetProxyBlanket</b>, that proxy identity is used. However, if the proxy identity has not been previously set, the thread token is used. If no thread token is present, the process token is used. For all future calls, the identity set on the first call is used. </li>
<li>
When dynamic cloaking (EOAC_DYNAMIC_CLOAKING) is set, on each call the current thread token (if there is a thread token) is used to determine the client's identity. If there is no thread token, the process token is used. This type of cloaking is extremely expensive.</li>
</ul>
