<p>
Registers security and sets the default security values for the process. This function is called exactly once per process, either explicitly or implicitly. It can be called by the client or the server, or both. For legacy applications and other applications that do not explicitly call <b>CoInitializeSecurity</b>, COM calls this function implicitly with values from the registry. If you set process-wide security using the registry and then call <b>CoInitializeSecurity</b>, the AppID registry values will be ignored, and the <b>CoInitializeSecurity</b> values will be used.</p>

<h4>Parameters</h4>
<dl>
<dt>
<i>pVoid</i></dt>
<dd>
[in] Defines the access permissions. This parameter is used when the process calling <b>CoInitializeSecurity</b> acts as a server. Its value can be NULL or a pointer to one of three types: either an AppID, an <a href="if_a2e_912k.htm"><b>IAccessControl</b></a> object, or a Win32 security descriptor. The type of data that <i>pVoid</i> points to is indicated by a flag set in the <i>dwCapabilities</i> parameter. If EOAC_APPID is specified, <i>pVoid</i> must be a pointer to a GUID that specifies the AppID of the process. In this case, all other parameters of the call are ignored, and registry values are used for security checks. If EOAC_ACCESS_CONTROL is specified, <i>pVoid</i> must be a pointer to an <b>IAccessControl</b> object, which determines who can call the process. If the capability flags (dw<i>Capabilities</i>) do not include either EOAC_APPID or EOAC_ACCESS_CONTROL, <i>pVoid</i> must be a pointer to a Win32 security descriptor. If <i>pVoid</i> is NULL, no ACL checking will be done. If it is not NULL, COM will check ACLs on calls and <i>dwAuthnLevel</i> cannot be RPC_C_AUTHN_LEVEL_NONE. See the Remarks section for more information.</dd>
<dt>
<i>cAuthSvc</i></dt>
<dd>
[in] Count of entries in <i>asAuthSvc</i>. Zero means register no authentication services. If you specify zero, you cannot receive secure calls. A value of -1 tells COM to choose which authentication services to register, and if this is the case, the <i>asAuthSvc</i> parameter must be zero. This value is used by COM when the process acts as a server. </dd>
<dt>
<i>asAuthSvc</i></dt>
<dd>
[in] Array of authentication service information used by COM to choose the authentication service for the process when it acts as a server. These values are control which security providers are used for incoming calls. Outgoing calls may use any security provider installed on the machine. The entries for NTLMSSP, Kerberos, and Snego must have the pPrincipalName member set to NULL. The SSL entry should have the pPrincipalName member set to a CAPI (Crypto API) handle that specifies a private certificate to be used as the application's server certificate. </dd>
<dt>
<i>pReserved1</i></dt>
<dd>
[in] Reserved for future use; this value must be NULL.</dd>
<dt>
<i>dwAuthnLevel</i></dt>
<dd>
[in] The default authentication level for the process. COM will fail calls that arrive with a lower authentication level. By default, all proxies will use at least this authentication level. This value should contain one of the flags from the <a href="enums_3lo8.htm"><b>RPC_C_AUTHN_LEVEL_xxx</b></a> enumeration. By default, all calls to <b>IUnknown</b> are made at this level.</dd>
<dt>
<i>dwImpLevel</i></dt>
<dd>
[in] The default impersonation level for proxies. The value of this parameter applies when the process is the client. It should be a value from the <a href="enums_2jco.htm"><b>RPC_C_IMP_LEVEL_xxx</b></a> enumeration. Outgoing calls from the client always use the impersonation level as specified (it is not negotiated). Incoming calls to the client can be at any impersonation level. By default, all <b>IUnknown</b> calls are made with this impersonation level so even security-aware applications should set this level carefully. To determine which impersonation levels each authentication service supports, see the description of the authentication services in <a href="comext_08j7.htm"><b>COM and Security Packages</b></a>. For more information about impersonation levels, see <a href="comext_6d9q.htm"><b>Impersonation</b></a>. </dd>
<dt>
<i>pAuthList</i></dt>
<dd>
[in] This value must be NULL on NT 4. On NT 5, this parameter is a pointer to a <a href="structs_48c4.htm"><b>SOLE_AUTHENTICATION_LIST</b></a>, which is an array of <a href="structs_7sof.htm"><b>SOLE_AUTHENTICATION_INFO</b></a> structures. This list indicates the default authentication information to use for each authentication service. It applies only to clients. When DCOM negotiates the default authentication service for a proxy, it picks the default authentication information from this list. If the pAuthInfo member of the SOLE_AUTHENTICATION_INFO structure representing the chosen authentication service is NULL, DCOM will use the process identity to represent the client. If both <i>pAuthList</i> and one of the cloaking flags are set, <b>CoInitializeSecurity</b> will return an error. 
<p>
The NTLMSSP and Kerberos entries in the list should each contain a pointer to a SEC_WINNT_AUTH_IDENTITY_W or to a SEC_WINNT_AUTH_IDENTITY_EXW structure containing the user name and password. 

<p>
For the SSL entry, the <i>pAuthInfo</i> member of the <b>SOLE_AUTHENTICATION_INFO</b> structure should be a CAPI handle to a private certificate. 

<p>
For Snego, the <i>pAuthInfo</i> member should be NULL or point to a SEC_WINNT_AUTH_IDENTITY_EXW structure. If non-NULL, the structure's PackageList member must point to a string containing a comma-separated list of authentication service names, and the PackageListLength member must give the number of bytes in the PackageList string. If <i>pAuthInfo</i> is NULL, Snego will pick a list of authentication services to try based on those available on the client machine. 

<p>
For more information, see the Remarks section. 
</dd>
<dt>
<i>dwCapabilities</i> </dt>
<dd>
[in] Additional capabilities of the client or server. If a flag other than one of the following <a href="enums_92k3.htm">EOLE_AUTHENTICATION_CAPABILITIES</a>flags is specified, <b>CoInitializeSecurity</b> will return an error: EOAC_APPID, EOAC_ACCESS_CONTROL, EOAC_STATIC_CLOAKING, EOAC_DYNAMIC_CLOAKING, EOAC_AUTO_IMPERSONATION, EOAC_SECURE_REFS, EOAC_REQUIRE_FULLSIC, EOAC_MAKE_FULLSIC, EOAC_ANY_AUTHORITY, or EOAC_MUTUAL_AUTH. Some of these flags cannot be set simultaneously. For more information on these flags, see the <a href="enums_92k3.htm"><b>EOLE_AUTHENTICATION_CAPABILITIES</b></a> enumeration and the Remarks section. </dd>
<dt>
<i>pReserved3</i></dt>
<dd>
[in] Reserved for future use; it must be set to NULL.
</dd>
</dl>
<h4>Return Values</h4>
<p>
This function supports the standard return value E_INVALIDARG, as well as the following:
<dl>
<dt>
S_OK </dt>
<dd>
Indicates success.</dd>
<dt>
RPC_E_TOO_LATE</dt>
<dd>
CoInitializeSecurity has already been called.</dd>
<dt>
RPC_E_NO_GOOD_SECURITY_PACKAGES</dt>
<dd>
<i>asAuthSvc</i> was not NULL and none of the authentication services in the list could be registered. Check the results saved in <i>asAuthSvc</i> for authentication service specific error codes.</dd>
<dt>
E_OUT_OF_MEMORY</dt>
<dd>
</dd>
</dl>
<h4>Remarks</h4>
<p>
The <a href="#_com_coinitializesecurity"><b>CoInitializeSecurity</b></a> function initializes the security layer and sets the specified values as the security default. If the process does not call <b>CoInitializeSecurity</b>, COM calls it automatically the first time an interface is marshaled or unmarshaled, registering the system default security. No default security packages are registered until then.</p>
<p>
When the EOAC_APPID flag is set in <i>dwCapabilities</i>, <i>pVoid</i> points to an AppID and all other parameters to <b>CoInitializeSecurity</b> are ignored (and must be zero). <b>CoInitializeSecurity</b> looks for the authentication level under the AppID key in the registry and uses it to determine the default security. If <i>pVoid </i>is NULL, <b>CoInitializeSecurity</b> will look up the application .exe name in the registry and use the AppID stored there. This gives the same security settings as if the process had not called <b>CoInitializeSecurity</b>. Before NT 4 SP 4, <b>CoInitializeSecurity</b> returned an error if it did not find the specified AppID in the registry. For more information on how the AppID key is used to set security, see <a href="comext_3jw9.htm"><b>Setting Process-wide Security Through the Registry</b></a> and the <a href="enums_92k3.htm"><b>EOLE_AUTHENTICATION_CAPABILITIES</b></a> enumeration.</p>
<p>
If the EOAC_ACCESS_CONTROL flag is set, <i>pVoid</i> is a pointer to an <b>IAccessControl</b> object, which determines who can call the process. DCOM will AddRef the <b>IAccessControl</b> and will Release it when <b>CoUninitialize</b> is called. The state of the <b>IAccessControl</b> object should not be changed. If EOAC_ACCESS_CONTROL is specified, the <i>dwAuthnLevel </i>cannot be none<i>.</i></p>
<p>
The <b>CoInitializeSecurity</b> function returns an error if both the EOAC_APPID and EOAC_ACCESS_CONTROL flags are set.</p>
<p>
If neither the EOAC_APPID nor the EOAC_ACCESS_CONTROL flag is specified in <i>dwCapabilities</i>, <i>pVoid </i>must be a pointer to a Win32 SECURITY_DESCRIPTOR. A security descriptor contains two ACLs: the discretionary ACL (DACL) indicates who is (and who is not) allowed to call the process; the system ACL (SACL) contains audit information. DCOM looks for the COM_RIGHTS_EXECUTE flag in the DACL to find out which callers are permitted to connect to the process's objects. Until DCOM supports auditing, the SACL must be NULL. A DACL with no ACEs allows no access. A NULL DACL will allow calls from anyone. For more information on ACLs and ACEs, see <object id=alink_1 type="application/x-oleobject"
	classid="clsid:adb880a6-d8ff-11cf-9377-00aa003b7a11">
<PARAM name="Command" value="ALink,MENU">
<PARAM name="DefaultTopic" value="../../notopic_0pk4.htm">
<PARAM name="Item1" value="">
<PARAM name="Item2" value="_win32_access_control_model">
</object><a href=JavaScript:alink_1.Click()>Access Control Model</a>. </p>
<p>
If <i>pVoid</i> is a security descriptor, the owner and group of the SECURITY_DESCRIPTOR must be set — applications should call <b>AccessCheck</b> (not <b>IsValidSecurityDescriptor</b>) to ensure that their security descriptor is correctly formed prior to calling <b>CoInitializeSecurity</b>. DCOM will copy the specified security descriptor. If the application passes a NULL security descriptor, COM will construct one that allows calls from anyone. </p>
<p>
When a CAPI handle is specified for the SSL entry in <i>pAuthList</i>, the CAPI handle must not be freed until <b>CoUninitialize</b> is called. If the list is specified but there is no entry for SSL, DCOM will try to find a default identity the first time DCOM negotiates SSL as the authentication service. If that succeeds, DCOM will save that identity as the default. Otherwise, the client will be anonymous for SSL. </p>
