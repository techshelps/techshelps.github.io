<h1><a name="_com_notifications"></a>Notifications</h1>
<p>
Notifications are callbacks generated by an object when it detects a change in its name, state, data, or presentation. Containers and other clients require notifications to respond appropriately to these changes. A container registers to receive notifications by setting up an advisory connection to an object of interest. Other interested clients can do the same. The container also creates an advisory sink to receive the notifications. Using the connection established by the container, an object experiencing a change notifies the advisory sink. Upon receiving a notification, the container takes whatever action has been defined for the type of change that has occurred.</p>
