<h2><a name="_com_event_freezing"></a>Event Freezing</h2>
<p>
A container can notify a control that it is not ready to respond to events by calling <b>IOleControl::FreezeEvents(TRUE)</b>. It can un-freeze the events by calling <b>IOleControl::FreezeEvents(FALSE)</b>. When a container freezes events, it is freezing event processing, not event receiving; that is, a container can still receive events while events are frozen. If a container receives an event notification while its events are frozen, the container should ignore the event. No other action is appropriate.</p>
<p>
A control should take note of a container's call to <b>IOleControl::FreezeEvents(TRUE)</b> if it is important to the control that an event is not missed. While a container's event processing is frozen, a control should implement one of the following techniques:
<ol>
<li>
Fire the events in the full knowledge that the container will take no action.</li>
<li>
Discard all events that the control would have fired.</li>
<li>
Queue up all pending events and fire them after the container has called <b>IOleControl::FreezeEvents(FALSE)</b>.</li>
<li>
Queue up only relevant or important events and fire them after the container has called <b>IOleControl::FreezeEvents(FALSE)</b>.</li>
</ol>
<p>
Each technique is acceptable and appropriate in different circumstances. The control developer is responsible for determining and implementing the appropriate technique for the control's functionality.</p>
