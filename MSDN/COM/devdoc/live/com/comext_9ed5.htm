<h2><a name="_com_iunknown_security"></a>IUnknown Security</h2>
<p>
<b>IUnknown</b> security is different from that of other interfaces. Because <b>IUnknown</b> is implemented locally by the proxy manager, it is not remoted to the server. Therefore, when a client makes calls to <b>IUnknown</b>, COM intercepts them and handles them locally. When COM needs to communicate with the server to release resources or obtain new interfaces, it uses a private interface called <b>IRemUnknown</b> that is implemented internally for each apartment. This situation leads to the following security issues: 
<ul>
<li>
There can only be one instance of the <b>IUnknown</b> proxy. You cannot call <a href="api1_5e9l.htm"><b>CoCopyProxy</b></a> on <b>IUnknown</b> because the <b>IUnknown</b> proxy is used to identify the object.</li>
<li>
All interface proxies delegate <b>IUnknown</b> calls to the <b>IUnknown</b> proxy. Therefore, all calls to <b>AddRef</b>, <b>Release</b>, and <b>QueryInterface</b> use the same security settings. For instance, if I set the authentication level on an interface called IMyInterface to encrypt, and call <b>QueryInterface</b> for IMyInterface, the authentication level used will be what is set for <b>IUnknown</b>, which may not be encrypt.</li>
<li>
COM caches the pointer returned by most calls to <b>IUnknown</b>. Therefore, some <b>IUnknown</b> calls will be sent over the wire and others will not. So, setting <b>IUnknown</b> security may not have the desired results if DCOM is using a cached pointer instead of making a remote call to get the pointer.</li>
</ul>
