<p>
Activation security (also called <i>launch security</i>) controls who can launch a server. Activation security is automatically applied by the Service Control Manager (SCM) of a particular machine. Upon receipt of a request from a client to activate an object (as described in <a href="comext_4ws3.htm"><b>Instance Creation Helper Functions</b></a>), the SCM of the machine checks the request against activation-security information stored within its registry. (Activation security is also checked for same-machine activations.)</p>
<p>
You might decide that you do not want remote clients to be able to activate any objects on a given machine. If you are the machine administrator, you can set the <a href="reg_0w8d.htm"><b>EnableDCOM</b></a> named value in the registry to <b>N</b> either directly or using Dcomcnfg.exe. This setting has no effect on local COM. COM still looks for an ACL in the <a href="reg_8j3i.htm"><b>LaunchPermission</b></a> named value, if there is one, and if not, in the <a href="reg_010u.htm"><b>DefaultLaunchPermission</b></a> value. (The <b>DefaultLaunchPermission</b> named value is only accessible to administrators.) Even if you turn off remote COM using the <b>EnableDCOM</b> named value, if another user has physical access to your machine, they could launch a server on your machine unless you set launch permissions (with an ACL) not to allow it.</p>
<p>
The Windows 95 and Macintosh platforms do not support launch security. For more details on the Windows 95 platform, see <a href="comext_133p.htm"><b>COM Security and Windows 95</b></a>.</p>
