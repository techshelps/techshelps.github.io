<p>
Another security capability new for COM on Windows NT 5.0 is called cloaking. Cloaking determines what identity the client projects toward the server during impersonation. When cloaking is set, the intermediate server masks his own identity and presents the client's identity to the server that he calls. Basically, the client identity that is seen by the server is the identity associated with the proxy. The proxy's identity is determined by several factors, one of which is the type of cloaking that is set (if any). </p>
