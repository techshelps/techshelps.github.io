<h1><a name="_com_com_objects_and_interfaces"></a>COM Objects and Interfaces</h1>
<p>
COM is a technology that allows objects to interact across process and machine boundaries as easily as objects within a single process interact. COM enables this by specifying that the only way to manipulate the data associated with an object is through what is called an <i>interface on the object.</i> When this term is used, it refers to an implementation in code of a COM binary-compliant interface that is associated with an object. </p>
<p>
Talking about an object that <i>implements an interface</i> means that the object uses code that implements each method of the interface and provides COM binary-compliant pointers to those functions to the COM library. COM then makes those functions available to any client who asks for a pointer to the interface, whether the client is inside or outside of the process that implements those functions.</p>
