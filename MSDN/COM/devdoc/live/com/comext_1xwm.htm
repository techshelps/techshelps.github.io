<p>
There are several reasons why you might decide to turn off the security that COM provides. When developing applications, it might be helpful to turn security off initially to allow you to focus on other functionality within your application. Then, you can add security features to your design when you are ready. To facilitate debugging, you might want to turn security off and then add security features one at a time. Finally, some applications do not need security and might run faster if no security checks are done. </p>
