<h3><a name="_com_interactive_user"></a>Interactive User</h3>
<p>
The interactive user is the user that is currently logged on to the machine where the application is running. If the identity is set to be the interactive user, all clients use the same instance of the server if the server registers its class factory as multi-use. If no user is logged on, the application will not run. If the server has a graphical user interface (GUI) that the client needs to see, you should use interactive user for the application's identity. However, choosing this identity carries some security risks because the server runs under the identity of the logged on user without the logged on user's knowledge or consent.</p>
