<h1><a name="_com_user_profiles"></a>User Profiles</h1>
<p>
A class container is associated with a user account, computer account, group account, OU, or a domain. Every user, computer, group, OU, and domain object has an associated property <i>ClassStorePath</i>, which contains the class store path for the object.</p>
<p>
Administration of the class store occurs through the Application Managers extension to the Group Policy Editor. Class stores are created automatically as needed.</p>
<p>
User accounts inherit the profile of its hierarchy (one or more OUs and the domain). This method of inheritance creates a list of class stores that is associated with the user account. A class store search for a user logged on under this account results in an ordered lookup in all the class stores included in the profile.</p>
<p>
<b>IClassAccess</b> searches the ordered list of class containers based on the user account requesting the information. There may also be class implementations in a class store that have access control lists (ACLs) to enforce user specific views and access restrictions.</p>
