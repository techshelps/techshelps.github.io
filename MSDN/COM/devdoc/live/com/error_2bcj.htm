<h1><a name="_com_handling_unknown_errors"></a>Handling Unknown Errors</h1>
<p>
Keep in mind that it is legal to return a status code only from the implementation of an interface method sanctioned as legally returnable. Failure to observe this rule invites the possibility of conflict between returned error-code values and those sanctioned by the application. In particular, pay attention to this potential problem when propagating error codes from functions that are called internally.</p>
<p>
Applications that call interfaces should treat any unknown returned error code (as opposed to a success code) as synonymous with E_UNEXPECTED. This practice of handling unknown error codes is required by clients of the COM-defined interfaces and functions. Because typical programming practice is to handle a few specific error codes in detail and treat the rest generically, this requirement of handling unexpected or unknown error codes is easily met.</p>
<p>
The following code sample shows the recommended way of handling unknown errors:</p>
<pre><code>HRESULT hrErr; 
hrErr = xxMethod(); 
 
switch (GetScode(hrErr))  { 
    case NOERROR: 
      //success 
      break; 
 
    case x1: 
      . 
      . 
      break; 
 
    case x2: 
      . 
      . 
      break; 
 
    case E_UNEXPECTED: 
    default: 
      //general failure 
      break; 
} 
 </code></pre>
<p>
The following error check is often used with those routines that do not return anything special (other than S_OK or some unexpected error):</p>
<pre><code>if (xxMethod() == NOERROR) 
    //success 
else 
    //general failure; 
 </code></pre>
<p>
</p>
