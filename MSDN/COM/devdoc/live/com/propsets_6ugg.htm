<h2><a name="_com_property_id_0x80000000"></a>Property ID 0x80000000</h2>
<p>
Property ID 0x80000000 (Locale Indicator) is reserved as an indication of the locale for which the property set is written. The default locale for a property set is the system's default locale (LOCALE_SYSTEM_DEFAULT). See the Win32 SDK for more information on LOCALE_SYSTEM_DEFAULT. The default is used in the event that the locale indicator does not exist in the property set.</p>
<p>
Applications can choose to support the locale or just get the default behavior. It is recommended that applications allow users to specify a working locale. Such applications should write the user-specified locale identifier to the property. Applications that use the user's default locale (LOCALE_USER_DEFAULT) should write the user's default locale identifier to the property. See the Win32 SDK for more information on LOCALE_USER_DEFAULT.</p>
<p>
<b>Note</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;If the <b>IPropertySetStorage</b> interface is used to create a property set, the user's default locale is automatically written as the Locale Indicator.</p>
<p>
Applications should also handle the case of a foreign object, which is one where the locale is not the application's locale, the user's locale, or the system's locale.</p>
<p>
The locale indicator property is of type VT_U14, and therefore consists of a DWORD containing VT_U14, followed by a DWORD containing the Locale Identifier (LCID), as defined in the Win32 SDK.</p>
