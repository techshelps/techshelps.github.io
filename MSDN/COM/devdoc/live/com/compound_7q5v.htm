<p>
Link-tracking functionality is primarily implemented in the form of two system services.
<dl>
<dt>
<b>Tracking Service</b></dt>
<dd>
The tracking service runs on all machines and manages the link-tracking activities for that machine. These activities include searching for link sources and processing link-source moves. When a link source is moved, the service passes the new revised-LSID to the Tracking (Server) Service which runs on the domain controller (DC), and which is described below.
<p>
The tracking service exposes its functionality through the track file COM object, which implements the <b>ITrackFile</b> interface. Link clients may be created using the <b>ITrackFile::CreateFromPath</b> method, and link sources may be found using the <b>ITrackFile::Resolve</b> method. When the state of a track file object is updated by a create or resolve, it must be persisted using the <b>IPersistStream</b> or <b>IPersistMemory</b> interface.
</dd>
<dt>
<b>Tracking (Server) Service</b></dt>
<dd>
The server portion of the tracking service runs on each domain controller in a domain. The service accepts notifications of object and volume moves from the tracking service on a given machine and allows workstations to query a link source's revised LSID given its birth-LSID.</dd>
