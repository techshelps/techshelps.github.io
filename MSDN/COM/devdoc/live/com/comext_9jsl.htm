<h3><a name="_com_remote_connections_and_activation_in_windows_95"></a>Remote Connections and Activation in Windows 95</h3>
<p>
By default DCOM for Windows 95 does not allow remote machines to connect to running objects. By default, the <b>EnableRemoteConnect</b> named-value is set to "N". To enable remote connections, change this value to "Y". The OLE/COM Object Viewer has a user interface that you can use to do this in the <b>File.System Configuration...</b> dialog box. Changing this value requires a reboot.</p>
<p>
If <b>EnableRemoteConnect</b> is not set to "Y" then all incoming calls will be rejected. (The caller will, typically, get an RPC_S_SERVER_UNAVAILABLE return code.) Remote calls from the machine will work (assuming the <a href="reg_0w8d.htm"><b>EnableDCOM</b></a> registry named-value is set to "Y").</p>
<p>
All processes on Windows 95 run with the same security settings—those belonging to the currently logged on user. Because it would, therefore, not be possible to securely launch a process from another machine, DCOM on Windows 95 does not support remote activation and will never launch a process. Remote clients can still make connections to COM servers running under Windows 95, however, as long as the process is already running, <a href="api1_6kz8.htm"><b>CoRegisterClassObject</b></a> has been called, and the <b>EnableRemoteConnect</b> registry key has been set to "Y". Also, remote connects are allowed on file moniker binds.</p>
<p>
The <a href="reg_010u.htm"><b>DefaultLaunchPermission</b></a> and <a href="reg_8j3i.htm"><b>LaunchPermission</b></a> registry values have no effect on Windows 95.</p>
