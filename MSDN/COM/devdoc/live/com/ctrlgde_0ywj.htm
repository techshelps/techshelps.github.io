<p>
Starting with Microsoft® Windows® 95 and Microsoft Windows NT® 3.51, OLE provides support for multi-threaded applications, allowing applications to make OLE calls from multiple threads. This multi-threaded support is called the apartment model, it is important that all OLE components using multiple threads follow this model. The apartment model requires that interface pointers are marshaled (using <b>CoMarshallInterface</b>, and <b>CoUnmarshalInterface</b>) when passed between threads. For more information about apartment model threading, refer to the Win32 SDK documentation, and the OLEAPT sample (in Win32® SDK).</p>
