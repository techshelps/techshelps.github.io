<h2><a name="_com_class_factory_options"></a>Class Factory Options</h2>
<p>
An ActiveX Control, by virtue of being a COM object, must have associated server code that supports control creation through <b>IClassFactory</b> as a minimum.</p>
<p>
It is optional, not required, that this class object also supports <b>IClassFactory2</b> for licensing management. Only those vendors that are concerned about licensing need to support COM's licensing mechanism. In other words, because <b>IClassFactory2</b> is the only way to achieve COM-level licensing, this interface is required on the class object for those controls that wish to be licensed.</p>
