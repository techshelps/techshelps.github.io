<pre><code>OLE Standard Utility Library <br> <br> <br>The OLESTD sample creates a library of utility functions which you may find <br>helpful to use as a model for writing your own code. <br> <br>Most of this code was once part of the OLE2UI sample library that used to <br>be included in the OLE samples. Since OLEDLG.DLL was added to the set of <br>system-supported OLE libraries, much of the old OLE2UI code has become <br>obsolete. This library contains most of the remaining functionality from <br>that DLL. <br> <br>THIS LIBRARY IS NOT AN OFFICIAL PART OF THE OLE SPECIFICATION. It is  <br>intended only to demonstrate techniques and methods; it is not intended to  <br>be used as a professional development library. Microsoft cannot guarantee  <br>that all of this code is completely correct or fully operational. <br> <br>You may feel free to incorporate some of this code in your applications but <br>please be aware that it has undergone limited testing and may not be  <br>entirely free of bugs. </code></pre>
