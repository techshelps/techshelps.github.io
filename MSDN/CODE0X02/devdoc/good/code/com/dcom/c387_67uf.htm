<pre><code>DCOM samples in the Win32 SDK. <br> <br>OLEIMP   -- The OLEIMP sample demonstrates a method for emulating auto  <br>            impersonation of clients. <br> <br>SIMPLE   -- The SIMPLE sample demonstrates the minimum requirements to use  <br>            a COM object, whether it is on the same machine or on a different  <br>            machine.  This sample consists of a client and a server portion. <br> <br>SECURE   -- The SECURE sample consists of a client portion and a server  <br>            portion.  Its purpose is to demonstrate client-side and server- <br>            side security in a Distributed COM application. <br> <br>COMPERF  -- The COMPERF sample demonstrates the performance of DCOM in  <br>            several different programming scenarios. <br> <br>DCOMPERM -- The DCOMPERM sample provides source code and several wrapper  <br>            functions to simplify the process of manipulating the access  <br>            and launch permissions for a COM server. Additionally, this  <br>            sample provides code which demonstrates how to set and retrieve  <br>            the RunAs password for a COM server. <br>            (sample located in \mstools\samples\win32\winnt\security\dcomperm) <br></code></pre>
