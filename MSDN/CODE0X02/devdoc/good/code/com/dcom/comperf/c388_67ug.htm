<pre><code>COM Performance Sample <br> <br>PURPOSE: <br>This is the reference performance sample for COM/DCOM run on local <br>and remote machines. This program is both a client and a server. <br>It launches as a client by default, registering its executable as a <br>server with COM and creating other instances of itself on a remote and <br>local machine to be servers. A single command-line argument is allowed <br>for a remote server name. Performance numbers in calls/sec are output <br>in tabular form. Tests COM and IDispatch method calls with two security <br>levels: default/min and full. Use DCOMCNFG to set default security to <br>Authn Lvl to NONE for best comparison. Parameter sizes are varied to see <br>effect on security levels(~4/50/4k bytes). Uses psperf.dll MIDL generated <br>proxy/stub implementation. Put psperf.dll in same dir as this exe on <br>all machines. Run exe on each machine to automatically register class code <br>and proxy/stub dll. You can then run on either machine and pass a remote <br>machine name (DNS or IP address) as single cmd-line parameter.  <br> <br>Instructions: <br>Install on one or more machines as described above. Run on command- <br>line as "comperf". <br>A single command-line argument is allowed for a remote server name. <br> E.g. "comperf MyComputer" or "comperf 123.44.44.234" using IP address. <br>This sample may be compiled as UNICODE or ANSI <br> <br>Usage: COMPERF [machine name | IP address | /? | -?] <br>Where: <br>/?Displays help screen <br>machine nameName of remote machine <br>IP addressIP address of remote machine </code></pre>
