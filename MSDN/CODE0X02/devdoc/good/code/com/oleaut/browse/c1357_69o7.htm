<pre><code>OLE Automation Controller and Server that Browses a Type Library <br> <br> <br>SUMMARY <br>======= <br> <br>The BROWSE sample controls the automation objects of the BROWSEH (Browse  <br>Helper) inproc server to browse a type library. BROWSE is a developer- <br>oriented type library browser.  <br> <br>In addition to displaying type library information, this sample shows how  <br>to control an automation object by accessing its properties and methods. <br>BROWSE provides generic helper functions (CreateObject &amp; Invoke) to control <br>any automation server. For more information on how to use these functions, <br>see the comments in INVHELP.CPP. <br> <br>BROWSEH exposes a number of automation objects that correspond to  <br>components of a type library. This allows an automation controller like  <br>BROWSE to access the properties and methods of these objects to browse the  <br>type library instead of directly using ITypeLib and ITypeInfo. So BROWSEH  <br>is a type library browse helper. BROWSEH does not support vtable binding. <br>Controllers must use IDispatch to control this server.  <br> <br>MORE INFORMATION <br>================ <br> <br>The following information describes the BROWSE sample. <br> <br>To Compile BROWSE and BROWSEH <br>----------------------------- <br> <br>To compile an ANSI debug version of the sample for Windows NT and Windows 95, <br>use the following command: <br> <br>   nmake <br> <br>To compile a Unicode debug version of the sample for Windows NT only, use the <br>following command: <br> <br>   nmake dev=win32 HOST=NT <br> <br>To compile a 16-bit debug version of the sample and if your development <br>environment is Win 3.x, use the following command. If your development <br>environment is Win95 or NT, change the HOST appropriately. <br> <br>   nmake dev=win16 HOST=DOS <br> <br>To clean up between builds which use different options, use one of the <br>following commands: <br> <br>   nmake clean <br>   nmake dev=win16 clean <br> <br>See the makefile header comments for other make options. <br> <br>If the build tools cannot find SDKUTIL.LIB, use the SAMPLES\COM\COMMON sample <br>to build SDKUTIL.LIB. <br> <br>Visual C++ 2.x and above can use makefile as an external makefile  <br>after making the following replacement in the makefile: <br> <br>   !include &lt;$(MSTOOLS)\samples\com\include\olesampl.mak&gt; <br> <br>with <br> <br>   !include &lt;win32.mak&gt; <br> <br> <br>To Run BROWSE <br>------------- <br> <br> - Change browseh.reg to provide the full path of BROWSEH.DLL, BROWSEH.TLB <br>   and MYDISP.TLB.. <br> <br> - Register browseh.reg in the registration database by double-clicking it. <br> <br> - Run BROWSE.EXE and use the menu to select a type library to browse. <br> <br> <br>BROWSE Files <br>------------ <br> <br>INVHELP.CPP and INVHELP.H contain two helper functions that are used to  <br>create an automation object (using CreateObject) and to invoke a method  <br>or property of that object (using Invoke). These functions are general  <br>enough to be used by any Automation controller. <br> <br>BROWSE.CPP uses the helper functions in invhelp.cpp to access the  <br>properties and methods of the automation objects of BROWSEH.  <br> <br>MAKEFILE is the makefile for the project. <br> <br> <br>To run BROWSEH <br>-------------- <br> <br> - Change BROWSEH.REG to provide the full path of BROWSEH.DLL and BROWSEH.TLB. <br> <br> - Register BROWSEH.REG in the registration database by double-clicking it. <br> <br> - Run the Automation controller BROWSE that uses BROWSEH to browse a type <br>   library OR Load and run the VB 4.0 VB.VBP project file which uses BROWSEH <br>   to output a C/C++ header file from the information in a type library. The <br>   header file can be used to create a C/C++ vtbl-binding client for the server <br>   to which the type library belongs, if the server supports vtbl-binding. After <br>   running the VB script, select the type library to be used as the input and <br>   specify the name of the header file to be output. <br> <br>BROWSEH Files <br>------------- <br> <br>MYDISP.ODL contains the description of a base class that implements  <br>IDispatch. All automation objects in this server are derived from this  <br>class. This is the implementation of IDispatch in the base class to be  <br>inherited in the derived classes. <br> <br>BROWSEH.ODL contains the description of the objects that BROWSEH exposes. <br> <br>TLB.H is the header file generated by mktyplib.exe <br> <br>MAKEFILE is the makefile for project. <br> <br>MAIN.CPP contains code to create an inproc server. <br> <br>Other files implement the BROWSEH automation server. For example, <br>COCLASS.CPP demonstrates how to use ITypeInfo and ITypeLib to browse a  <br>coclass in a type library. <br> <br>VB.VBP and VB.FRM are VB 4.0 files that uses BROWSEH to browse a type library <br>and to create a C/C++ header file from the browsed information. </code></pre>
