<pre><code>OLE Automation Sample <br> <br> <br>The DispDemo sample is an OLE Automation controller. DispDemo drives the  <br>two polygon servers which are also provided as samples. <br> <br>The interesting part of DispDemo is in the remote polygon class. The remote  <br>polygon class was constructed so that the IDispatch members could be  <br>accessed conveniently from C++. The remote polygon class does this by  <br>transforming the C++ calls into IDispatch calls. The code that calls these  <br>routines has no idea that it is going through IDispatch. <br> </code></pre>
