<pre><code>OLE Automation Sample <br> <br> <br>SUMMARY <br>======= <br> <br>The SPoly2 sample draws polygons. The only way to make SPoly2 draw a polygon  <br>is to use its programmability interface. <br> <br>One OLE automation object is exposed by Spoly2: spoly.application. <br>The object spoly2.application is associated with SPoly's main application  <br>window. It controls drawing polygons and clearing the display. <br> <br>MORE INFORMATION <br>================ <br> <br>SPoly2 implements IDispatch for spoly.application by using INTERFACEDATA, <br>DispGetIDsOfNames, and DispInvoke. <br> <br>Methods defined on spoly2.application <br>------------------------------------- <br> <br>Name                        Description <br> <br>Draw                        Draw the polygon. <br>Reset                       Delete all points from the polygon. <br>AddPoint(X, Y)              Add a point with coordinates (x,y) to the  <br>                            polygon. <br>EnumPoints as VT_ENUM       Return a collection of the polygon's points. <br>GetXOrigin as short         Get the X origin of the polygon. <br>SetXOrigin(x as short)      Set the X origin of the polygon. <br>GetYOrigin as short         Get the Y origin of the polygon. <br>SetYOrigin(y as short)      Set the Y origin of the polygon. <br>GetWidth as short           Get the line width of the polygon. <br>SetWidth(width as short)    Set the line width of the polygon. <br> <br>Shortcomings of this sample <br>--------------------------- <br> <br>Many items in this sample should be properties. Instead, they are  <br>implemented as methods. Anything which behaves like an attribute of the  <br>object should be a property. <br> <br>This is not a good example of how to implement a collection. </code></pre>
