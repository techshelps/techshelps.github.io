<pre><code>=========================================================== <br>           INSIDE OLE BY KRAIG BROCKSCHMIDT <br>                    COMPANION DISC <br>       COPYRIGHT (C) 1995 BY KRAIG BROCKSCHMIDT <br>=========================================================== <br> <br>This companion CD contains the sample source code and <br>related support files for the examples presented in Inside <br>OLE by Kraig Brockschmidt. We recommend that you store this <br>disc in a safe place after you install the files. <br> <br> <br> <br> <br>     INSTALLATION <br> <br>The files on this disc are not compressed and can be copied <br>to your hard disk by running the Setup program (under Windows <br>NT or Windows 95) or by dragging the files in the CODE directory <br>to an INOLE directory on your hard disk using File Manager or <br>another utility (under 16-bit Windows). You must have at least <br>7.5 MB of free space on your hard disk to install the files. <br> <br>************************************************************** <br>*                                                            * <br>*                        IMPORTANT                           * <br>*                                                            * <br>************************************************************** <br> <br>Many of the samples include a REG (registration) file that <br>must be "run" before the samples will work. Double click <br>on the file in FIle Manager or Explorer to "run" them.  If you <br>are working on Win32 platforms, use WIN32.REG.  If you are <br>working on Windows 3.1x, use WIN16.REG. <br> <br>The REG files assume that you install the files to C:\INOLE; <br>you'll need to edit the REG files if you install the files <br>to another directory.  Simply replace all occurances of <br>"c:\inole" with the actual installation directory. <br> <br> <br> <br> <br>             DISC CONTENTS <br> <br>The sample source code and support files for each chapter  <br>are stored under CHAPXX, where XX is the chapter number.  <br>For example, all files for Chapter 2 are in the CHAP02  <br>directory. Several other directories contain files that you  <br>will need for compilation or that you might want to study.  <br>They include: <br> <br>DIRECTORY     CONTENTS <br>---------     -------- <br>BUILD         Contains the  DLL and EXE files created by <br>              MAKEALL.BAT files. It is recommended that you <br>              add this directory to your path. <br> <br>CLASSLIB      C++ class library created for this book. <br> <br>INC           Include files (H) needed for this book. <br>              Must be in your INCLUDE environment path. <br> <br>INTERFAC      OLE template interface implementations. <br> <br>LIB           Library files (LIB) needed for this book. <br>              Must be in your LIB environment path. <br> <br> <br>See the file CONTENTS.TXT for a full description of the <br>contents of the companion disC. <br> <br>Be sure that all environment variables are set correctly for <br>your compiler. For example, if you have the Inside OLE files, <br>Visual C++ 2.0, the Win32 SDK, and the OLE controls development <br>kit installed on drive C, your environment variables should <br>include the following (long lines have been broken): <br> <br>INCLUDE=C:\MSVC20\INCLUDE;C:\MSVC20\MFC\INCLUDE;C:\MSVC20\CDK32\INCLUDE; <br>        C:\MSTOOLS\IDL;C:\MSTOOLS\H;C:\INOLE\INC <br>LIB=C:\MSVC20\LIB;C:\MSVC20\MFC\LIB;C:\MSVC20\CDK32\LIB; <br>    C:\MSTOOLS\LIB;C:\INOLE\LIB <br>PATH=C:\MSVC20\BIN;C:\MSVC20\CDK32\BIN;C:\MSTOOLS\BIN;C:\INOLE\BUILD <br> <br> <br>Check your compiler's documentation for more information. <br> <br>NOTE: You might need to increase your environment size to accommodate <br>the environment variables. <br> <br> <br> <br> <br>         BUILDING THE SAMPLE PROGRAMS <br> <br>To compile all the sample programs on this disc, run the MAKEALL.BAT <br>batch file in the installation directory. You must add the INCLUDE <br>and LIB directories from this installation to the INCLUDE and LIB <br>environment variables as detailed above. <br> <br>For detailed information on the build process and the files <br>involved, see the file BUILD.TXT.  This file also includes <br>information on the OLE UI Library and the MIDL compiler which <br>may be important for your work with these samples <br> <br> <br> <br> <br>        KNOWN ERRORS AND PROBLEMS <br> <br>As the printed copy of this book was finalized, extensive testing <br>and debugging were performed on the samples on Windows 3.1x (16-bit), <br>Windows NT 3.5 and 3.51, and Windows 95, the latter two platforms <br>being still in pre-release form at the time of production.  As bugs <br>are invariably found, there are several places where the book text <br>does not match the sample code.  The file ERRATA.TXT points out these <br>discrepancies and contains the most up-to-date information.  Please <br>take a few moments to review ERRATA.TXT and mark the printed <br>book as appropriate. <br> <br> <br> <br> <br>  IF THERE ARE PROBLEMS WITH THIS DISC OR THE SAMPLES <br> <br>Every effort was made to ensure the accuracy of the book and <br>this disc. Should you encounter a problem, please contact <br>us at the following address: <br> <br>    Microsoft Press <br>    Attn: Inside OLE Editor <br>    One Microsoft Way <br>    Redmond, WA  98052-6399 <br> <br>No telephone calls, please. <br> <br>The author also welcomes your comments through email at <br>kraigb@microsoft.com.  Due to the potential volume of email, <br>responses are not guaranteed.  For timely support of OLE <br>questions or problems, contact Microsoft Developer Support <br>Services. <br></code></pre>
