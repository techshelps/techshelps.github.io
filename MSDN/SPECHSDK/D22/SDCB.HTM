<P>Sets the awake state for a voice-command site. </P>

<P>dwAwake</P>
<P>[in] TRUE to cause the site to wake up or FALSE to cause it to go to sleep.</P>
<P>If a voice-navigation application is installed on the user's computer, suspending speech recognition by using <B>AwakeStateSet</B> will typically cause the voice-navigation application to activate a "wake up" menu.</P>
<P>Calling <B>AwakeStateSet</B> allows the user to temporarily suspend speech recognition for a site. For example, the user might want to suspend speech recognition from the computer microphone during a telephone conversation and resume recognition when the conversation is finished. The user resumes recognition by speaking an appropriate command from a sleep menu — for example, "Wake up!"</P>
<P>The sleep state for a site is saved between uses of the site, even if the user shuts down the computer in the meantime. </P>
<P>If a voice-navigation application is installed on the user's computer, an application may not need to set the sleep state. However, it may call this function to make sure that speech recognition is awake. For example, if an application speaks (with voice text or text-to-speech) "Do you want to print the document?" it might enable and wake up speech recognition for the site to receive the user's reply. The application should then restore speech recognition to its previous state.</P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
