<H3>Object Creation</H3><P>To create a voice-command object, an application calls the <B>CoCreateInstance</B> function with the CLSID_VCmd class identifier and the IID_IVoiceCmd interface identifier. An application must create a voice-command object for each audio source that it needs to use. For example, if the application needs to recognize commands from a telephone line as well as the computer microphone, it should create two voice-command objects.</P>
<P>After creating a voice-command object, <B>CoCreateInstance</B> returns a pointer to the <B>IVoiceCmd</B> interface for the voice-command object. An application uses <B>IVoiceCmd</B> to register itself with the speech-recognition engine and to create voice-menu objects and voice-menu enumerators. For more information about voice-menu objects and voice-menu enumerators, see "Voice-Menu Object" later in this section and "Voice-Menu Enumerator" later in this section.</P>
<P>Before an application can perform other voice-command tasks, it must register itself by calling the <B>IVoiceCmd::Register</B> member function. By registering, the application tells the engine which site to use as the source of voice commands and passes the voice-command object a pointer to the application's voice-command notification interface. The object calls the notification interface to notify the application about events related to voice commands. </P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
