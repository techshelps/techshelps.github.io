<P>Voice Commands</P>
<H1>What is Command and Control recognition?</H1><P>"Command &amp; Control" speech recognition allows the user to speak a word, phrase, or sentence from a list of phrases that the computer is expecting to hear. For example, a user might be able to speak the command, "Send mail to Fred Smith", "Send mail to Bob Jones", or "Turn on the television."</P>
<P>The number of different commands a user might speak at any time can easily number in the hundreds. Furthermore, the commands are not just limited to a "list" but can also contain other fields, like "Send mail to &lt;Name&gt;" or "Call {digits}" or "Record the movie at {time}". With all of the possibilities, the user is able to speak thousands of different commands.</P>
<P>When using Command &amp; Control technology, users talk in natural speech to their computer and don't need to train the computer to their voice, so it's easy to use.</P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
