<H3>Games and Edutainment</H3><P>Game and edutainment software titles will be some of the heaviest users of Command &amp; Control speech recognition in the near term. Christmas 1995 saw the appearance of several games and half a dozen language-learning titles that use speech recognition. Only high end machines sold in Christmas 1995 could run speech recognition. Because memory and CPU in machines will increase, and because of the introduction of Microsoft's speech API, many more games and edutainment  titles in the Christmas '96 market will use speech recognition.</P>
<P>What do these titles use speech recognition for?</P>
<P>The most compelling use is interacting with characters. In most games, when a user "talks" to a character on the computer, they either type in a response, or click on the text of the response with their mouse. A silent response is a let-down because the computer's character is actually speaking through the sound card. After all, how many conversations do you have where the person you're talking to speaks and you stay mute and write out your response? Why not allow the user to really talk back to the character? It's a lot more fun and realistic.</P>
<P>Another use for speech recognition in games/titles is to avoid magic keystrokes. Many games have gotten so complex that virtually every key on the keyboard does something like "Look out the left window" or "Turn on targeting". Whenever I play these games I can only remember the most common keys, such as the ones for firing. I can't ever remember that F2 looks out over the left window and F3 looks out the right window. Why not just let the user speak, "Look out the left window?"</P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
