<H3>Speech Recognizers make mistakes</H3><P>Speech recognizers make mistakes, and will always make mistakes. The only thing that is changing is that every two years recognizers make half as many mistakes as they did before. But, no matter how great a recognizer is it will always make mistakes.</P>
<P>An application can minimize some of the misrecognitions by:</P>
<P>Design the list of commands that the computer is listening for so that commands sound different. As a rule of thumb, the more phonemes different between two commands the  more different they sound to the computer. The two commands, "go" and "no" only differ by one phoneme so when the user says, "Go" the computer is likely to recognize "No." However, if the commands were "Go there" and "No way" recognition would be much better.</P>
<P>Don't provide speech commands that do really bad things like formatting a user's hard disk.</P>
<P>Verify commands that might be dangerous.</P>
<P>Have the computer verify every command with the user. The Microsoft Voice application will display the command that it heard and then in small text display, "Say 'Do it' to accept the command." The command is not actually acted upon unless the user says "Do it" within a few seconds of the command being spoken.</P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
