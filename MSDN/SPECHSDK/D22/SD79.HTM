<h2>More Specific Reasons for Implementing Speech</H2><P>Command and Control recognition might be used in some of the following situations:</P>
<P> <FONT FACE="Symbol">·</FONT>    <B>Answering questions</B>.  Speech recognition assists the user in answering questions posed by the computer. All speech-recognition engines can easily identify "Yes," "No," and a few other short responses. For example, an application can easily be designed to accept voice responses to message boxes and wizard screens.</P>
<P> <FONT FACE="Symbol">·</FONT>    <B>Streamlining access to features</B>.  Speech recognition enables the user to speak any one of a potentially huge set of commands, which can make hard-to-reach features more accessible. For example, it is usually faster to say, "Change the font to Arial," "Use 13-point bold," or "Print the current page" than to maneuver through the corresponding dialog boxes.</P>
<P> <FONT FACE="Symbol">·</FONT>    <B>Activating macros</B>.  Keyboard-activated macros usually require the user to memorize a key sequence that may not be intuitive because the keyboard is overloaded with commands. Speech recognition allows the user to speak a more natural word or phrase to activate a macro. For example, "Spell check the paragraph" is easier for most users to remember than the ctrl+f5 key combination.</P>
<P> <FONT FACE="Symbol">·</FONT>    <B>Accessing Large Lists</B>.  Many applications provide large lists of names that users must scroll through to select the correct one. The file open dialog box or the "Start" menu provide such lists. In general, it's faster for a user to speak one of the names on the list, such as "Start running calculator" than to maneuver through the list to find it.</P>
<P> <FONT FACE="Symbol">·</FONT>    <B>Facilitating dialogue between the user and the computer</B>.  Speech recognition works very well in situations where the computer essentially asks the user "What do you want to do?" and branches according to the reply (somewhat like a wizard). For example, the user might reply, "I want to book a flight from New York to Boston." After the computer analyzes the reply, it clarifies any ambiguous words ("Did you say New York?"). Finally, the computer asks for any information that the user did not supply, such as "What day and time do you want to leave?"</P>
<P> <FONT FACE="Symbol">·</FONT>    <B>Providing</B> <B>hands-free computing</B>.  Speech recognition is an essential component of any application that requires hands-free operation; it also can provide an alternative to the keyboard for users who are unable or prefer not to use one. Users with repetitive-stress injuries or those who cannot type may use speech recognition as the sole means of controlling the computer.</P>
<P> <FONT FACE="Symbol">·</FONT>    <B>Humanizing the computer</B>.  Speech recognition can make the computer seem more like a person — that is, like someone whom the user talks to and who speaks back. This capability can make games more realistic and make educational or entertainment applications friendlier.</P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
