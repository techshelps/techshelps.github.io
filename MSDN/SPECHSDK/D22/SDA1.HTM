<H3>Object Creation</H3><P>After an application has registered its site with the voice-command object, it can create a voice-menu object by using the <B>IVoiceCmd::MenuCreate</B> member function. <B>MenuCreate</B> retrieves a pointer to an <B>IVCmdMenu</B> interface for the newly created voice-menu object. An application uses the <B>IVCmdMenu</B> member functions to obtain information about the voice menu, add and remove menu commands, and so on.</P>
<P>When calling <B>MenuCreate</B>, the application specifies the name of the voice menu that the new object is to represent and indicates whether the function should create a new menu or open an existing one from the voice-menu database. If the function creates a new menu, the menu initially contains no commands. The application must add commands by using the <B>IVCmdMenu::Add</B> member function. </P>
<P>A voice menu is stored in the database, unless it was created as a temporary menu. A <I>temporary menu</I> is destroyed when the voice-menu object is released. Typically, you will store a voice menu between invocations of the voice-command object, so you should first call <B>MenuCreate</B> with the VCMDMC_OPEN_EXISTING value. If <B>MenuCreate</B> returns an error, you should call it a second time with the VCMDMC_OPEN_ALWAYS value, which creates a new voice menu for the application.</P>
<P>An application can use the <B>IVoiceCmd::MenuEnum</B> member function to create a voice-menu enumerator object to enumerate the menus currently in the voice-menu database. For more information about voice-menu enumerators, see "Voice-Menu Enumerator" later in this section.</P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
