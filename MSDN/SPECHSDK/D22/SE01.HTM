<h2>About OLE Automation</H2><P>The voice-command and voice-text objects are exposed as OLE automation objects, allowing them to be accessed and controlled through Visual Basic, Visual Basic for Applications (VBA), and other automation-aware application macro languages. You can take advantage of the OLE automation capabilities of these objects to add voice-command and voice-text capabilities to your Visual Basic applications. </P>
<P>This appendix describes the properties and methods that Visual Basic programmers can use to manipulate the voice-command objects.</P>
<P>Note that any version of Visual Basic or VBA that supports OLE automation can be used with voice-command and voice-text object. However only Visual Basic version 4.0 supports the custom asynchronous notification mechanism. Using previous versions of Visual Basic requires the use of a polling mechanism to periodically check to see if a voice command was recognized or another event occurred.</P>
<P>All OLE automation methods described in this appendix set a generic error #440, "OLE Automation error" if they fail.</P>
<P>For examples of Visual Basic applications that use the voice-command and voice-text objects, see the sample applications included with the Speech Software Development Kit. </P>
<P>For more information about OLE automation, see the Microsoft Win32 Software Development Kit (SDK).</P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
