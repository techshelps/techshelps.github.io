<h2>Managing User Expectations</H2><P>When users hear that they can speak to their computers, they instantly think of <I>Star Trek</I> and <I>2001: A Space Odyssey</I>, expecting that the computer will correctly transcribe every word that they speak, understand it, and then act upon it in an intelligent manner. </P>
<P>You should convey as clearly as possible exactly what an application can and cannot do and emphasize that the user should speak clearly, using words the application understands.</P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
