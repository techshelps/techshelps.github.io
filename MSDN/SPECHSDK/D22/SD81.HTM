<H3>Problems with computer generated sounds</H3><P>What's often worse that ambient noise are sounds generated by the user's computer and played out their 80-watt stereo system.</P>
<P>Several methods exist to make sure that the microphone isn't hearing the speakers:</P>
<P>If the user is wearing a close-talk headset, causing the microphone to be about a few centimeters away from the user's mouth, then the microphone is so close to the user that it won't hear the speakers. This solution is good for avid game players who want speech recognition, but can't hold anything in their hands because they already have a joystick.</P>
<P>Make sure the user is wearing headphones. That way the microphone won't pick up the sound coming from the computer.</P>
<P>Have a "push-to-talk" button. When the user pushes the button, the computer's audio output is muted and speech recognition is turned on. When the user releases the button speech recognition is turned off and the audio is turned back on. Users get the hang of this pretty quickly. If used in a wireless device, this also saves battery life.</P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
