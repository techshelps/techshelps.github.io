<P>Enables or disables speech recognition for a voice-command site.</P>
<P> <FONT FACE="Symbol">·</FONT>    Returns NOERROR if successful, or one of these error values:</P>

<P>[in] TRUE to enable speech recognition or FALSE to disable it.</P>
<P></P>
<P>Whenever speech is turned on or off, the WM_SPEECHSTARTED or WM_SPEECHENDED message is sent to all top-level windows in the system. An application can use these messages to determine when to enable or disable its voice commands or voice-text capabilities.</P>
<P>Calling <B>EnabledSet</B> allows the user to completely turn off speech recognition for a site so that nothing is recognized, including commands on sleep menus. For example, the user might want to disable speech recognition from the computer microphone during a meeting so that speech recognition will stay off, even if somebody inadvertently speaks a command on a sleep menu.</P>
<P>If a voice-navigation application is installed on the user's computer, an application may not need to set the enabled state. However, it may call this function to make sure that speech recognition is awake. For example, if an application speaks (with voice text or text-to-speech) "Do you want to print the document?" it might enable and wake up speech recognition for the site to receive the user's reply. The application should then restore speech recognition to its previous state.</P>
<P>Note, however that, if speech recognition is disabled, it is probably because the user does not want to use it. It may not be appropriate to enable speech recognition under those circumstances. </P>
<P>The enabled state for a site is saved between uses of the site, even if the user shuts down the computer in the meantime. </P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
