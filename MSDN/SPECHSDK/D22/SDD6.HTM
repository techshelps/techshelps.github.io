<h2>IVCmdAttributes::ThresholdGet</H2><P></P>
<P>HRESULT ThresholdGet(DWORD *pdwThreshold);</P>
<P></P>
<P>Retrieves the threshold level of the speech-recognition engine used by a voice-command site.</P>
<P> <FONT FACE="Symbol">·</FONT>    Returns NOERROR if successful, or one of these error values:</P>
<P>E_INVALIDARG<BR>VCMDERR_INVALIDMODE<BR>VCMDERR_NOTSUPPORTED<BR>VCMDERR_OUTOFMEM</P>
<P></P>
<P><I>pdwThreshold</I></P>
<P>[out] Address of a variable that receives the threshold level. </P>
<P></P>
<P>The threshold level is a value from 0 to 100 that indicates the point below which an engine rejects an utterance as unrecognized. A value of 0 indicates that the engine should match any utterance to the closest phrase match. A value of 100 indicates that the engine should be absolutely certain that an utterance is the recognized phrase. For example, suppose the engine is expecting "What is the time?" If the threshold is 100 and the user mumbles "What'z tha time" or has a cold, the command may not be recognized. However, if the threshold is too low and the user says a similar-sounding phrase that is not being listened for such as "What is mine?" the engine may recognize it as "What is the time?"</P>
<P>If the command spoken by the user is not close enough to what the speech-recognition engine expects, the voice-command object notifies the application that the command was not recognized by calling <B>IVCmdNotifySink::CommandOther</B> with a NULL phrase. </P>
<P>The threshold for a site is saved between uses of the site, even if the user shuts down the computer in the meantime.</P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
