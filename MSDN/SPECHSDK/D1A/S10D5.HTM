<h2>D</H2><P><B>degradation</B></P>
<P>A reduction in quality or performance of a communications channel.</P>
<P></P>
<P><B>deterioration</B></P>
<P>The gradual loss of data stored by a speech-recognition results object. The information in a results object can occupy a significant amount of memory, so an engine developer may permit the object to discard data automatically as time passes.</P>
<P></P>
<P><B>dictation grammar</B></P>
<P>Defines a context for the speaker by identifying the subject of the dictation, the expected style of language, and what dictation has already been done.</P>
<P></P>
<P><B>digital-audio format</B></P>
<P>Audio format controlled by binary or numeric data.</P>
<P></P>
<P><B>digital-audio stream</B></P>
<P>Continuous audio data received from or sent to an audio device.</P>
<P></P>
<P><B>Digital Signal Processor (DSP)</B></P>
<P>A general-purpose multiprocessor tailored to a particular type of operation. Applications involving communications, compression, and audio are more efficiently performed on a DSP than on the host computer.</P>
<P></P>
<P><B>diphone</B></P>
<P>A sound consisting of two phonemes: one that leads into the sound and one that finishes the sound. For example, the word "hello" consists of these diphones: <I>silence-h h-eh eh-l l-oe oe-silence</I>.</P>
<P></P>
<P><B>diphone concatenation</B></P>
<P>The text-to-speech engine concatenates short digital-audio segments and performs intersegment smoothing to produce a continuous sound.</P>
<P></P>
<P><B>discrete speech</B></P>
<P>Every word must be isolated by a pause before and after the word—usually about a quarter of a second—in order for the engine to recognize it.</P>
<P></P>
<P><B>DTMF (Dual Tone Multi-Frequency)</B></P>
<P>Touch-tone or push-button dialing. Pushing a button on a telephone keypad generates a sound that is a combination of two tones, one high frequency and the other low frequency.</P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
