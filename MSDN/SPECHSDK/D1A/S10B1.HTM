<h2>Pronunciation Lexicons</H2><P>Both speech-recognition and text-to-speech engines can make use of a pronunciation lexicon, which is a database of pronunciations for words and phrases to be recognized or played. Some engines allow an application or the user to edit the pronunciation lexicon to add new pronunciations or to replace incorrect pronunciations with correct ones. </P>
<P>An engine can give the user direct access to its pronunciation lexicon by providing a Lexicon dialog box. The Lexicon dialog box displays entries in the pronunciation lexicon and allows the user to edit them. An application causes a speech-recognition engine to display its Lexicion dialog box by calling the <B>ISRDialogs::LexiconDlg</B> or <B>IVCmdDialogs::LexiconDlg</B> member function. Similarly, an application calls the <B>ITTSDialogs::LexiconDlg</B> or <B>IVTxtDialogs::LexiconDlg</B> member function to cause a text-to-speech engine to display its Lexicon dialog box.</P>
<P>If an engine supports the optional <B>ILexPronounce</B> interface, an application can use it to query and control the engine's pronunciation lexicon. The <B>ILexPronounce::Get</B> member function retrieves the pronunciation and part of speech of a given word, the <B>ILexPronounce::Add</B> member function adds the pronunciation and part of speech of a word to the lexicon, and the <B>ILexPronounce::Remove</B> member function removes the pronunciation and part of speech of the given word from the lexicon. </P>
<P>For information about how to use the <B>ILexPronounce</B> interface to adjust a pronunciation, see Appendix C, "Unicode and the International Phonetic Alphabet."</P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
