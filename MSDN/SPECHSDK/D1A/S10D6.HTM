<h2>E</H2><P><B>echo canceling</B></P>
<P>A method of controlling echoing on communication lines, in which the sender checks the inbound channel for a slightly delayed duplicate of its own transmission. In echo canceling, the sender adds an appropriately modified, reversed version of its transmission to the path on which it receives information. The result is to erase the echo electronically but leave incoming data intact.</P>

<P></P>
<P><B>engine</B></P>
<P>A program that does the actual work of recognizing speech or translating text into speech. Most speech-recognition engines convert incoming audio data to engine-specific phonemes, which are then translated into text for use by an application. A text-to-speech engine performs the same process, only in reverse. An engine object is an OLE COM object that represents a mode of a speech-recognition or text-to-speech engine.</P>
<P></P>
<P><B>engine enumerator</B></P>
<P>Enumerates the speech-recognition or text-to-speech modes supported by a particular engine.</P>
<P></P>
<P><B>engine-specific phoneme character set</B></P>
<P>A character set that describes phonemes, pauses, and so on, and that is specific to a text-to-speech engine.</P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
