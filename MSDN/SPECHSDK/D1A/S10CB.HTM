<h2>Adjusting an Engine's Pronunciation of a Word</H2><P>Typically, it should not be necessary to adjust the pronunciations of words in the engine's native language. However, engines are likely to mispronounce foreign names or invented words (such as those that commonly occur in game software). An application can adjust an engine's pronunciation of a word in any of the following ways:</P>
<P> <FONT FACE="Symbol">·</FONT>    If the engine has a pronunciation lexicon, the correct pronunciation can be added to the lexicon and the incorrect pronunciation (if any) removed. For more information, see the <B>ILexPronounce</B> interface in this section.</P>
<P> <FONT FACE="Symbol">·</FONT>    The application can provide a text-to-speech engine with phonemes instead of ASCII text to be spoken. For more information, see the <B>ITTSCentral::TextData</B> member function in the section, "Low-Level Text-to-Speech API."</P>
<P></P>
<P>For example, suppose a text-to-speech engine mispronounces a word that is not in the engine's lexicon. Correcting the pronunciation would involve the following steps:</P>
<P>    1.    Determine what phonemes the engine is using by calling the <B>ITTSCentral::Phoneme</B> member function with the text of the word. For example:</P>
<P>pITTSCentral-&gt;Phoneme(CHARSET_IPAPHONETIC, //IPA character set<BR>    NULL,       // text is not tagged<BR>    dtext,      // text of the word<BR>    pdPhoneme); // function fills in pointer to phonemes<BR></P>
<P>The function fills in the <B>SDATA</B> structure pointed to by the <I>pdPhoneme</I> parameter with a pointer to a WCHAR array of Unicode values, which contains the phonemes used to pronounce the word.</P>
<P>    2.    Check the phonemes to determine which ones should be changed.</P>
<P>    3.    Store the correct pronunciation in the engine's lexicon by calling<B> </B>the <B>ILexPronounce::Add</B> member function, or pass the corrected phonemes to the engine by calling the <B>ITTSCentral::TextData</B> member function and specifying CHARSET_IPAPHONETIC for the <I>eCharacterSet</I> parameter.</P>
<P></P>
<P>If an engine doesn't support the IPA or the <B>ILexPronounce</B> interface, it may still provide a dialog box that allows an end-user to adjust pronunciation, typically by supporting the <B>LexiconDlg</B> function of the <B>ISRDialogs</B> interface (for a speech-recognition engine) or the <B>ITTSDialogs</B> interface (for a text-to-speech engine). For more information, see the section, "Low-Level Speech Recognition API" or "Low-Level Text-to-Speech API."</P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
