<H3>Dialog Boxes</H3><P>A speech-recognition engine provides a set of dialog boxes that let the user configure the engine. By using the <B>ISRDialogs</B> interface provided by a speech-recognition engine object, an application can direct the engine to display one of its dialog boxes. The controls and capabilities in the dialog boxes are determined solely by the engine. </P>
<P>When an application calls a member function of the <B>ISRDialogs</B> interface to display a dialog box, it specifies the handle of the parent window for the dialog box. By specifying NULL instead of a window handle, the application can determine whether the engine supports the given dialog box. The engine returns NOERROR if it supports the dialog box, or SRERR_NOTSUPPORTED if not. </P>
<P>The application also specifies the title of the dialog box by specifying the address of a title string. If the application specifies NULL instead of a title string address, the engine uses the default title. </P>
<H4><A NAME="sec0"></A>About Dialog Box</H4><P>An engine's About dialog box contains information that identifies the speech-recognition engine and its manufacturer, and it contains the manufacturer's copyright notice. An application displays the About dialog box by calling the <B>ISRDialogs::AboutDlg</B> member function.</P>
<H4><A NAME="sec1"></A>General Dialog Box</H4><P>The General dialog box gives the user control of the general features of the speech-recognition engine. An application displays the General dialog box by using the <B>ISRDialogs::GeneralDlg</B> member function. Depending on the engine, the General dialog box may allow the user to do the following:</P>
<P> <FONT FACE="Symbol">·</FONT>    Inform the engine of the speaker's gender or other speaker-specific information</P>
<P> <FONT FACE="Symbol">·</FONT>    Control how stringent the engine is about recognition</P>
<P> <FONT FACE="Symbol">·</FONT>    Control the maximum amount of disk space allotted for speaker information</P>
<P> <FONT FACE="Symbol">·</FONT>    Control optimizations that affect speech processing time</P>
<P> <FONT FACE="Symbol">·</FONT>    Export and import speaker information to and from a disk so that the information can be transferred between systems</P>
<P></P>
<H4><A NAME="sec2"></A>Lexicon Dialog Box</H4><P>A speech-recognition engine maintains a database of pronunciations called a <I>pronunciation lexicon</I>, and an engine may allow an application to collect new or corrected pronunciations from the user. The Lexicon dialog box displays a user's pronunciation lexicon and allows the user to edit it. For example, the user can edit the phonetics of mispronounced words and load or unload personal exception dictionaries. An application uses the <B>ISRDialogs::LexiconDlg</B> member function to display the Lexicon dialog box.</P>
<P>For more information about pronunciation lexicons, see the section, "Common Elements of the Speech Application Programming Interface."</P>
<H4><A NAME="sec3"></A>General Training Dialog Box</H4><P>The <B>ISRDialogs::TrainGeneralDlg</B> member function displays the General Training dialog box, which trains a speech-recognition engine by having the user speak a preselected set of words and phrases. After the user speaks the words and phrases, the recognition accuracy should improve for that speaker.</P>
<H4><A NAME="sec4"></A>Microphone Training Dialog Box</H4><P>The Microphone Training dialog box trains the engine for use with a particular microphone so that recognition accuracy improves with that microphone. An application should display this dialog box at the request of the engine or whenever the speaker wants to display it. Training information is associated with both the speaker and the microphone. If the engine does not supply this dialog box, the speaker cannot train it for the microphone; however, the application will still work. The application uses the <B>ISRDialogs::TrainMicDlg</B> member function to display the Microphone Training dialog box.</P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
