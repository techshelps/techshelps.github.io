<H3>Sharing Recognition with Other Applications</H3><P>An application using the previously described techniques is able to incorporate dictation and act as a stand-alone application. However, other applications running on the machine may also be using speech recognition and may wish to share recognition with the active application, either by using the speech-recognition sharing object or by using voice commands. To integrate well with other applications, a dictation application should be written with extra precautions.</P>
<P>When deciding upon a speech-recognition engine to use, the application should use the speech-recognition sharing object and find an engine that supports dictation grammars that are already in use on the desired wave-in audio device. If such an engine is not found, the application should create a new instance of a dictation engine to be shared. Applications can use private instances of the engine without going through the sharing object, but this prevents other applications from using the same instance and consumes more CPU time and memory.</P>
<P>The dictation grammar should not be activated unless the application's editor window has the keyboard focus and the application is in dictation mode. An application can get into dictation mode through a voice command or a menu.</P>
<P>When an application activates the dictation grammar it should disable voice commands through the <B>IVCmdAttributes::EnabledSet</B> member function and return the voice-command object to its previous state when the dictation grammar is deactivated. This allows smooth integration with voice commands.</P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
