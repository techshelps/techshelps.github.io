<h2>ISRGramCommon::Archive</H2><P></P>
<P>HRESULT Archive(BOOL fArchiveResults, PVOID pBuf, DWORD dwBufSize,</P>
<P>    DWORD *pdwBufNeeded);</P>
<P></P>
<P>Serializes a grammar object into memory, using a memory format that is native to the engine. The native format for the engine is stored in a data buffer.</P>
<P> <FONT FACE="Symbol">·</FONT>    Returns NOERROR if successful, or one of these error values:</P>
<P>E_INVALIDARG<BR>E_OUTOFMEMORY<BR>SRERR_INVALIDFLAG<BR>SRERR_NOTSUPPORTED</P>
<P></P>
<P><I>fArchiveResults</I></P>
<P>[in] TRUE if the engine should archive all information in existing speech-recognition results objects, or FALSE if no results objects should be archived. Archiving the information in results objects may use a lot of memory, so an application should do this only if it needs the results objects for the next use of the application or document.</P>
<P></P>
<P><I>pBuf</I></P>
<P>[out] Address of a buffer that receives the archived data — the engine's native format and results objects, if any. As an alternative to a buffer, <I>pBuf</I> can point to memory in a memory-mapped file. </P>
<P></P>
<P><I>dwBufSize</I></P>
<P>[in] Number of bytes available in the buffer specified by <I>pBuf</I>. If the number is too small, <B>Archive</B> returns SRERR_NOTENOUGHDATA and fills <I>pdwBufNeeded</I> with the number of bytes needed.</P>
<P></P>
<P><I>pdwBufNeeded</I></P>
<P>[out] Number of bytes needed for the data to be archived.</P>
<P></P>
<P>If the engine does not support the grammar's standard format, <B>Archive</B> returns an error.</P>
<P>If <I>fArchiveResults</I> is TRUE, existing speech-recognition results objects are archived with the grammar. Information about lists is not archived. The application can save the archive data to disk or leave it in the buffer. </P>
<P>To reuse the grammar, the application calls the <B>GrammarLoad</B> member function and passes in the native format, which loads more quickly than standard format. If the archived grammar includes speech-recognition results objects, the engine calls the <B>ISRGramNotifySink::UnArchive</B> member function for each results object present when archive was called so the application can retrieve them.</P>
<P>While a grammar is activated, the speech-recognition engine may modify its engine-specific grammar structure as it acquires more information about the patterns of the speakers' speech. For this reason, the <B>Archive</B> member function should be called each time a grammar is deactivated and just before it is released, to ensure that the engine's modifications are preserved for the next use of the grammar.</P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
