<H3>Multimedia Audio-Source Object</H3><P>Most applications recognize audio from a multimedia wave-in driver. Microsoft provides a component object called the <I>multimedia audio-source object</I> that provides access to the multimedia wave-in driver. To use the multimedia audio-source object, an application calls the <B>CoCreateInstance</B> function with the CLSID_MMAudioSource class identifier. The function returns the address of the <B>IUnknown</B> interface supported by the audio-source object. The application needs to specify this address when creating an engine object (described later in this section). </P>
<P>By default, the multimedia audio-source object uses WAVE_MAPPER as the audio device. To use a different device, the application can call the <B>IUnknown::QueryInterface</B> member function with the IID_IAudioMultiMediaDevice interface identifier. <B>QueryInterface</B> returns the address of the <B>IAudioMultimediaDevice</B> interface. The application can then call the <B>IAudioMultimediaDevice::DeviceNumSet</B> member function to set the identifier of the multimedia device to use as the audio source. </P>
<P>An application can retrieve a list of wave-in audio devices available in the system by using the <B>WaveInGetNumDevs</B> and <B>WaveInGetDevCaps</B> functions. </P>
<P>After acquiring the address of the <B>IAudioMultimediaDevice</B> interface, an application must call the <B>Release</B> member function before it closes to release the audio-source object. </P>
<P>As an alternative to using an engine object and multimedia audio-source object, an application can use the speech-recognition sharing object to use an engine and an audio source that are shared with other applications. For more information about the speech-recognition sharing object, see "Speech-Recognition Sharing Object" later in this section.</P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
