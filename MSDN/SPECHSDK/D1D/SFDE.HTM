<h2>ISRResEval::ReEvaluate</H2><P></P>
<P>HRESULT ReEvaluate(BOOL *pfChanged);</P>
<P></P>
<P>Causes a speech-recognition engine to reevaluate the recognition result represented by this object.</P>
<P> <FONT FACE="Symbol">·</FONT>    Returns NOERROR if successful, or one of these error values:</P>
<P>E_INVALIDARG<BR>E_OUTOFMEMORY<BR>SRERR_NOTENOUGHDATA<BR>SRERR_NOTSUPPORTED</P>
<P></P>
<P><I>pfChanged</I></P>
<P>[out] Address of a variable that receives TRUE if reevaluating the recognition changed the result. An engine may not be able to reevaluate a result because it doesn't have enough information.</P>
<P></P>
<P>Reevaluating a recognition allows the engine to take advantage of new knowledge that it has recently acquired.</P>
<P>Typically, <B>ReEvaluate</B> is used for dictation in which the application has the speaker do a speaking pass followed by a correction pass. As the speaker corrects the document, the application may call the <B>ISRResCorrection</B>::<B>Correction</B> and <B>ISRResCorrection</B>::<B>Validate</B> member functions, which ultimately provide the engine with the following information:</P>
<P> <FONT FACE="Symbol">·</FONT>    New proper names or words are identified, and their text is mapped to phonetic representations. Subsequent occurrences of these phonemes should be correctly recognized.</P>
<P> <FONT FACE="Symbol">·</FONT>    Misrecognitions are corrected. This effect sometimes ripples through a document because a misrecognition can produce non sequiturs that confuse the engine's grammar rules, and corrections can affect subsequent recognitions.</P>
<P> <FONT FACE="Symbol">·</FONT>    The engine has managed to adapt to the user's speech and grammar patterns, which corrects some misrecognitions.</P>
<P> <FONT FACE="Symbol">·</FONT>    By the end of a document the engine may be able to better identify the context of the dictation and the vocabulary used within the document.</P>
<P></P>
<P>An advanced engine can take advantage of all of these clues.</P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
