<P>Low-Level Speech Recognition</P>
<H1>Why Use the Low-Level API?</H1><P>The high level speech API (Voice Commands, Voice Text, and Voice Dictation) exist to make speech easy to use, but in the process prevent full control of speech recognition. In the low level API:</P>
<P>The application must pay attention to many more details than with the high level API.</P>
<P>The application can do anything that it wants to so long as the engine can support the feature.</P>
<P>If standard low-level API doesn't provide for a feature, then engines can add onto API.</P>
<P>The engine is in application's process space.</P>
<P>Multiple instances of engines can be run at once.</P>
<P>Audio comes from or goes to any media that the application desire.</P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
