<h2>ISRGramNotifySink::UnArchive</H2><P></P>
<P>HRESULT UnArchive(PIUNKNOWN pIUnknownResult);</P>
<P></P>
<P>Notifies an application that a speech-recognition results object that was archived with a grammar has been loaded along with the grammar.</P>
<P> <FONT FACE="Symbol">·</FONT>    Return value is ignored.</P>
<P></P>
<P><I>pIUnknownResult</I></P>
<P>[in] Address of the <B>IUnknown</B> interface on the speech-recognition results object that was loaded.</P>
<P></P>
<P>The application receives an <B>UnArchive</B> notification for each speech-recognition results object in existence when the grammar was archived. The unique identifier of the results object is maintained, so the application can tell which results object belongs to which text.</P>
<P>Once the application returns from the <B>UnArchive</B> member function, both the <B>IUnknown</B> interface and the speech-recognition results object are be released unless the application calls the <B>IUnknown::QueryInterface</B> member function on one of the object's interfaces. This allows an application to ignore the parameter without causing results objects to accumulate and consume memory needlessly. The results object is likely to support the speech-recognition results interfaces (<B>ISRResAudio</B>, <B>ISRResBasic</B>, and so on), but the application must query for each interface desired.</P>
<P>An application can keep a results object for later reference although the object can consume large amounts of memory. However, from the engine's point of view, it doesn't really need to re-create the entire results object until the <B>QueryInterface</B> member function is called.</P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
