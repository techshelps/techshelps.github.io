<H3>Releasing an Engine Object and Shutting Down</H3><P>When an application finishes using speech recognition, it should release all of the outstanding interfaces that it has on speech-recognition objects. This includes those from the engine object, all grammar objects, and all results objects. </P>
<P>Once all of these objects are free, the engine begins shutting down. The engine releases all notification sink objects from the application. </P>
<P>The application should not shut down until all of its notification sinks (for both <B>ISRGramNotifySink</B> and <B>ISRNotifySink</B>) have been released. This is very important because speech recognition is an asynchronous process, possibly running in a different process space.</P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
