<H3>Rule Activation</H3><P>To begin using a context-free grammar to recognize speech, the application must first activate a specific rule in the grammar. This puts the rule at the starting node of the recognition. </P>
<P>Continuing the examples described at the beginning of this section, if an application activates the &lt;Actions&gt; rule, the speaker can say "Send mail to Bob Marks." However, if the application activates the &lt;Names&gt; rule instead, the user can say "Bob Marks" but cannot say "Send mail to Bob Marks."</P>
<P>Note that a grammar can have several rules activated at one time. For example, if both &lt;Actions&gt; and &lt;Names&gt; are activated, the speaker can say "Send mail to Bob Marks" or "Bob Marks."</P>
<P>The context-free grammar format requires a list of all of the rules that can be activated (called <I>exported rules</I>). Grammar designers should keep this list to a minimum because the efficiency of the grammar — both the processing required and the accuracy of recognition — can be affected by the number of exported rules.</P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
