<H1>Objects</H1><P>Speech-recognition objects provide detailed control of speech recognition. Together these objects serve as a recognition layer for an application, allowing it to use any of the speech-recognition engines available in the system and to recognize input from multimedia wave-in devices or other audio sources. This section describes these objects and lists the interfaces they support.</P>
<P>In addition to the interfaces listed in this section, each object supports the <B>IUnknown </B>interface, which is a common interface supported by all OLE component objects. For more information about <B>IUnknown</B>, see the section, "Common Elements of the Speech Application Programming Interface."</P>
<P>If your application does not require detailed control of speech recognition, you can use voice-command objects to implement command and control. Voice commands use speech-recognition objects, so they also serve as an example of implementing speech recognition. For more information about voice commands, see the section, "Voice Commands."</P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
