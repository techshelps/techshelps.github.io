<H3>Speech-Recognition Enumerator</H3><P>To create a speech-recognition enumerator, an application calls the <B>CoCreateInstance</B> function with the CLSID_SREnumerator class identifier and the IID_ISRFind interface identifier. This creates a speech-recognition enumeration object with an <B>ISRFind</B> interface that the application can use to find an engine.</P>
<P>After creating the speech-recognition enumerator and getting the address of its <B>ISRFind</B> interface, the application fills an <B>SRMODEINFO</B> structure with values that indicate the kind of engine the application is looking for, such as the language, the dialect, the engine features needed, the engine name, and so on. Any members of the <B>SRMODEINFO</B> structure that are not relevant to the application can be set to NULL. The application then calls the <B>ISRFind::Find</B> member function. </P>
<P>The <B>Find</B> member function, if it succeeds, fills a second <B>SRMODEINFO</B> structure with information about the closest matching speech-recognition mode available. Because this is only the closest match, the application should check the mode to see if it is acceptable. If not, the application can enumerate all of the engines to try again to find an acceptable mode (described in the next section), or the application can fail.</P>
<P>An application can rank certain characteristics more or less important than the engine's default rankings by filling an <B>SRMODEINFORANK</B> structure that indicates the priority of each member of the <B>SRMODEINFO</B> structure. The application specifies the address of the <B>SRMODEINFORANK</B> structure along with the <B>SRMODEINFO</B> structures when calling the <B>Find</B> member function. </P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
