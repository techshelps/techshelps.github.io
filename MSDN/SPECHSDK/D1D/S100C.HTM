<h2>Types of Grammars</H2><P>An application can perform speech-recognition by using three different kinds of grammars: <I>context-free</I>, <I>dictation</I>, and <I>limited domain</I>. Each grammar uses a different strategy for narrowing the set of sentences it will recognize:</P>
<P> <FONT FACE="Symbol">·</FONT>    <B>Context-free grammar</B>.  Uses rules that predict the next words that might possibly follow the word just spoken, reducing the number of candidates to evaluate in order to recognize the next word. </P>
<P> <FONT FACE="Symbol">·</FONT>    <B>Dictation grammar</B>.  Defines a context for the speaker by identifying the subject of the dictation, the expected style of language, and what dictation has already been done.</P>
<P> <FONT FACE="Symbol">·</FONT>    <B>Limited-domain grammar</B>.  Does not provide strict syntax structures, but does provide a set of words to recognize. Limited-domain grammar is a hybrid between a context-free grammar and a full dictation grammar. </P>
<P></P>
<P>The approach used by a speech-recognition engine to accept verbal input influences the approach used by the grammar to recognize a phrase. A speech-recognition engine accepts verbal input using one of the following technologies: </P>
<P> <FONT FACE="Symbol">·</FONT>    <B>Discrete speech</B>.  Each word must be isolated by pauses before and after the word.</P>
<P> <FONT FACE="Symbol">·</FONT>    <B>Word spotting</B>.  Only certain words are recognized in an utterance.</P>
<P> <FONT FACE="Symbol">·</FONT>    <B>Continuous speech</B>.  Given a continuous utterance with no pauses between words, the engine can recognize the words that were spoken.</P>
<P></P>
<P>Each of these technologies can influence how the grammar recognizes a phrase in the following ways:</P>
