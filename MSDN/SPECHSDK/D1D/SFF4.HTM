<h2>ISRResScore::GetWordScores</H2><P></P>
<P>HRESULT GetWordScores(DWORD dwRank, long *palScore,</P>
<P>    DWORD dwWordScoreSize, DWORD *pdwWordScoreRequired);</P>
<P></P>
<P>Returns the score of the recognized phrase or alternative phrases. An application can get the text string for the alternatives by using ISRResBasic.</P>
<P> <FONT FACE="Symbol">·</FONT>    Returns NOERROR if successful, or one of these error values:</P>
<P>E_INVALIDARG<BR>E_OUTOFMEMORY <BR>SRERR_NOTSUPPORTED</P>
<P></P>
<P><I>dwRank</I></P>
<P>[in] Rank of the score. 0 is the final recognition result, 1 is the second best, and so on. If this exceeds the total number of alternatives in the results object then an error is returned.</P>
<P></P>
<P><I>palScore</I></P>
<P>[out] This points to an array of longs. The array is filled in with the scores for individual words in the recognition results, starting at the beginning. Each score is filled in with a score from -100 to 100. Because of the inaccuracy of speech technology exact meanings for the scores are impossible. -100 is definitely a rejection. 0 is on the border between recognized and unrecognized. 100 is a very positive and strong recognition.</P>
<P></P>
<P><I>dwWordScoreSize</I></P>
<P>[in] Number of bytes in the memory pointed to by palScore. If the buffer is not large enough then GetWordScores returns S_FALSE and returns the required amount of space in the location pointed to by pdwWordScoreRequired.</P>
<P></P>
<P><I>pdwWordScoreRequired</I></P>
<P>[out] Filled in either with the number of bytes copied to palScore, or with the number of bytes required to copy the data if S_FALSE is returned.</P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
