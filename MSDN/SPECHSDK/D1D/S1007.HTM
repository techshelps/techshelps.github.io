<P></P>
<P>Provides information about a phoneme node in a recognition/alternative graph generated by a speech-recognition engine.</P>
<P></P>
<P><B>dwNextPhonemeNode</B></P>
<P>Number of the node that follows next in time. If the next node has several alternatives, this pointer should continue along the path that produces the highest path score at the final node. If there is nothing left in the path, this can be NULL.</P>
<P></P>
<P><B>dwUpAlternatePhonemeNode</B></P>
<P>Number of an alternative node with a higher score than that of the phoneme in this node. The alternative nodes should be ordered according to the highest score for the phoneme. If there are no more alternatives, this can be NULL.</P>
<P></P>
<P><B>dwDownAlternatePhonemeNode</B></P>
<P>Number of an alternative node with a lower score than that of the phoneme in this node. The alternative nodes should be ordered according to the highest score for the phoneme. If there are no more alternatives, this can be NULL.</P>
<P></P>
<P><B>dwPreviousPhonemeNode</B></P>
<P>Number of the previous node. If there are several previous nodes, this maps back along the highest path score at the final node. If there is nothing before this in the path, this can be NULL.</P>
<P></P>
<P><B>dwWordNode</B></P>
<P>Node number of the word node to which this phoneme most likely belongs. If this phoneme is spurious and doesn't belong to a word node, this is NULL.</P>
<P></P>
<P><B>qwStartTime</B></P>
<P>Time stamp, in bytes, when the audio for this node started. If the value is indeterminate, this is zero.</P>
<P></P>
<P><B>qwEndTime</B></P>
<P>Time stamp, in bytes, when the audio for this node ended. If the value is indeterminate, this is zero.</P>
<P></P>
<P><B>dwPhonemeScore</B></P>
<P>Score for this individual phoneme. It is valid to compare this score only against the scores of this phoneme's alternatives. Engines should make this value a linear probability if possible. If an engine has no information about the value, this is zero.</P>
<P></P>
<P><B>wVolume</B></P>
<P>Linear volume level of the phoneme, from 1 to 0xFFFF. If the engine has no information about the volume, this should be zero. An application can use this information to determine emphasis or sentence type (for example, question or command) or to do transplanted prosody.</P>
<P></P>
<P><B>wPitch</B></P>
<P>Average pitch of the phoneme, in hertz. Engines that do not know this value set it to zero. Obviously, unvoiced sounds have no pitch. Applications can use this information to determine emphasis or sentence type (for example, question or command) or to do transplanted prosody.</P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
