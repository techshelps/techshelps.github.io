<H3>Automatic Linking</H3><P>Some engines support automatic linking between grammars. When grammars are linked, one grammar indicates that it imports a rule from another grammar and identifies the rule name by a string. If an application loads another grammar that exports a rule of that name, the first grammar borrows that rule and all of the vocabulary referenced by the rule from the second grammar, even if the second grammar is not activated. In the case of a conflict, the first grammar links to the grammar that has been loaded the longest.</P>
<P>For example, a grammar that allows the speaker to say "Set the time to &lt;Time&gt;" might list &lt;Time&gt; as an <I>imported rule</I>. A second grammar might have a &lt;Time&gt; rule that provides the vocabulary and syntax for recognizing the time. As soon as the second grammar is loaded, the first grammar would automatically link its &lt;Time&gt; rule to the second grammar's &lt;Time&gt; rule.</P>
<P>Automatic linking allows third parties to develop improved or shared grammars for commonly used syntaxes, such as numbers, dates, and times. If a third party wishes to keep the grammar format secret, the grammar can be compiled into the custom formats of each engine that is supported, rather than shipping the grammar in a standard format.</P>
<P>Automatic linking should be used with care because name conflicts can occur or grammars can change invisibly to the application. If an imported rule cannot be linked, the original grammar should still work even though portions of it may be inaccessible. In addition, IDs of words that originate from different grammars will be invalid because the application won't be able to identify which grammar provided the word.</P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
