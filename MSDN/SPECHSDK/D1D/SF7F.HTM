<H3>Interacts with</H3><P>The application enumerates the available engine/audio-source pairs by calling member functions of the <B>IEnumSRShare</B> interface on the speech-recognition sharing object. These member functions return addresses of <B>SRSHARE</B> structures with information about each pair, including its instance identifier.</P>
<P>To select an existing pair, the application calls the <B>IEnumSRShare::Share</B> member function with the instance identifier of the desired pair.</P>
<P>To create a new pair, the application calls the <B>IEnumSRShare::New</B> member function with the GUID of a speech-recognition mode and the device identifier of an audio source that is not currently in use.</P>
<P>Both <B>Share</B> and <B>New</B> return addresses of the <B>ISRCentral</B> interface on the engine of the pair. After obtaining this interface, the application interacts with the engine as though it had connected directly with it and can release the speech-recognition sharing object.</P>
<P>When a speech-recognition sharing object is used to share an audio source among several engines, the object provides exclusive rights to the source to one engine at a time on a first-come, first-served basis. An engine requests the audio source by calling the <B>IAudio::Start </B>member function. If more than one engine requests the audio source at a time, the first engine to call <B>IAudio::Start</B> is awarded exclusive use of the source until that engine calls <B>IAudio::Stop</B>.</P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
