<h2>ISRGramCFG::ListGet</H2><P></P>
<P>HRESULT ListGet(TCHAR *pszListName, PSDATA pdWord);</P>
<P></P>
<P>Retrieves the list of words that the engine is currently using.</P>
<P> <FONT FACE="Symbol">·</FONT>    Returns NOERROR if successful, or one of these error values:</P>
<P>E_INVALIDARG<BR>E_OUTOFMEMORY<BR>SRERR_INVALIDLIST<BR>SRERR_NOTSUPPORTED</P>
<P></P>
<P><I>pszListName</I></P>
<P>[in] Address of a buffer that contains the name of the list.</P>
<P><I>pdWord</I></P>
<P>[out] Address of an <B>SDATA</B> structure that receives information about the list. The <B>dwSize</B> member of the structure receives the number of bytes needed for the list information and the <B>pData</B> member receives the address of a memory object that contains a sequential list of <B>SRWORD</B> structures, one for each word in the list. (This is not an array, because the size of each structure varies with its contents.) It is not necessary to explicitly terminate the list; it is terminated implicitly because no more <B>SRWORD</B> structures fit in the specified amount of memory.</P>
<P></P>
<P>The application allocates the <B>SDATA</B> structure and passes its address to the <B>ListGet </B>member function. <B>ListGet</B> allocates memory (by using the OLE task allocator) for the returned data and sets the <B>pData</B> member of the <B>SDATA</B> structure to point to the memory. If the allocation fails, the <B>pData</B> member is set to NULL and the <B>dwSize</B> member is set to zero. The application must free the memory pointed to by <B>pData</B>, as well as the <B>SDATA</B> structure itself.</P>
<P>This member function allocates memory and fills in a list of words. If a list has not been set or is empty, the memory will be empty and the member function returns SRERR_INVALIDLIST.</P>
<P>If the engine does not support lists, it should return SRERR_NOTSUPPORTED.</P>
<P>The application must free the memory allocated by the member function by using the <B>CoTaskMemAlloc</B> and <B>CoTaskMemFree</B> functions.</P>
