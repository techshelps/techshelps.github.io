<h2>ISRCentral::Pause</H2><P></P>
<P>HRESULT Pause(void);</P>
<P></P>
<P>Pauses the speech-recognition engine, incrementing the pause count. The application must call the <B>Resume</B> member function after each call to the <B>Pause</B> member function.</P>
<P>Retrieves information specific to the current speech-recognition mode.</P>
<P> <FONT FACE="Symbol">·</FONT>    Returns NOERROR if successful, or E_OUTOFMEMORY if a low-memory condition occurs. </P>
<P></P>
<P>Pausing an engine prevents it from processing future phrases but not from identifying the beginning and ending of utterances. </P>
<P>Calling this function during an utterance pauses the processing of digital audio. This function affects the notifications received through the <B>ISRGramNotifySink</B> interface, and may affect notifications received through the <B>ISRNotifySink::VUMeter</B> member function. </P>
<P>The <B>Pause</B> member function may be called at different times by different applications that share the same engine, or it may be called automatically when a <B>PhraseFinish</B> notification is sent. For this reason, the <B>Pause</B> function maintains a pause count that is incremented any time the function is called. The engine starts with a pause count of 0.</P>
<P>If an engine is paused more than a second on a real-time audio stream, it may start losing information from the audio source because internal buffers aren't large enough to accumulate that much audio.</P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
