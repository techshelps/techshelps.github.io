<H3>Information Chunks in Limited-Domain Grammars</H3><P>The limited-domain grammar uses the general grammar data-format described earlier in this appendix. It supports the following information chunks: </P>
<P> <FONT FACE="Symbol">·</FONT>    SRCKLD_WORDS</P>
<P> <FONT FACE="Symbol">·</FONT>    SRCKLD_GROUP</P>
<P> <FONT FACE="Symbol">·</FONT>    SRCKLD_SAMPLE</P>
<P></P>
<P>The grammar must contain at least one SRCKLD_WORDS chunk; the SRCKLD_GROUP and SRCKLD_SAMPLE chunks are optional, and the grammar can contain more than one of each.</P>
<H4><A NAME="sec0"></A>Words (SRCKLD_WORDS)</H4><P>This chunk contains a list of words that the engine will recognize, stored as a sequential list of null-terminated word strings. For example: </P>
<P>"Automobile\0Franchise\0Repair\0Muffler\0Drive Shaft" </P>
<P></P>
<P>(The last '\0' is implicit in C notation.)</P>
<P>This list does not have to include words from the closed set of the language, which contains the most common words that are not nouns, verb, or adjectives, because these words are supplied by the engine. The closed set of a language is usually fewer than two thousand words. The closed set of the English language includes words such as "the," "and," "to," and "me."</P>
<H4><A NAME="sec1"></A>Word Groups (SRCKLD_GROUP)</H4><P>This chunk contains the same information as the SRCKLD_WORDS chunk, except the words are also related in some way. For example: </P>
<P>"New York City\0Boston\0Los Angeles\0Chicago\0Seattle" </P>
<P></P>
<P>(The last '\0' is implicit in C notation.)</P>
<H4><A NAME="sec2"></A>Sample Text (SRCKLD_SAMPLE)</H4><P>This chunk contains sample text, stored as a single null-terminated string. The sample text might be from a document written by the speaker or a document similar to the one that the speaker will dictate. It allows the engine to identify a topic, common words, and authoring style. The text can be any length, although most sample text will only be a few pages long (not enough to form the basis for a language model).</P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
