<P>The engine object receives notifications from the audio-source object about the status of incoming audio, such as whether audio data is available.</P>
<P>The engine object can notify the application of events that pertain to speech recognition, such as interference in the audio signal or the beginning and end of an utterance. To receive notifications, the application calls the <B>ISRCentral::Register</B> member function on the engine object and passes the address of the notification interface. The application must create a COM object that supports <B>ISRNotifySink</B> as an interface. How the application responds to notifications is up to the application developer.</P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
