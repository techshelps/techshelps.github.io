<h2>Sample Uses for Speech Technologies </H2><P>It's impossible to say, "Thou shalt use speech to do XXX." Not only is every application different, but speech technology is so new that application writers haven't had much experience with it. As a general rule, use speech when it provides significant advantages to users, not just for the "Wow!" effect. Try to find uses that make the application easier to use, or allow users to access features more quickly than with the keyboard or mouse. In the case of games, use speech to add realism to the interaction with characters, making the game more involving and fun.</P>
<P>Telephony applications benefit most from speech recognition and text-to-speech because their sole means of communicating with users is through the telephone audio. Text-to-speech is not only easier to use than manually recording all of the prompts, but it also enables new features that allow arbitrary text to be read, such as names, addresses, and e-mail. Speech recognition is a great substitute for touch-tone menus not only because it's more natural and flexible, but also because many users don't have touch-tone phones. Several engine vendors have phone numbers you can call for a demonstration of telephony applications.</P>
<P>Games, especially adventure games, are the next beneficiaries of speech. Any game in which the user "talks" with characters will enjoy the fruits of speech. Speech recognition allows users to really talk to the characters, which is a lot more fun than typing in a response. Rather than just printing out what characters "speak," use text-to-speech to really make them speak. Not only does this increase the realism of the game, but it allows users to take their hands off the keyboard, sit back in their chairs, and enjoy the game.</P>
<P>Multimedia titles can use concatenated text-to-speech for recording audio passages, treating it like improved audio compression. They can also incorporate speech recognition so that users can sit back and relax, just as they can with games.</P>
<P>Of course, there are other applications that can use speech. For example, some applications use speech because they require that the user's hands be free for other things, or because the user can't see the screen.</P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
