<h2>How to Implement Using the Low-Level Interfaces </H2><P>Of course, not everyone is satisfied by the high-level speech interfaces because they don't always supply enough flexibility, sacrificing some flexibility and control for ease of implementation. Therefore, the API also has lower-level interfaces and objects that require a bit more work but which provide a lot more control over the speech recognition and text-to-speech processes. The high-level modules (voice commands and voice text) actually use these same low-level interfaces and objects to do speech recognition.</P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
