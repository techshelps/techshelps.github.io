<H1>Why Should I Use Speech in My Application?</H1><P>Whenever I mention speech recognition or text-to-speech, people instantly think of the computer on "Star Trek." The computer's synthesized voice sounds exactly like a human voice. The speech recognition is even better. It never listens in on conversations between people, and when given a command, the computer never makes a mistake. It's great. If computers had perfect speech recognition and text-to-speech like that today, everyone would be talking to computers. Unfortunately, it will be decades before speech technology is that good.</P>
<P>Even though speech technology isn't perfect, it's still useful to applications. Unfortunately, because some people expect more from speech recognition and text-to-speech than what the technology can deliver, they dismiss the technology outright. I will describe some reasonable expectations for speech technology and show you what you can accomplish with its current capabilities.</P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
