<h2>So what does this have to do with speech recognition and text-to-speech?</H2><P>Even though computer videos are significantly inferior to movies, many applications benefit from computer video technology, especially games and multimedia titles. Videos are so necessary to some applications that they wouldn't be able to function without them--even though computer videos are light years away from a real movie.</P>
<P>Speech recognition and text-to-speech are new technologies, just like computer videos. Although speech technologies aren't nearly as good as those on "Star Trek," many applications can get good use out of them.</P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
