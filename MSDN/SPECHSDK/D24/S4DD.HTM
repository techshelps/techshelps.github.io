<H1>Overview of Speech Technologies</H1><P><I>Speech recognition</I> is the ability of a computer to understand the spoken word for the purpose of receiving command and data input from the speaker. <I>Text-to-speech</I> is the ability of a computer to convert text information into synthetic speech output.</P>
<P>Speech recognition and text-to-speech use <I>engines</I>, which are the programs that do the actual work of recognizing speech or playing text. Most speech-recognition engines convert incoming audio data to engine-specific phonemes, which are then translated into text that an application can use. (A <I>phoneme</I> is the smallest structural unit of sound that can be used to distinguish one utterance from another in a spoken language.) A text-to-speech engine performs the same process, in reverse. Engines are supplied by vendors that specialize in speech software; they may be bundled with new audio-enabled computers and sound cards, purchased separately, or licensed from the vendor.</P>
<P>The speech-recognition engine transcribes audio data received from an <I>audio source</I>, such as a microphone or a telephone line. The text-to-speech engine converts text to audio data, which is sent to an <I>audio destination</I>, such as a speaker, a headphone, or a telephone line. Under some circumstances, an engine may be able to transcribe audio data to or from a file.</P>
<P>An engine typically provides more than one <I>mode</I> for recognizing speech or playing text. For example, a speech-recognition engine will have a mode for each language or dialect that it can recognize. Likewise, a text-to-speech engine will have a mode for each <I>voice</I>, which plays text in a different speaking style or personality. Other modes may be optimized for a particular audio sampling rate, such as 8 kilohertz (kHz) for use over a telephone line.</P>
<P>Speech recognition can be as simple as a predefined set of <I>voice commands</I> that an application can recognize. More complex speech recognition involves the use of a <I>grammar</I>, which defines a set of words and phrases that can be recognized. A grammar may use <I>rules</I> to predict the most likely words to follow the word just spoken, or it may define a <I>context</I> that identifies the subject of dictation and the expected style of language. </P>
<P>Both speech-recognition and text-to-speech engines may make use of a <I>pronunciation lexicon</I>, which is a database of correct pronunciations for words and phrases to be recognized or played. </P>
<P>An engine's approach to recognizing speech or playing text determines the quality of speech in an application — that is, the accuracy of recognition or clarity of playback — and the amount of effort required from the user to get good accuracy or clarity. The engine's approach also affects the processor speed and memory required by an application; it may also influence the application's features or the design of its user interface. </P>
<P>This section provides an overview of speech technology. An understanding of both speech recognition and text-to-speech will help you decide how to best incorporate speech in your application and how to choose a technology that supports what you want to do.</P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
