<H3>Objects</H3><P>Four objects are involved in speech recognition:</P>
<P>Voice-command object. This is the central control point for the voice-command module. Most applications will use only this as a means to create Voice-menu objects or Voice-menu enumerators.</P>
<P>Notification sink. The notification sink code is supplied by the application. The voice-command object calls methods in this object both when commands are spoken and for VU-level updates. It is up to the application to act upon the notifications.</P>
<P>Voice menu. The Voice-menu object provides most of the controls for speech recognition and is similar to a Windows-menu object accessed with an HMENU. The object allows commands to be added or removed from the menu and to have speech recognition activated (and listening) or deactivated.</P>
<P>Voice-menu enumerator. Applications use the enumerator to obtain the list of Voice menus that are stored in the internal database and to determine which of these menus are active. Most applications will not use the Voice-menu enumerator. </P>
<P>For more information look in the "Voice Commands" section.</P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
