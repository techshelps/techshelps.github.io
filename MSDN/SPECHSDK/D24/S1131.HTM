<H3>Typical Speech Recognizers on the Market</H3><P>Three types of speech recognizers are common on the market today:</P>
<P> <FONT FACE="Symbol">·</FONT>    <B>Command and Control</B>.  The engine allows users to give simple commands, like "Minimize Window" or "Send mail to Fred" to the computer. It also allows for limited data entry such as numbers. Command and Control engines are continuous speech, speaker independent, sub-word modeling, and use a small vocabulary. To find more about what you can do with these recognizers look in the "Voice Commands" section.</P>
<P> <FONT FACE="Symbol">·</FONT>    <B>Discrete Dictation</B>.  The engine allows users to speak in arbitrary text so long as the user leaves pauses between words, providing text entry rates of up to 50 words per minute. Discrete dictation engines are discrete speech, speaker adaptive, sub-word modeling, and use a large vocabulary. To find more about what you can do with these recognizers look in the "Dictation" section.</P>
<P> <FONT FACE="Symbol">·</FONT>    <B>Continuous Dictation</B>.  The engine allows users to speak in arbitrary text using continuous speech, providing text entry rates of up to 120 words per minute. Continuous Dictation engines are continuous speech, speaker dependent, sub-word modeling, and use a large vocabulary.
