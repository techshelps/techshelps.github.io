<h2>Voice Commands</H2><P>The voice-command interface is the high-level interface for speech recognition. It is designed to provide command and control speech recognition for applications. With this interface, a user gives the computer simple commands, such as "Open the file," and can answer simple yes/no questions. Command and Control does not allow speech dictation; developers wishing to implement dictation in applications need to use the low-level API.</P>
<P>The voice-command design mimics a Windows menu in behavior, providing a "menu" of commands that users can speak. Basically, to use voice commands, an application designs a Voice menu that corresponds to a window or state within the application. Most programs will have one Voice menu for the main window and one for every dialog box. Contained within every Voice menu is a list of voice commands that users can say. When they say one, the application is notified which command was spoken. "Open a file" and "Send mail to &lt;e-mail name&gt;" are typical voice commands. Each voice command has information in addition to the spoken command, such as a description string and a command ID.</P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
