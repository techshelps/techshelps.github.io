<H3>Vocabulary Size</H3><P>Speech-recognition engines typically support several different sizes of vocabulary. Vocabulary size does not represent the total number of words that a given engine can recognize. Instead, it determines the number of words that the engine can recognize accurately in a given state, which is defined by the word or words that were spoken before the current point in time. For example, if an engine is listening for "Tell me the time," "Tell me the day," and "What year is it?" and the user has already said "tell," "me," and "the," the current state has these two words: "time" and "day."</P>
<P>Speech-recognition engines support these vocabulary sizes:</P>
<P> <FONT FACE="Symbol">·</FONT>    <B>Small vocabulary</B>.  The engine can accurately recognize about 50 different words in a given state. Although many small-vocabulary engines can exceed this number, larger numbers of words significantly reduce the recognition accuracy and increase the computation load. Small-vocabulary engines are acceptable for command and control, but not for dictation.</P>
<P> <FONT FACE="Symbol">·</FONT>    <B>Medium vocabulary</B>.  The engine can accurately recognize about 1000 different words in a given state. Medium-vocabulary engines are good for natural language command and control or data entry.</P>
<P> <FONT FACE="Symbol">·</FONT>    <B>Large vocabulary</B>.  The engine can recognize several thousand words in a given state, perhaps up to 100,000. Large-vocabulary engines require much more computation than small-vocabulary engines, but the large vocabulary is necessary for dictation.</P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
