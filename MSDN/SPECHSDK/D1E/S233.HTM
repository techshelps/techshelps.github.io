<H3>Dialog Boxes</H3><P>A text-to-speech engine provides a set of dialog boxes that enable the user to configure the engine. By using the <B>ITTSDialogs</B> interface provided by a text-to-speech engine object, an application can direct the engine to display one of its dialog boxes. The controls and capabilities in the dialog boxes are determined solely by the engine. An application retrieves the address of the <B>ITTSDialogs</B> interface by calling the <B>IUnknown::QueryInterface</B> member function on the engine object with the IID_ITTSDialogs interface identifier.</P>
<P>When an application calls a member function of the <B>ITTSDialogs</B> interface to display a dialog box, it specifies the handle of the parent window for the dialog box. By specifying NULL instead of a window handle, the application can determine whether the engine supports the given dialog box. The engine returns the NOERROR value if it supports the dialog box or the TTSERR_NOTSUPPORTED error value if it does not. </P>
<P>The application also specifies the title of the dialog box by specifying the address of a title string. If the application specifies NULL instead of a title string address, the engine uses the default title. </P>
<H4><A NAME="sec0"></A>About Dialog Box</H4><P>An engine's About dialog box contains information that identifies the text-to-speech engine and its manufacturer and contains the manufacturer's copyright notice. An application displays the About dialog box by calling the <B>ITTSDialogs::AboutDlg</B> member function.</P>
<H4><A NAME="sec1"></A>General Dialog Box</H4><P>The General dialog box gives the user control of the general features of the text-to-speech engine. An application displays the General dialog box by using the <B>ITTSDialogs::GeneralDlg</B> member function. Depending on the engine, the General dialog box may allow the user to perform the following tasks:</P>
<P> <FONT FACE="Symbol">·</FONT>    Set the maximum amount of disk space that the text-to-speech engine can use. The amount of disk space affects the playing of concatenated wave files.</P>
<P> <FONT FACE="Symbol">·</FONT>    Set the speaker preferences supported by the engine.</P>
<P> <FONT FACE="Symbol">·</FONT>    Provide the user with access to any other dialog boxes provided by the engine. </P>
<P></P>
<H4><A NAME="sec2"></A>Lexicon Dialog Box</H4><P>A text-to-speech engine maintains a database of pronunciations called a <I>pronunciation lexicon</I>, and an engine may allow an application to collect new or corrected pronunciations from the user. The Lexicon dialog box displays the user's pronunciation lexicon and allows the user to edit it. For example, the user can edit the phonetics of mispronounced words and load or unload personal exception dictionaries. An application uses the <B>ITTSDialogs::LexiconDlg</B> member function to display the Lexicon dialog box.</P>
<P>For more information about pronunciation lexicons, see the section, "Common Elements of the Speech Application Programming Interface."</P>
<H4><A NAME="sec3"></A>Translation Dialog Box</H4><P>The <B>ITTSDialogs::TranslateDlg</B> member function causes the engine to display a dialog box that enables the user to control how the engine speaks symbols, currencies, and abbreviations. The user can also control number-translation techniques, such as whether the engine should speak "34" as "thirty-four," "three four," or the old English "four and thirty." </P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
