<H1>Text-to-Speech Control Tags</H1><P>A text-to-speech engine can usually translate individual words to speech successfully. However, as soon as the engine speaks a sentence, the perceived quality of its translation decreases because the engine cannot correctly synthesize human prosody — the inflection, accent, and timing of human speech.</P>
<P>The prosody of translated speech can be improved by using text-to-speech control tags to better simulate human speech. Control tags can be embedded in the source text passed to an engine with the <B>ITTSCentral::TextData</B> member function, or they can be inserted into the text that is currently playing by calling the <B>ITTSCentral::Inject</B> member function. This allows an application to alter prosody of text as it is spoken, without having to reconstruct the text-to-speech buffers. </P>
<P>This appendix describes control tags that you can use to alter the prosody of text translated into speech. All tags are optional except the bookmark (<B>Mrk</B>) tag, which must be supported. </P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
