<H3>Control Tags</H3><P>An application can embed control tags in text buffers. By using control tags, the application provides clues about the text, so the engine can do a better job of speaking it, perhaps even changing the speaking voice. An application can use control tags to perform the following tasks:</P>
<P> <FONT FACE="Symbol">·</FONT>    <B>Change the voice, language, or speaking style</B>.  For example, an application might use a different voice for different data types or conduct a conversation between different voices.</P>
<P> <FONT FACE="Symbol">·</FONT>    <B>Insert bookmarks in text</B>.  Bookmarks notify an application when the audio for the given text has been reached so that the application can switch to a new page in a book, do some animation, or do any other synchronized event.</P>
<P> <FONT FACE="Symbol">·</FONT>    <B>Specify how a sentence should be read</B>.  An application can instruct the engine to read a sentence quickly, with excitement, or in a monotone.</P>
<P>If text contains tags, the application should set the TTSDATAFLAG_TAGGED value when it calls the <B>ITTSCentral::TextData</B> member function to place a buffer in the engine's speaking queue. As an alternative, the application can call the <B>ITTSCentral::Inject</B> member function to insert control tags into text as the engine plays it.</P>
<P>For more information about about text-to-speech control tags, see Appendix A, "Text-to-Speech Control Tags."</P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
