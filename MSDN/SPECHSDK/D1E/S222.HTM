<H1>Overview of Text-to-Speech Objects</H1><P>Text-to-speech objects provide fairly detailed control of text-to-speech. Together, these objects serve as a translation layer for an application, allowing it to use any of the text-to-speech engines available on the system and to send text as audio data to multimedia wave-out devices or other audio destinations. There are the following text-to-speech objects:</P>
<P> <FONT FACE="Symbol">·</FONT>    The <I>engine enumerator</I> enumerates the text-to-speech modes for a particular engine. This object is supplied by the engine vendor.</P>
<P> <FONT FACE="Symbol">·</FONT>    The <I>text-to-speech enumerator</I> enumerates the text-to-speech modes for all engines available to the application. This object is supplied by Microsoft.</P>
<P> <FONT FACE="Symbol">·</FONT>    The <I>engine object</I> provides a text-to-speech mode for the application to use. This object is supplied by the engine vendor.</P>
<P> <FONT FACE="Symbol">·</FONT>    The <I>multimedia audio-destination object</I> represents an audio destination and is based on a multimedia device driver. This object is supplied by Microsoft.</P>
<P></P>
<P>To perform text-to-speech translation, an application needs an engine object to convert the text into speech and a multimedia audio-destination object to play speech output. </P>
<P>The sole purpose of the text-to-speech enumerator and engine enumerator is to locate a text-to-speech mode and create an engine object. As soon as the application has the engines it needs, it can release the objects.</P>
<P>The following illustration shows the sequence in which text-to-speech objects are typically created and gives the instructions used to create them.</P>

<P>After an application has created the objects it needs, it can use them to play text as speech. When the text-to-speech engine receives text from the application, the engine subdivides the text into buffers and processes one buffer at a time.</P>
<P>The following illustration shows how an application interacts with the engine and audio-destination objects to play a buffer of text.</P>
