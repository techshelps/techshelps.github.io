<P></P>
<P>Indicates the mouth position that corresponds to a phoneme.</P>
<P></P>
<P><B>bMouthHeight</B></P>
<P>Height of the mouth or lips. This is a linear range from 0xFF for the maximum possible height for the mouth to 0x00 for the minimum height (that is, the mouth or lips are closed).</P>
<P></P>
<P><B>bMouthWidth</B></P>
<P>Width of the mouth or lips. This is a linear range from 0xFF for the maximum possible width for the face to 0x00 for the minimum width (that is, the mouth or lips are puckered).</P>
<P></P>
<P><B>bMouthUpturn</B></P>
<P>Extent to which the mouth turns up at the corners (that is, how much it smiles). This is a linear range from 0xFF for the maximum upturn (that is, the mouth is fully smiling) to 0x00 if the corners of the mouth turn down. If this member is 0x80, the mouth is neutral.</P>
<P></P>
<P><B>bJawOpen</B></P>
<P>Angle to which the jaw is open. This is a linear range from 0xFF for completely open to 0x00 for completely closed.</P>
<P></P>
<P><B>bTeethUpperVisible</B></P>
<P>Extent to which the upper teeth are visible. This is a linear range from 0xFF for the maximum extent (that is, the upper teeth and gums are completely exposed) to 0x00 for the minimum (the upper teeth are completely hidden). If this member is 0x80, only the teeth are visible. </P>
<P></P>
<P><B>bTeethLowerVisible</B></P>
<P>Extent to which the lower teeth are visible. This is a linear range from 0xFF for the maximum extent (that is, the lower teeth and gums are completely exposed) to 0x00 for the minimum (the lower teeth are completely hidden.) If this member is 0x80, only the teeth are visible.</P>
<P></P>
<P><B>bTonguePosn</B></P>
<P>Tongue position. This a linear range from 0xFF if the tongue is against the upper teeth, to 0x00 if it is relaxed. If this member is 0x80, the tongue is visible.</P>
<P></P>
<P><B>bLipTension</B></P>
<P>Lip tension. This is a linear range from 0xFF if the lips are very tense to 0x00 if they are completely relaxed.</P>
<P></P>
<P><B>TTSMOUTH</B> is passed by the <B>IVTxtNotifySink::Visual</B> and <B>ITTSNotifySink::Visual</B> member functions along with other information about the phoneme. An application can use this information for graphical animation of spoken text.</P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
