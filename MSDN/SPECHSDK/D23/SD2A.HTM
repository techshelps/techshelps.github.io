<H3>Games and Edutainment</H3><P>Text-to-speech is useful in games and edutainment to allow the characters in the application to really "talk" to the user instead of displaying speech baloons. Of course, it's also possible to have recordings of the speech. An application would use text-to-speech instead of recordings in the following cases:</P>
<P> <FONT FACE="Symbol">·</FONT>    It's always possible to use concatenated word/phrase text-to-speech to replace recordings since it really just uses recordings of phrases or words. The application designer could easily have recordings of whole sentences played by the text-to-speech engine when a specific sentence string is passed in. If the application did this, it could easily used synthesized text-to-speech instead.</P>
<P>Synthesized text-to-speech inevitably sounds unnatural and wierd. However, it's very good for character voices that are supposed to be robots, aliens, or maybe even foreigners.</P>
<P>Of course, if the application cannot afford to have recordings of all the possible dialogs or if the dialogs cannot be recorded ahead of time then text-to-speech is the only alternative.</P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
