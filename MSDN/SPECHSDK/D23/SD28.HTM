<H1>What is Text-to-Speech?</H1><P>Text-to-speech is a process through which text is rendered into digital audio and "spoken." Most text-to-speech engines can be categorized by the method that they use to translate phonemes into audible sound. </P>
<P><B>Concatenated Word</B>. Although Concatenated Word systems are really synthesizers, the are one of the most commonly used text-to-speech systems around. In a concatenated word engine, the application designer provides recordings for phrases and individual words. The engine pastes the recordings together to speak out a sentence or phrase. If you use voice-mail then you've heard one of these engines speaking, "[You have] [three] [new messages]." The engine has recordings for "You have", all of the digits, and "new messages".</P>
<P><B>Synthesis</B>. A text-to-speech engine that uses synthesis generates sounds like those created by the human vocal cords and applies various filters to simulate throat length, mouth cavity, lip shape, and tongue position. The voice produced by current synthesis technology tends to sound less human than a voice produced by diphone concatenation, but it is possible to obtain different qualities of voice by changing a few parameters.</P>
<P><B>Diphone Concatenation</B>. A text-to-speech engine that uses diphone concatenation links short digital-audio segments together and performs intersegment smoothing to produce a continuous sound. Each diphone consists of two phonemes, one that leads into the sound and one that finishes the sound. For example, the word "hello" consists of these phonemes: <I>h eh l œ</I>. The corresponding diphones are <I>silence-h h-eh eh-l l-œ œ-silence</I>. </P>
<P>Diphones are acquired by recording many hours of a human voice and painstakingly identifying the beginning and ending of phonemes. Although this technique can produce a more realistic voice, it takes a considerable amount of work to create a new voice and the voice is not localizable because the phonemes are specific to the speaker's language.</P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
