<h2>Voice-Text Site</H2><P>A text-to-speech engine plays voice text through a voice-text site on the user's machine. A <I>voice-text site</I> consists of an audio-output device, such as the computer speaker or a telephone line, and a text-to-speech mode. An engine typically provides several different modes for playing speech, each representing a different voice. Each <I>voice</I> plays text in a different speaking style or personality. </P>
<P>An application must create a separate voice-text object for each site that it needs to use. To use a site other than the default (the computer speaker and the default mode of the engine), the application must obtain the identifier of the desired audio-output device and the globally unique identifier (GUID) of the desired mode, and then pass that information to the voice-text object when registering. </P>
<P>An application uses the <B>waveOutGetNumDevs</B> and <B>waveOutGetDevCaps</B> multimedia functions to obtain the device identifier of an audio-output device. To determine the available text-to-speech modes, an application creates a text-to-speech enumerator. The enumerator returns information about the modes provided by all engines in the user's computer, including the GUID of each mode. </P>
<P>For more information about multimedia and multimedia functions, see the documentation included with the Microsoft Win32 Software Development Kit (SDK). For information about enumerating the modes of a text-to-speech engine, see the section, "Low-Level Text-to-Speech API." </P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
