<H3>Creating and Localizing Text-to-Speech Voices</H3><P>Creating a new voice for an engine that uses synthesis can be done relatively quickly by altering a few parameters of an existing voice. However, although the pitch and timbre of the new voice is different, it uses the same speaking style and prosody rules as the existing voice. </P>
<P>Creating a new voice for a text-to-speech engine that uses diphone concatenation can take a considerable amount of work, because the diphones must be acquired by recording a human voice and identifying the beginning and ending of phonemes, which are specific to the speaker's language.</P>
<P>Whether a text-to-speech engine uses synthesis or diphone concatenation, localizing an engine for a new language requires a skilled linguist to design pronunciation and prosody rules and reprogram the engine to simulate the sound of the language's phonemes. In addition, diphone-concatenation systems require a new voice to be constructed for the new language. As a consequence, most engines support only five to ten major languages.</P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
