<h2>Where the Engine Comes From</H2><P>Of course, for text-to-speech to work on an end user's PC the system must have a text-to-speech engine installed on it. The application has two choices:</P>
<P>The application can come bundled with a text-to-speech engine and install it itself. This guarantees that text-to-speech will be installed and also guarantees a certain level of quality from the text-to-speech. However, if an application does this, royalties will need to be paid to the engine vendor.</P>
<P>Alternatively, an application can assume that the text-to-speech engine is already on the PC or that the user will purchase one if they wish to use text-to-speech. The user may already have text-to-speech because many PCs and sound cards will come bundled with an engine. Alternatively, the user may have purchased another application that included an engine. If the user has no text-to-speech engine installed then the application can tell the user that they need to purchase a text-to-speech engine and install it; Several engine vendors offer retail versions of their engines.</P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
