<h2>Engine Dialog Boxes</H2><P>A text-to-speech engine provides a set of dialog boxes that enable the user to configure the engine. By using the <B>IVTxtDialogs</B> interface provided by the voice-text object, an application can direct the engine to display its dialog boxes. The controls and capabilities of the dialog boxes are determined solely by the engine. Before an application can call any <B>IVTxtDialogs</B> member function, it must first register with the engine by calling the <B>IVoiceText::Register</B> member function.</P>
<P>When an application calls a member function of the <B>IVTxtDialogs</B> interface to display a dialog box, it specifies the handle of the parent window for the dialog box. By specifying NULL instead of a window handle, the application can determine whether the engine supports the given dialog box. The engine returns the NOERROR value if it supports the dialog box or the VTXTERR_NOTSUPPORTED error value if it does not. The application also specifies the title of the dialog box by specifying the address of a title string. If the application specifies NULL instead of a title string address, the engine uses the default title. </P>
<P>If a voice-navigation application such as Microsoft Voice is running, an application does not need to direct an engine to display its dialog boxes because the voice-navigation application gives the user access to them. For more information about voice-navigation applications, see the section, "Common Elements of the Speech Application Programming Interface.".</P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
