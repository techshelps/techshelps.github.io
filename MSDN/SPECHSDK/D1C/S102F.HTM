<P>Multimedia Audio Objects </P>
<H1>About Multimedia Audio Objects</H1><P>Most application developers who incorporate speech recognition or text-to-speech features in their applications want the speech engine to obtain speech input from, or send speech output to, a multimedia wave device. Microsoft provides a pair of component objects, called the <I>multimedia audio-source object</I> and the <I>multimedia audio-destination object</I>, that an application can use to create audio-source and audio-destination objects that give the engine access to the multimedia wave-in and wave-out devices. </P>
<P>To use a multimedia audio object, an application must create an instance of the object and then pass the address of the object's <B>IUnknown</B> interface to the engine. For information about how to create a multimedia audio-source object for use in a speech-recognition application, see the section, "Low-Level Speech Recognition API." For information about how to create a multimedia audio-destination object for use in a text-to-speech application, see the section, "Low-Level Text-to-Speech API." </P>
<P>If your application needs to use an audio source or destination other than a multimedia wave device, you must either write a custom audio object that gives the engine access to that source or destination or use a custom audio object provided by a third-party vendor. A custom audio object must support the <B>IAudio</B> and <B>IAudioSource</B> interfaces.</P>
<P>This section contains reference information about the interfaces and member functions that the multimedia audio objects support. Because the interfaces are intended to be called by an engine rather than an application, the information in this section is intended primarily for engine developers rather than application developers. This information is also intended for developers who need to write a custom audio object. For more information about developing speech engines, see Appendix G, "Developing a Speech Engine."</P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
