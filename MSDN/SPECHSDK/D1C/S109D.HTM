<H1>Writing an Audio Source/Destination Object</H1><P>Applications can write their own audio source or destination objects to rout the audio as they desire. Some typical uses might be:</P>
<P><B>Speech Recognition Accuracy Test</B>. Write an audio source that gets its audio from a wave file.</P>
<P><B>Speech Recognition Over the Network</B>. The audio source gets audio from a network pipe rather than a wave device.</P>
<P><B>Cache Text-to-Speech Output</B>. Write an audio destination that writes its audio to a wave file so that the application can save processing on text-to-speech phrases it speaks a lot.</P>
<P><B>DirectSound Output</B>. Write an audio destination object that send its audio to the DirectSound driver rather than the wave device.</P>
<P><B>Echo, Chorus, and other Effects</B>. The audio destination object does some digital effects on the audio before passing it down to another audio destination object.</P>
<P><B>Text-to-Speech Over the Network</B>. Pipe the audio from the audio destination through a network pipe to another computer.</P>
<P><B>Get notified ahead of time</B>. If some of the timing notifications come right when the text-to-speech audio is being played then the animation will always lag behind the audio. An application can write an audio destination object that passes all of the data down to another audio destination object except that it re-maps bookmarks so they happen a bit sooner than the text-to-speech engine thinks.</P>
<P>Writing an audio source or destination object is straight forward. Look on the speech SDK for a sample.</P>
