<h2>Detect the User's Experience Level</H2><P>If possible, an application should determine the user's experience with the system. If the user logs on the application can keep statistics about individual him/her over several sessions. Alternatively, the system can notice if the user is having difficulty maneuvering through prompts or is whizzing through them. As an application determines the user's experience level it can:</P>
<P>Shorten or elongate prompts depending upon the user's experience.</P>
<P>Emphasize DTMF if the user is having problems with speech recognition.</P>
<P>Provide more or less help.</P>
<P>Send the user to a real operator if they're having a lot of difficulty.</P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
