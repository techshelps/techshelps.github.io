<h2>Verification and Undo</H2><P>Because speech recognition makes mistakes its important for the application to verify the data with the user. The level of verification can vary. An application might explicitly ask if it heard a response correctly if a misrecognition would cause the user significant problems.</P>
<P>If a misrecognition would only cause minor problems the application should mention the recognition result in passing and allow the user to go back and correct the response. For example, if after asking the time the movie application asked what theater, it could phrase the theater question to include the time. "Where do you want to see the movie, 2001, this evening?"</P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
