<h2>Telephony Users Often Have Different Motivations</H2><P>A typical PC users has experience using the computer and the software. They either have personally purchased the software or need to use it to get their job done.</P>
<P>Many telephony applications (like those that provide movie listings) are used by people that have completely different motivations than PC users. Telephony users don't want to talk to a computer; They want to talk to a human to get their task completed. The telephony application is merely a substitute for the real thing, and almost always inferior to the human. However, it's an annoyance they have to live with. Because of this telephony users are less forgiving of poor user interface design and are quick to hang up.</P>
<P>Furthermore, telephony users are a more diverse population. They are from all age groups and education levels. Many of them don't even know that they're talking to a computer and just think it' a very dense operator on the other side of the phone. Telephony applications using speech recognition get better "accuracy" if the users know that they're talking to a computer because the users will adjust their speaking style.</P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
