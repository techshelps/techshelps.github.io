<h2>Design the Application for Speech Recognition</H2><P>Many applications try to use speech recognition by altering the menus and structure only slightly. Rather than telling the user, "To transfer money press one, to open an account press two, etc.." they say, "To transfer money press or say one, etc." While this makes the addition of speech recognition easy it does not take full advantage of it.</P>
<P>An application using speech recognition should be designed from the start to use speech recognition as a primary input device. DTMF should be available, but only as a back-off for those few users that cannot get speech recognition to work.</P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
