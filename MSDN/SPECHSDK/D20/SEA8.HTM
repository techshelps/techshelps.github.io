<P>Voice Telephony</P>
<H1>What is Telephony?</H1><P>Telephony applications are applications that are accessed via the telephone rather than locally over the PC. A GUI application may also support telephony features although the user interface deign for the two interaction mechanisms are significantly different. Many GUI applications support telephony because of the flexibility that a long-distance connection to the PC provides.</P>
<P>Here are some typical telephony applications:</P>
<P><B>Voice Mail or Answering Machine Software</B>. Most users are familiar with "Voice mail" or computerized answering machine software. These pieces of software allow users to call into a computer and access audio messages that have been left for them. Voice-mail and answering machine software programs are often extended to E-mail, address books, and other types of data.</P>
<P><B>Accessing Databases</B>. Large numbers of telephony applications allow users to access databases such as movie listings, stock quotes, or news.</P>
<P><B>Call Routing</B>. Many of the same telephony applications that provide voice-mail or database access also allows incoming calls to be routed to other phone lines. Because most contemporary call routing systems rely on DTMF (touch-tone) to rout the call they ask for an extension number, but with speech recognition this could just as easily be a name.</P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
