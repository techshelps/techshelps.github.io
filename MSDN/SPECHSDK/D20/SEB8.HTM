<h2>Third Party Controls</H2><P>A number of ISVs and engine vendors produce "controls" that make telephony applications easier to write because they handle a lot of the user interface work for the application. Telephony controls are akin to Windows buttons, list-boxes, and menus. They provide an easy-to-implement standard that also provides a common user interface for the user.</P>
<P>As an example, an application might use a telephony control to ask the user a yes/no question. To ask the question the application only has to specify the initial question, "Do you want pepperoni on your pizza?" and tell the control to ask away. The control speaks the text, waits for a response, interprets it, and returns the result. The control even handles users that don't respond in time, unrecognized results, or synonymous results such as, "Yeah sure".</P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
