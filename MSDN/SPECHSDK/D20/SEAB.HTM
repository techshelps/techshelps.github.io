<h2>Hardware and Software Requirements</H2><P>Telephony applications use the same speech recognition engines used for Command and Control speech recognition, and the same text-to-speech engines used on the PC.</P>
<P>These hardware and software requirements should be considered when designing a speech application:</P>
<P> <FONT FACE="Symbol">·</FONT>    <B>Processor speed</B>.  The speech-recognition and text-to-speech engines currently on the market typically require a 486/66 or faster processor. </P>
<P> <FONT FACE="Symbol">·</FONT>    <B>Memory</B>.  On the average, the combination of speech recognition and text-to-speech will use 2 megabytes (MB) of random-access memory (RAM) in addition to that required by the running application.</P>
<P> <FONT FACE="Symbol">·</FONT>    <B>Telephony card</B>.  A number of telephony cards are on the market today. On the low end are cards that use FAX/MODEM chips which have been augmented to handle speech.  These are included in almost every new home PC. Higher end cards include DSPs or support for multiple phone lines.</P>
<P> <FONT FACE="Symbol">·</FONT>    <B>Operating system</B>.  The Microsoft Speech application programming interface (API) requires either Windows 95 or Windows NT version 3.5.</P>
<P> <FONT FACE="Symbol">·</FONT>    <B>Speech-recognition and text-to-speech engine</B>.  Speech-recognition and text-to-speech software must be installed on the user's system. Many new audio-enabled computers and sound cards are bundled with speech-recognition and text-to-speech engines. As an alternative, many engine vendors offer retail packages for speech recognition or text-to-speech, and some license copies of their engines. </P>
