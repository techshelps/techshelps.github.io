<H1>Why Use Speech in Telephony?</H1><P>Contemporary telephony applications use recordings to play audio to the users, and wait for DTMF (touch-tone) responses from the user. Speech technology has the following advantages over DTMF and recorded audio:</P>
<P>Speech recognition allows a much larger set of inputs than DTMF. While DTMF can only allow the users 12 choices in any state, speech recognition can provide the user with hundreds or thousands of possible responses. Hence, a DTMF system that wishes to ask, "Who do you want to call?" needs a complicated menu structure to maneuver through thousands of names. Speech recognition only has to hear the full name.</P>
<P>In a DTMF application, frequent users either have to memorize or write down an arcane DTMF key sequences so they don't have to listen to all of the prompts. Users of speech recognition systems don't need to do this. It's much easier for users to remember what words to speak than what numbers to press.</P>
<P>In some places in Europe, only 80% of all telephones are rotary and cannot produce DTMF. In the United States of America, 20% of all telephones are rotary and cannot produce DTMF.</P>
<P>Synthesized text-to-speech allows anything to be spoken, allowing E-mail and names to be spoken to the user. It is also cheaper than hiring a professional talent to record, and localizes easier.</P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
