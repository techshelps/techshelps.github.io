<H3>Half-duplex Voice Modems</H3><P>Early low-end "Voice Modems" were basically created by bolting record and playback ability onto an existing FAX/MODEM chip-set. Although this made these voice modems cheap, they were lacking some critical features to make speech recognition viable.</P>
<P>Low-cost voice modems are "half-duplex" and do not support "full-duplex" audio. "Half-duplex" means that an application cannot record and play audio at the same time. Because of this, an important feature, "barge-in" is not possible.</P>
<P>"Barge-in" allows a user to interrupt a prompt being spoken by the telephony application. With barge-in, a user can listen to the list of options and speak the one he wants when he hears it. Without barge-in the user must wait for all of the options to be read before speaking. Having to listen to a long prompt can get annoying.</P>
<P>Applications that expect to run on half-duplex voice modems need to make sure that they design around the problems of half-duplex audio, perhaps even using shorter prompts when barge-in is not available on the machine.</P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
