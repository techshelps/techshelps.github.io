<h2>Communicate Speech Awareness</H2><P>Since most applications today do not include speech recognition, users will find speech recognition a new technology. They probably won't assume that your application has it, and won't know how to use it.</P>
<P>When you design a speech-recognition application, it is important to communicate to the user that your application is speech-aware and to provide him or her with the commands it understands. It is also important to provide command sets that are consistent and complete. </P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
