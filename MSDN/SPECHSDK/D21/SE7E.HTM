<h2>IVDctText::GetChanges</H2><P></P>
<P>HRESULT GetChanged(DWORD *pdwNewStart, DWORD *pdwNewEnd,</P>
<P>    DWORD *pdwOldStart, DWORD *pdwOldEnd);</P>
<P></P>
<P>This informs the applications of the changes that have occurred since the last time the application called IVDctText::Unlock. It returns where the changes started and ended in the old text, and where they now start and end in the new text. Thus, if text was not inserted/deleted then pdwXXXStart == pdwXXXEnd. If text was deleted then pdwOldStart &lt; pdwOldEnd. Likewise if text was inserted, pdwNewStart &lt; pdwNewEnd. If several changes occurred since the last call to UnLock then they will all be wrapped up into one larger change.</P>
<P></P>
<P> <FONT FACE="Symbol">·</FONT>    Returns NOERROR if successful, or one of these error values:</P>
<P>E_INVALIDARG<BR>E_OUTOFMEMORY<BR></P>
<P></P>
<P><I>pdwNewStart</I></P>
<P>[out] Filled with the beginning of the new region that was changed.</P>
<P></P>
<P><I>pdwNewEnd</I></P>
<P>[out] Filled with the end of the new region that was changed.</P>
<P></P>
<P><I>pdwOldStart</I></P>
<P>[out] Filled with the beginning of the old region that was changed.</P>
<P></P>
<P><I>pdwOldEnd</I></P>
<P>[out] Filled with the end of the old region that was changed.</P>
<P></P>
<P>Example: If the text was "This is a test" the last time the application called UnLock, and is now changed to "This was a test" then, the following values would be returned:</P>
<P>    *pdwNewStart = 5</P>
<P>    *pdwNewEnd = 8</P>
<P>    *pdwOldStart = 5</P>
<P>    *pdwOldEnd = 7</P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
