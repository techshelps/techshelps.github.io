<h2>Glossary Entries</H2><P>A glossary entry is one or more words that, if dictated, will be replaced by a text string. It is a textual translation of a symbol. Thus, a user could have a glossary entry for "copyright" that converts it to "&copy;", or "a t and t" to "AT&amp;T". Since users can add glossary entries, they are designed so they're easy for users to understand and modify.</P>
<P>Applications can provide their own glossary entries for a specific site, and even more complex interactions by providing their own commands. Voice Dictation will have some built in glossary entries.</P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
