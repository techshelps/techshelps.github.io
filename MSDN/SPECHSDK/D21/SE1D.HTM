<h2>Commands</H2><P>Voice Dictation supports some command &amp; control ability while the user dictates. Applications should use commands for non-textual actions, or textual-modifications that are too complex for glossary entries. Applications will be able to specify commands to have Voice Dictation listen for. Users, through an application's user-interface, can modify these commands.</P>
<P>Voice Dictation will also provide built-in commands. We will have a limited number in the first version but will expand the built-in commands as resources and technology (continuous dictation) allow. Applications cannot add built-in commands, although they can rename or disable them if they don't use them.</P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
