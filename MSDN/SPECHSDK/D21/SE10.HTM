<H3>Speech Recognizers make mistakes</H3><P>Speech recognizers make mistakes, and will always make mistakes. The only thing that is changing is that every two years recognizers make half as many mistakes as they did before. But, no matter how great a recognizer is it will always make mistakes.</P>
<P>To make matters worse, dictation engines make misrecognitions that are correctly spelled, often grammatically correct, but means nothing. Unfortunately, sometimes the misrecognition mistakes mean something completely different than the user intended. While people have become accustomed to typos they are not accustomed attributing strange wording to speech errors.</P>
<P>An application can minimize some of the misrecognitions by:</P>
<P>Make it as easy as possible for users to correct mistakes.</P>
<P>Provide easy access to the "Correction Window" so the user can correct mistakes that the recognizer made.</P>
<P>Allow the user to train the speech recognition system to his/her voice.</P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
