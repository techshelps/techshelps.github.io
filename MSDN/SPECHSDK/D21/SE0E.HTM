<h2>Hardware and Software Requirements</H2><P>A dictation application requires certain hardware and software on the user's computer to run. Not all computers have the memory, speed, microphone, or speakers required to support speech, so it is a good idea to design the application so that speech is optional.</P>
<P>These hardware and software requirements should be considered when designing a speech application:</P>
<P> <FONT FACE="Symbol">·</FONT>    <B>Processor speed</B>.  The speech-recognition and text-to-speech engines currently on the market typically require a Pentium 60 or faster processor. </P>
<P> <FONT FACE="Symbol">·</FONT>    <B>Memory</B>.  On the average, speech recognition for dictation consumes 4 to 8 megabytes (MB) of random-access memory (RAM) in addition to that required by the running application.</P>
<P> <FONT FACE="Symbol">·</FONT>    <B>Sound card</B>.  Almost any sound card will work for speech recognition and text-to-speech, including Sound Blaster&trade;, Media Vision&trade;, ESS Technology, cards that are compatible with the Microsoft&reg; Windows Sound System, and the audio hardware built into multimedia computers. A few speech-recognition engines still need a DSP (digital signal processor) card.</P>
<P> <FONT FACE="Symbol">·</FONT>    <B>Microphone</B>.  The user can choose between two kinds of microphone: either a close-talk or headset microphone that is held close to the mouth or a medium-distance microphone that rests on the computer 30 to 60 centimeters away from the speaker. A headset microphone is needed for noisy environments. Dictation works best with close-talk microphones.</P>
<P> <FONT FACE="Symbol">·</FONT>    <B>Operating system</B>.  The Microsoft Speech application programming interface (API) requires either Windows 95 or Windows NT version 3.5.</P>
<P> <FONT FACE="Symbol">·</FONT>    <B>Speech-recognition and text-to-speech engine</B>.  Speech-recognition and text-to-speech software must be installed on the user's system. Many new audio-enabled computers and sound cards are bundled with speech-recognition and text-to-speech engines. As an alternative, many engine vendors offer retail packages for speech recognition or text-to-speech, and some license copies of their engines. </P>
<P>For a list of engine vendors that support the Speech API, see the ENGINE.DOC file included with the Speech Software Development Kit. </P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
