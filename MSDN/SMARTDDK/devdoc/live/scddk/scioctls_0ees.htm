<h2>WDM driver version:</h2>
<p>
The <b>IOCTL_SMARTCARD_IS_PRESENT</b> <b>DeviceIoControl</b> operation either returns immediately if no card is currently inserted, or it installs an event handler to track card insertions. </p>
<p>
The operation either returns immediately with STATUS_SUCCESS, which indicates that a card is already in the reader, or it returns with STATUS_PENDING, which indicates that no card is currently in the reader. In this case, the driver then informs the caller of card insertion through an I/O completion. Waiting for I/O completion can be accomplished with the following code fragment:</p>
<pre><code>success = GetOverlappedResult(
    hDevice,
    &amp;lpOverlapped,
    &amp;lpBytesReturned,
    TRUE);
 </code></pre>
<h4>I/O Status</h4>
<p>
<i>Information</i> must be set to zero. <i>Status</i> can be:</p>
