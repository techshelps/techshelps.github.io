<H2>Overview</H2>When justifying text, the text-processing client distributes the characters in each line to completely fill the specified line length. Whether removing space to fit more characters in the line or adding more space to spread the characters, justification can produce large gaps between words, cramped or extended glyph spacing, uneven line break patterns, and other jarring visual effects. For example:</P>

<P><B>Figure 6a. Poorly justified text</B></P>
To offset these effects, text-processing clients have used justification algorithms that redistribute the space with a series of glyph spacing adjustments that progress from least to most obvious. Typically, the client will begin by expanding or compressing the space between words. If these changes aren't enough or look distracting, the client might hyphenate the word at the end of the line or adjust the space between glyphs in one or more lines.</P>
To disguise spacing inconsistencies so they won't disrupt the flow of text for a reader, the font developer can use the JSTF table to enable or disable individual glyph substitution and positioning actions that apply to specific scripts, language systems, and glyphs in the font. </P>
For instance, a ligature glyph can replace multiple glyphs, shortening the line of text with an unobtrusive, localized adjustment (see Figure 6b). Font-specific positioning changes can be applied to particular glyphs in a text line that combines two or more fonts. Other options include repositioning the individual glyphs in the line, expanding the space between specific pairs of glyphs, and decreasing the spacing within particular glyph sequences.</P>

The font designer or developer defines JSTF data as prioritized suggestions. Each suggestion lists the particular actions that the client can use to adjust the line of text. Justification actions may apply to both vertical and horizonal text.</P></BODY></HTML>
