<H2>Goals</H2>    Provide a simple standard API which application software can utilize for licensing. The API should be suitable for a wide variety of software publishers, software licensing products, operating systems, and network platforms.</P>
    Provide license system independence (allow a single application source and/or executable to interface to more than one license system).</P>
    Provide an API which <I>facilitates</I> the most common software licensing policies (such as concurrent use, personal use, node-locked, etc.)</P>
    Minimize the effort required of software publishers to implement simple use of software licensing within their products.</P>
    Allow software publishers to isolate their product's code from licensing policy. Policy is handled by the licensing system rather than by the application.</P>
    Allow support for the standalone as well as networked environments on machines ranging from the smallest of computers through the largest super computers.</P>
    Offer a reasonable level of protection against license system tampering. Provide the ability to establish, beyond a reasonable doubt, when such tampering has occurred.</P>
    <I>Help the </I><I>Honest Person be Honest</I>.</P></BODY></HTML>
