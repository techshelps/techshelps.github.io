<H2>Requirements</H2>In order to design a suitable common API interface, some requirements are imposed on license systems which conform to the API. These are:</P>
    Provide support for the API as detailed in this specification. Implement a service provider and/or a link-library for each of the operating system / network platform to be supported.</P>
    Within the license document itself, provide for:</P>
1.    a minimum of four secret values, where each is a minimum of 32-bits in size.</P>
2.    a Publisher name of at least 32 characters, a Product name of at least 32 characters, and a product version number of at least 12 characters.</P>
·    The license system must be capable of providing a string which <I>uniquely</I> identifies itself. This string typically includes the vendor name, product name, and version.</P>
In addition to the requirements, a few guidelines are suggested:</P>
·    Carefully choose the error messages returned by LSGetMessage(). They should be suitable for display to (and comprehensible by) an end user.</P>
    Try to map as many license system specific errors to the commonly defined error codes.</P>
    The secret values should be two-way encrypted onto the license by a unique method known only to the particular license system.</P>
    Care should be taken in non-preemptive environments not to block that environment.</P></BODY></HTML>
