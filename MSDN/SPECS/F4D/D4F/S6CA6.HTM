<H1>License System Service Providers</H1>This chapter is targeted to the license system vendor who provides the underlying mechanisms to support the common License Service API. For each operating system platform that a license system vendor wishes to support, it must develop a license <I>service provider</I> for that platform.</P>
Each operating system has its own set of requirements which the license system vendor must deal with. Depending on the particular platform, a service provider may be implemented as a dynamically linked library, a run-time library, or perhaps a statically linked module (on platforms which do not support dynamic linking).</P>
This chapter contains the O/S platform-specific information needed for a license system vendor to implement a service provider. Included are: development guidelines, how multiple license systems exist concurrently, etc. Although this chapter is targeted towards license system provider developers, applications vendors may find it useful reading to better understand how the License Service API is provided for each platform.</P></BODY></HTML>
