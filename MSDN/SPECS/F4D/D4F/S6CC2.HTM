<H1>Appendix A: Example Scenario</H1>This appendix provides an example scenario of how a software publisher might incorporate the License Service API into an application, using the Basic Challenge protocol. It is not intended to be construed as the de facto way to utilize the LSAPI. Consult a license system vendor for additional scenarios and more detailed examples.</P>
The License Service API allows the software publisher to choose among a number of different strategies. The following are some examples supplied by the Microcomputer Managers Association:</P>
1.    <B>ANNOUNCEMENT ONLY</B>.  In its most basic form, the API can be used by an application to simply announce when it is starting and terminating; this announcement can be logged by a license system to record or <I>meter</I> the number of software applications in use at any one time.</P>
2.    <B>AUTHORIZATION DESIRED</B>.  Software can use the API to look for authorization to run from the licensing system. If no license or license system is present, the software may display a warning message but continue to run.</P>
3.    <B>AUTHORIZATION REQUIRED</B>.  Software can use the API to look for authorization to run from the licensing system. If no license is present, the software may elect to not run.</P>
These are just a few of the possible strategies that may be used. Organizations such as the Microcomputer Managers Association, the Software Publishers Association, and the Netware Masters Group can be contacted for further recommendations.</P></BODY></HTML>
