<H2>Characters, Glyphs and Fonts</H2>We often speak inaccurately of character sets: we may refer to a "Greek character set" or a "Latin character set". But in order to understand how different writing systems are supported by Windows, we need to be more precise about characters.</P>
Users don't view or print characters: a user views or prints <B>glyphs</B>. A glyph is a representation of a character. The character "Capital Letter A" is represented by the glyph "<B>A</B>" in Times New Roman Bold, and "<B>A</B>" in Arial Bold. A <B>font</B> is a collection of glyphs. Windows is able to retrieve the appropriate glyphs by using mapping information about the keyboard, the language system in use, and the glyphs associated with each character.</P>
Fonts are designed with character sets in mind: a font for use in Russia will include glyphs representing Cyrillic characters. There is no magic word or blessing uttered to create a "character set." A character set is only a collection of characters. However, characters from different language systems are conventionally divided into different "character sets", primarily because, in the past, a limited number of characters could be "addressed" at any one time.</P>
<H3><A NAME="sec0"></A>Preparing for TrueType Open:<BR>Glyph Substitution</H3>Glyphs can also represent combinations of characters and alternate forms of characters: there is not a strict one-to-one correspondence between glyphs and characters. For example, two characters may be typed in a document, but represented by only a single glyph (a ligature glyph). Conversely, different versions of a character may appear at the beginning, middle, or ending of a word. Thus, a single character can be represented by several different glyphs in a font.</P>
TrueType Open will provide a substitution table to handle one-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-one mappings.</P></BODY></HTML>
