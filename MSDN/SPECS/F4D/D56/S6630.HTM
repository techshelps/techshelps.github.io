<SPAN CLASS="list"><UL><LI>The xMin, xMax, yMin, and yMax fields must be the actual max/min of all glyph bounding boxes. Glyphs with no contours should be ignored for the purposes of these calculations.</LI><LI>Bit 0 of the flags field (baseline for font at y=0) should be set. Fonts should be designed so that this condition is true.</LI><LI>Bit 3 of the flags field (force ppem to integer values) should be set.</LI><LI>The macStyle field should agree with the fsSelection field in the 'OS/2' table.</LI><LI>The fontDirectionHint field should be 2 (strongly left-to-right, with neutrals) for a Far East font.</LI></UL></SPAN><B>Recommendations</B></P>
<SPAN CLASS="list"><UL><LI>The fontRevision field is intended for font manufacturers to indicate the revision number of font software. All other version numbers in a TTF refer to versions of the TrueType specification or the particular table specification, and an inappropriate value in a version field may produce unpredictable results.</LI><LI>The font should be designed so that unitsPerEm is a power of 2; this can greatly increase the speed of scaler math. In choosing the font's design resolution, also consider size versus quality tradeoffs; with a smaller unitsPerEm (512 or 256), point coordinate deltas in the 'glyf' table typically occupy one byte instead of 2, greatly reducing overall font size.</LI><LI>Bit 1 of the flags field (left sidebearing at x=0) should be set if this condition is true for all glyphs.</LI><LI>Bit 4 of the flags field (instructions may alter advance width) should be set if the font is "non-linear". This may occur if advance widths are changed by TrueType instructions, or if embedded bitmaps have advances that don't match the value obtained by linearly scaling 'hmtx' data.</LI><LI>Far East fonts will almost certainly have a large 'glyf' table, which means indexToLocFormat should be 1 (long offsets).</LI></UL></SPAN></BODY></HTML>
