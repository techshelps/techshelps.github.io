<H2>Maintaining minimum_distance</H2>When the width of a glyph feature decreases below a certain size, rounded values may become zero. Allowing values to round to zero can result in certain glyph features disappearing. For example, a stem might disappear entirely at small point sizes. By setting a minimum_distance of one pixel you can assure that even at small sizes those features will not disappear.</P>
In the example shown below, the minimum_distance value is used to ensure that the stem of the r does not disappear at small sizes. By ensuring that the distance from point 9 to point 10 is always at least one pixel, this goal is accomplished. </P>
