<H2>Controlling rounding</H2>The TrueType interpreter uses the round_state to determine the manner in which values will be rounded. Instructions are used to set the value of the round_state, a Graphics State variable. The setting of round_state determines how values will be rounded by the interpreter. </P>
The instruction set makes it easy to set a number of predefined round states that will round values to the grid, pixel centers (half grid), or to either the grid or pixel centers. It is also possible to specify that values should be rounded down or rounded up. If none of the predefined rounding options suffices, the SROUND instructions provide very fine control of the rounding of values, making it possible to choose a phase, threshold, and period for the rounding function. The S45ROUND allows the same fine control as SROUND but is used when movement is along a 45 degree axis with the x-y plane.</P>
A number of instructions round the value they obtain before moving any points. The effect of using any of the MDRP, MIRP, MIAP, MDAP, or ROUND instructions depends on the value of the round_state graphics state variable along with that of the control_value_cut_in. </P>
The ROFF instruction turns off rounding but allows the instruction to continue looking at the cut-in value.</P></BODY></HTML>
