<H2>Managing the direction of distances</H2>The auto_flip variable owes its existence to the fact that the TrueType interpreter distinguishes between distances measured in the direction of the projection_vector (positive distances) and those that are measured in the direction opposite to the projection_vector (negative distances). </P>
The setting of the auto_flip Boolean determines whether the sign of values in the Control Value Table is significant. If auto_flip is set to TRUE, the values of CVT entries will be changed when necessary to match the sign of the actual measurement. This makes it possible to control distances measured with or against the projection vector.</P>
For example, the CVT might contain an entry for uppercase stem widths. At times it may be convenient to control widths from left to right while at other times it may be convenient to control them from right to left. One case will produce a positive distance, the other a negative distance. Without auto_flip it would be necessary to have two CVT entries (+UC_Stem and –UC_Stem) instead of just one. Setting auto_flip to TRUE makes the sign of the value read from the CVT the same as the sign of the distance between the points we are controlling in the original unmodified domain.</P>
Generally, auto_flip is set to TRUE, but if it becomes necessary to distinguish between a positive or negative distance, the variable must be set to FALSE.</P></BODY></HTML>
