<H2>Managing at specific sizes</H2>Most TrueType instructions are independent of size. They are used to control a feature over the full range of sizes. Occasionally, it is necessary to alter a glyph outline at a specific size to include or exclude certain pixels. In other words, occasionally it is desirable to make an exception to the outline that would otherwise be produced by the other instructions. Such exceptions are made using the DELTA instructions.</P>
There are two types of DELTA instructions. The DELTAP instructions work by moving points. The DELTAC instructions work by changing values in the CVT. </P>
For example, without a DELTA instruction the circumflex accent shrinks to a single pixel at  9 ppem. Using DELTAs, the appearance is improved by lowering points 5, 2 and 1 by one pixel at 9 ppem. </P>

<B>Note:</B>   <I>DELTA instructions should be used sparingly, since they are associated with a relatively high storage overhead. They can be useful for solving otherwise "impossible" cases.</I></P>
<H3><A NAME="sec0"></A>The delta_base</H3>The delta_base is the base value used to calculate the range of point sizes to which a delta instruction will apply. Changing the delta_base allows you to change the range of ppem sizes affected by each of the DELTA instructions.</P>
The three pairs of DELTA instructions are grouped according to the range of pixels they potentially affect, with each group beginning at 16 pixels per em larger than the previous group. All DELTAC1 and DELTAP1 instructions potentially can affect glyphs at sizes beginning at delta_base pixels per em through delta_base plus 15 pixels per em. The DELTAP2 and DELTAC2 instructions affect the range beginning at delta_base plus 16 pixels per em. The DELTAP3 and DELTAC3 instructions affect delta_base plus 32 pixels per em.</P>
<H3><A NAME="sec1"></A>The delta_shift</H3>The delta_shift value is the power to which an exception is raised. By varying the value of the delta_shift,  you trade off fine control of outline movement as opposed to total range of movement. A low delta_shift favors range of movement over fine control. A high delta_shift favors fine control over range of movement. </P>
Points can be moved by multiples of a fixed amount called a step. The size of the step is 1 divided by 2 to the power delta_shift. </P></BODY></HTML>
