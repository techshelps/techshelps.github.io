<h1><a name="5.1sectiondata"></a>5.1 Section Data</h1>
<p>
Initialized data for a section consists of simple blocks of bytes.  However, for sections containing all zeros, the section data need not be included.</p>
<p>
The data for each section is located at the file offset given by the PointerToRawData field in the section header, and the size of this data in the file is indicated by the SizeOfRawData field. If the SizeOfRawData is less than the VirtualSize, the remainder is padded with zeros.</p>
<p>
In an image file, the section data must be aligned on a boundary as specified by the FileAlignment field in the optional header. Section data must appear in order of the RVA values for the corresponding sections (as do the individual section headers in the Section Table).</p>
<p>
There are additional restrictions on image files for which the Section Align value in the Optional Header is less than the page size of the architecture. For such files, the location of section data in the file must match its location in memory when the image is loaded, so that the physical offset for section data is the same as the RVA. </p>
