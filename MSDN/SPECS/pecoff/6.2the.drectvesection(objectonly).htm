<h1><a name="6.2the.drectvesection(objectonly)"></a>6.2 The .drectve Section (Object Only)</h1>
<p>
A section is a &quot;directive&quot; section if it has the IMAGE_SCN_LNK_INFO flag set in the section header. By convention, such a section also has the name <b>.drectve</b>. The linker removes a <b>.drectve</b> section after processing the information, so the section does not appear in the image file being linked. Note that a section marked with IMAGE_SCN_LNK_INFO that is not named <b>.drectve</b> is ignored and discarded by the linker.</p>
<p>
A <b>.drectve</b> section consists of a string of ASCII text. This string is a series of linker options (each option containing hyphen, option name, and any appropriate attribute) separated by spaces. The <b>.drectve</b> section must not have relocations or line numbers.</p>
<p>
In a <b>.drectve</b> section, if the hyphen preceding an option is followed by a question mark (for example, &quot;-?export&quot;), and the option is not recognized as a valid directive, the linker must ignore it. This allows compilers and linkers to add new directives while maintaining compatibility with existing linkers, as long as the new directives are not required for the correct linking of the application. For example, if the directive enables a link-time optimization, it is acceptable if some linkers cannot recognize it.</p>
