<p>
The data structures described so far, up to and including the optional header, are all located at a fixed offset from the beginning of the file (or from the PE header if the file is an image containing an MS-DOS stub).</p>
<p>
The remainder of a COFF object or image file contains blocks of data that are not necessarily at any specific file offset. Instead the locations are defined by pointers in the Optional Header or a section header.</p>
<p>
An exception is for images with a Section Alignment value (see the Optional Header description) of less than the page size of the architecture (4K for Intel x86 and for MIPS; 8K for Alpha). In this case there are constraints on the file offset of the section data, as described in the next section. Another exception is that attribute certificate and debug information must be placed at the very end of an image file (with the attribute certificate table immediately preceding the debug section), because the loader does not map these into memory. The rule on attribute certificate and debug information does not apply to object files.</p>
