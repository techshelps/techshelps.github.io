<p>
The Export Name Table contains the actual string data pointed to by the Export Name Pointer Table. The strings in this table are public names that can be used by other images to import the symbols; these public export names are not necessarily the same as the (private) symbol names that the symbols have in their own image file and source code, although they can be.</p>
<p>
Every exported symbol has an ordinal value, which is just the index into the Export Address Table (plus the Ordinal Base value). Use of export names, however, is optional. Some, all, or none of the exported symbols can have export names. For those exported symbols that do have export names, corresponding entries in the Export Name Pointer Table and Export Ordinal Table work together to associate each name with an ordinal.</p>
<p>
The structure of the Export Name Table is a series of ASCII strings, of variable length, each null terminated.</p>
