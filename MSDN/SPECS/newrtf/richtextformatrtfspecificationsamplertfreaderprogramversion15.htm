<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
The Rich Text Format (RTF) Specification is a method of encoding formatted text and graphics for easy transfer between applications. Currently, users depend on special translation software to move word-processing documents between different MS-DOS®, Windows, OS/2, Macintosh, and Power Macintosh applications.</p>
<p>
The RTF Specification provides a format for text and graphics interchange that can be used with different output devices, operating environments, and operating systems. RTF uses the ANSI, PC-8, Macintosh, or IBM PC character set to control the representation and formatting of a document, both on the screen and in print. With the RTF Specification, documents created under different operating systems and with different software applications can be transferred between those operating systems and applications. RTF files created in Word 6.0 (and later) for the Macintosh and Power Macintosh have a file type of “RTF.”</p>
<p>
Software that takes a formatted file and turns it into an RTF file is called a writer. An RTF writer separates the application's control information from the actual text and writes a new file containing the text and the RTF groups associated with that text. Software that translates an RTF file into a formatted file is called a reader.</p>
<p>
Included with the RTF specification is a sample RTF reader application (see "Appendix A: Sample RTF Reader Application" beginning on page 89 of this document). It is designed for use with the specification to assist those users developing their own RTF readers. The file included with this Application Note, Rtfreadr.exe, contains the sample RTF reader program itself. This file and its use are described in Appendix A. The sample RTF reader is not a for-sale product, and Microsoft does not provide technical or any other type of support for the sample RTF reader code or the RTF specification.</p>
<p>
RTF Version 1.5 has been updated to include all new control words introduced by Microsoft Word for Windows 95 version 7.0 and Word 97 for Windows.</p>
