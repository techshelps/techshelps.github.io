<H2>B.1 Initial Window Size</H2>Although each side has indicated the size of its receive window, it is recommended that a slow start method be used to begin transmitting data. The initial window size on the transmitter is set to half the maximum size the receiver requested, with a minimum size of one packet. As the receiver successfully digests each window, the window size on the transmitter is bumped up by one packet to the initial maximum. This method prevents a system from flooding an already congested network because no history has been established.</P></BODY></HTML>
