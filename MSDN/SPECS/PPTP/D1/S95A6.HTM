<H2>Packet Processing Delay (PPD)</H2>The PPD parameter is a 16-bit word exchanged during the Call Control phase that represents tenths of a second (64 means 6.4 seconds). The protocol only specifies that the parameter is exchanged; it does not specify how it is calculated. The way in which values for PPD are calculated is implementation-dependent and need not be variable (static time-outs). The PPD must be exchanged in the call connect sequence even if it remains constant in an implementation. One possible way to calculate the PPD is the following:</P>

The header size consists of the IP and GRE v2 header, and is 36. The MTU is the overall MTU for the internetwork link between the FEP and NTS. <I>WindowSize</I> represents the number of packets in the sliding window, and its calculation or size is implementation-dependent. The amount of latency in the internetwork could be used to pick a window size sufficient to keep the current connection's pipe full. The constant <I>8</I> converts bytes to bits (assuming <I>ConnectRate</I> is in bits per second). If <I>ConnectRate</I> is in bytes per second, omit the <I>8</I>. <I>FEPFudge</I> is not required but can be used to take overall processing overhead of the FEP into account.</P>
The PPD is used to seed the adaptive algorithm with the initial RTT(n-1) value.</P></BODY></HTML>
