<H2>B.3 Opening the Window</H2>With every successful transmission of a window without a time-out, the window is opened by one packet until it reaches the maximum window size that was sent by the other side when the call was connected. As stated earlier, no retransmission is done on a time-out. After a time-out, the transmission resumes with the window starting at one and adjusting upward with each success.</P></BODY></HTML>
