<H2>Executive Summary</H2></P>
This document outlines the minimum hardware &amp; software requirements for parallel port devices to obtain "Plug &amp; Play" support under Chicago. "Plug &amp; Play" (in this document) is defined as the ability to attach an I/O device to a host, and enable the host to determine that the device has been added, identify it, and either automatically install the necessary device drivers or prompt the user for a diskette containing them. This document is not intended to provide a complete, detailed description of how an operating system will internally accomplish this, but rather to define the necessary hardware/software requirements.</P>
