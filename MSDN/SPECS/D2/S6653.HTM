<H2>Types  Indices</H2>All Symbol and Type records which reference records in the $$TYPES table  must use valid non-zero type indices.  For public symbols  a type index of 0x0000 (T_NOTYPE) is permitted.  </P>
Since many types (relating to hardware and language primitives) are common, type index values less than 0x1000 (CV_FIRST_NONPRIM) are reserved for a set of predefined primitive types.  A list of predefined types and their indices are defined in this document in Section 5.  Type indices of 0x1000 and higher are used to index into the set of non-primitive type definitions in the module's $$TYPES segment.  Thus 0x1000 is the first type, 0x1001 the second, and so on.  Non-primitive type indices must be sequential and contain no gaps in the numbering.  Type indices are now a 32-bit quantity and the valid range is 0x001000 to 0xffffff (2<SUP>24</SUP> - 1) with the top 8 bits reserved and must be 0.</P></BODY></HTML>
