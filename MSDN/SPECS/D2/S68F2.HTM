<H3>Hardware Requirements</H3></P>
Plug &amp; Play support for parallel port devices will require that the device provide a parallel interface, which conforms to the IEEE 1284 specification.  This interface may be 1284-I compliant (using 1284-A or 1284-B connectors), or 1284-II compliant (using 1284-C connectors). </P>
</P>
It is also required that these devices minimally support nibble mode as described in the IEEE 1284 specification. </P>
</P>
It is suggested that parallel port devices support ECP mode as defined by the IEEE 1284 specification in order to enjoy the improved performance benefits ECP mode provides. </P>
</P>
Note that in order for a peripheral to receive "Plug &amp; Play" certification from Microsoft, nibble mode support &amp; reporting the minimal device ID key values, (as described in IEEE 1284), is required.</P>
