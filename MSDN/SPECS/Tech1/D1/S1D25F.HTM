The IRemUnknown interface on the object-exporter specified object, in addition to servicing reference counting as described above also services QueryInterface calls for remote clients for IPIDs managed by that exporter. IRemUnknown::RemQueryInterface differs from IUnknown::QueryInterface in much the same way as RemAddRef and RemRelease differ from AddRef and Release, in that it is optimized for network access by being able to retrieve many interfaces at once.</P>
