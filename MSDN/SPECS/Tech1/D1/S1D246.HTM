<H2>Data Selection</H2>  </P>
A data object can vary to a number of degrees as to what exact data it can exchange through the <B>IDataObject </B>interface. Some data objects, such as those representing the clipboard or those used in a drag-and-drop operation, statically represent a specific selection of data in the source, such as a range of cells in a spreadsheet, a certain portion of a bitmap, or a certain amount of text. For the life of such static data objects, the data underneath them does not change.</P>
Other types of data objects, however, may support the ability to dynamically change their data set. This ability, however, is not represented through the <B>IDataObject </B>interface itself. In other words, the data object has to implement some <I>other</I> interface to support dynamic data selection. An example of such objects are the WOSA Extensions for Real Time Market Data (WOSA/XRT), a specification available from Microsoft or the Open Market Data Council for Windows. WOSA/XRT uses a data object and the <B>IDataObject </B>interface for exchange of data, but use the <B>IDispatch </B>interface from OLE Automation to allow consumers of the data to dynamically instruct the data object to change its working set. In other words, the OLE Automation technology (built on COM but not part of COM itself) allows the consumer to identify the specific market issues and the information on those issues (high, low, volume, and so forth) that it wants to obtain from the data object. In response, the data object internally determines where to retrieve that data and how to watch for changes in it. The data object then notifies the consumer of changes in the data through COM's Notification mechanism.</P>
