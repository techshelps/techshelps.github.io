<H2>Exposing the Class Factory</H2>  </P>
<A NAME="PT3"></A>With a class factory implementation the server must now expose it such that the COM Library can locate the class factory from within CoGetClassObject<I> </I>after it has loaded the .DLL<font class="MissingLink" meta="aslch06_FNThree">3.</font> server or launched the .EXE server. The exact method of exposing the class factory differs for each server type. The following sections cover each type in detail which apply to .DLLs and .EXEs running on the local or remote computer in relation to the client. There are also some considerations for .DLL servers running remotely under a surrogate server that are covered in this section.</P>
