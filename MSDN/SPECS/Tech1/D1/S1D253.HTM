The *_UserMarshal routine is called when marshaling the data on the client or server side. The buffer pointer may or may not be aligned upon the entry. The routine should align the buffer pointer appropriately, marshal the data and then return the new buffer pointer position which is at the first "free" byte after the marshaled object. For the complications related to pointees see the next chapter.</P>
Please note that the wire type specification is a contract that determines the actual layout of the data in the buffer. For example, if the conversion is needed and done by the NDR engine, it follows from the wire type definitions how much data would be processed in the buffer for the type.</P>
