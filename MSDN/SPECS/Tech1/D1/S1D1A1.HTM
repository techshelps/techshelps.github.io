<H2>Creating an Initial Connection Between Processes</H2>  </P>
Earlier we said we would later discuss how an initial remoting connection is established between two processes. It is now time to have that discussion.</P>
The real truth of the matter is that the initial connection is established by some means outside of the architecture that we have been discussing here. The minimal that is required is some primitive communication channel between the two processes. As such, we cannot hope to discuss all the possibilities. But we will point out some common ones.</P>
One common approach is that initial connections are established just like other connections: an interface pointer is marshaled in the server process, the marshaled data packet is ferried [to] the client process, and it is unmarshaled. The only twist is that the ferrying is done by some means <I>other </I>than the RPC mechanism which we've been describing. There are many ways this could be accomplished. The most important, by far is one where the marshaled data is passed as an out-parameter from an invocation on a well-known endpoint to a Service Control Manager.</P>
