<H3>IMoniker::Inverse</H3>  </P>
<B>HRESULT IMoniker::Inverse(ppmk)</B></P>
Answer a moniker that when composed onto the end of this moniker or one of similar structure will annihilate it; that is, will compose to nothing. IMoniker::Inverse will be needed in implementations of IMoniker::RelativePathTo, which are important for supporting monikers that track information as it moves about.</P>
This is the abstract generalization of the ".." operation in traditional file systems. For example a File Moniker which represented the path "a\b\c\d" would have as its inverse a moniker containing the path "..\..\..\..", since "a\b\c\d" composed with "..\..\..\.." yields nothing. </P>
Notice that an the inverse of a moniker does not annihilate just that particular moniker, but all monikers with a similar structure, where structure is of course interpreted with respect to the particular moniker. Thus, the inverse of a Generic Composite Moniker is the reverse composite of the inverse of its pieces. Monikers which are non-generic composites (such as File Monikers are presently implemented) will also have non-trivial inverses, as we just saw. However, there will be many kinds of monikers whose inverse is trivial: the moniker <I>adds </I>one more piece to an existing structure; its inverse is merely a moniker that <I>removes</I> the last piece of the existing structure. A moniker that when composed onto the end of a generic moniker removes the last piece is provided; see CreateAntiMoniker. Monikers with no internal structure can return one of these as their inverse.</P>
Not all monikers have inverses. The inverse of an anti-moniker, for example, does not exist. Neither will the inverses of most monikers which are themselves inverses. It is conceivable that other monikers do not have inverses as well; a macro moniker might be an example. Monikers which have no inverse cannot have relative paths formed from things inside the objects they denote to things outside.</P>
