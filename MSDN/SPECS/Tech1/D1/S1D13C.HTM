<H3>Reusable Component Objects</H3>  </P>
Object-oriented programming allows programmers to build flexible and powerful software objects that can easily be reused by other programmers. Why is this? What is it about objects that are so flexible and powerful?</P>
The definition of an object is a piece of software that contains the functions that represent what the object can do (its intelligence) and associated state information for those functions (data). An object is, in other words, some data structure and some functions to manipulate that structure.</P>
An important principle of object-oriented programming is <I>encapsulation</I>, where the exact implementation of those functions and the exact format and layout of the data is only of concern to the object itself. This information is hidden from the clients of an object. Those clients are interested only in an object's behavior and not the object's internals. For instance, consider an object that represents a stack: a user of the stack cares only that the object supports "push" and "pop" operations, not whether the stack is implemented with an array or a linked list. Put another way, a client of an object is interested only in the contract—the promised behavior—that the object supports, not the implementation it uses to fulfill that contract.</P>
COM goes as far as to formalize the notion of a contract between object and client. Such a contract is the basis for interoperability, and for interoperability to work on a large scale requires a strong standard.</P>
