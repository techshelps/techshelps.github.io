<H3>Notifications</H3>  </P>
What follows is a detailed description of each of the relevant notifications.</P>
Note that in the network case, depending on the notification in question, the byte order used may be different than that of the local computer. The byte order, and so forth, of the incoming data is provided from the dataRep contained the passed RPCOLEMESSAGE structure.</P>
Though each function is documented here for purely historical reasons as if it were in fact a function call, we have seen above that this is not the case. Unless otherwise specified, the name of the argument to the DebugORPC... notification call is the same as the name of the structure member in ORPC_DBG_ALL used to pass it to the debugger. So for example the pMessage argument of the DebugORPCClientGetBufferSize notification is passed to the debugger in the pMessage structure member of ORPC_DBG_ALL. We trust that readers will not be too confused by this, and apologize profusely should this prove not to be the case.</P>
