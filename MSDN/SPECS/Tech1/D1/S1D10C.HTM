<H1>Chapter 15: The COM Library</H1>  </P>
It should be clear by this time that COM itself involves some systems-level code, that is, some implementation of its own. However, at the core the Component Object Model by itself is a specification (hence <I>Model</I>) for the way objects and their clients interact through the binary standard of interfaces. As a specification it defines a number of other standards for interoperability:</P>
<SPAN CLASS="list"><UL><LI>The fundamental process of interface negotiation through QueryInterface.</LI><LI>A <I>reference counting</I> mechanism through objects (and their resources) are managed even when connected to multiple clients.</LI><LI>Rules for memory allocation and responsibility for those allocations when exchanged between independently developed components.</LI><LI>Consistent and rich error reporting facilities.</LI></UL></SPAN>In addition to being a specification, COM is also an implementation contained what is called the <I>COM Library. </I>The implementation is provided through a library (such as a .DLL on Microsoft Windows) that includes:</P>
<SPAN CLASS="list"><UL><LI>A small number of fundamental API functions that facilitate the creation of COM applications, both clients and servers. For clients, COM supplies basic object creation functions; for servers the facilities to expose their objects.</LI><LI>Implementation locator services through which COM determines from a class identifier which server implements that class and where that server is located. This includes support for a level of indirection, usually a system registry, between the identity of an object class and the packaging of the implementation, such that clients are independent of the packaging which can change in the future.</LI><LI>Transparent remote procedure calls when an object is running in a local or remote server. This includes the implementation of a standard network wire-protocol.</LI><LI>A standard mechanism to allow an application to control how memory is allocated within its process.</LI></UL></SPAN>In general, only one vendor needs to, or should, implement a COM Library for any particular operating system. For example, Microsoft has implemented COM on Microsoft&reg; Windows&reg; 3.1, Microsoft Windows 95, Microsoft Windows NT, and the Apple&reg; Macintosh&reg;. </P>
The following chapter describes elements of the COM Library that a vendor implementing COM on a previously unsupported platform would require.</P>
