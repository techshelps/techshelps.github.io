The ability for debuggers to support scenarios such as these is provided by hooks in the client and server side RPC infrastructure. If requested by the debugger, at certain important times, these hooks inform the debugger of the fact that a transmission of a remote call about to be made or that transmission of return values is about to occur. That is, when the COM Library is about to make or return from a call to an object, it notifies the debugger of what is happening, so that the debugger can take any special actions it desires.</P>
