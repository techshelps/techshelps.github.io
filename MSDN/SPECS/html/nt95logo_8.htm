<h4>Basic Requirements</h4>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>32-bitness</b></dt>
<dd>
<b>Required:</b><BR>An application must be a Win32 application programming interface executable file compiled with a 32-bit compiler that generates an executable file of the PE (Portable Executable) format (“[PE_Win32]” as reported by the Exedump program on the Win32 SDK). This means that all the major program files (DLLs and EXEs) must be 32-bit with the exceptions stated below. </dd>
</dl>
<p>
<b>Note</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Windows NT, thunks allow applications to call from 16-bit code to 32-bit code.  However, calling from 32-bit to 16-bit on Windows NT is not supported; you need 32-bit equivalent code for Windows NT.  On Windows 95, thunks allow applications to call in both directions.  Fully 32-bit code allows applications to ship a single binary.</p>
<p>
<b>Exception:<BR></b>If your application is not represented in PE format (interpreted code, for example), then the “run-time engine” must be a Win32-based executable file in the PE format. For example, if you develop an application in Microsoft Access, your application is an .mdb file, not an .exe, but Access.exe would need to be a Win32-based executable file in the PE format.</p>
<p>
<b>Exception:<BR></b>Under the following circumstances, certain 16-bit code elements may be included in your product:
<ul>
<li>
Some minor, subsidiary 16-bit executable files and dynamic-link libraries (DLLs) may be used in order to provide backward compatibility and links to 16-bit products. However, your main program files (including DLLs) must be 32-bit.<br><br></li>
<li>
Other minor, subsidiary 16-bit executable files and DLLs may be used for convenience in a very limited fashion, however, only if there is no existing 32-bit version of the DLL you need for your application. These files cannot constitute a significant portion of the product. <br><br></li>
<li>
You must fully explain any and all instances of 16-bit code when you submit your product for testing. This must be done in the electronic Vendor Questionnaire you submit with your application.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<b>Required:<BR></b>The application must support multitasking.  It must support either Alt-Tab or Ctrl-Esc to switch focus from full screen to the desktop.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>Stability and Functionality</b></dt>
<dd>
<b>Required:<BR></b>The product must be fully functional and stable on the most recent versions of both the Windows NT and Windows 95 operating systems. We will do vigorous stability testing to confirm that your product does not adversely affect the overall stability of Windows NT or Windows 95.  See section 8.1, Pre-testing &amp; Verification of Compliance for specific stability tests.<br>
</dd>
<dt>
<b>Product Distribution</b></dt>
<dd>
<b>Required:</b><BR>In order for a bundled package of applications (commonly known as a “suite”) to use the Logo, each individual product in that suite must be tested and pass the Logo requirements.  In order for each individual product to use the Logo when shipped separately, it must be retested for compliance with Logo installation &amp; uninstallation requirements only.<p>
<b>Required:</b><BR>The Logo program is for 32-bit Windows-based applications.  However, vendors may distribute 16-bit versions of their product on the same distribution media as the 32-bit Logo tested product provided the installer clearly distinguish the difference between the 16-bit product and the 32-bit Designed&nbsp;for&nbsp;Windows&nbsp;NT&nbsp;and&nbsp;Windows&nbsp;95 products.  A message must be included such as “Do you also wish to install Product Y? This is a 16-bit product that is not designed for Microsoft Windows NT and Windows 95 but must operate in this environment.”</p>
<p>
<b>Required:</b> <BR>Windows NT runs on multiple hardware platforms. Windows 95 is a single-platform operating system. You must provide a version of your application that runs on both Windows NT 4.0 and Windows 95.  You may wish to ship multiple platform versions (different binaries that work on platforms such as Intel&reg; x86, , or Alpha &nbsp;AXP™) of your application in the same package.  All multiple platform versions may be submitted simultaneously for testing.
<ul>
<li>
If your product can be installed on multiple platforms from a single distribution media (for example, a CD-ROM), the installer must automatically detect the platform. It is not acceptable to ask the user which platform to install.<br><br></li>
<li>
If you ship your application in a multiple-platform package on which you are using the Logo, you must include in that package a version of your application that runs on Windows 95.  Similarly, any advertising or marketing materials on which you use the Logo must refer to a package that includes a version of the product that runs on Windows 95.</li>
</ul>
