<h4>Games and Multimedia Applications</h4>
<p>
<b>Required:<BR></b>All products that use DirectX must fail gracefully on Windows NT 3.51, but function properly on Windows NT 4.0 and later versions.</p>
<p>
<b>Required:<BR></b>All products that use Direct3D or DirectSound APIs must provide a comparable user experience on both Windows NT 4.0 and Windows 95 to be eligible for the Designed for Windows NT &amp; Windows 95 Logo.  </p>
<p>
Products that use Direct3D and DirectSound  APIs without updating  Windows NT using SP3 may be granted the &quot;Designed for Windows 95 Logo&quot; provided the product displays a meaningful user message and does not load on Windows NT.</p>
<p>
<i>Only products that use Direct3D or DirectSound are eligible for the Designed for Windows 95 Logo</i></p>
<p>
<b>Recommended:</b></p>
<p>
<i>Many of the recommendations listed below will become requirements in the next revision of the Designed for Windows Logo program so please review this section closely.</i></p>
<p>
Future versions of the Logo will require Games and Multimedia applications with the following capabilities to support DirectX 5.0 (or later) <i>or</i> use the Win32 Multimedia subsystem APIs.  It is recommended that applications with:
<ul>
<li>
2D graphics output be produced using DirectDraw, in either windowed or full-screen mode.<br><br></li>
<li>
sound playback use DirectSound. <br><br></li>
<li>
game support for keyboard, mouse, and gaming devices (such as joysticks and gamepads) use DirectInput.<br><br></li>
<li>
hardware accelerated 3D graphics be accessed through Direct3D.<br><br></li>
<li>
advanced services for media integration, animation or streaming of 2-D, 3-D, video and audio support DirectX media (ActiveMovie 2.0).</li>
</ul>
