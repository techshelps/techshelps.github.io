<h3>What Does the &quot;Designed for Windows NT and Windows 95&quot; Logo Mean&#63;</h3>
<p>
The Designed for Windows<sup> </sup>NT and Windows 95 Logo Program was developed by Microsoft to help end users easily identify desktop hardware and software products that were designed specifically for the Microsoft&reg; Windows&reg; family of 32-bit operating systems, Windows&nbsp;NT&reg;&nbsp;Workstation (hereafter referred to as Windows NT) and Windows 95. Users can mix and match hardware and software products with the Designed for Windows NT and Windows 95 Logo and be assured that the products will take advantage of the new technologies integrated into both of these operating systems. As a software vendor, licensing the Logo enables you to use the Logo on your product packaging, advertising, collateral, and other marketing materials. This signals to customers that your product is:
<ul>
<li>
<b>&quot;Tested&quot;</b> - Your product has been tested and is fully functional on both Windows NT and Windows&nbsp;95.<br><br></li>
<li>
<b>&quot;Best User Experience&quot;</b> - Your product has been designed to provide optimum usability and to ensure a consistent, accessible user experience.<br><br></li>
<li>
<b>&quot;Works well with Others&quot;</b> - You designed your product to take advantage of the latest software &amp; hardware technologies available on Microsoft Windows NT &amp; Windows 95.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<b>Operating System Versions to Which This Logo Applies</b></p>
<p>
In order to receive the Designed for Windows NT and Windows 95 Logo, all requirements will be fully tested in parallel and must pass on the latest releases of both Windows NT Workstation (version 4.0 at the time of publication) and Windows 95. If your application runs <i>only </i>on Windows 3.X, <i>only</i> on Windows 95*, or <i>only</i> on Windows NT, do not submit your application for this Logo. If your application runs on Windows NT 3.51, but not on Windows NT 4.0, do not submit your application for this Logo.</p>
<p>
There is no Microsoft Logo program for Windows NT alone for software.</p>
<p>
<b>*Special message to Games vendors using Direct3D or DirectSound</b></p>
<p>
If your application does not run on Windows NT because it uses Direct3D or DirectSound, you may choose to submit your application for the Designed for Windows 95 Logo.  To license this Logo your application must pass all the same requirements found in this Handbook, but your application is not required to run on Windows NT.  <i>Only applications that fail on Windows NT due to their use of Direct3D or DirectSound are eligible for the Designed for Windows 95 Logo.  The Designed for Windows 95 Logo is no longer available for any other applications. </i> For more information refer to the Games &amp; Multimedia Applications section.</p>
<p>
<b>Other Microsoft Logo Programs</b></p>
<p>
The Designed for Windows NT and Windows 95 Logo is for commercially marketed desktop applications that run primarily on Windows NT Workstation and Windows 95. It is not for client/server applications or Windows NT Server-based applications. If your application is a client/server application or runs primarily on Windows&nbsp;NT Server, you should consider applying for the Designed&nbsp;for&nbsp;BackOffice&reg;&nbsp;Logo. Receiving the Designed for Windows&nbsp;NT&nbsp;and&nbsp;Windows 95 Logo <i>is not</i> a requirement for receiving the Designed&nbsp;for&nbsp;BackOffice&nbsp;Logo. For additional information on the BackOffice&nbsp;Logo, see <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/backoffice/designed">http://www.microsoft.com/backoffice/designed</a> or send an e-mail message to bckoffc@microsoft.com.</p>
<p>
Microsoft also offers the Microsoft Office Compatible Logo Program. The Designed for Windows NT and Windows 95 Logo <i>is</i> now a requirement for receiving the Microsoft Office Compatible Logo. For additional information on the Microsoft Office Compatible Logo program, see <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/office/compatible">http://www.microsoft.com/office/compatible/</a> or send an e-mail message to offcomp@microsoft.com.</p>
<p>
<b>Testing</b></p>
<p>
Software applications are tested by an independent laboratory, VeriTest, Inc. (<a href="http://www.veritest.com/labs/logolab/Microsoft/microsoft(f).htm">http://www.veritest.com/labs/logolab/Microsoft/microsoft(f).htm</a> or send an e-mail to logolab@veritest.com).</p>
<p>
The Designed for Windows NT and Windows 95 Logo indicates that a software product provides all the features outlined in this handbook; it is not a “quality assurance” seal. Neither Microsoft nor the testing organization will be testing the quality of your product or ensuring that it is “bug-free.”  The testing organization’s job is just to make sure that your product has full functionality, that the Logo features are present, and that your product is not generating frequent faults or system crashes.</p>
<p>
Please note that the license agreement states:</p>
<p>
You may only use the Logo as a symbol that your Product is compatible with Microsoft Windows NT and Windows 95. You may not explicitly state or imply that Microsoft or the testing organization in any way endorses your product. Also, the Windows NT and Windows 95 Logo program is not intended to be a “certification” program, that is, the Logo does not represent that Microsoft or the testing organization certifies your product(s) in any way.</p>
