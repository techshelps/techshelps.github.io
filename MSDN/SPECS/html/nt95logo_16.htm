<h4>UNC/LFN Support</h4>
<p>
<b>Required:<BR></b>Your application must support the Universal Naming Convention (UNC). UNC paths allow logical connections to network devices without the need to specifically reference a network drive letter. Your application does not need to be network-aware per se, but it does need to work seamlessly in a network environment. The system must be able to locate the network server and path with the UNC name even over a modem connection. Supporting UNC does <i>not</i> mean that the application is disallowed from presenting network drive letters to users. It merely means that the user must have the option of using only the UNC path name.</p>
<p>
<b>NOTE&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </b>An LFN is 260 characters, which in general includes 3 bytes for &quot;<b>&lt;driveletter&gt;:\</b>&quot;, 255 bytes for the filename+extension, and 2 bytes for the null terminator. A UNC path has 2 bytes for &quot;<b>\\</b>&quot; instead of 3 bytes for &quot;<b>&lt;driveletter&gt;:\</b>&quot;, and the path may not include an extension (filetype).</p>
<p>
<b>Required:<BR></b>If your application saves files that are exposed to the user, your application must support LFNs with all of the following required features:
<ul>
<li>
Users must be able to enter names of 255 characters, including all uppercase and lowercase standard characters, embedded spaces, embedded periods, etc.<br><br></li>
<li>
Leading and trailing spaces must be stripped by the Save As command. To test this, enter a name with leading and trailing spaces, such as “####This is a test###”, retrieve the file, and then make sure the spaces are deleted.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<b>NOTE&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </b> Here and throughout this handbook, the number sign (#) indicates a spacebar space.
<ul>
<li>
Question marks anywhere in the file name must prevent the file from being saved. No error message needs to be displayed.<br><br></li>
<li>
The characters within the quotation marks “ +  ,  ;  =  [  ] ” must be supported anywhere in the name, including leading and trailing. These should not cause any error conditions.  (NOTE&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; support for leading and trailing periods has been dropped from the Logo requirements.)</li>
</ul>
<p>
<b><BR> Required:<BR></b>If a file name is fully exposed in Windows Explorer, it must be a fully supported LFN.  Applications are allowed to use “labeling schemes” in which a user is saving, for example, a report type or a game state, without actually creating a file that is exposed to the user in Windows Explorer.</p>
<p>
<b>Required:<BR></b>The application must use LFNs for displaying all documents and data files in the shell, in title bars, in dialog boxes and controls, and with icons.</p>
<p>
<b>Required:<BR></b>You must test your LFN functionality on Windows NT FAT, NTFS, and compressed NTFS partitions.</p>
