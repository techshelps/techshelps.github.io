<h4>Stability &amp; Functionality</h4>
<p>
The following are some of the tests we will run to test the stability &amp; functionality of your product. You can pretest your product prior to submitting for Logo testing using the following.</p>
<p>
<b><small>ON WINDOWS 95</b></small>
<ol>
<li>
Find the Stress application in the Win32 SDK (\mstools\bin\win95\stress.exe), and select the following options: User Heap, GDI Heap, Wind32 Heap, Menu32 Heap, GDI32 Heap. Then set the Level to 2. Now execute the Stress program.<br><br></li>
<li>
With Stress running, start your product from its icon.<br><br></li>
<li>
Exercise all of your product’s functions, and make sure they are stable even when the system is under stress.<br><br></li>
<li>
Switch video modes “on the fly,” and make sure your product is still operational.<br><br></li>
<li>
Test printing and all other input/output functions supported.<br><br></li>
<li>
Close Stress, and then start one popular 16-bit application and one popular 32-bit application to see whether your product will still run without problems while these are active.</li>
</ol>
<p>
<b><small>ON WINDOWS NT</b></small>
<ol>
<li>
Start the Performance Monitor (Perfmon.exe).<br><br></li>
<li>
Choose to view counters from “Memory,” “Objects,” and any other object-types that are relevant to your application.<br><br></li>
<li>
Run your application for extended periods of time, exercising all of your product’s functions, and ensure that all systematic changes in system resources are accounted for.<br><br></li>
<li>
Switch video modes “on the fly,” and make sure your product is still operational (not supported on Windows NT prior to version 4.0).</li>
</ol>
