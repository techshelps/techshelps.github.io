<h4>Support for the Internet</h4>
<p>
<b>Required:<BR></b>Authors of ActiveX&reg; Controls must digitally sign their controls, as specified in the ActiveX SDK.  Controls should also be marked “safe for persistence” as appropriate. For more information, see the ActiveX SDK at <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/IntDev/sdk">http://www.microsoft.com/IntDev/sdk</a>.</p>
<p>
<b>Recommended:<BR></b>In addition to the above requirements, the following behaviors are recommended:
<ul>
<li>
Authors of ActiveX Controls should provide support for automatic code download.  If the control is a single file, then no additional work is required.  If multiple files are required, then a .cab, .inf, or a self-extracting executable should be provided. Refer to the Internet Component Download spec in the ActiveX SDK.<br><br></li>
<li>
Any code intended to be downloaded from the Internet should support Authenticode signing.  Commercial publishers should obtain a digital signature from http://www.microsoft.com/workshop/prog/security/authcode/certs-f.htm  Executables should be signed to allow users to identify provenance, using procedures and technology found at http://www.microsoft.com/workshop/prog/security/authcode/codesign-f.htm<br><br></li>
<li>
Applications should register an Internet update site for the application when installing.  This site will provide information about upgrades available for the application.  Upgrades should be made available for user-initiated download.  See the Installation section for more information about how to include this URL in the registry.<br><br></li>
<li>
Applications should also register a general product information site when installing.  See the Installation section for more information about how to include this URL in the registry.<br><br></li>
<li>
Applications, tools, controls, or any other software that installs or sets up DLLs should honor the ModuleUsage registry section described in the appendix of the ActiveX SDK.<br><br></li>
<li>
Your application should support WinSock 2.  Note that support for the Broadcast PC capabilities of future versions of Windows will require WinSock 2.  For more information on writing WinSock 2 applications refer to the Win32 SDK online documentation. <br><br></li>
<li>
Your application should expose the Help files as HTML. Over time, Microsoft will phase out support for the WinHelp engine, and replace it with Web-based help.<br><br></li>
<li>
Your application should have an FTP save option, enabling a user to save to an FTP site in the same way as they can save to the local drive or to a network drive.<br><br></li>
<li>
Your application should produce documents that can be viewed from a browser. You can do this either by implementing a “Save As HTML” feature, or by adding ActiveX Document (docobj) support to your application. See the ActiveX SDK for more information about adding ActiveX Documents.</li>
