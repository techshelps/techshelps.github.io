<h4>Java Applications</h4>
<p>
A Java application, for the purposes of this Logo program, is defined as any application written in the Java programming language that requires a Java virtual machine to run.  This section details the requirements and exemptions applicable to Java applications.</p>
<p>
<b>Required:<BR></b>To qualify for the Logo, a Java application, when running on a Windows PC, must use and re-distribute the Microsoft Win32 virtual machine for Java.  For more information about using and re-distributing the Microsoft virtual machine refer to <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/java">http://www.microsoft.com/java</a> or the Microsoft SDK for Java.</p>
<p>
<b>Exemption:<BR></b>Java applications are not required to be an OLE server or container.</p>
<p>
<b>Exemption:<BR></b>Java applications are temporarily exempt from providing support for high contrast, from supporting full functionality through the keyboard, and from exposing the keyboard focus as outlined in the UI section. </p>
<p>
Popular class libraries such as AFC 4.0 will provide support for these accessibility features in the future.  Thus vendors should expect this temporary exemption to be removed from future versions of the logo program.</p>
<p>
<b>Required:<BR></b>Java applications must follow all other Logo requirements that apply to any functionality they provide.</p>
<p>
<b>Examples:</b> 
<ul>
<li>
Java applications must provide automated installers and uninstallers that meet the requirements of the Install and Uninstall sections of this handbook.  (Note that the VM is considered a core component and must not be uninstalled.)<br><br></li>
<li>
Java applications that use native data file types must register them and their icons.</li>
</ul>
