<h4>Add-On Products</h4>
<p>
Add-on products are accessory products, such as wizards, templates, and macros, which are not executable files. If a wizard, template, or macro is always packaged <i>only</i> with the 32-bit product it supports, it is considered part of that product for Logo testing. This section applies only to add-on products that are packaged and marketed <i>separately</i> from the product they support.</p>
<p>
<b>Exception:<BR></b>An add-on product does not have to be an executable (.exe).</p>
<p>
<b>Required:<BR></b>To qualify for the Logo, add-ons must be used by a 32-bit product that is compliant with Designed for Windows NT and Windows 95 Logo.  (This does not <i>require</i> the host product to license the Logo.)</p>
<p>
<b>Required:<BR></b>If the separately marketed add-on products are also included in a suite of applications, they must be tested separately and with the suite for the add-on to qualify for the Designed for Windows NT and Windows 95 Logo.</p>
<p>
<b>Required:<BR></b>Add-on products must follow all other Logo requirements that apply to any functionality they provide.</p>
<p>
<b>Examples:</b> 
<ul>
<li>
Any executable code in the add-on products must be 32-bit code.<br><br></li>
<li>
Add-on products must provide automated installers and uninstallers that follow the user interface rules as defined in UI/Shell.<br><br></li>
<li>
Add-on products that use native data file types must register them and their icons.<br><br></li>
<li>
Add-on products that use the mouse or keyboard, or that draw on the screen must support the Accessibility requirements.</li>
</ul>
