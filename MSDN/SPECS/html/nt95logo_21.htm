<h4>Development Tools</h4>
<p>
Development tools are products such as languages and compilers that create executable files or interpreted code modules that mimic the action of executable files when used with a run-time engine of the developing application. These products must meet all the general requirements, with the following additions and exceptions.</p>
<p>
<b>Exception:<BR></b>OLE drag-and-drop support is not required within the tool’s design environment.</p>
<p>
<b>Required:<BR></b>If Windows is one of the compiler’s or development tool’s target platforms, then the product must be capable of generating applications that can meet all the Designed for Windows NT and Windows 95 Logo requirements.</p>
<p>
<b>Exception:<BR></b>Development tools which create Java applications do not need to meet the above requirement.</p>
<p>
<b>Exception:<BR></b>Certain “interactive entertainment authoring tools” are not required to create applications that support OLE and UNC pathnames, as follows:
<ul>
<li>
When the interactive entertainment authoring tools are intended only for authoring non-file-based multimedia applications.<br><br></li>
<li>
Developers of this kind of tool must submit a sample application.<br><br></li>
<li>
Developers of this kind of tool must advise their customers that if they create a file-based application using this tool (whether or not they use other tools), in order for that application to be eligible for the Designed for Windows NT and Windows 95 Logo, it must meet the file-based requirements, including OLE support.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<b>Exception:<BR></b>Development tools are temporarily exempt from the requirement to expose the keyboard focus.  Vendors should be aware that this exemption will be removed in the next update of the Logo Handbook.</p>
<p>
<b>Required:<BR></b>The development tool must provide an easy point-and-shoot way (commonly known as wizards or experts) to create applications with OLE container or object server, or provide this functionality by default.</p>
<p>
<b>Required:<BR></b>Development tools are required to submit a sample application in uncompiled form for testing. When compiled, this application must demonstrate the following:
<ul>
<li>
The Win32 PE format.<br><br></li>
<li>
Large and Small Icons for its executable file.<br><br></li>
<li>
The ability to save/retrieve files with LFNs.<br><br></li>
<li>
The ability to save/retrieve files with UNC file names.<br><br></li>
<li>
OLE Container and/or Server drag and drop functionality.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<b>Exception:<BR></b>Sample applications do not need to meet any of the other Windows Logo requirements, such as install/uninstall, etc.</p>
<p>
<b>Recommended:<BR></b>Development tools should provide the ability to create applications that use multiple threads.</p>
