<h4>Non-file-based Applications</h4>
<p>
The following points define a file-based application and a non-file-based application:
<ul>
<li>
A non-file-based application is one that is <i>not</i> primarily used to create, edit, and save files (although file operations may be common ancillary tasks).<ul>
<li>
Many accounting packages and Personal Information Manager (PIM) products are considered non-file-based applications. If you’re uncertain whether your product is considered non-file-based, please explain your case in the Vendor Questionnaire.<br><br></li>
<li>
Generally, applications that run exclusively in full-screen mode are not, for Logo purposes, considered file-based. An application that runs exclusively in full-screen mode is one that cannot, for example, be windowed or resized. <br><br></li>
<li>
File-based applications have as their primary purpose the creation and editing of documents and include Open, Save, and Close commands, typically on the File menu of the application.<br><br></li>
<li>
The primary purpose of applications such as Microsoft Word and Microsoft Excel is to allow the user to create, edit, and manipulate files. Therefore, they do need to support the requirements for file-based applications in order to be eligible to license the Designed for Windows NT and Windows 95.<br><br></li>
<li>
Utilities are considered non-file-based applications.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<b>Exception:<BR></b>If your product is a non-file-based application, the requirements to support OLE and UNC pathnames do not apply. A direct example of this might be a utility, multimedia reference title, a game, or applications like Terminal and Clock, which for the most part do not save files in any way and, if they do, it’s done as a facility for saving user profiles, for example.</p>
