<b>Tested &amp; Reliable</b></dt>
<dd>
<b>Basics</b>:  Applications must be functional &amp; stable on both Windows NT 4.0 and Windows 95.  Applications &amp; components must be 32-bit.  Each product in a bundle of apps must pass Logo requirements for the bundle to carry the Logo.<br>
</dd>
<dt>
<b>Best User Experience</b></dt>
<dd>
<b>Installation</b>:  Applications must provide graphical install, properly register all components, auto-detect the OS onto which they're installing and default installation to the &quot;drive:\Program Files&quot; directory.  Applications must pretest using Install Analyzer tool.<p>
<b>Uninstall</b>: Applications must completely uninstall from a system by means of an automated, registered uninstaller.  Applications must not remove core components or shared components necessary to other applications.</p>
<p>
<b>UI/Shell</b>: Applications must use system metrics, must support the high contrast viewing option, must provide keyboard access to all features, and expose keyboard focus to enable accessibility aids such as screen magnifier accessories.</p>
