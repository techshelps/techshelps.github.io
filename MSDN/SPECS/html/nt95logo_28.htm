<h4>UI/Shell</h4>
<p>
<b>Verification of High Contrast Support:<BR></b>You can easily verify most of the settings related to size, color, and fonts. Click the <b>Display</b> tab on the Accessibility Options box in Control Panel. Choose Settings and verify that the &quot;White on Black&quot; option is selected. Apply these settings. Then go back into your product and test the major screens, dialog boxes, and controls to ensure that these changes have been properly reflected. The application should still be usable. Screen elements should be displayed correctly and be compatible with the appearance scheme. For example, make sure that text contrasts with its background, that graphics on toolbar buttons are distinguishable, and that menus and scroll bars have the appropriate sizes. You can also experiment with appearance schemes by clicking the <b>Appearance</b> tab on the Display box in Control Panel. </p>
<p>
<b>Verification of Exposure of Keyboard Focus:<BR></b>Use the screen magnification accessory that is included with the Active Accessibility SDK. The magnifier must accurately track the location of the keyboard focus when the focus is moved.  Check to ensure that it tracks the focus in both documents and toolbars.  This will also be included with future versions of the operating system. </p>
