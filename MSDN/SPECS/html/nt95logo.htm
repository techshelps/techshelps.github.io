<h2>Designed for Microsoft<sup>&reg; </sup>Windows NT<sup>&reg;</sup> and Windows<sup>&reg; </sup>95</h2>
<h1>Logo Handbook for Software Applications</h1>
<h5>Version 3.0<BR>May 7th, 1997</h5>
<h3>Welcome</h3>
<p>
Welcome to the Logo Handbook.  So, your first impression probably is that this is a <i>big</i> document.  Don't be intimidated!  It's not as hard as it looks &amp; your products probably fulfill most of the Logo requirements already.</p>
<p>
So, then why is this Handbook so large?  There are two reasons:</p>
<p>
First, we've gone to great lengths to explain &amp; detail exactly what each requirement means, how to implement it, and why we believe it's important to defining a Designed for Windows application.  Based on feedback from our Logo Partners, we've found that developers appreciate getting the most specific, detailed information possible about the requirements and recommendations.  <i>So we've been thorough.</i></p>
<p>
Second, we've done a great deal of research into understanding what customers think of as an ideal application. We've worked with our Logo Partners, with end users, and with major corporations to develop the recommendations you will find in this Handbook.  This document is a way for us to share this information with you, our current &amp; future Logo Partners, to enable you to leverage not only the Windows brand, but also the valuable feedback that Microsoft hears everyday from our customers.  <i>To this end, we've been explicit about the new recommendations, and that too made the Handbook a little longer.</i></p>
<p>
Additionally, to help make this Handbook a little easier to use, we've added a summary page - a quick overview of the logo requirements.  Check it out - it is in section 5, just before the Detailed Specifications section.  Do not forget this is not a substitute for careful reading of the specific requirements, but it will give you a good overview of the program.</p>
<p>
Finally, we look forward to welcoming you to the Microsoft Windows Logo Partnership.</p>
<p>
Sincerely,</p>
<p>
The Windows Logo Team</p>
