<H2>Finding Precise Frames</H2>  </P>
A frame directory can help locate data in a compressed file because it can indicate a suitable key frame image to act as a starting point. However, there still might be a significant delay until a requested image is displayed. For example, a file might have a large number of interframe encoded images the device must decode before it can display them. In an extreme case, a motion video file might be entirely interframe encoded, with the exception of its initial image. </P>
To handle delays associated with interframe encoding, the digital video command set includes the <B>seek exactly</B> flag for the <B>set</B> command (for example, <B>set</B> <I>device name</I> <B>seek</B> <B>exactly</B> <B>on)</B>. With <B>seek exactly</B> enabled, a <B>seek</B> command, or a <B>play</B> command with the <B>from</B> flag, will go to the precise frame specified by the command. This can cause a significant delay as the device locates and decompresses the frame. With <B>seek exactly</B> disabled, the file will be positioned to a (optimally) nearby, previous key frame image. An application can determine the approximate location of the nearest preceding key frame image by using the <B>status</B> <I>device name</I> <B>reference</B> command. This is only approximate, because a frame directory might be required to efficiently determine the precise location of this image. The exact location can be determined by using the <B>status</B> <I>device name</I> <B>position</B> command after using the <B>seek</B> command. Because implementation of the <B>seek</B> <B>exactly</B> mode is tricky, especially with out of order algorithms such as MPEG, the default is device dependent.</P>
