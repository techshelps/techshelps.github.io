<H2>Frame Numbering and Time Formats</H2>  </P>
All digital-video devices must support the frames time format. A frame is a complete image, typically intended for playback at 30 frames per second. Visual material originating on film will have a natural frame rate of 24 frames per second. PAL-originated material will have a frame rate of 25 frames per second.</P>
With a time format of frames, there is a potential "off-by-one" ambiguity. This section provides guidelines for avoiding such ambiguities. To simplify the discussion, assume that <B>seek exactly</B> is enabled. The following guidelines define frame numbering:</P>
<SPAN CLASS="list"><UL><LI>    Frames are numbered from an arbitrary origin. (An application can determine the origin with <B>status</B> <B>start</B> <B>position</B>.)</LI><LI>    The initial state of the workspace with new contents is stopped, positioned at <B>status</B> <B>start</B> <B>position</B>. This occurs after an <B>open</B> or <B>load </B>operation, and when a <B>monitor file</B> is sent after recording is completed. </LI><LI>    A paused device instance returns the number of the frame currently in the frame buffer in response to <B>status position</B>.</LI><LI>    When the <B>seek to </B>and <B>play to</B> commands complete, the current position and image shown is specified in the <B>to</B> parameter. Some devices will be <B>stopped</B>, some devices will be <B>paused</B>.</LI><LI>    For the <B>play to</B> command, all frames up to and including the <B>to</B> position are shown but no audio associated with the <B>to</B> position is played. For example, the command <B>play from 3 to 5</B> will show three frames of video but the duration of audio played is equivalent to two frames.</LI><LI>    A frame number one greater than the last frame in the file is a valid argument for <B>cue output to</B>,<B> play to</B>,<B> </B>or <B>seek to</B>. This frame is referred to as the "final valid frame". Values larger than this cause a range error. When the device reaches this position, it displays the same image associated with the last frame in the file. This final valid frame number equals <B>status start position </B>plus <B>status length</B>.
For example, if a file contains ten frames and the first is frame one, frames one through eleven are valid frames. Frame eleven shows the same image as frame ten.</P></LI><LI>    The default final position for a <B>play</B> command without a specified end position, or for a <B>seek to end </B>command, is the final valid frame.</LI><LI>    A command specifying a frame prior to the <B>status start position</B> causes a range error.</LI><LI>    On a <B>stop </B>command, the <B>status position</B> of a device instance does not change. </LI><LI>    When <B>seek exactly</B> is off, a <B>play</B> command without a <B>from</B> position will not necessarily start from the current position, because such a <B>play</B> has an implied initial <B>seek</B>, which might find an earlier key frame image. </LI><LI>    When <B>seek exactly</B> is off, and a file contains interframe encoded images, if a <B>seek</B> command specifies an interframe encoded image, the actual frame reached by the device will be an key frame image prior to the specified frame. The <B>status position</B> command will return the actual frame reached.</LI></UL></SPAN> </P></BODY></HTML>
