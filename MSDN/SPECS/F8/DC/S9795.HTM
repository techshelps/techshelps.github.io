The rectangle specifies the region of the external input used as the source for the pixels compressed and saved. This rectangle defaults to the rectangle specified (or defaulted) by the MCI_DGV_PUT_VIDEO flag for the MCI_PUT command. When it is set differently than the video rectangle, what is displayed is not what is recorded.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP">MCI_DGV_RECORD_AUDIO_STREAM</P></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP">Specifies an audio-stream number is included in the <B>dwAudioStream</B> field of the data structure identified by <I>lParam2</I>.

If one of these commands has not been executed, MCI_RECORD performs an implied reserve, using device-specific default parameters. The algorithm and quality level for the stored data is set with the MCI_SETAUDIO and MCI_SETVIDEO commands. There may be device-specific limitations on what other device driver instances might be doing during recording. </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP"></P></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP">When data is recorded into an existing sequence, the contents of the original file are not changed until the changes are explicitly saved with MCI_SAVE. However, MCI_PLAY plays the data as if the newly recorded data were present. If there is a file in the workspace that has data following the explicit or implied starting position, and the device driver cannot guarantee it will preserve this data, it rejects the command by returning MCIERR_UNSUPPORTED_FUNCTION.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP"><B>See Also</B> </P></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP">MCI_CUE, MCI_PAUSE, MCI_PLAY, MCI_RESUME, MCI_SEEK</P></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>
