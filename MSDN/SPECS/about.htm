<H1>About this Specification</H1>

<P>This specification details the format of OpenType fonts, the TrueType and CFF outline formats, and the TrueType hinting language. Adobe and Microsoft have both contributed material to this document. Because OpenType is an extension of TrueType, there is also information in this document that was originally authored by Apple.

<P>Many references to both TrueType and PostScript exist throughout this document, as OpenType fonts combine the two technologies.

<P>If you have comments or suggestions about this document, please send mail to the <A HREF="mailto:ttwsite@Microsoft.com">Microsoft Typography Group.</a>
