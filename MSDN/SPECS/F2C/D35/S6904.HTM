<H4>C.3.2. Glyph components</H4>With this system, there are separate glyph components that are superimposed to get the proper appearance for the syllable block. Although the components correspond to the jamos, each jamo may need more than one corresponding glyph, since the exact shape of the glyph will depend on the context. For example, some systems use about 500 glyphs to get reasonably good shapes (though not up to the same quality of a full set of 11,172 glyphs). Once again, since there is a simple algorithmic mapping between sequences of modern jamos and the possible syllable block values (see above), there is essentially no difference in overhead in using jamos versus precomposed syllable blocks.</P>
