<H3>1.1. About This Document</H3>The body of this document describes the new characters and semantics in Unicode 1.1. Section 2.0 (Changes in Unicode 1.0) describes the changes that were made to Unicode 1.0 in the process of alignment with 10646. Section 3.0 (New Character Semantics) provides descriptions of character semantics incorporated into 10646, including double diacritics and the additional format characters. Section 4.0 (Additional Character Semantics) provides additional clarifications of character semantics and usage for volumes 1 and 2, including Unicode character equivalence. Section 5.0 (Conjoining Korean Jamos) describes the semantics of the new conjoining jamos, and how to use them to form Hangul syllables.</P>
The appendixes contain information referenced by the text. Appendix A (Errata) and Appendix B (Han Compatibility Mappings) list errata from Volume 2. Appendix C (Implementing Korean Jamos) describes implementation issues involved in implementing conjoining jamos. Appendix D (Canonical Ordering Priorities) lists the canonical ordering priorities used by the character equivalence algorithm in Section 4.4. Appendix E (Block Names) lists the new block names, which are now aligned with 10646. Appendix F (FSS-UTF) discusses a transformation format of 10646 (and thereby Unicode) for 8-bit environments. Appendix G (Symmetric Swapping Characters) lists characters referenced by Section 3.4.1. Appendix H (New Characters) lists the new characters1 introduced in the alignment with 10646. Appendix I (Unicode 1.1 Character List) contains a complete list of names for all characters in Unicode 1.1—including all Unicode 1.0 characters2—with their new names and the maximal decompositions.</P></BODY></HTML>
