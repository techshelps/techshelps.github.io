<H3>C.1. Coverage</H3>The conjoining jamos from U+1100 to U+11FF provide for full coverage of modern Korean syllable blocks, as well as for all old Korean syllable blocks.</P>
The 2,350 precomposed syllable blocks in Unicode 1.0 provide for the most common syllable blocks in modern Hangul. The Supplementary Sets A and B provide an additional set of precomposed characters. The Korean national standards organizations intended these sets to be used together with the private use zone to supply the additional characters needed to complete the 11,172 modern Korean syllable blocks.</P></BODY></HTML>
