<H3>3.4. Additional Alternate Format Characters</H3>The following format characters were introduced as a result of the merger with 10646:</P>
<UL><LI><FONT FACE="Symbol"></FONT>    The symmetric swapping format characters can be used to control the glyphs used to represent characters such as "(".</LI><LI><FONT FACE="Symbol"></FONT>    The character shaping selectors could be used to control the shaping behavior of the Arabic compatibility characters.</LI><LI><FONT FACE="Symbol"></FONT>    The numeric shape selectors codes could be used to override the normal shapes of the Western Digits.</LI></UL>However, the use of the character shaping selectors and digit shapes codes from ISO/IEC 10646-1 is strongly discouraged in Unicode. Instead, the appropriate character codes should be used. For example, if the Arabic digit forms are desired, then the explicit characters should be used, such as U+0660 ARABIC-INDIC DIGIT ZERO. Similarly, if contextual forms for Arabic characters are desired, then the nominal characters should be used, and not the presentation forms with the shaping selectors.</P></BODY></HTML>
