<H1>1.0   Introduction</H1>The Microsoft Flash File System (FFS) is a file system that makes flash memory media appear as a readable and writeable disk drive.</P>
1.0   FLASH File System</P>
FFS treats the media as a collection of relatively large blocks (erase blocks) that are all identical in size.  A portion of the space in each block is dedicated to storing the block's statistics.  The remainder of the space within a block is used for directory and file control structures and file data.  Space is allocated on a byte-by-byte basis.  Directory and file control structures and file data are distributed throughout the media. As files are deleted, space is deallocated. </P>
 The file system determines when deallocated space within a block should be reclaimed for reuse.  When deallocated space reclamation is performed, fragmentation that would have resulted from the reclamation process is also eliminated.  After reclamation, the free space within a block appears after any allocated space remaining in the block.</P></BODY></HTML>
