<H1>4.0   Media Partitioning</H1>The recommended method of describing the partitioning of flash media is to use the device tuples defined in the PC Card metaformat specification. Note that these tuples, if stored in common memory, will consume an entire block.  A file system partition cannot contain anything except the file structures and data managed by the file system.</P>
A formatting or partitioning utility for flash media must place the partition information in a memory space within the media appropriate to the media implementation. The file system itself does not rely on device tuple information to determine how the media is partitioned.  The file system only relies on the boot record to obtain a partition's characteristics.</P></BODY></HTML>
