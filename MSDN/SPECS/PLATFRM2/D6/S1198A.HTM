<H3>Making Computers Accessible</H3>  </P>
Accessibility means designing computer software to accommodate a wide range of users, including users with disabilities. Although no software can be accessible to everyone, a few simple steps can greatly increase the number of people who can use an application. Special needs can be addressed in the following ways:</P>
<SPAN CLASS="list"><UL><LI>New features can be built into hardware and operating systems that help make them more accessible to users with and without specialized needs. This solution is preferred because the features are available on all workstations and can be used with all "well-behaved" applications (that is, applications that follow standard programming practices and implement the guidelines described in this document). However, some issues cannot be addressed at a system level.</LI><LI>Accessibility aids can modify the system making it usable by more people. These aids work with all well-behaved applications, but they are not available when the user moves to a new computer. In addition, many people who could benefit from such aids never obtain them.</LI><LI>Specialized applications, such as word processors, can be designed to integrate voice and text to help individuals with limited reading and writing skills. A few of these applications are available, but in general, people with disabilities need to use mainstream applications to cooperate with their coworkers and to take advantage of the latest mainstream features.</LI><LI>Usability features can be built into mainstream applications, making them easier for people with disabilities to use. Examples include customizable colors and access keys, which can only be provided by the application itself. Often, these features also benefit people who do not have disabilities. Mainstream applications can also be made compatible with accessibility aids.</LI></UL></SPAN> </P></BODY></HTML>
