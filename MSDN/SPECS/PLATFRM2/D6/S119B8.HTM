<H3>Defining Application-Specific Sound Events</H3>  </P>
You should allow the user to customize the way your application uses sounds by defining as many new sound events as possible. In Windows 95 and Windows NT, sound events are defined in the registry, and the user can use Control Panel to associate any sound, or no sound, with each event. You can have most of your events generate no sounds by default, but the user who desires additional audio feedback can use Control Panel to add their own sounds. This capability is especially useful for people with visual and some types of cognitive impairments.</P>
For more information about playing sounds, see, "Playing Sounds Specified In the Registry," in the Win32 SDK.</P>
