<H3>Positioning Related Items near Each Other</H3>  </P>
You should try to arrange related items near each other. Because a person with low vision or tunnel vision can only see a portion of the screen at a time, this arrangement helps reduce the amount of work the person has to do to shift their gaze back and forth between related items. It also makes relationships clearer to all users.</P>
