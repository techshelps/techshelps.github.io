<H3>Adjusting General User Interface Timings</H3>  </P>
Any timed behavior should be adjustable by the user. Some individuals have slower than average reaction times, and it can be difficult for them to use features that rely on fixed timings. Examples of this include the autoscrolling that takes place when the user drags towards the edge of a window or holds down the mouse button over a scroll bar. In some cases, you should allow the user to turn off timed behavior altogether. An example of this would be any event that happens automatically when the mouse or keyboard focus pauses over on an object for specific amount of time.</P>
