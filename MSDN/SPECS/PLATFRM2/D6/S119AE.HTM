<H3>Selectable Font Sizes</H3>  </P>
The best way to satisfy users who prefer small type and those who require larger type is to allow them to choose the typeface and size that best fit their needs. This simple feature can make applications seem more user-friendly.</P>
The preferred approach is to provide a menu option or property sheet where the user can choose the font using the standard Font Selection dialog box. A second approach is to automatically resize the fonts when the user resizes the window, but this approach is less flexible because the user cannot use a large font in a small window with scroll bars.</P>
The following example illustrates selectable font sizes. The FaxFire application is used to drive a fax card connected to a user's computer. It has a window that shows a list of all the faxes that the user has sent or received during the last month with each line showing information for a single fax: its date, destination, and so on. The line has a maximum length of 50 characters, and because it is always drawn in a 10 point font, the window is a fixed size. However, some users have complained about the fixed font size. How can the font size be fixed?</P>
With a minimal amount of work, a Font command can be added to one of the menus that enables the user to choose a font using the standard Font Selection dialog box provided in the Windows common dialog box library. When the application draws its text, it uses the font that the user has requested. In case the font selection makes some of the information extend beyond the edge of the window, the window can be changed to be resizable and be given scroll bars. The total amount of work required to fix the font sizing problem is quite reasonable.</P>
