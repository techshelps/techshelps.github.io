<H3>Binding Documents to Lie Flat</H3>  </P>
Printed documentation can be bound in a large number of different ways, but comb and spiral bindings are generally considered the most accessible because they allow a document to lie flat. These types of bindings are useful for people with motion or visual impairments; for example, a person who is quadriplegic may lie the book flat and turn the pages with a pencil, a person who is blind may run it through a flatbed scanner to use optical-character recognition for conversion to an online format, and a person with low vision might use a closed-caption television system to enlarge the pages. Flat bindings are also preferred by people who want to be able to type while reading.</P>
Generally, the choice of binding is made on a purely economic basis. Often a method such as perfect (glue) binding is considerably cheaper than other alternatives, but it is not particularly convenient for users with disabilities.</P>
