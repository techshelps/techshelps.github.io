<H3>Turning Off Sounds</H3>  </P>
You should give the user the option to turn off sounds that your application makes, because sounds can be distracting or annoying for some people, such as those who are deaf or hard-of-hearing, or be inappropriate in some environments, such as crowded or public spaces. This is especially true of decorative sounds or sounds that are redundant to information on the screen.</P>
If you do not want to provide your own option to turn off sounds, you can check the SM_BEEP option using the <B>GetSystemMetrics </B>function. If this option is FALSE, the user has chosen to turn off the standard system beep, and you can infer that they also want other sounds turned off as well.</P>
