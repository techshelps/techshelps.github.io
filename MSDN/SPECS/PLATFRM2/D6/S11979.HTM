<H3>Background About the Accessibility Issue</H3>  </P>
Computer accessibility is becoming an increasingly important issue in the home and workplace. An estimated eight out of ten major corporations employ people with disabilities who may need to use computers as part of their jobs. Over 30 million people in the U.S. alone have disabilities that can be affected by the accessibility of computer software. In addition, as the population ages, more people experience functional limitations, causing computer accessibility to become a more important issue for everyone.</P>
Legislation in the U.S., such as the Americans with Disabilities Act (which affects private businesses with more than 15 employees) and Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act (which affects the federal government and organizations that receive government funding), has also brought accessibility issues to national attention in both the public and private sectors. Accessibility is also being incorporated into official and international standards for usability, such as ANSI 200.</P>
Microsoft&reg; Windows&reg; 95 incorporates many new features and enhancements designed to make the operating system more accessible to people with disabilities. Applications should also follow accessible design practices to make computing in the home, schools, and workplace more accessible to everyone.</P>
This document discusses how computers can be made accessible for people with disabilities and describes how to design and produce computer software that accommodates users with disabilities.</P>
