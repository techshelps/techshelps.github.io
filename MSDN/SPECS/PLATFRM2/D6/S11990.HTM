<H3>Documenting the Keyboard Interface</H3>  </P>
Complete documentation for the keyboard user interface should be included with an application. If an application provides keyboard commands and mechanisms, but lacks appropriate documentation for them, the features become essentially useless. If space is a problem, the keyboard interface can be described in another place, and cross-references to the information can be included in the primary documentation. However, keyboard access should not be categorized as a niche or specialty feature, because it is used and relied on by so many people.</P>
