<H3>Including Users with Disabilities in Usability Testing</H3>  </P>
If you perform usability testing, you can try to include subjects who have disabilities. You do not necessarily have to design special tests for these subjects, but you should watch to see how these individuals approach and perform the ordinary tasks you are already testing. It can be a very informative process, helping you learn about the different ways in which people work.</P>
