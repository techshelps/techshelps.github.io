<H3>Colors in Online Help</H3>  </P>
An author that is designing an online help topic can specify foreground and background colors, or use the color scheme selected by the user in Control Panel. If the author specifies his or her own color scheme, the user running Windows version 3. <I>x</I> or Windows NT version 3. <I>x</I> has no way to override the scheme and use a different set of colors. As a consequence, some users who require high-contrast colors schemes will not be able to make use of the help topic. (In Windows 95, the help system provides the user with the option to use only Control Panel colors. However, this option leads to having the topic appear different from the help author's preference.)</P>
If you want your online help to be usable by as many customers as possible, you should generally allow the user to choose their own color scheme rather than specifying one of your own choosing.</P>
