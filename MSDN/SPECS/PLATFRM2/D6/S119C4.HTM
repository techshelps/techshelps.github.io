<H3>Including Accessibility Sites in Beta Tests</H3>  </P>
The best way to find out if your product is really usable by people with disabilities is to actively solicit their feedback. Include those people in any beta or usability tests you run on your product or employ them on your staff. You can also send evaluation copies to organizations that represent or work with people with disabilities.</P>
You should also try to include companies who develop accessibility aids in your beta program. This will not only allow them to make sure their product works with your own, but also allow them to prepare any special configuration files or other items necessary to make the two products work well together. They can also provide you with valuable technical suggestions for improving your application's accessibility. For more information about accessibility aid manufacturers, see Appendix A, "Additional Resources."</P>
