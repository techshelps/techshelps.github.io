<H3>Testing for Compatibility with Accessibility Aids</H3>  </P>
Your application can be inaccessible if it has problems running with certain accessibility aids, such as screen review utilities, screen enlarger utilities, or voice input utilities. Even if you think of your product as an application, it is a development platform that accessibility aids must be compatible with.</P>
If possible, you should try to include a sampling of utilities in any compatibility testing you perform. To obtain a list of vendors and their utilities, see Appendix A, "Additional Resources."</P>
