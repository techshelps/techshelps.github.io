<H2>Drawing Operations</H2>  </P>
The type of drawing operation used can affect compatibility with screen review utilities. Screen review utilities watch calls to drawing functions and remember what text and graphics have been drawn and where. They also check textual attributes, such as font, size, formatting, and so on. In addition, they watch information being copied from one location to another and being erased or overwritten by other text or graphics. These utilities rely on being able to monitor normal Windows drawing operations.</P>
