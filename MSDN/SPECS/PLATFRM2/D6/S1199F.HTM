<H3>Identifying Windows for the User</H3>  </P>
You should try to assign a user-friendly caption to every window, whether or not it is visible on the screen. </P>
Every window can have a caption, whether or not it has a visible caption bar. Screen review utilities query this text by sending a WM_GETTEXT message and use it to identify the window to a user who is blind when the window receives focus or when the user issues a "What window am I working in?" query. Similarly, voice recognition and on-screen keyboard utilities use the caption as a command that the user can choose. However, for this to work, the application developer has to provide appropriate text when the window is created or by calling the <B>SetWindowText</B> function.</P>
Note that the need for captions applies to all windows — not only top-level windows but also to child windows, such as floating palettes, custom controls, and toolbars — and to panes within the same window frame when they are implemented as separate windows.</P>
