<H3>Customizing Color</H3>  </P>
For many people, color is a matter of preference. They may use Control Panel to choose a personal color scheme that they enjoy, but they do not mind and probably do not even notice if an application always draws its elements in a fixed color.</P>
However, for many users with visual impairments, color is critical. Many people require a reasonably high contrast between text and the background to be able to read. They may even need a particular scheme, such as white text on a black background, to prevent the background from "bleeding" over and obscuring the foreground text. Some people consider the default color scheme quite legible, but find that it causes eyestrain over longer periods of time. Still others, nearly 10% of males and 1% of females, have some form of color blindness that makes certain color combinations unreadable.</P>
