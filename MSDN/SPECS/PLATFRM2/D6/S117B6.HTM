The use of color can greatly enhance a user interface, but only if it is used appropriately. In general, your application should not convey information by color alone, because some people will not be able to see it. Color should only be used to enhance, emphasize, or reiterate information shown by other means. If your application must convey information through color, you should make sure it is also available through some another means.</P>
