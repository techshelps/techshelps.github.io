<H3>Yielding Control to Background Applications</H3>  </P>
Windows-based 16-bit applications should yield control at all times so that other programs, such as accessibility aids, can run in the background. If a program refuses to yield control, the user is unable to access the machine. You can avoid access problems by following these techniques:</P>
<SPAN CLASS="list"><UL><LI>Avoid using system modal dialog boxes or windows. When a system-modal window is active, no background tasks are allowed to run. (This is true to a lesser extent for 16-bit applications running under Windows 95, although it is not a problem for those running under Windows NT.)</LI><LI>Avoid using the <B>PeekMessage</B> function in tight loops without yielding.</LI></UL></SPAN> </P></BODY></HTML>
