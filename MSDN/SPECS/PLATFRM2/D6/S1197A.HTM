<H3>Using This Accessibility Document</H3>  </P>
This document contains the following sections:</P>
<SPAN CLASS="list"><UL><LI>A summary of accessibility features and programming techniques.</LI><LI>Background information about disabilities and accessibility aids.</LI><LI>Detailed descriptions of features and programming techniques that make applications more accessible or compatible with accessibility aids.</LI><LI>A list of additional resources for information about accessibility aids and their manufacturers.</LI><LI>Guidelines for developing applications for Windows version 3. <I>x</I> so that they are more accessible.</LI></UL></SPAN>The guidelines discussed in this document are not hard and fast rules. However, it is recommended that you adapt or adopt as many as you can to your own applications, or find additional ways to achieve the same goals.</P>
Product designers often start by asking which of the guidelines are the most important, but as a designer, you should determine this yourself based on the current state of your application. First, determine which of the areas your application is already handling correctly and which remain problems. Then decide which problems you can address in the version of your application currently under development. Finally, when you start on the next version of your application, design in corrections to any remaining problems. In this way, you can demonstrate your desire to do "the right thing" in the near term and make a considerable difference in the long term.</P>
