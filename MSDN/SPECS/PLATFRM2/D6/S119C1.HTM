<H3>Reconfiguring Commands and Dialog Boxes</H3>  </P>
Providing customization of keyboard commands, menus, and dialog boxes makes it possible for users to specially tailor an application for their needs. For example, users who enter keystrokes slowly (either through the keyboard or other input devices) can benefit from assigning simple key combinations to lengthy, repetitive tasks. Users with cognitive disabilities can often benefit from a reduction in the number of options in menus and toolbars. One approach is to provide the user with a choice of menus with different levels of complexity, such as novice, intermediate, and advanced menu configurations.</P>
Macro capabilities that allow a user to create custom dialog boxes is also another good way to reduce complexity and improve access to the features a specific user requires. This type of feature is normally supported in large applications, such as Microsoft Word and Microsoft&reg; Excel.</P>
