You can test your application to see how well it addresses some of the issues discussed in this document by following these suggestions:</P>
<SPAN CLASS="list"><UL><LI>Use your computer for a week after choosing a high contrast color scheme in Control Panel, especially one that uses white text on a black background, such as High Contrast Black. Are there any portions of your application that become invisible or difficult to use or recognize?</LI><LI>Use your computer for a week without a mouse. Drop the mouse down behind your desk. Are there operations you cannot perform? Is anything especially awkward to use? Are the keyboard mechanisms adequately documented?</LI><LI>Increase the size of your system font using the Display property sheet. (In Windows version 3.1, edit the Fonts.fon=, Oemfonts.fon=, and Fixedfon.fon= entries in the SYSTEM.INI file to specify a larger font. It is easy to test with the 8514*.fon files provided with Windows.) Does your application look good despite the changes? Can you adjust all of the fonts in your application to be at least as large as the system font?</LI><LI>Change the display scaling ratio using the Custom Font Size feature in the Display property sheet. Does your application appear consistent, or do various elements of the user interface appear disproportionately large or small?</LI><LI>Use your computer for a week after choosing an enlarged appearance scheme in Control Panel, such as Windows Standard (Extra Large). Are there any portions of your application that are not consistent with other applications?</LI></UL></SPAN> </P></BODY></HTML>
