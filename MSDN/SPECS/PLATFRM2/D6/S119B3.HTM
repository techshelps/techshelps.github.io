<H3>Global Scaling</H3>  </P>
Windows 95 provides a Custom Font Size feature—that is, the ability to globally scale all fonts and most other visual elements on the screen by changing the number of pixels used to represent a "logical inch." To be compatible with this feature, applications should avoid drawing in MM_TEXT mode, which bypasses logical scaling. If an element of the application's user interface uses MM_TEXT while the rest does not, that one element will be drawn out of proportion to all the rest of the screen elements.</P>
It is important to note that bitmaps are not automatically scaled by this factor. Bitmaps are discussed further in the next section.</P>
