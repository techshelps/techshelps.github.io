<H3>Supporting System Sound Events</H3>  </P>
You should generate the proper system sounds for any action your application carries out. Windows 95 defines a large number of system sound events and plays the associated sound when an error occurs. When your application carries out actions that correspond to system events, it should use the <B>PlaySound</B> function to play the sound for the event if any has been set up in Control Panel. This makes your application consistent with the rest of the Windows environment and enables users to customize the sound scheme to give more or fewer sounds, as they prefer.</P>
For more information about playing sounds, see, "Playing Sounds Specified in the Registry," in the Win32 Software Development Kit (SDK).</P>
