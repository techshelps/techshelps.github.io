<H3>Line Width</H3>  </P>
Although many applications draw lines with a fixed width of one pixel, those lines disappear on high-resolution monitors. They may also be invisible to a person with low vision. Instead of using fixed widths, applications should determine the proper thickness of a line by calling the <B>GetSystemMetrics </B>function with the SM_CXBORDER and SM_CYBORDER values. These values are defined appropriately for the resolution of the monitor, and in future operating systems the user will also be able to adjust them appropriately for their vision.</P>
