<H3>1.2 Berkeley Sockets</H3>  </P>
The Windows Sockets Specification has been built upon the Berkeley Sockets programming model which is the de facto standard for TCP/IP networking.  It is intended to provide a high degree of familiarity for programmers who are used to programming with sockets in UNIX2 and other environments, and to simplify the task of porting existing sockets-based source code.  The Windows Sockets API is consistent with release 4.3 of the Berkeley Software Distribution (4.3BSD).</P>
