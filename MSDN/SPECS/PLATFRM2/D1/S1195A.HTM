<H3>1.1 What is Windows Sockets?</H3>  </P>
The Windows Sockets specification defines a network programming interface for Microsoft Windows1 which is based on the "socket" paradigm popularized in the Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD) from the University of California at Berkeley.  It encompasses both familiar Berkeley socket style routines and a set of Windows-specific extensions designed to allow the programmer to take advantage of the message-driven nature of Windows.</P>
The Windows Sockets Specification is intended to provide a single API to which application developers can program and multiple network software vendors can conform.  Furthermore, in the context of a particular version of Microsoft Windows, it defines a binary interface (ABI) such that an application written to the Windows Sockets API can work with a conformant protocol implementation from any network software vendor.  This specification thus defines the library calls and associated semantics to which an application developer can program and which a network software vendor can implement.</P>
Network software which conforms to this Windows Sockets specification will be considered "Windows Sockets Compliant".  Suppliers of interfaces which are "Windows Sockets Compliant" shall be referred to as "Windows Sockets Suppliers".  To be Windows Sockets Compliant, a vendor must implement 100% of this Windows Sockets specification.</P>
Applications which are capable of operating with any "Windows Sockets Compliant" protocol implementation will be considered as having a "Windows Sockets Interface" and will be referred to as "Windows Sockets Applications".</P>
This version of the Windows Sockets specification defines and documents the use of the API in conjunction with the Internet Protocol Suite (IPS, generally referred to as TCP/IP).  Specifically, all Windows Sockets implementations support both stream (TCP) and datagram (UDP) sockets.</P>
While the use of this API with alternative protocol stacks is not precluded (and is expected to be the subject of future revisions of the specification), such usage is beyond the scope of this version of the specification.</P>
