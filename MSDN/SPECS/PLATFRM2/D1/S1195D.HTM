<H3>1.4 The Status of this Specification</H3>  </P>
Windows Sockets is an independent specification which was created and exists for the benefit of application developers and network vendors and, indirectly, computer users. Each published (non-draft) version of this specification  represents a fully workable API for implementation by network vendors and programming use by application developers. Discussion of this specification and  suggested improvements continue and are welcomed. Such discussion occurs mainly via the Internet electronic mail forum winsock@microdyne.com. Meetings of  interested parties occur on an irregular basis. Details of these meetings are publicized to the electronic mail forum.</P>
