<H1>The Business Case for Carrying the Designed for Microsoft BackOffice Logo</H1>  </P>
The goal of this program is to enable customers to easily identify products which have been developed specifically to take advantage of key technologies in Microsoft BackOffice.  Software developers benefit as well from using the logo on their product packaging and marketing materials because the logo distinguishes the product as having been developed to take advantage of the key technologies customers purchase BackOffice to get.</P>
What makes the BackOffice logo unique among the many logo programs in the industry is that, in order to qualify to carry the logo, a software product must meet a high technical standard.  This standard, the BackOffice logo requirements, ensures that the product carrying the logo takes advantage of the key BackOffice technologies customers find most important.</P>
Meeting the BackOffice logo requirements is potentially a lot of work.  To help in your decision to develop your product so that it meets the logo requirements the BackOffice Logo Department has put together the following table, which indicates some business reasons for meeting the logo requirements.</P>
