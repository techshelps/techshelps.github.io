<BR></P>Guidelines for Using the Designed for Microsoft BackOffice Logo</P>
Microsoft has established the following set of guidelines for properly using the Designed for Microsoft&reg; BackOffice&trade; logo.</P>
Graphic Element and Accompanying Words</P>
The logo is composed of two main components:</P>
<B>The Graphic Element. </B>The "connectivity graphic" (set of wavy, intertwining lines). The trademark symbol (TM ) must appear at the lower-right corner of the graphic. </P>
<B>The Accompanying Words.</B> The Microsoft-approved words that appear with the graphic. They are as follows:</P>
Designed for (located above connectivity graphic)</P>
Microsoft&reg; BackOfficeTM  (located below connectivity graphic)</P>
These words must accompany every use of the logo. The registered trademark symbol (&reg;) must appear immediately following the word Microsoft and the trademark symbol must appear following the word BackOffice. None of the words may be abbreviated, translated, or transliterated, as is done in non-English documentation. You may not substitute your own translation of the logo.</P>
Materials using the logo that are distributed only within the United States should include the following footnote: "Microsoft is a registered trademark and BackOffice and the BackOffice logo are trademarks of Microsoft Corporation." Materials using the logo that are distributed outside the United States should include the following footnote: "Microsoft, BackOffice, and the BackOffice logo are either registered trademarks or trademarks of Microsoft Corporation in the United States and/or other countries/regions."</P>
Using the Designed for Microsoft BackOffice Logo</P>
You may use the logo only as a symbol indicating that your product is compatible with the Microsoft BackOffice integrated family of server software. You may not imply that Microsoft in any way endorses your product. Also, the Designed for Microsoft BackOffice logo program is not intended to be a "certification program"; i.e., the logo does not represent that Microsoft certifies your product in any way.</P>
Sizing and Placement Requirements</P>
<SPAN CLASS="list"><UL><LI>Microsoft will provide you with camera-ready artwork or electronic artwork of the logo. You may not alter this artwork in any way, separate the words "Designed for" from above the connectivity graphic and "Microsoft BackOffice" from below the connectivity graphic, or replace the words with any others. This official artwork will be provided by Microsoft to authorized third parties.</LI><LI>You may not display the logo on packaging, documentation, collateral, or advertising in a manner that suggests that your product is a Microsoft product or in a manner that suggests that Microsoft or BackOffice is a part of your product name.</LI><LI>The logo cannot be larger than or more prominent than your product name, trademark, logo, or trade name.</LI><LI>The logo must stand alone. A minimum amount of empty space must be left between the logo and any other object such as type, photography, borders, edges, etc. The required border of empty space around the logo must be must be 1/2 <I>x</I> wide, where <I>x</I> equals the width of the logo, as measured from the highest point to the lowest point on the connectivity graphic.</LI><LI>You may not combine the logo with any other feature, including, but not limited to, other logos, words, graphics, photos, slogans, numbers, design features, or symbols.</LI><LI>The connectivity graphic may not be used as a design feature on your product, product packaging, documentation, collateral, or advertising.</LI><LI>Minimum size for the logo is 3/4" high.</LI></UL></SPAN>Four-Color Applications</P>
<I>The multicolored version is the preferred way of reproducing the logo</I>. The connectivity graphic consists of four wavy lines, each in a different color, inside a black box. The four PANTONE&reg; Matching System (PMS) colors are, from top to bottom at left edge, as follows:</P>
*Yellow    PMS 123C</P>
*Green    PMS 360C</P>
*Red    PMS 172C</P>
*Blue    PMS 279C</P>
The accompanying words, Microsoft&reg; BackOfficeTM, print in black. Four-color process (CMYK) equivalents may also be used.</P>
The four-color version can be reproduced <I>only</I> as described here. The four wavy line colors must appear in the positions described. The four-color version must always appear on a white background.</P>
Black-and-White Applications</P>
Black-and-white reproductions of the logo may be positive or reversed.</P>
Quality Control</P>
Microsoft reserves the right to review your use of the logo. Upon signing the trademark license, third parties are required to provide Microsoft with any products, documentation, or marketing materials bearing the logo so that Microsoft can review usage to determine whether the usage guidelines have been followed. If you want to have these samples returned to you, please indicate so in a letter accompanying the shipment.</P>
Send these items to:</P>
BackOffice Logo Department</P>
Microsoft Corporation</P>
One Microsoft Way</P>
Redmond, WA  98052-6399</P>
USA</P>
Microsoft reserves the right to conduct spot checks on all third-party products, product packaging, marketing materials, and documentation and may periodically send out requests for samples. Microsoft may also conduct spot checks in retail outlets and other product sources to monitor your compliance with the License Logo Agreement and the usage guidelines. Refusal to submit samples, or noncompliance with the License Logo Agreement or with these guidelines, could result in revocation of the license to use the logo.</P>
All third parties must correct any deficiencies in their use of the logo and/or in the quality of the product used in conjunction with the logo upon reasonable notice from Microsoft. Refusal to correct such deficiencies could result in revocation of your license to use the logo.</P>
<B>MICROSOFT BACKOFFICE LOGO USAGE GUIDELINES FOR OEMS AUTHORIZED TO DISTRIBUTE THE BACKOFFICE FAMILY</B></P>
<B>OEMs licensed to distribute or pre-install two or more components of the BackOffice Family under a separate Microsoft OEM License Agreement may use the "Microsoft</B>&reg;<B> BackOffice</B>&trade;<B> Logo" without the words "Designed for", as prescribed in these guidelines and only on those personal computer systems which COMPANY distributes or pre-installs with two or more products of the BackOffice Family.  </B> Electronic versions of the logo are provided to OEMs so that they may re-size the logo in accordance with these guidelines.  </P>
<img src="DPT1Y.gif"></P>
<SPAN CLASS="list"><OL><LI>An OEM may display  the Microsoft BackOffice logo in full screen form in the Start-up (or "Boot-up") screen of a Microsoft BackOffice program.  The logo as it appears in the Start-up screen must include the appropriate trademark symbols.  Such electronic use of the BackOffice logo does not need to be accompanied by a trademark footnote.</LI><LI>An OEM may display the Microsoft BackOffice logo in icon form when used to start a Microsoft BackOffice program and such use need not  include the &trade; and &reg; symbols due to size constraints.  In addition, such electronic use of the Microsoft BackOffice logo does not need to be accompanied by a trademark footnote. </LI><LI>Your right to distribute the logo as described herein shall expire effective the earlier of (i) the date on which you are no longer licensed to distribute at least two products of the BackOffice Family under a separate Microsoft OEM License Agreement or (ii) upon termination or expiration of your Designed for Microsoft BackOffice Logo License Agreement.</LI><LI>Any use that is not consistent with these guidelines is strictly prohibited; if you have any questions please contact BackOffice Marketing department at Microsoft or send e-mail to bckoffc@microsoft.com.</LI></OL></SPAN><B><I>Notice Under Section 2(b) of the Designed for Microsoft BackOffice Logo License Agreement</I></B></P>
By reason of government regulations regarding the licensing of registered trademarks, it is important for Microsoft to know which of its licensees are using the licensed marks in certain countries/regions. </P>
