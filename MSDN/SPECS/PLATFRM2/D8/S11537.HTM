Answer all the questions that pertain to your product.

6. Consider what Microsoft will require to test your product</P>
Microsoft maintains a considerable library of hardware and software required for testing your BackOffice product.  However, if your product requires functionality such as a connection to a mainframe or remote server, you will need to provide Microsoft with complete dial-in instructions for remote testing, or actually ship a fully-configured platform to Microsoft.  Your server platform will be returned promptly after the test.  For more information,  please contact Microsoft  BackOffice Logo Software Testing Lab via email at BOSTL@microsoft.com with questions and to make special arrangements.</P>
7. Assemble package to ship to Microsoft</P>
If you are submitting multiple products simultaneously, please clearly indicate that this is the case, and bundle all materials for one product together within the package.  The following items must all be included for the test process to begin. Please do not ship any partial packages.  The following items should be enclosed:</P>

  Your Software Application Product on diskette, CD-ROM, or tape</P>
<img src="DPT2D.gif">   Any unusual or specialized hardware required for us to test your product.   Also, <B>please note</B>:  If you bundle your hardware with your software, your hardware will also need to be Logo'd.  Logo testing for hardware is conducted by Microsoft BackOffice Hardware Testing Labs [BOHTL].  You can contact BOHTL by email at "bohtl@microsoft.com".</P>
<img src="DPT3D.gif">   Any available end-user manuals (may be in draft form)</P>

8. Ship the package to:</P>
Microsoft Corporation</P>
BackOffice Software Testing Lab - Attn: Todd Merrell</P>
One Microsoft Way, Building 20/1018</P>
Redmond, WA 98052-6399</P>
9. Expect a Confirmation...</P>
....via Fax or email that your package has arrived, is complete, and that testing has begun.  Testing will begin the day following a complete application kit is received. Microsoft will then report testing results back to you within 10 business days.  If any questions arise, Microsoft will contact you sooner.  </P>
10. Send a Final Copy of your product</P>
Once your product is final [e.g. the "shrink-wrapped" version], send 1 copy to Microsoft's BackOffice Logo Department [address below] </P>
Due to early packaging deadlines, we will not always be receiving the final, shrink-wrapped version of your software. One question people often ask us is, "How complete does my product have to be for testing?"  The product must be in "final beta," i.e. fully functional and nearly ready for shipping.  Once the product has been tested, you should not be adding new functionality that impacts Logo Criteria.  Microsoft will conduct random re-tests of licensed products to ensure that final products still meet Logo requirements.</P>
Contact at Microsoft corporation.</P>
