<H2>Terminology</H2>  </P>
This document uses the following special terminology:</P>
<B>Winlogon</B></P>
Winlogon.exe is the executable image responsible for implementing interactive logon. There are many aspects of interactive logon, including an actual collection of Identification and Authentication (I &amp; A) information (see GINA below), and a number of other functions, such as window-station and desktop management, screen saver control, and multiple-network provider notifications.</P>
<B>GINA</B></P>
This specification is for developers who want to replace the component of Windows NT that performs Identification and Authentication of interactive users. This replacable functionality is implemented as a dynamic-link library (DLL) that is loaded and called by Winlogon.exe. This DLL is refered to as the Graphical Identification and Authentication DLL, or GINA for short<I>.</I></P>
<B>MSGINA.DLL</B></P>
The standard GINA shipped with Windows NT is called MSGINA.DLL.</P>
<B>Secure Attention Sequence (SAS)</B></P>
Winlogon uses a special sequence of events to recognize when a user wants to log on or perform other secure operations. This sequence of events is refered to as the <I>Secure Attention</I> <I>Sequence </I>or <I>SAS</I>. The SAS provides a secure way for users to enter identification and authentication information. Users are protected from password-collection programs and other flaws inherent in timeshare systems. </P>
In Windows NT, users can enter a Secure Attention Sequence, prompting Winlogon to switch to a secure desktop that no trojan program has access to. The SAS for a standard Windows NT system is the CTRL+ALT+DEL key combination. Developers writing a replacement GINA are encouraged to achieve the same level of security with their Secure Attention Sequence through the use of devices like smart-card readers. The SAS could be, for example, the insertion or removal of a smart card. Developers can also choose to retain the CTRL+ALT+DEL key combination as the SAS.</P>
