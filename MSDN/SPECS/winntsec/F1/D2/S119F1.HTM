<H3>Network Provider Notification Information</H3>  </P>
The WLX_MPR_NOTIFICATION_INFO structure is returned from a GINA DLL following successful authentication. Winlogon uses this information to provide identification and authentication information already collected to network providers. Winlogon is responsible for freeing both the main structure and all string and other buffers pointed to from within the structure.</P>
