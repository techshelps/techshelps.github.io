<H2>32 Bit Rasterizer</H2><B><I>Faster and better hinting and rendering</I></B></P>
The new 32 bit TrueType rasterizer performs font hinting and rendering faster at all resolutions with more efficient memory use and better scan conversion. To maximize speed, the rasterizer streamlines the hinting process with improved calling conventions, opcode dispatch, and math processing. To efficiently use memory, the rasterizer caches grid-fitted contours, provides two new modes of scan conversion banding, and reuses rasterizer workspace. The 32 bit rasterizer eliminates numerical overflow problems.</P>
The new rasterizer supports bitmap embedding and gray scale rendering (both are discussed in this article) and corrects problems with composite glyph nesting and scaling. Now, composite glyphs can contain glyph components that are composites themselves.</P>
To improve the appearance of fonts, the TrueType rasterizer provides better curve rendering and pixel drop-out control. The curve rendering algorithm now rasterizes curves directly without first converting them to lines. The drop-out control positions extra pixels precisely where they are needed to fill gaps in rasterized glyph shapes.</P></BODY></HTML>
