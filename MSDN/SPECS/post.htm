<H2>post - PostScript</H2>
<P>
This table contains additional information
needed to use TrueType or OpenType fonts on PostScript printers. This includes data for the FontInfo dictionary entry and the PostScript names
of all the glyphs.<P>
Formats 1.0, 2.0, and 2.5 refer to TrueType fonts and OpenType fonts with TrueType data. OpenType fonts with TrueType data may also use Format 3.0. OpenType fonts with CFF data use Format 3.0 only. <P>
The table begins as follows:

</TABLE>&nbsp;&nbsp;<P>
<P>
The last four entries in the table are present because PostScript
drivers can do better memory management if the virtual memory
(VM) requirements of a downloadable OpenType font are known before
the font is downloaded. This information should be supplied if
known. If it is not known, set the value to zero. The driver will
still work but will be less efficient.
<P>
Maximum memory usage is minimum memory usage plus maximum runtime
memory use. Maximum runtime memory use depends on the maximum
band size of any bitmap potentially rasterized by the 
font scaler. Runtime memory usage could be calculated by rendering
characters at different point sizes and comparing memory use.
<BR>
<P>
If the format is 1.0 or 3.0, the table ends here. The additional
entries for formats 2.0 and 2.5 are shown below. Apple has defined
a format 4.0 for use with QuickDraw GX, which is described in
their documentation.
<P><BR><H4>Format 1.0</H4>
<P>
This TrueType-based font file contains exactly the
258 glyphs in the standard Macintosh TrueType font file (see <A HREF="WGL4.htm">The WGL4.0 Character Set</A> chapter for a list of the Macintosh glyphs). As a result, the glyph names are taken from
the system with no storage required by the font.
<P><BR><H4>Format 2.0</H4>
<P>
This is the format required by TrueType-based fonts to be used on Windows.

<TABLE WIDTH=460 BGCOLOR="#F0F0F0">

</TABLE>&nbsp;&nbsp;<P>
<P>
This TrueType-based font file contains glyphs not
in the standard Macintosh set or the ordering of the glyphs in
the TrueType font file is non-standard (again, for the Macintosh).
The glyph name array maps the glyphs in this font to name index.
If the name index is between 0 and 257, treat the name index as
a glyph index in the Macintosh standard order. If the name index
is between 258 and 32767, then subtract 258 and use that to index
into the list of Pascal strings at the end of the table. Thus
a given font may map some of its glyphs to the standard glyph
names, and some to its own names.
<P>
Index numbers 32768 through 65535 are reserved for future use.
 If you do not want to associate a PostScript name with a particular
glyph, use index number 0 which points the name <CITE>.notdef.</CITE>
<P><BR><H4>Format 2.5 </H4>
<P>
This format provides a space saving table
for TrueType-based fonts which contain a pure subset of, or a simple reordering
of, the standard Macintosh glyph set.

<TABLE WIDTH=460 BGCOLOR="#F0F0F0">
<THEAD>
<TR>
<TH BGCOLOR="#C0C0C0">Type</TH>
<TH BGCOLOR="#C0C0C0">Description</TH></TR>
</THEAD><TBODY>
<TR>
<TD VALIGN=TOP>CHAR</TD><TD VALIGN=TOP>offset[numGlyphs]</TD></TR>
</TABLE>&nbsp;&nbsp;<P>
<P>
This format is useful for TrueType-based font files that
contain only glyphs in the standard Macintosh glyph set but which
have those glyphs arranged in a non-standard order or which are
missing some glyphs. The table contains one byte for each glyph
in the font file. The byte is treated as a signed offset that
maps the glyph index used in this font into the standard glyph
index. In other words, assuming that the font contains the three
glyphs A, B, and C which are the 37th, 38th, and 39th glyphs in
the standard ordering, the 'post' table would contain the bytes
+36, +36, +36.
<P><BR><H4>Format 3.0</H4>
<P>
This format is used by OpenType fonts with TrueType or CFF data. The format makes it possible to create a special font that is not burdened with a large 'post' table set of glyph names.
<P>
This format specifies that no PostScript name information is provided
for the glyphs in this font file. The printing behavior of this
format on PostScript printers is unspecified, except that it should
not result in a fatal or unrecoverable error. Some drivers may
print nothing, other drivers may attempt to print using a default
naming scheme.
<P>
<CITE>Windows makes use of the italic angle value in the 'post'
table but does not actually <STRONG>require</STRONG> any glyph names to
be stored as Pascal strings .</cite>
