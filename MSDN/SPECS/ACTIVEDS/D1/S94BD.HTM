<H2>9.2    Group Object</H2><P>Directory services for different networking environments support the concept of a group to help manage access rights for elements in the directory service. The Active Directory Group object represents an underlying directory service group.</P>
<P>The directory service group in a specific network environment may behave differently in another network environment. There may be limitations on whether groups can be contained within groups or on how much support is offered for groups contained within other groups.  For example, some namespaces might allow only users to be members of a group, while other might allow users, groups, and organizational units to be group members.</P>
<P>The Group object supports the COM interface IADsGroup.</P></BODY></HTML>
