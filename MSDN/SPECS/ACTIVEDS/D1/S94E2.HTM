<H2>1.2    Audience</H2><P>This specification is intended for clients of the Active Directory interfaces, such as:</P>
<P><B><UL><LI>System administrators</B>. Typically, this audience will access the Active Directory interfaces through a scripting language, such as Microsoft&reg; Visual Basic&reg;, although C/C++ can also be used to enhance performance. For example, an administrator could write a script to add 100 new users to the system.</LI></UL></P>
<P><B><UL><LI>Developers</B>. Typically, this audience will access the Active Directory interfaces through a compiled language such as C++, although Visual Basic can be used for prototyping the application. For example, a developer could write an application to manage network printing.</LI></UL></P>
<P>This specification can also be useful for:</P>
<P><B><UL><LI>Provider writers</B>. This audience will implement the Active Directory interfaces.  Providers follow the specifications for the Active Directory objects to develop an implementation of the objects with the on-the-wire protocol for a specific network environment that they are supporting. Providers who follow the specifications for Active Directory objects ensure consistent access to well-known directory service objects.  Provider writers will be interested primarily in the Software Development Kit.</LI></UL></P>
<P>Readers of this document are assumed to have a working knowledge of the Component Object Model and directory services.  Example code is given in Visual Basic and C/C++.</P></BODY></HTML>
