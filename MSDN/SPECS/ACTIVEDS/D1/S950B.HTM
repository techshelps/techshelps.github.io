<H3>6.5.1    Developing Third Party Extensions</H3><P>A third party extension is a COM object like other Active Directory objects.  However, it differs from the standard Active Directory object in that it has its own class factory and can be instantiated separately from a host object.  Clients are never expected to do this directly.</P>
<P><B>Detailed specifications for third-party extensions were not fully defined at the time of publication. .   A revised release of this specification will contain the detailed specifications for writing a third-party extension for Active Directory.</B></P></BODY></HTML>
