<H2>6.3    Namespace Extensions</H2><P>The Active Directory set of defined objects represents the minimum set of Active Directory objects that should be implemented by an Active Directory provider writer.  <B>Providers writers are encouraged to document and provide implementations for namespace-specific Active Directory objects</B>.</P>
<P>An Active Directory object that is defined by Active Directory might have additional functionality in a particular namespace that is not exposed by the Active Directory definition of the object.  A provider could then implement a namespace-specific interface on the object to expose such functionality.  Clients would discover the interface by browsing the type library..</P>
<P>For example, the PrintQueue component in namespace X might expose a Statistics interface,IADsPrintQueueStatistics, which includes the read-only  properties TotalJobsServiced and AverageServiceTime.  In order to retrieve the interface from a PrintQueue, the client would use the standard COM QueryInterface method..</P>
<P>Also, a namespace might expose an Active Directory object that is not defined by Active Directory at all.  A provider could implement a new Active Directory object  and it would be discoverable using the schema management objects.</P>
<P>For example, namespace X might also include a FaxQueue component object.  A provider writer for namespace X could write the complete implementation of this object, including the IADsFaxQueue interface and all the properties and methods needed to store FaxQueues in the DS.</P></BODY></HTML>
