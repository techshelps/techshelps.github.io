<H3>6.2.1    Browsing Methods</H3>The Active Directory schema container and objects allow an application to determine what objects and properties are supported by a given provider.  It is often useful to determine what methods are supported by a given object and what parameters are required by those methods.  COM provides a mechanism for providers of COM objects to describe the methods and parameters supported by their objects.  This information is called <B>type information</B> and is supplied in <B>Type Libraries</B>.   </P>
Active Directory provider writers are required to supply type libraries and help files documenting the interfaces their provider supports.  COM defines two interfaces for obtaining the type information for a given class:</P>
<P><UL><LI>IDispatch::GetTypeInfo</LI></UL></P>
<P><UL><LI>IProvideClassInfo::GetClassInfo</LI></UL></P>
Providers must support IDispatch::GetTypeInfo and may optionally support IProvideClassInfo::GetClassInfo.  Both provide an ITypeInfo interface for the class hosting the interface.  Consult the COM documentation for details on using these interfaces to browse the interfaces and methods on a class.</P>
Microsoft provides a type library documenting all the standard interfaces supported by Active Directory (these are the interfaces documented in this specification).  This type library is <B>ActiveDs.TLB</B>.  Provider writers must supply a type library that contains all of the information found in ActiveDs.TLB and additional type information documenting any provider-specific extensions.</P></BODY></HTML>
