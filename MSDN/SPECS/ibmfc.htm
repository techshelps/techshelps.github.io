<H2>IBM Font Class Parameters
</H2>
This section defines the IBM Font Class and the IBM Font Subclass parameter values to be used in the classification of font designs by the font designer or supplier. This information is stored in the sFamilyClass field of a font's OS/2 table. 

<P><STRONG>sFamilyClass</STRONG>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><STRONG>Format:</STRONG> 2-byte signed short 

<P><STRONG>Title:</STRONG> Font-family class and subclass. Also see section 3.4. 

<P><STRONG>Description:</STRONG> This parameter is a classification of font-family design. 

<P><STRONG>Comments:</STRONG> The font class and font subclass are registered values assigned by IBM to each font family. This parameter is intended for use in selecting an alternate font when the requested font is not available. The font class is the most general and the font subclass is the most specific. The high byte of this field contains the family class, while the low byte contains the family subclass. 
</BLOCKQUOTE>


<P>These values classify a font design as to its appearance, but do not identify the specific font family, typeface variation, designer, supplier, size, or metric table differences. It should be noted that some font designs may be classified equally well into more than IBM Font Class or Subclass. Such designs should be matched to a classification for which substitution of another font design from the same class or subclass would generally result in a similar appearance of the presented document. 

<P>&nbsp;

<P>This style is characterized by unjoined (non-connecting) characters that have a uniform appearance with little or no contrast in the strokes. An example of this font style is the Gilles Gothic family. This IBM Subclass reflects the ISO Script Class, Unjoined Subclass, and Monotone Specific Group as documented in the 12/87 ISO/IEC 9541-5 draft standard.

<P><STRONG>Subclass ID = 9-14 : (reserved for future use)</STRONG>

<P>These subclass IDs are reserved for future assignment, and shall not be used without formal assignment by IBM. 
<P>&nbsp;
<P><STRONG>Subclass ID = 15 : Miscellaneous </STRONG>

<P>This subclass ID is used for miscellaneous designs of the associated design class that are not covered by another Subclass. 
<P>&nbsp;
<P><STRONG>Class ID = 11 (reserved for future use)</STRONG>

<P>This class ID is reserved for future assignment, and shall not be used without formal assignment by IBM. 
<P>&nbsp;
<P><STRONG>Class ID = 12 Symbolic </STRONG>

<P>This style is generally design independent, making it suitable for Pi and special characters (icons, dingbats, technical symbols, etc.) that may be used equally well with any font. This IBM Class reflects various ISO Specific Groups, as noted below and documented in the 12/87 ISO/IEC 9541-5 draft standard. 
<P>&nbsp;
<P><STRONG>Subclass ID = 0 : No Classification </STRONG>

<P>This subclass ID is used to indicate that the associated font has no design sub-classification or that the design sub-classification is not of significance to the creator or user of the font resource. 
<P>&nbsp;
<P><STRONG>Subclass ID = 1-2 : (reserved for future use)</STRONG>

<P>These subclass IDs are reserved for future assignment, and shall not be used without formal assignment by IBM. 
<P>&nbsp;
<P><STRONG>Subclass ID = 3 : Mixed Serif </STRONG>

<P>This style is characterized by either both or a combination of serif and sans serif designs on those characters of the font for which design is important (e.g., superscript and subscript characters, numbers, copyright or trademark symbols, etc.). An example of this font style is found in the IBM Symbol family. This IBM Subclass is not reflected in the 12/87 ISO/IEC 9541-5 draft standard. 
<P>&nbsp;
<P><STRONG>Subclass ID = 4-5 : (reserved for future use)</STRONG>

<P>These subclass IDs are reserved for future assignment, and shall not be used without formal assignment by IBM. 
<P>&nbsp;
<P><STRONG>Subclass ID = 6 : Oldstyle Serif </STRONG>

<P>This style is characterized by a Oldstyle Serif IBM Class design on those characters of the font for which design is important (e.g., superscript and subscript characters, numbers, copyright or trademark symbols, etc.). An example of this font style is found in the IBM Sonoran Pi Serif family. This IBM Subclass is not directly reflected in the 12/87 ISO/IEC 9541-5 draft standard, though it is indirectly by the ISO Serif Class and Legibility Subclass (implies that all characters of the font exhibit the design appearance, while only a subset of the characters actually exhibit the design). 
<P>&nbsp;
<P><STRONG>Subclass ID = 7 : Neo-grotesque Sans Serif</STRONG>

<P>This style is characterized by a Neo-grotesque Sans Serif IBM Font Class and Subclass design on those characters of the font for which design is important (e.g., superscript and subscript characters, numbers, copyright or trademark symbols, etc.). An example of this font style is found in the IBM Sonoran Pi Sans Serif family. This IBM Subclass is not directly reflected in the 12/87 ISO/IEC 9541-5 draft standard, though it is indirectly by the ISO Sans Serif Class and Gothic Subclass (implies that all characters of the font exhibit the design appearance, while only a subset of the characters actually exhibit the design). 
<P>&nbsp;
<P><STRONG>Subclass ID = 8-14 : (reserved for future use)</STRONG>

<P>These subclass IDs are reserved for future assignment, and shall not be used without formal assignment by IBM. 
<P>&nbsp;
<P><STRONG>Subclass ID = 15 : Miscellaneous </STRONG>

<P>This subclass ID is used for miscellaneous designs of the associated design class that are not covered by another Subclass.
