<H3>2.4.2.12  Call Park</H3>Two forms of call parking are provided: directed call park and non-directed call park. In <I>directed</I> call park, the application specifies the destination address where the call is to be parked. This roughly behaves like a call transfer to the destination address, but it doesn't alert or time out as a transfer would. </P>
In <I>non-directed</I> call park, the switch returns to the TAPI DLL the address where it parked the call. In either case, the function <B>TSPI_linePark</B> is used to park a call.</P>
A parked call can later be retrieved. The TAPI DLL specifies the park address to <B>TSPI_lineUnpark</B> which returns an call handle to the unparked call. Appropriate <B>LINE_CALLSTATE</B> messages will be sent to the TAPI DLL as the call is reconnected.</P>
TSPI_linePark</P>
Parks a given call at another address.</P>
TSPI_lineUnpark</P>
Retrieves a parked call.</P></BODY></HTML>
