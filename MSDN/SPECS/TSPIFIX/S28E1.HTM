<H3>2.5.2.4  Buttons</H3>The SPI models a phone's buttons and lamps as button/lamp pairs. A button with no lamp next to it, or a lamp with no button is specified using a "dummy" indicator for the lamp, resp. button. A button with multiple lamps is modeled by using multiple button/lamp pairs. </P>
Information associated with a phone button can be set and retrieved. When a button is pressed, a PHONE_BUTTON message is sent to the TAPI DLL's callback. Parameters of this message are a handle to the phone device and the button/lamp ID of the button that was pressed. The keypad button '0' through '9', '*', and '#" are assigned fixed button/lamp IDs 0 through 11.</P>
TSPI_phoneSetButtonInfo</P>
Sets the information associated with a button on a phone device.</P>
TSPI_phoneGetButtonInfo</P>
Returns information associated with a button on a phone device.</P>
PHONE_BUTTON</P>
This message is sent to the TAPI DLL's callback when a button on the phone is pressed.</P>
The information associated with a button does not carry any semantic meaning as far as the SPI is concerned. It is useful for (device specific) apps that understand the meaning of this information for a given phone device, or for display to the user (e.g., online help).</P></BODY></HTML>
