TSPI_phoneSelectExtVersion is typically called in two situations: (1) An application requested to open a phone, the resulting change of Media  Mode monitoring was successful, the application requested that a  particular Extension version be used, and no Extension version was currently selected. (2) The last application using a particular Extension version closed the phone, and the Extension version selection can be cancelled. </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP"><B>See Also</B></P></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP">Functions: <B>TSPI_phoneNegotiateExtVersion</B></P></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>
