<H3>2.4.2.8  Call Accept, Reject, and Redirect</H3>In environments like ISDN, call offering is separate from alerting. In fact, after a call has been offered to the TAPI DLL, a time window exists during which the TAPI DLL has a number of options.</P>
<SPAN CLASS="list"><UL><LI>The TAPI DLL can simply answer the call using <B>TSPI_lineAnswer</B> (described earlier).</LI><LI>The TAPI DLL can reject the offering call using <B>TSPI_lineDrop</B>. The call remains valid but transitions to the <I>idle</I> state.</LI><LI>The TAPI DLL can accept the call using <B>TSPI_lineAccept</B>, which will initiate alerting to both the caller as ringback, and the called party as ring.</LI><LI>The TAPI DLL can redirect the call using <B>TSPI_lineRedirect</B>, which deflects the offering call elsewhere. The call remains valid but transitions to <I>idle</I>. </LI></UL></SPAN>TSPI_lineAccept</P>
Accepts an offered call and start alerting of both caller (ringback) and called party (ring).</P>
TSPI_lineRedirect</P>
Redirects an offering call to another address.</P></BODY></HTML>
