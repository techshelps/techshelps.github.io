<H3>2.4.2.13  Call Forwarding</H3>Forwarding affects the treatment by the switch or network of incoming calls destined for a given address. The TAPI DLL can specify call forwarding conditions based on origin of call (internal, external, selective based on caller ID), status of the address (busy, no answer, unconditionally), and destination address where calls are to be forwarded. When the specified conditions are met for an incoming call, the switch deflects the incoming call to the specified destination number. Note that because the switch performs the forwarding action, the TAPI DLL will typically not know when a call has been forwarded. </P>
The <B>TSPI_lineForward</B> function provides a combination of call forwarding and do-not-disturb features. <B>TSPI_lineForward</B> also cancels any or all of the forwarding requests currently in effect. Some switches require that a call be established to the forwarding address in order for call forwarding to be initiated. On such systems, <B>TSPI_lineForward</B> allocates a consultation call and returns the handle for it to the TAPI DLL. The consultation call can be used as any other call. After the connection is established, forwarding confirmation is received from the switch, and the call is dropped (using <B>TSPI_lineDrop</B>), forwarding is in effect. A <B>LINE_ADDRESSSTATE</B> message with a <I>forwarding</I> indication informs the TAPI DLL about changes in an address' forwarding status. </P>
TSPI_lineForward</P>
Set or cancel call forwarding requests.</P>
Note that it may be impossible for a service provider to know at all times what forwarding is in effect for an address. Forwarding may be canceled or changed in ways that make it impossible for a service provider to be informed of this fact.</P></BODY></HTML>
