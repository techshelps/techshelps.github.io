<H3>2.4.2.14  Call Pickup</H3>Call pickup allows the TAPI DLL to answer a call that is alerting at another address. The TAPI DLL  invokes <B>TSPI_linePickup</B> by identifying the target of the pickup and is returned a call handle for the picked up call. There are several ways to specify the target of the pickup request. First, specify the address (extension) of the alerting party. Second, if no extension is specified and the switch allows it, the TAPI DLL can pick up any ringing phone in its pickup group. Third, some switches require a group ID to identify the group to which the ringing extensions belongs. </P>
After the call has been picked up, the call is diverted to the TAPI DLL and the TAPI DLL is sent appropriate <B>LINE_CALLSTATE</B> messages for the call.  The TAPI DLL can invoke <B>TSPI_lineGetCallInfo</B> to find out information about the picked up call, if provided by the switch.</P>
