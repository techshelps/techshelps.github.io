<H3>2.3.11.2  Lines</H3>The “[Lines]” section of TELEPHON.INI specifies the lines that are defined in the system, the driver (provider) with which they are associated, and a user-assigned friendly name for each.</P>
This section has the following format:</P>
<BR></P>
<pre><code>[Lines]=&lt;<I>count</I>&gt;,&lt;<I>lastID</I>&gt;<I>x</I>=&lt;<I>id</I>&gt;,&lt;<I>DriverId</I>&gt;,"&lt;<I>friendlyname</I>&gt;"</code></pre>
The Lines entry indicates how many lines are defined (and how many Line<I>x</I> entries appear in the section) with the <I>&lt;count&gt;</I> parameter.  The <I>&lt;lastID&gt;</I> parameter is an "advisory" parameter indicating the most recently assigned permanent line ID.  This can be used to optimize the assignment of new unique permanent line IDs.  Both &lt;<I>count</I>&gt; and &lt;<I>lastID</I>&gt; are set to 0 when Telephony is installed.  The values must be updated consistently by any agent that modifies the [Lines] section.</P>
Each Line<I>x</I> entry defines a line and giving its permanent ID &lt;<I>id</I>&gt; (used to link parameters in other files, such as address translation, to the line), the identity &lt;<I>DriverID</I>&gt; of the provider with which it is associated, and a user-assigned friendly name (e.g., phone number or port number).  Line permanent IDs are in the range from 0 to 4,294,967,295 and must be unique throughout the [Lines] section. "<I>x</I>" takes values from 0 to one less than <I>&lt;count&gt;</I>. Line<I>x</I> entries must have their name-sequence numbers renumbered to form a contiguous range whenver needed, although there is no requirement that they appear in sequential order.</P>
Parts of the Telephony service require that the name-sequence numbers of the lines for a given service provider form a contiguous range, although they need not appear sequentially in the TELEPHON.INI file.  For example, if one were to select all Line<I>x</I> entries with <I>DriverID</I> of "26" and sort them sequentially by their name-sequence number "<I>x</I>", one would find that the sequence has no "holes":</P>
<BR></P>
<pre><code>Line4=1234, 26, "first"=1567, 26, "second"=1103, 26, "third"</code></pre>
is legal but</P>
<BR></P>
<pre><code>Line4=1234, 26, "first"=1567, 26, "second"=1103, 26, "third"</code></pre>
is not since the name "Line5" is skipped.  Any agent that adds or removes lines in the middle of the overall sequence must renumber other name-sequence numbers accordingly.</P></BODY></HTML>
