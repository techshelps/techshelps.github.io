<H3>2.5.2.6  Data Areas</H3>Some phone sets support the notion of downloading or uploading data to or from the phone device. This may allow the phone set to be programmed in a variety of ways. The SPI models these phone sets as having one or more download and/or upload areas. Each area is identified by a number that ranges from zero to the number of data areas available on the phone minus one. Sizes of each area may vary. The format of the data itself is device specific. </P>
TSPI_phoneSetData</P>
Downloads a buffer of data to a given data area in the phone device.</P>
TSPI_phoneGetData</P>
Uploads the contents of a given data area in the phone device to a buffer.</P>
When a data area of a phone device is changed, a PHONE_STATUS message is sent to the TAPI DLL's callback to notify the TAPI DLL about the state change. Parameters to this message provide an indication of the change.</P></BODY></HTML>
