<H3>2.3.11.1  Providers</H3>The “[Drivers]” section of TELEPHON.INI specifies the names and locations of installed Telephony service providers and the Address Translation module. This information is used so that TAPI.DLL can identify and load each provider.</P>
This entries defined by TSPI in this section have the following format:</P>
<BR></P>
<pre><code>[Drivers]=&lt;count&gt;,&lt;lastID&gt;=&lt;id&gt;,&lt;filename&gt;,"&lt;friendlyname&gt;"</code></pre>
The Drivers entry indicates how many service providers are installed (and how many <I>Driverx</I> entries appear in the section) with the <I>&lt;count&gt;</I> parameter.  The <I>&lt;lastID&gt;</I> parameter is an "advisory" parameter indicating the most recently assigned permanent driver ID.  This can be used to optimize the assignment of new unique permanent driver IDs.  Both &lt;<I>count</I>&gt; and &lt;<I>lastID</I>&gt; are set to 0 when Telephony is installed.  The values must be updated consistently by any agent that modifies the [Drivers] section.</P>
Each <I>Driverx</I> entry identifies a Telephony service provider, and gives its permanent ID &lt;<I>id</I>&gt; (used to link parameters in other files, such as address translation, to the provider information), file name, and friendly name (e.g., product name).  Driver permanent IDs are in the range from 0 to 4,294,967,295 and must be unique throughout the [Drivers] section. "<I>x</I>" takes values from 0 to one less than <I>&lt;count&gt;</I>.  Driver<I>x</I> entries must have their name-sequence numbers renumbered to form a contiguous range whenver needed, although there is no requirement that they appear in sequential order.</P></BODY></HTML>
