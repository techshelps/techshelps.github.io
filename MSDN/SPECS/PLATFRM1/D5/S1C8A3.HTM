<H1>1. Introduction</H1>  </P>
The PC system includes devices installed within the PC system unit, and with external peripherals.  The most common external PC peripherals are those connected to printer ports or serial ports.  This document is concerned with detecting and identifying devices connected to the serial ports, also known as COM ports.  COM ports are the common means for connecting with COM port devices, such as modems, pointing devices like mice, serial printers and other bi-directional devices.</P>
This specification defines mechanisms that each Plug and Play COM device must implement to support identification, which in turn supports automatic configuration of the entire PC system without end-user intervention.  </P>
