<H2>1.3 DWORD Alignment</H2>To make resource binary files easier to read under Win32, all objects within the file are to be DWORD-aligned. This includes headers as well as data entries. This does not usually entail changes in the order of the fields of resource data structures, but does entail the need for some padding between fields.</P>
The single exception to this rule is the font and fontdir structures. The reason for the exception is that these two structures are copied directly from other files, and are not used by RC.</P></BODY></HTML>
