<H2>4.10 User-Defined Resources and RCDATA</H2>RC allows the programmer to include resources not defined in Windows. The user may choose a name not defined as a standard type and use it to include data that is to be used as a resource. This data may be taken from an external file or may be placed between BEGIN and END statements. As an option, the programmer can define the type as RCDATA with the same results.</P>
As might be imagined, the format of this resource is very simple because the resource compiler knows nothing about the logical structure of the data. Here is the organization:</P>
  </P>
<BR></P>
<pre><code>[Normal resource header (type = 10 for RCDATA, named types represent user-defined types)]

[The data from the BEGIN ... END or from the external file is included without translation into the .RES file]</code></pre>
  </P></BODY></HTML>
