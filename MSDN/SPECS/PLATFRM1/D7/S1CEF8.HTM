<H1>Introduction</H1>  </P>
This document contains a complete set of specifications required for implementing Plug and Play SCSI 1.0 systems.  Future revisions are possible but are not expected to alter baseline requirements defined herein.</P>
SCSI offers a cost-effective, high-performance interface for storage devices and permits attachment of external devices such as CD-ROMs, scanners, and printers.</P>
SCSI is designed to accommodate a broad range of applications and performance levels.  This results in multiple choices for such items as connectors, cables, termination, etc.  These choices can lead to incompatibilities.  This specification defines a profile for  personal computing environments that eases the integration task and promotes compatibility of conforming devices.  PnP SCSI systems are easier to configure because the configuration choices are simplified.  Adding a PnP SCSI device to a PnP SCSI system requires no special user skills or knowledge.</P>
PnP SCSI simplifies termination by making proper termination a side effect of configuring the system.  Termination is not included within SCSI peripheral devices; thus the confusion over the presence of a terminator and the possibility of excessive terminators are eliminated.</P>
PnP SCSI eliminates the problem of setting unique SCSI IDs through use of a protocol called SCAM, that performs an automatic ID assignment.  Legacy SCSI devices are permitted to coexist with newer SCAM devices by using an ID assignment convention based on the peripheral device class.</P>
PnP SCSI specifies the SCSI 50-position high-density shielded connector for all external connectors and requires that the cables meet the SPI draft standard.  This eliminates the confusion that exists with the multiplicity of connector and cable choices.</P>
Command set profiles are under consideration for future PnP documents.</P>
Products conforming to the requirements herein are termed PnP SCSI.</P>
