<H2>9.5. Device driver architecture</H2>  </P>
There are two primary device driver protocols in use today.  These are ASPI and CAM. Windows NT and future windows OS's use their own SCSI protocol which is referred to as the Miniport interface.  It is recommended that vendors of host adapters supply drivers compatible with one or more of these layered driver architectures.</P>
