<H3>6.4.1. Automatic SCSI ID assignment</H3>The X3T9.2 (now X3T10) committee has voted to include a protocol, SCSI Configured AutoMagically (SCAM), into the SCSI-3 Parallel Interface draft standard.  SCAM  automatically assigns device ID's.  All PnP SCSI devices are required to conform to level 1 of this document and level 2 conformance is recommended.</P>
The SCAM protocol is designed so that legacy devices can be detected and used.  If more than one legacy device is present, the user must ensure that they do not have SCSI ID conflicts.  Devices that support SCAM function correctly in legacy systems.</P></BODY></HTML>
