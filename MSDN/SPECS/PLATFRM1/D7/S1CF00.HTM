<H2>6.2. Terminator requirements</H2>  </P>
This section defines the requirements of the terminator and terminator power.  Section 7 defines the location of terminators in system configurations.</P>
All terminators in PnP SCSI systems shall conform to the terminator requirements in the SCSI-3 Parallel Interface document.  The terminators shall operate correctly over a TERMPWR voltage range of 4.0-5.25 Vdc.  Regulated terminators are required.  These are often referred to as alternative 2 or active terminators.</P>
The host and the peripheral sub-system shall provide terminator power (TERMPWR) to the SCSI bus.  All terminators must be powered from the TERMPWR line(s) in the SCSI bus.</P>
  </P>
<B>Note</B>   Exceptions may be necessary for  battery operated devices and PCMCIA PC-Cards.</P>
  </P>
Devices providing TERMPWR must provide a self-resetting device (e.g. positive-temperature-coefficient or circuit breaker device) to limit the maximum amount of current sourced instead of a fuse.  Such a device opens the circuit when excessive current is drawn and closes the circuit when the device resets.</P>
