<H1>7. System configurations</H1>  </P>
Plug and Play requirements exist for three possible configurations:</P>
a.    Internal  configuration - all SCSI peripheral devices are internal to the host enclosure.</P>
b.    External configuration - all SCSI peripheral devices are external to the host enclosure.</P>
c.    Mixed configuration - a combination of internal and external SCSI peripheral devices.</P>
Each of these configurations exist for two design alternatives:  add-in SCSI and motherboard SCSI.  The term host adapter is used to refer to either the SCSI add-in card for the add-in SCSI design alternative or the SCSI logic within the host for the motherboard design alternative.</P>
PnP SCSI host adapters that support a mixed configuration shall have an automatic switchable terminator at the exit point.</P>
PnP SCSI peripheral devices shall not terminate the SCSI bus.</P>
PnP SCSI peripheral subsystems attached to the SCSI bus shall be terminated by installing an external terminator into the remaining open connector on the last peripheral subsystem on the bus.</P>
