<H1>Foreword</H1>  </P>
The Plug and Play SCSI (PnP SCSI) effort was undertaken as an extension to Plug and Play ISA.  Microsoft encouraged host adapter manufacturers to participate in this effort to develop an easy to use SCSI environment in the personal computer marketplace.</P>
PnP SCSI is a profile, not a standard.  PnP SCSI references the SCSI-2 standard and portions of the draft SCSI-3 standards.  PnP SCSI selects specific options and features from these documents.</P>
This specification is part of the PnP family and is designed to facilitate usage of the Small Computer System Interface (SCSI) on personal computing products. This document is an open, public specification supplementing existing SCSI specifications. This specification is intended to be platform and operating system independent.</P>
Companies which contributed to developing the initial draft specification include:  Adaptec,  AT&amp;T Global Information Solutions (formerly NCR), Digital Equipment Corporation, Future Domain, Maxtor, and Microsoft.</P>
