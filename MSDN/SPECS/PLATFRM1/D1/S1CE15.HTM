<H2>CAPABILITY FLAGS</H2>  </P>
These flags are used to describe the capabilities of a given surface.  All flags are bit flags and some combinations are legal.  A DCI Provider is expected to fill the <B>dwDCICaps</B> field of the <B>DCISURFACEINFO</B> structure with the combination of flags that describes the surface.  A DCI Client can fill the <B>dwDCICaps</B> field of the <B>DCICREATEINPUT</B> structure to describe the surface that it wants created.</P>

This flag cannot be combined with DCI_OFFSCREEN or DCI_OVERLAY.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP">DCI_OFFSCREEN</P></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP">Indicates that surface is an off screen display surface.  This flag cannot be combined with DCI_PRIMARY or DCI_OVERLAY.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP">DCI_OVERLAY</P></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP">Indicates that surface is an overlay surface.  This flag cannot be combined with DCI_PRIMARY or DCI_OFFSCREEN.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP">DCI_VISIBLE</P></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP">Indicates that the surface is directly visible.  All data written to this surface will be immediately visible.  This flag can be combined with DCI_OFFSCREEN to indicate that data from the off screen surface is automatically made visible on the primary display surface.  A DCI Client must not use this surface for double buffering.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP">DCI_CHROMAKEY</P></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP">Indicates that mechanism for overlaying is chromakeying.  This flag informs the DCI Client that the <B>dwChromakeyValue</B> field holds valid information.  This flag must be combined with DCI_OVERLAY.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP">DCI_1632_ACCESS</P></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP">This flag means that a bank switch handler has been installed for this surface.  The surface memory must be accessed via the provided selector only.  Huge pointer selector arithmetic is invalid.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP">DCI_DWORDSIZE</P></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP">Indicates that the DCI Provider supports only destination rectangles  whose sizes are DWORD multiples. </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP">DCI_DWORDALIGN</P></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP">Indicates that the DCI Provider will supports only destination rectangles that are aligned on DWORD boundaries on the screen.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP">DCI_WRITEONLY</P></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP">Indicates that only writes are permitted to the surface.  Read accesses from the surface may or may not generate a protection fault, but the results of a read from this surface will not be meaningful.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP">DCI_ASYNC</P></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP">This flag indicates that the surface is being copied to the screen asynchronously.  If the an OffScreen surface has this capability, the <B>Draw</B> callback will return immediately and the data will be copied when possible.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP"></P></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP">If this flag is combined with DCI_VSYNCH, the <B>Draw</B> callback will return immediately but the data will not be copied until the next VBI.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP">DCI_VSYNCH</P></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP">This flag indicates that the surface is being copied to the screen on each VBI.  If an offscreen surface has this capability, the <B>Draw</B> callback will copy the surface data to the screen on the next Vsynch signal and then return. </P>
If this flag is combined with DCI_ASYNCH, the <B>Draw</B> callback will return immediately but the data will not be copied until the next VBI.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP">DCI_CAN_STRETCHX</P></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP">This flag indicates that the DCI provider supports only stretching an image along the x axis (horizontal direction).  Any vertical stretching required will have to be performed by the DCI Client.  This flag is valid only for offscreen surfaces.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP">DCI_CAN_STRETCHY</P></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP">This flag indicates that the DCI provider supports only stretching an image along the y axis (vertical direction).  Any horizontal stretching required will have to be performed by the DCI Client.  This flag is valid only for offscreen surfaces.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP">DCI_CAN_STRETCHXY</P></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP">This flag indicates that the DCI Provider is capable of stretching the surface arbitrarily.  The support promised is not guaranteed.  A stretch request may still be rejected.  </P>
This flag only indicates capabilities of a surface.  It does not indicate that stretching is active.  This flag is valid only for offscreen surfaces.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP">DCI_CAN_STRETCHXN</P></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP">This flag indicates that the DCI Provider supports only stretching an image in integer multiples along the x axis (horizontal direction).  The support promised is not guaranteed.  A stretch request may still be rejected.  </P>
This flag only indicates capabilities of a surface.  It does not indicate that stretching is active.  This flag is valid only for offscreen surfaces.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP">DCI_CAN_STRETCHYN</P></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP">This flag indicates that the DCI Provider supports only stretching an image in integer multiples in the x axis (horizontal direction).  The support promised is not guaranteed.  A stretch request may still be rejected.  </P>
This flag only indicates capabilities of a surface.  It does not indicate that stretching is active.  This flag is valid only for offscreen surfaces.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP">DCI_CAN_STRETCHXYN</P></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP">This flag indicates that the DCI Provider is capable of stretching the surface in integer multiples along both the x and y axes.  The support promised is not guaranteed.  A stretch request may still be rejected.  </P>
This flag only indicates capabilities of a surface.  It does not indicate that stretching is active.  This flag is valid only for offscreen surfaces.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP">DCI_CANOVERLAY</P></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP">DCI Provider promises support for controlling overlay of an offscreen surface with the onscreen surface.  Access to the Overlay Control Buffer is provided by the <B>DCICreateOverlay</B> call.</P>
This flag only indicates capabilities of a surface.  It does not indicate that overlay is active.  This flag is valid only for offscreen surfaces.  </P>
This mechanism is not an alternate for window overlap management.  DCI Providers that support window overlap management must do so by supporting the <B>SetDestination </B>callback of offscreen surfaces.</P></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>
