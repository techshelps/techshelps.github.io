<H2>Purpose and Scope of Document</H2>  </P>
Microsoft is developing an advanced implementation of its Scalable Windows operating system called Windows NT.  Windows NT is a robust, fully featured operating system which provides fundamental compatibility with Windows.  (For more information on Windows NT see the attached Windows NT overview).  Microsoft and Intel have cooperated to define a multi-processor system architecture that is optimal for Windows NT.  This document describes the architecture of multi-processor machines best suited to run Windows NT.  Windows NT, like any portable, well-structured operating system, can be adapted to a wide variety of hardware platforms, including today's machines.  However, to achieve the best performance and to avoid significant porting and testing efforts, new multi-processor system designs should follow the architecture set forth in this document.</P>
Windows NT will be portable and secure.  It will support multi-processor (and uni-processor) machines.  It will be available in versions sufficiently standard to support binary distribution of the operating system for standard machine configurations.  Such distribution will be key to gaining wide-spread use of multi-processor machines.  This current document presents only the high level architecture of such machines.</P>
This document describes Windows NT hardware needs in a general fashion, but with emphasis on the 386 and i486.  It should be noted the Windows NT is a portable system capable of running on other architectures.</P>
Machines that conform to the architecture described here will require the least (possibly no) adaptation of Windows NT and will run Windows NT the most efficiently.</P>
