<H2>NMI</H2>  </P>
When Windows NT sees an NMI, it will print a message and halt.  Neither I/O nor memory buffers will be flushed, nor will any other part of an orderly shutdown be performed.  A full cold start will be required to reboot.  NMI should only be raised in circumstances in which such an immediate halt is the desired action.  Power-fail, I/O failure, and even some benign memory failures are NOT justification for raising an NMI--the desired reaction in these cases is an orderly shutdown.</P>
The correct use of NMI is to report when data being returned to the processor from memory is wrong.  NMI should never be used to report an I/O error.</P>
