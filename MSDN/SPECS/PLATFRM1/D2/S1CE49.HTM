<H2>Software Interrupts</H2>  </P>
Windows NT uses software interrupts to schedule and execute certain kinds of deferred processing.  A software interrupt is an event which behaves just like a "normal" interrupt, but is caused by the processor writing to some control register, rather than an external event.  The 80x86 Int instruction generates a kind of trap, not a software interrupt, and thus is not adequate for this purpose.</P>
Processors only send software interrupts to themselves.  They are masked in the same way as other interrupts.  Software interrupts have a priority lower than any I/O device.</P>
