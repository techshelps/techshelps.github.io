<H3>4.1 System Device Configuration List</H3>  </P>
The system device configuration list consists of nodes or data structures that identify the embedded devices that are on the system.  The embedded devices consist of systemboard components that provide the base functionality for the system.  This includes devices such as the Programmable Interrupt Controller (PIC), the DMA Controller, System Timer, Keyboard Controller, Integrated Video Controller, Floppy Controller, etc.  The system device configuration list only provides information about the systemboard devices and does not include nodes for devices plugged into an expansion bus.  The system device configuration list does not identify the peripherals that are attached to the embedded systemboard devices.  For instance, the system configuration list will identify an integrated fixed disk controller but will not provide nodes for any fixed disk drives that might be attached to the controller.  It is assumed that peripherals will be identified by other software.  The system BIOS provides an interface for system software to access the information in the system configuration list through the BIOS functions that are defined later in this document.  The System Device Node data structure provides configuration information about a single systemboard device.  The information returned for each systemboard component reported through the Plug and Play BIOS interface will follow the data structure format specified for the System Device Node.  The next subsection describes the System Device Node data structure.</P>
