<H3>1.2 Enhancements to the current BIOS architecture</H3>  </P>
The Plug and Play BIOS Specification attempts to make several improvements to the current PC system BIOS architecture to achieve the goals stated previously.</P>
<SPAN CLASS="list"><UL><LI><B>Perform resource allocation and conflict resolution at POST time.</B>
The current System BIOS Architecture performs no such resource management at POST time.  The goal is to increase the probability of successfully bootstrapping into the OS by specifying resource management at POST time.</P></LI><LI>Actively monitor the INT 19h bootstrap vector
The current System BIOS Architecture allows option ROMs to hook INT 19h indiscriminately.  By actively monitoring control of INT 19h, the System BIOS may regain control of the Bootstrap process to ensure that the Operating System is loaded from the proper device and in the proper manner.</P></LI><LI>Provide a mechanism for Remote Program Load
The current architecture provides no specific support for RPL.  Consequently, RPL devices must resort to hooking the INT 19h bootstrap vector or INT 18h, the alternate bootstrap vector.  Hooking these vectors can interfere with system specific security features, as well as result in bootstrap failures.  The method and support for booting from RPL devices is beyond the scope of the Plug and Play BIOS Specification.  A separate specification should define explicit support for RPL devices.</P></LI><LI>Provide Runtime Configuration Support
Proprietary techniques exist to support device resource configuration and reporting.  The Plug and Play BIOS Specification defines specific, standard interfaces whereby configuration software may identify and configure devices on the systemboard.</P></LI><LI>Provide Dynamic Event Notification
A further extension of the Runtime Configuration Support allows the System BIOS to report dynamic configuration events to the Plug and Play software such that new devices added into the system may be resource managed.  This dynamic event notification interface is specific to devices controlled by the system BIOS.  It does not encompass the insertion and removal of devices on the various expansion busses</P></LI></UL></SPAN> </P></BODY></HTML>
