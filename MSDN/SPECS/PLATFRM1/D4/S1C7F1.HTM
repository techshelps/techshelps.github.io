<H2>6. Plug and Play Resources</H2>  </P>
Plug and Play cards return read-only configuration information in two formats.  The serial identifier is returned bit-wise by the Plug and Play devices in response to reads from the Serial Isolation register.  This information is returned in a serial format to facilitate the Plug and Play device selection algorithm described earlier.  Plug and Play cards also provide resource data sequentially a byte at a time in response to reads from the Resource Data<I> </I>register.  The resource configuration data completely describes all resource needs and options of the device.</P>
