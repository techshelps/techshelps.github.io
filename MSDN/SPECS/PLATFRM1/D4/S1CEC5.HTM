<H3>5.2. Minimum Level of Functionality for a Non-configurable Logical Device</H3>  </P>
The minimum functionality non-configurable Plug and Play logical device identifies itself and provides resource information about the fixed resources it uses. The device should support the Activate command so that it can be removed from the bus if the Plug and Play software detects a non-resolvable conflict with a logical device on this card and another logical device in the system. Resource usage does not need to programmable since it may not be re-located.</P>
This is the minimum functionality level only for a device with fixed compatible resource usage.  This is not a desirable solution because there is no guarantee that any given configuration of devices with fixed resources will be conflict free.</P>
