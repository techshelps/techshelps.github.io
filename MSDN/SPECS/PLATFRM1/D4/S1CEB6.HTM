<H3>1.1. Goals</H3>  </P>
The following are the architectural goals to support full Plug-and-Play of ISA systems:</P>
<SPAN CLASS="list"><OL><LI>Focus on ease-of-use for the end-user</LI><LI>Provide the ability to uniquely address individual cards even when two or more cards are configured to use the same system resources.</LI><LI>Define a protocol that provides the ability to read a configuration template on each card which identifies current resource usage and options for each system resource requested on each card </LI><LI>Define a mechanism to set or modify the current configuration of each card</LI><LI>Provide a range of cost-benefit compliance points</LI><LI>Maintain backward and forward compatibility as follows:

<UL><LI>Plug and Play ISA cards will electrically and functionally inter-operate with standard ISA cards in any existing ISA based PC system; however, the system may not be fully auto-configurable.</LI><LI>With the addition of Plug and Play software (i.e.  utilities, BIOS enhancements or operating system enhancements, and user interrogation), the above system can be made increasingly auto-configurable.  </LI><LI>A system with only Plug and Play ISA cards and appropriate software will be fully auto-configurable.</LI></UL></LI></OL></SPAN> </P></BODY></HTML>
