<H3>1.2. Implementation Considerations</H3>  </P>
The solution of the ISA configuration problem addresses major concerns of end-users, system integrators, ISA card manufacturers, and operating system vendors.  It also presents an excellent business opportunity for providing measurable value and differentiation in the short term.  </P>
