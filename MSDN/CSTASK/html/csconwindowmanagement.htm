There are a variety of ways to manage the tool and document windows in your program and to maximize your workspace. Tool windows are windows added by the development environment (for example, the Project Explorer). Document windows are windows that contain items that you create (for example, a form). You can dock or link the tool windows to minimize window clutter, and you can view only the windows you need. You can also customize your window preferences so that each time you open the development environment, you view the windows you want.</p>
<p>
In addition, there are two development interface modes: MDI (Multiple Document Interface) and SDI (Single Document Interface). In MDI mode your desktop has one window that contains the other windows you have open. In SDI mode every window you have open appears separately on the desktop.</p>
<h2>Windows</h2>
<h3>Tool Windows</h3>
<p>
Tool windows are defined by the application and its add-ins. The tool windows are listed in the View menu. They can be shown, hidden, docked, linked, or moved outside the application area and viewed on another monitor. Although you cannot maximize or minimize a tool window, you can resize it. The new size becomes part of your current view. When a tool window is active, you can make changes to it. For example, you can add items and projects to the Project Explorer when it is active. You can make tool windows dockable or undockable by selecting or clearing the Dockable command on the Windows menu. When a tool window is dockable, it floats on top of the other windows or it snaps to a side of the application window. To move a dockable window without snapping it into place, press CTRL while dragging it to the location you desire. When tool windows are no longer dockable, they behave like document windows, appearing on the Windows list of the Windows menu.</p>
<h3>Document Windows</h3>
<p>
Document windows are dynamically created when you open or create files or other items. When a document window is visible, the file is considered open and you can edit it. Closing a document window also closes the file. The current list of document windows appears in the Windows menu in the order in which they are opened, with the currently open window at the top of the list. The active document window also has a check mark to the left of it.</p>
<p>
Document windows exist only inside the application's available client area. You can close, resize, maximize, and minimize document windows, but you cannot hide, link, or dock them.</p>
<h3>Linking Windows</h3>
<p>
You can link tool windows together by dragging one window over another. There are two types of linking: linked windows and tabbed linked windows. When you link windows horizontally, they appear as one window, with the title bar as the separator. Tabbed linked windows appear as one window, with tabs that allow you to navigate to the other linked windows.</p>
<h3>Multiple Monitors</h3>
<p>
On platforms that support multiple monitors, you can move your windows to multiple monitors by dragging the window to the other monitors. You can position the windows where you want them on the different monitors and their positions will be saved.</p>
<h3>Full Screen Mode</h3>
<p>
Full Screen mode makes the active document window full screen hiding all adornments of the main application window, including all toolbars, the title bar, all tool windows, the status bar, and the Windows taskbar. The z-order is retained so that your list of windows on the Window menu remains in the order in which they were opened. Any changes you make to your workspace in Full Screen mode are saved when you leave it.</p>
<p class=blue>
<b>To change to full screen mode</b>
<ul type=disc>
<li>
Choose <b>Full Screen</b> from the <b>View</b> menu.</li>
</ul>
<p>
When you are in Full Screen mode, a toolbar with the Full Screen button appears on top of the window. Click the Full Screen button to leave Full Screen mode.</p>
