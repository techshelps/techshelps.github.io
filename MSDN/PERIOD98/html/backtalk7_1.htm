<h4>How delightfully refreshing!</h4>
<p>
The December 1997 interim shipment to all Professional and Universal subscribers included a beta refresh of Windows 98, which by now has started whining that it will soon expire. Never fear! Windows 98 beta 3 is on its way in the January 98 quarterly release. It not only comes chock-full of new features and bug fixes, but extends your desktop's life as well. And speaking of <i>refreshing</i>, remember that the January 98 quarterly release is a complete refresh of your MSDN subscription. That is to say, all discs of all packs that you currently receive at your subscription level are included in the January shipment, complete with nifty new '98 release valises (that's "binders" to you and me)!</p>
<h4>Staying organized</h4>
<p>
Many of you have written to ask when you'll be receiving Microsoft Project 98 as part of your MSDN subscription. The good news: it's part of the January 98 release. Watch your mailbox.</p>
<h4>Questions about your subscription?</h4>
<p>
The Member Services section on MSDN Online (<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/msdn/services/">http://www.microsoft.com/msdn/services/</a>) allows you to get the information you need about your subscription. You'll find:

</li>
<li>

<h4>Developer to developer</h4>
<p>
You’re sitting there in your office (or cubicle), it’s 3:00 a.m. and there are two things bothering you: the cold pizza you consumed an hour or so ago and that nagging development question. You may have to suffer alone with your digestive system, but there are ways you can find help or just someone to commiserate with on that code, no matter what the hour. For a listing of public newsgroups on Microsoft products and technologies, check out the Newsgroups page on MSDN Online (http://www.microsoft.com/msdn/newsgroups/) There you’ll find listings of public newsgroups on Visual Basic, Visual C++, Visual FoxPro, Visual InterDev, SQL Server, Office Development, Win32 Development, and Multimedia Development. There’s even one for MSDN! Point your newsgroup browser at the ones that interest you. If you prefer, you can also contact Microsoft Technical Support. Just click on the hot links and you’ll find yourself at the Support site, where you can ask your questions.</p>
<p>
If you would welcome the chance to get out of the office and meet with other developers face-to-face, consider joining a user group near you. The MSDN User Group program provides specific information and support to the developer-centric user groups and special interest groups (SIGs). </p>
<p>
We support more than 500 developer user groups around the globe. These groups are especially interested in Visual Tools products. You’ll find more information about the groups and whether there’s one near you at <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/msdn/usergroup/">http://www.microsoft.com/msdn/usergroup/</a>. Microsoft also offers the Mindshare Program (see <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/mindshare/">http://www.microsoft.com/mindshare/</a>), which is designed to support the broad spectrum of general PC user groups.</p>
<p>
Several of our subscribers have also written to ask if there are plans for developer chat rooms or forums on MSDN Online. All we can say now is stay tuned. We’re looking at various ways of helping our developer community communicate with one another and with us. For now, though, visit those newsgroups (we read them, too) and send us e-mail at msdn@microsoft.com. </p>
