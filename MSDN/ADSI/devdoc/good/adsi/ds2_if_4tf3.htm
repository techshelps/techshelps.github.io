<h3><a name="_ds_iads_setinfo"></a>IADs::SetInfo</h3>
<p>
Saves the current values for the properties for this Active Directory object from the property cache to the underlying directory store. This is analogous to flushing a buffer out to disk. </p>
<pre><b><code>HRESULT IADs::SetInfo(void);
 </code></b></pre>
<h4>Return Values</h4>
<p>
This method supports the standard return values E_FAIL and E_UNEXPECTED, as well as the following:
<dl>
<dt>
S_OK</dt>
<dd>
The property values in the cache have been saved to the underlying directory. 
</dd>
</dl>
<h4>Remarks</h4>
<p>
<b>SetInfo</b> does affects only the objects that are newly created in a container. It does not affect objects that were already stored in a container. Except for newly created objects, a call to this method affects the properties of the container, not its contents. </p>
<p>
At the time of the <b>SetInfo </b>call, if any property cache values have been written with a control code such as ADS_PROPERTY_UPDATE or ADS_PROPERTY_CLEAR, it is at this time that the appropriate requests are passed on to the underlying directory service. </p>
<h5>Notes to Implementers</h5>
<p>
Both <b>GetInfo</b> and <b>SetInfo</b> may require multiple accesses to the underlying directory to load or store the properties in the ADSI object. It is technically possible for a <b>GetInfo</b> or <b>SetInfo</b> operation to be only partially successful. You are expected to complete as much of the requested operation as possible before returning. Active Directory provides several standard error codes to indicate that a request was not completely processed. See <a href="ds2cli_822b.htm"><b>ADSI Errors</b></a>. </p>
<h4>QuickInfo</h4>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Windows NT:</b>  Use version 4.0 and later. <br>
