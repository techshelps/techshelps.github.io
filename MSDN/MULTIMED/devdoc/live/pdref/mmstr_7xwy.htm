<h4>Members</h4>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>cbStruct</b></dt>
<dd>
Size, in bytes, of the <b>MIXERCONTROL</b> structure. </dd>
<dt>
<b>dwControlID</b></dt>
<dd>
Audio mixer-defined identifier that uniquely refers to the control described by the <b>MIXERCONTROL</b> structure. This identifier can be in any format supported by the mixer device. An application should use this identifier only as an abstract handle. No two controls for a single mixer device can ever have the same control identifier.</dd>
<dt>
<b>dwControlType</b></dt>
<dd>
Class of the control for which the identifier is specified in <b>dwControlID</b>. An application must use this information to display the appropriate control for input from the user. An application can also display tailored graphics based on the control class or search for a particular control class on a specific line. If an application does not know about a control class, this control must be ignored. There are eight control class classifications, each with one or more standard control types:
<dl>
<dt>
MIXERCONTROL_CT_CLASS_CUSTOM</dt>
<dd>
MIXERCONTROL_CONTROLTYPE_CUSTOM</dd>
<dt>
MIXERCONTROL_CT_CLASS_FADER</dt>

<dd>
MIXERCONTROL_CONTROLTYPE_MICROTIME<br>
MIXERCONTROL_CONTROLTYPE_MILLITIME</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dt>
<b>fdwControl</b></dt>
<dd>
Status and support flags for the audio line control. The following values are defined:
<dl>
<dt>
MIXERCONTROL_CONTROLF_DISABLED</dt>
<dd>
The control is disabled, perhaps due to other settings for the mixer hardware, and cannot be used. An application can read current settings from a disabled control, but it cannot apply settings.</dd>
<dt>
MIXERCONTROL_CONTROLF_MULTIPLE</dt>
<dd>
The control has two or more settings per channel. An equalizer, for example, requires this flag because each frequency band can be set to a different value. An equalizer that affects both channels of a stereo line in a uniform fashion will also specify the MIXERCONTROL_CONTROLF_UNIFORM flag.</dd>
<dt>
MIXERCONTROL_CONTROLF_UNIFORM</dt>
<dd>
The control acts on all channels of a multichannel line in a uniform fashion. For example, a control that mutes both channels of a stereo line would set this flag. Most MIXERCONTROL_CONTROLTYPE_MUX and MIXERCONTROL_CONTROLTYPE_MIXER controls also specify the MIXERCONTROL_CONTROLF_UNIFORM flag.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dt>
<b>cMultipleItems</b></dt>
<dd>
Number of items per channel that make up a MIXERCONTROL_CONTROLF_MULTIPLE control. This number is always two or greater for multiple-item controls. If the control is not a multiple-item control, do not use this member; it will be zero.</dd>
<dt>
<b>szShortName</b></dt>
<dd>
Short string that describes the audio line control specified by <b>dwControlID</b>. This description should be appropriate to use as a concise label for the control.</dd>
<dt>
<b>szName</b></dt>
<dd>
String that describes the audio line control specified by <b>dwControlID</b>. This description should be appropriate to use as a complete description for the control.</dd>
<dt>
<b>Bounds</b></dt>
<dd>
Union of boundary types.</dd>
<dt>
<b>lMinimum</b></dt>
<dd>
Minimum signed value for a control that has a signed boundary nature. This member cannot be used in conjunction with <b>dwMinimun</b>.</dd>
<dt>
<b>lMaximum</b></dt>
<dd>
Maximum signed value for a control that has a signed boundary nature. This member cannot be used in conjunction with <b>dwMaximun</b>.</dd>
<dt>
<b>dwMinimum</b></dt>
<dd>
Minimum unsigned value for a control that has an unsigned boundary nature. This member cannot be used in conjunction with <b>lMinimun</b>.</dd>
<dt>
<b>dwMaximum</b></dt>
<dd>
Maximum unsigned value for a control that has an unsigned boundary nature. This member cannot be used in conjunction with <b>lMaximum</b>.</dd>
<dt>
<b>Metrics</b></dt>
<dd>
Union of boundary metrics.</dd>
<dt>
<b>cSteps</b></dt>
<dd>
Number of discrete ranges within the union specified for a control specified by the <b>Bounds</b> member. This member overlaps with the other members of the <b>Metrics</b> structure member and cannot be used in conjunction with those members.</dd>
<dt>
<b>cbCustomData</b></dt>
<dd>
Size, in bytes, required to contain the state of a custom control class. This member is appropriate only for the MIXERCONTROL_CONTROLTYPE_CUSTOM control class. 
<p>
To determine if the <b>dwMinimum</b>, <b>dwMaximum</b>, <b>lMinimum</b>, <b>lMaximum</b>, <b>cSteps</b>, and <b>cbCustomData</b> members are appropriate for a control class, see <a href="../pdgrmm/mixer_056b.htm">Control Types</a>.

<p>
The calling application does not need to initialize any members of this structure because the <b>MIXERCONTROL</b> structure is passed to the <a href="mmfunc_01o3.htm"><b>mixerGetLineControls</b></a> function as a receiving buffer that is referenced and described by the <b>MIXERLINECONTROLS</b> structure. When <b>mixerGetLineControls</b> returns, the <b>cbStruct</b> member contains the actual size of the information returned by the mixer device. The returned information will not exceed the requested size, nor will it be smaller than the <b>MIXERCONTROL</b> structure.
</dd>
<dt>
<b>dwReserved</b></dt>
<dd>
Reserved; do not use.
</dd>
</dl>
