<h2><a name="_win32_adding_drivers_within_an_application"></a>Adding Drivers Within an Application</h2>
<p>
If you need your application to implement its own compression routines internally, the application can add drivers to the ACM by calling the <a href="../pdref/mmfunc_5jhg.htm"><b>acmDriverAdd</b></a> function. The application implements the driver by providing a function that conforms to the <a href="../pdref/mmfunc_05yb.htm"><b>acmDriverProc</b></a> prototype. After the application has added the driver, the application can use the driver through the ACM as it would use any other driver.</p>
<p>
The ACM treats drivers as either global or local. An application specifies whether a driver should be added as global or local when it calls <b>acmDriverAdd</b>. There are two differences between global and local drivers:
<ul>
<li>
Drivers added as global drivers are not shared with other applications. </li>
<li>
An application can directly alter the priority of a global driver (but not a local driver) by calling the <a href="../pdref/mmfunc_8dx5.htm"><b>acmDriverPriority</b></a> function. The ACM conducts a prioritized search when seeking an appropriate driver to provide an implementation of a function call. The ACM always gives local drivers higher priority than global drivers. The most recently added local driver has highest priority.</li>
</ul>
