<h2><a name="_win32_performing_memory_file_i_o"></a>Performing Memory File I/O</h2>
<p>
The multimedia file I/O services let you treat a block of memory as a file. This can be useful if you already have a file image in memory. Memory files let you reduce the number of special-case conditions in your code because, for I/O purposes, you can treat memory files as if they were disk-based files. You can also use memory files with the clipboard.</p>
<p>
As with I/O buffers, memory files can use memory allocated by the application or by the file I/O manager. In addition, memory files can be either expandable or nonexpandable. When the file I/O manager reaches the end of an expandable memory file, it expands the memory file by a predefined increment.</p>
<p>
To open a memory file, use the <a href="../pdref/mmfunc_665q.htm"><b>mmioOpen</b></a> function with the <i>szFilename</i> parameter set to NULL and the MMIO_READWRITE flag set in the <i>dwOpenFlags</i> parameter. Set the <i>lpmmioinfo</i> parameter to point to an <a href="../pdref/mmstr_7saa.htm"><b>MMIOINFO</b></a> structure that has been set up as follows: 
<ol>
<li>
Set the <b>pIOProc</b> member to NULL.</li>
<li>
Set the <b>fccIOProc</b> member to FOURCC_MEM.</li>
<li>
Set the <b>pchBuffer</b> member to point to the memory block. To request that the file I/O manager allocate the memory block, set <b>pchBuffer</b> to NULL.</li>
<li>
Set the <b>cchBuffer</b> member to the initial size of the memory block.</li>
<li>
Set the <b>adwInfo</b> member to the minimum expansion size of the memory block. For a nonexpandable memory file, set <b>adwInfo</b> to NULL.</li>
<li>
Set all other members to zero.</li>
</ol>
<p>
There are no restrictions on allocating memory for use as a nonexpandable memory file. </p>
