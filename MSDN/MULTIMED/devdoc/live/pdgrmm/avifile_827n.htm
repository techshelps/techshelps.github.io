<h1><a name="_win32_about_avifile_functions_and_macros"></a>About AVIFile Functions and Macros</h1>
<p>
The AVIFile functions and macros handle the information in time-based files as one or more <i>data streams</i> instead of tagged blocks of data called chunks. Data streams refer to the components of a time-based file. An AVI file can contain several different types of data, such as a video sequence, an English soundtrack, and a French soundtrack. Using AVIFile, an application can access each of these components separately.</p>
<p>
<b>Note</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the AVIFile functions and macros work with any RIFF file, this overview demonstrates their use with AVI files only. AVI files are typically the time-based files used with the AVIFile macros and functions.</p>
<p>
AVIFile functions and macros are contained in a dynamic-link library. To initialize the library, use the <a href="../pdref/mmfunc_4pbo.htm"><b>AVIFileInit</b></a> function. After you initialize the library, you can use any of the AVIFile functions or macros. To release the library, use the <a href="../pdref/mmfunc_33uc.htm"><b>AVIFileExit</b></a> function. AVIFile maintains a reference count of the applications that are using the library, but not those that have released it. Your applications should balance each use of <b>AVIFileInit</b> with a call to <b>AVIFileExit</b> to completely release the library after each application finishes using it.</p>
