<h3><a name="_win32_automatically_opening_a_device"></a>Automatically Opening a Device</h3>
<p>
When you issue a command and specify a device that is not open, MCI tries to open the device before implementing the command. The following rules apply to automatically opening devices:
<ul>
<li>
The automatic open feature works only with the command-string interface. </li>
<li>
The automatic open feature fails for commands that are specific to custom device drivers. </li>
<li>
Automatically opened devices do not respond to commands that use "all" as a device name.</li>
<li>
The automatic open feature does not let your application specify the "type" flag. Without the device name, MCI determines the device name from the entries in the registry. To use a specific device, you can combine the device name with the filename by using the exclamation point, as described in the reference material for the <a href="../pdref/mmcmdstr_7226.htm"><b>open</b></a> command.</li>
</ul>
<p>
If an application uses the automatic open feature to open a device, the application should check the return value of every subsequent <b>open </b>command to verify that the device is still open. MCI also automatically closes any device that it automatically opens. MCI typically closes a device in the following situations:
<ul>
<li>
The command is completed.</li>
<li>
You abort the command.</li>
<li>
You request notification in a subsequent command.</li>
<li>
MCI detects a failure.</li>
</ul>
