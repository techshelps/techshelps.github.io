<h2><a name="_win32_opening_and_closing_mixer_devices"></a>Opening and Closing Mixer Devices</h2>
<p>
When you want to use a mixer device, you can either simply begin using it or you can explicitly open the device before using it. Explicitly opening a mixer device offers two main benefits:
<ul>
<li>
It guarantees the continued existence of that mixer device.</li>
<li>
It lets you receive notification of audio line and control changes.</li>
</ul>
<p>
You can use the <a href="../pdref/mmfunc_1cq6.htm"><b>mixerOpen</b></a><b> </b>function to explicitly open a mixer device. This function takes as parameters a device identifier, a pointer to a memory location, and other values unique to each type of device. The memory location is filled with a device handle. Use this device handle to identify the open mixer device when calling other audio mixer functions. As long as a handle of a mixer device exists, the device continues to exist in the system. If a configuration change occurs to the mixer device and it hasn't been explicitly opened, your application might suddenly be unable to access it.</p>
<p>
<b>Note</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;The difference between device identifiers and device handles is important. Device handles are returned when you open a device driver by using <b>mixerOpen</b>. Device identifiers are determined implicitly from the number of devices present in a system; this number is obtained by using the <a href="../pdref/mmfunc_4xrn.htm"><b>mixerGetNumDevs</b></a><b> </b>function. </p>
<p>
You can use the <a href="../pdref/mmfunc_9wrp.htm"><b>mixerClose</b></a><b> </b>function to close a mixer device. You should close the device after you finish using it.</p>
