<p>
In addition to using a callback function, you can poll the <b>dwFlags</b> member of a <a href="../pdref/mmstr_7zsi.htm"><b>WAVEHDR</b></a> structure to determine when an audio device is finished with a data block. Sometimes it is better to poll <b>dwFlags</b> than to wait for another mechanism to receive messages from the drivers. For example, after you call the <a href="../pdref/mmfunc_1epg.htm"><b>waveOutReset</b></a> function to release pending data blocks, you can immediately poll to be sure that the data blocks have been released before calling <a href="../pdref/mmfunc_2h82.htm"><b>waveOutUnprepareHeader</b></a> and freeing the memory for the data block.</p>
<p>
You can use the WHDR_DONE flag to test the <b>dwFlags</b> member. As soon as the WHDR_DONE flag is set in the <b>dwFlags</b> member of the <b>WAVEHDR</b> structure, the driver is finished with the data block.</p>
