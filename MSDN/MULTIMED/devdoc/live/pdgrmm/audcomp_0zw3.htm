<p>
The ACM functions fall into several categories. Naming conventions for the functions make it easy to identify these categories. Function names (with two exceptions) are of the form <i>acmGroupFunction</i>, where <i>Group</i> designates the ACM category (such as "Driver," "Format," "FormatTag," "Filter," "FilterTag," or "Stream"), and <i>Function</i> describes the action performed by the function.</p>
<p>
The functions in the filter and format groups are very similar. Almost every function that acts on filters has a parallel function that acts on formats.</p>
<p>
In the format group, some functions use waveform-audio format tags (the <b>wFormatTag</b> member of a <a href="../pdref/mmstr_625u.htm"><b>WAVEFORMATEX</b></a> structure) while others require full waveform-audio formats (the full <b>WAVEFORMATEX</b> structure). (For reference information about the <b>WAVEFORMATEX</b> structure, see <a href="avicap_83si.htm">Error</a>.)</p>
<p>
In the filter group, some functions use waveform-audio filter tags (the <b>dwFilterTag</b> member of a <a href="../pdref/mmstr_7trm.htm"><b>WAVEFILTER</b></a> structure), while others require full waveform-audio filters (the full <b>WAVEFILTER</b> structure). </p>
<p>
The functions in the stream group represent the many steps involved in a conversion: opening a conversion instance, preparing for the conversion, performing the conversion, cleaning up after the conversion is complete, and closing the conversion instance.</p>
