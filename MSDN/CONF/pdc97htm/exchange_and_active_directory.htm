White Paper</p>
<p>
<b>Abstract</b></p>
<p>
This White Paper provides an overview of how Microsoft® Exchange will integrate with the Windows NT® 5.0 operating system Active Directory service as well as the benefits of integration. Moving to a common directory reduces the total cost of ownership, provides a unified view of all objects, and a single point of administration across the enterpise. By providing, among other things, a replication agent between the Exchange Directory Service and the Active Directory to keep all objects in sync, provide full backward compatibilty for all Exchange clients, and offer a unified administration program, the migration to and coexistence with the Active Directory will be greatly simplified.</p>

<h2><a name="introduction"></a>Introduction</h2>
<p>
Two new Microsoft® software releases in 1998 will significantly enhance the way businesses communicate. Microsoft Windows NT® operating system version 5.0 will be available early in the year, followed by the next major release of Microsoft Exchange Server with directory integration, codenamed &ldquo;Platinum,&rdquo; which is due in the second half of the year. </p>
<p>
With &ldquo;Platinum,&rdquo; servers and clients will use the Windows NT 5.0 Active Directory for universal access to all user and configuration information. This directory integration provides Exchange customers with even greater scalability, enhanced security, and native Internet Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) version 3.0 support, as well as a single point of administration.</p>
<p>
We know that any upgrade has inherent costs, which is why we made it a fundamental design goal of &ldquo;Platinum&rdquo; to provide seamless upgrading and interoperability with previous versions of Exchange servers and Exchange clients. By unifying the underlying object classes and directory tree, &ldquo;Platinum&rdquo; will provide administrators of Exchange and Windows NT with a consistent administrative model. Additionally, with rich directory replication between the Active Directory and the Exchange Directory Service, recipient administrative functions for the entire Exchange organization can be performed through the Windows NT 5.0 Microsoft Management Console (MMC).</p>
<p>
With these two new releases, we&rsquo;re taking great strides toward realizing Microsoft&rsquo;s Zero Administration for Windows® vision. This vision&mdash;offering a simplified and single point of administration&mdash;is our focus and will be an inherent trait in all future releases. </p>
<p>
This white paper discusses the benefits of migrating to the Active Directory, as well as the simplicity with which migration is achieved. </p>
<h2><a name="background"></a>BACKGROUND</h2>
<p>
If you&rsquo;re unfamiliar with the features and benefits of Microsoft Exchange Server and Windows NT Server, this section provides an overview of the Exchange Directory service and a brief outline of the forthcoming Windows NT 5.0 Active Directory. </p>
<h3><a name="microsoftexchangedirectoryservice"></a>Microsoft Exchange Directory Service</h3>
<p>
We introduced the Exchange Directory Service with the first release of Exchange in March 1996. Since its release, Exchange has been deployed in thousands of companies with directory sizes ranging from 10 users to hundreds of thousands of entries. The Exchange Directory Service delivered our first distributed, multimaster (for example, every Exchange server has a full, modifiable, copy of the directory), replicated directory for messaging. The Exchange Directory Service provides the following features: 
<ul>
<li>
<b>Fully multimastered functionality,</b> allowing a single point of administration. <br><br></li>
<li>
<b>Remote Procedure Calling (RPC)&ndash;based replication </b>within a site, <b>and mail-based replication </b>between sites. This feature ensures that all directory updates are quickly and efficiently propagated to all other Exchange servers in the organization. Between sites, you can set up a schedule for regular updates of information to be transmitted by e-mail, allowing replication to both connected and non-connected, remote sites.<br><br></li>
<li>
<b>Client-server (RPC) operations supporting rich, fully indexed searches.</b> Server-based searches mean that your requests are processed at the server level. By filtering out unnecessary data at the server level, the information you receive is more pertinent, which saves you time, and there are fewer transmissions, which helps maintain the network&rsquo;s speed. <br><br></li>
<li>
<b>Scalability and a transaction-based database.</b> Microsoft Exchange Server is scalable to hundreds of thousands of users, so you&rsquo;re not limited by capacity. The transaction-based database means that you have a record of the updates: should your server ever go down, you have a record of the recent changes, making recovery easier and more secure. In Exchange 5.5, the maximum database size grows from 16 gigabytes to virtually unlimited storage capacity.<br><br></li>
<li>
<b>LDAP, the universal directory protocol, </b>with read-only functionality. Our Exchange 5.5 release will include full LDAP v. 3.0, for read and write functionality and support for programming via the Active Directory Service Interface (ADSI).<br><br></li>
<li>
<b>Address Book Views.</b> This feature allows an administrator to offer multiple views so users can choose to access names and addresses of people in subgroupings such as &ldquo;Marketing&rdquo; or &ldquo;Southwest,&rdquo; for example, rather than having to search through the entire company-wide address book.<br><br></li>
<li>
<b>Language-Specific Sort Orders.</b> This feature allows an administrator to define the languages for which the Exchange server will properly sort responses. Thus, when the e-mail client connects to the Exchange server and identifies its local language (such as French), the server will return all lists sorted in the appropriate order.</li>
</ul>
<h3><a name="windowsnt5.0activedirectory"></a>Windows NT 5.0 Active Directory</h3>
<p>
At Microsoft, we&rsquo;re building the foundation for distributed computing with our next-generation Active Directory Service. This Active Directory Service, part of Windows NT 5.0, combines the best of the Internet&rsquo;s Domain Name Service (DNS) locator services and the X.500 naming standards. This combination provides enterprises with the interoperability they need to unify and manage the multiple name spaces that now exist across the varied software and hardware environments of corporate networks. </p>
<p>
The Active Directory Service incorporates LDAP as its core protocol, so it can work across operating system boundaries, integrating multiple name spaces. This next-generation directory service can be included in and manage application-specific directories, as well as other network operating system&ndash;based directories. This broad functionality offers a general purpose directory service that reduces the administrative burdens and costs associated with maintaining multiple name spaces. </p>
<p>
The Active Directory Service provides a single point of administration for all published resources, including files, peripheral devices, host connections, databases, Web access, users, other arbitrary objects, and services. This next-generation Directory Service also supports a hierarchical name space allowing objects to be grouped by organizational unit.</p>
<p>
Supporting more than 10 million objects per store, with multiple stores, the Active Directory Service offers unparalleled scalability while also providing unsurpassed simplicity for smaller businesses. When combined with the forthcoming Microsoft Distributed File System, part of Windows NT 5.0, the Active Directory Service will bring networks even closer to the goal of having a single global name space.</p>
<p>
The Active Directory Service is seamlessly integrated with Windows NT Server&mdash;the only operating system that offers traditional file and print, applications, communications, and Internet/intranet support built in. Windows NT Server is the best file and print server for all of your business&rsquo;s information and resource-sharing needs, outperforming the other operating systems available today. It is also the premium applications server available, offering the best scalability/price ratio in the industry. Additionally, Windows NT Server is an excellent communications platform, offering such features as Remote Access Services (RAS), Telephony Application Programming Interface (TAPI), and Point to Point Tunneling Protocol (PPTP). </p>
<p>
The Active Directory Service provides the power of X.500 interoperability, without requiring systems to host the entire X.500 overhead. Our Active Directory Service implements the protocols needed for X.500 communication, including subsets of the 1993 Directory Access Protocol (DAP), Directory System Protocol (DSP), and Directory Information Shadowing Protocol (DISP), and, as already noted, LDAP. The result of this collection of protocols is the high level of interoperability required for administering today&rsquo;s diverse networks.</p>
<p>
The Active Directory includes the following features and benefits:
<ul>
<li>
Support for open standards to facilitate cross-platform directory services, including support for DNS and standard protocols, such as LDAP and HTTP.<br><br></li>
<li>
Support for standard name formats to ensure ease of migration and ease <br>
of use.<br><br></li>
<li>
Global Catalog server that holds a copy of every directory object in the organization.<br><br></li>
<li>
A rich set of APIs, which are easy to use for both the scripter and C/C++ programmer.<br><br></li>
<li>
Easy, intuitive administration through a simple hierarchical domain structure and the use of drag-and-drop administration.<br><br></li>
<li>
Directory object extensibility via an extensible schema.<br><br></li>
<li>
Fast lookup and Internet publishing via the Global Catalog.<br><br></li>
<li>
Speedy, convenient updates through multimaster replication.<br><br></li>
<li>
Support for services that have a short life span, such as chat services, IP telephony, and other conferencing services.<br><br></li>
<li>
Backward compatibility with previous versions of the Windows NT operating system.<br><br></li>
<li>
Interoperability with NetWare environments.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a name="benefitsofintegration"></a>BENEFITS OF INTEGRATION</h2>
<p>
Microsoft is committed to the Zero Administration for Windows vision. Toward this vision, we have developed a platform to fully integrate with the Windows NT 5.0 Active Directory. By creating &ldquo;Platinum&rdquo; with full integration in mind, we&rsquo;ve been able to make migration to the Active Directory Service extremely simple, while preserving backward compatibility with previous versions of Exchange. This integration benefits both existing and future Microsoft Exchange customers, by providing a consistent directory strategy that provides a number of advantages.</p>
<h3><a name="reducedcostofownership"></a>Reduced Cost of Ownership</h3>
<p>
The most significant benefit of directory integration is the lower cost of ownership when maintaining two (or more) directory services and sets of data. This benefit is a result of two features:</p>
<h4><a name="unifiedstorageofalldirectoryinformation"></a>Unified storage of all Directory information</h4>
<p>
The Active Directory Service will be the single universal repository for all user and resource information. &ldquo;Platinum&rdquo; will access this repository, providing a consistent data view to the operating system, Exchange, and other applications.</p>
<h4><a name="flexiblearchitecture"></a>Flexible architecture</h4>
<p>
The Active Directory Service provides a flexible architecture enabling users (Mailboxes) to be moved between sites and renamed without adversely affecting Personal Address Books or old mail messages. The Active Directory also comes with a set of tools for renaming, merging, and splitting domains, making the directory even more customizable.</p>
<h3><a name="improvedreplication"></a>Improved Replication</h3>
<p>
The Windows NT 5.0 Active Directory Service adds several significant new features to extend and enhance the Exchange replication feature set, resulting in a reduction in network traffic and processing time.</p>
<h4><a name="perpropertyreplicationreconciliation"></a>Per-property replication and reconciliation</h4>
<p>
The Active Directory will replicate only changed properties. If, for example, the administrator changes a user&rsquo;s telephone number, only the new telephone number is replicated to other servers, not the entire user object. This property-specific update significantly reduces the amount of replication traffic within and between sites.</p>
<h4><a name="improvedreplicationtopology"></a>Improved replication topology </h4>
<p>
The Active Directory Service uses a more efficient replication model for intra-site and inter-site replication. The Active Directory will support any replication topology including, for example, a ring topology. This flexibility allows multiple replication paths to different sites, so the system is not prone to a single point of failure. </p>
<h3><a name="enhancedsecurity"></a>Enhanced Security</h3>
<p>
The Active Directory replaces the Windows NT security model and adds two important features.</p>
<h4><a name="perpropertypermissions"></a>Per-property permissions</h4>
<p>
With the Active Directory Service, administrators can set up permissions on any properties on any object, allowing them, for example, to give a group of users the ability to modify their office location and phone number but not their e-mail address.</p>
<h4><a name="richpermissionsmodel"></a>Rich permissions model</h4>
<p>
Active Directory applies all permissions directly to every object. Rather than cycling through a hierarchy to check on a user&rsquo;s access to a certain piece of data, the object itself will know whether a user has access to its particular piece of information. This feature not only results in greater performance, but also alleviates the need for administrators to consider the wide-reaching hierarchical implications that can result when giving a user permission to access one piece of data. </p>
<h3><a name="unifiedadministration"></a>Unified Administration</h3>
<p>
The Active Directory Service provides several enhancements to simplify and unify administration. 
<ul>
<li>
Previously in Microsoft Exchange, you could modify objects on an Exchange server only in the specific site in which the object was created. The Active Directory Service allows any object to be modified on any server that contains a full replica of the site, dramatically increasing replication flexibility.<br><br></li>
<li>
MMC provides a single tool for all Windows NT and Exchange operations. MMC also offers a Web administration tool&mdash;implemented with Active Server Pages and ADSI&mdash;to provide full Windows NT 5.0 management via any Web Browser, such as Microsoft Internet Explorer.</li>
</ul>
<h3><a name="expandedscalability"></a>Expanded Scalability</h3>
<p>
Data has shown that the Exchange directory can already service more client requests than are, on average, generated by any single Exchange server. With Exchange using the Active Directory, you can minimize the number of computers that need to run the directory service. With fewer computers running the directory service, the amount of replication network traffic and replication latency is also minimized.</p>
<p>
With fewer directory servers and the richer replication model, scalability is significantly enhanced&mdash;without reducing the efficiency of the network services or increasing the processing power needed on the Exchange servers.</p>
<h3><a name="extensibleschema"></a>Extensible Schema</h3>
<p>
The Active Directory Service itself defines a wide variety of classes such as service, site, machine, and organizational unit. The Active Directory Service is also extensible through the Active Directory API (formerly known as OLE DS), allowing administrators and applications the flexibility to extend the definition of objectClasses, or to create new objectClasses (such as message queues, configuration objects, and monitor objects). </p>
<p>
This extensibility allows administrators, for example, to add new attributes for Address Book Views (such as &ldquo;Current Project&rdquo;), for company-specific attributes (such as &ldquo;Employee ID&rdquo;), or Authorization (such as &ldquo;Expense Approval&rdquo;).</p>
<h3><a name="enhanceddirectoryaccess"></a>Enhanced Directory Access </h3>
<p>
The Active Directory can be accessed by a wide range of clients including Exchange, Outlook, Outlook Express (via the Windows Address Book), as well any generic LDAP client. </p>
<h4><a name="lightweightdirectoryaccessprotocol(ldap)"></a>Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP)</h4>
<p>
LDAP is the industry-standard protocol for accessing a directory service and is the primary protocol for accessing the Active Directory. By using LDAP, any client running on any platform that supports LDAP version 2.0 or 3.0 can search, read, or write to any directory object. This protocol greatly increases the openness of &ldquo;Platinum.&rdquo;</p>
<h4><a name="mapi1.0nameserviceproviderinterface(nspi)"></a>MAPI 1.0 Name Service Provider Interface (NSPI)</h4>
<p>
The Active Directory Service also supports the NSPI used by Exchange 4.0 and 5.<i>x</i> clients for complete backward compatibility. Combined with the replication agent (discussed later), this feature also ensures that existing personal address book (PAB) entries, off-line address book (OAB) entries, as well as replies to old e-mail messages will continue to work properly.</p>
<h3><a name="asinglecommonprogramminginterfaceadsi"></a>A Single, Common Programming Interface: ADSI </h3>
<p>
Active Directory Service provides a single, common programming interface to facilitate programming needs. You can use Active Directory to query, enumerate, and manage the resources in a directory service no matter which network environment is associated with the resource. Active Directory abstracts the capabilities of directory services from different network providers to present a single set of directory service interfaces for managing network resources. This common programming interface, ADSI, makes it easier to perform common administrative tasks, such as adding new users, managing printers, and locating resources throughout the distributed computing environment. By programming your queries to ADSI, you no longer need to concern yourself with the nuances of a proprietary directory service.</p>
<p>
ADSI lets Exchange customers use the scripting language with which they are familiar (such as Visual Basic®, Scripting Edition [VBScript], Java, and Perl) to read, write, or search through the directory. Scripting in the various languages is supported on the client side with Internet Explorer 3.0 and on the server side with Internet Information Server (IIS) Active server pages. For application developers, ADSI allows C++ full access to the directory through a COM interface.</p>
<h3><a name="sectionsummary"></a>Section Summary </h3>
<p>
With the release of &ldquo;Platinum,&rdquo; Exchange customers will get all of the great benefits of directory integration&mdash;through the Windows NT 5.0 Active Directory&mdash;and the security of knowing &ldquo;Platinum&rdquo; has been designed to be extremely simple to implement and use, while maintaining backward compatibility. Full integration with the Active Directory moves us closer to the Zero Administration for Windows vision and offers administrators a host of benefits: 
<ul>
<li>
Reduced cost of ownership, from maintaining only one Directory.<br><br></li>
<li>
Improved replication, through per-property replication and improved replication topology.<br><br></li>
<li>
Enhanced security, with per-property permissions and a rich permissions model.<br><br></li>
<li>
Unified administration, to simplify and streamline directory management.<br><br></li>
<li>
Expanded scalability, enhanced by the centralized directory service and rich replication model.<br><br></li>
<li>
Extensible schema, allowing for a breadth of customization options.<br><br></li>
<li>
Client access protocols, including LDAP and MAPI 1.0.<br><br></li>
<li>
A single, common programming interface. <p>
These rich features work together to deliver improved functionality and full integration with the Active Directory.
</li>
</ul>
<h2><a name="howactivedirectoryandplatinumworktogether"></a>HOW ACTIVE DIRECTORY AND &ldquo;PLATINUM&rdquo; WORK TOGETHER</h2>
<p>
With &ldquo;Platinum,&rdquo; all the information currently stored in the Microsoft Exchange Directory service will be represented in the Active Directory. This information can be thought of as two distinct areas: 
<ul>
<li>
Recipients (Mailboxes, Distribution Lists, Custom Recipients)<br><br></li>
<li>
Configuration information (Connectors, Monitors, Protocols, and so forth)</li>
</ul>
<h3><a name="recipientinformation"></a>Recipient Information</h3>
<p>
In the Active Directory, Exchange recipients will be stored as one of the following native Windows NT 5.0 objects in the Domain container:
<ul>
<li>
<b>Mailbox:</b> In the Active Directory, a Mailbox will be a user of Windows NT who has been &ldquo;mail-enabled&rdquo;; in other words, a user with an e-mail address, information that indicates to which Exchange server the user&rsquo;s mail should be routed, and the need for the user to connect to receive his or her mail. <br><br></li>
<li>
<b>Distribution Lists:</b> Because Windows NT Groups are primarily used for security purposes (for example, giving a Group permission to a file share), a new objectClass Distribution-List will be used to represent the Exchange Distribution List. Additionally, the Windows NT Group will be mail-enabled so users can send mail to it as well.<br><br></li>
<li>
<b>Custom Recipients:</b> In general, a Custom Recipient will be represented as a mail-enabled Contact in the Active Directory; that is, a Contact with an e-mail address and (optionally) information that allows Exchange to properly route the mail. <p>
With Exchange integration into the Active Directory, any object in the Active Directory can easily be mail-enabled. To mail-enable a native Windows NT 5.0 objectClass or third-party objectClass, the schema definition of the object can be modified to include the Exchange-Recipient Auxiliary class and to set the LDAP mail attribute on the object. This modification allows &ldquo;Platinum&rdquo; to know where to route mail addressed to this object. For example, the Windows NT Server object could be mail-enabled and the <i>mail</i> attribute could be set to server_admin@company.com<i>. </i>Users could then send messages directly to the server, to request additional disk space, for example, and the messages would be routed to the server administrator.
</li>
</ul>
<h3><a name="configurationinformation"></a>Configuration Information</h3>
<p>
All configuration information currently stored in the Exchange directory and registry will be stored in the Active Directory. The Active Directory has a special container (Naming Context) &ldquo;Configuration,&rdquo; which is replicated to every Active Directory server in the organization, and this is the container in which all the Exchange configuration information will be stored. As the Configuration container is replicated everywhere, it is also modifiable everywhere.</p>
<p>
<b>Figure 1. Exchange and Active Directory structures</b></p>
<p>
Within the Configuration container are two sub-containers that are of particular interest for Exchange:
<ul>
<li>
<b>Services,</b> where server applications can put global configuration information, and<br><br></li>
<li>
<b>Sites,</b> where server applications can store site-specific configuration information.<p>
Note that the Active Directory (and Exchange) administration tools will hide much of this complexity to enhance usability.
</li>
</ul>
<h4><a name="services"></a>Services</h4>
<p>
Under the \Configuration\Services container, Exchange will create an &ldquo;Microsoft Exchange&rdquo; container to include global routing information, directory replication information for replicating between the Active Directory and down-level Exchange servers, and down-level Exchange site information used for migration/coexistence.</p>
<h4><a name="sites"></a>Sites</h4>
<p>
Under the \Configuration\Site container is a container for every Active Directory site in your company (for example, &ldquo;Los Angeles,&rdquo; &ldquo;New York,&rdquo; &ldquo;Seattle&rdquo;). By definition, every Exchange server will exist in one of the Active Directory sites. Exchange will create a sub-container &ldquo;Microsoft Exchange Settings&rdquo; under the site where it is installed, and under this container are containers for Connectors, Monitors, Protocols, Servers, and Directory Replication (for Microsoft Mail and other systems) &mdash; similar to the containers that currently exist in the Exchange directory service under Configuration container.</p>
<p>
<b>Figure 2. Unified Directory Information Tree (DIT)</b></p>
<h3><a name="thenewwindowsnt5.0site"></a>The New Windows NT 5.0 Site </h3>
<p>
An Exchange site is defined as a group of servers that can communicate over high-bandwidth, permanent, and synchronous connections. The Active Directory builds on this definition saying that a site is a collection of IP subnets. The difference between the two versions of the definition is that with Active Directory, users, or recipients, are mapped to domains rather than sites.</p>
<p>
With the release of &ldquo;Platinum,&rdquo; as well as with future versions of BackOffice<sub></sub> products, there will no longer be Exchange sites or SMS sites, only a single definition of a site. When an administrator installs an Exchange server, the server will automatically be inserted into the site where it is physically located, based on its IP address. The Exchange routing engine will use the site to automatically generate an optimized messaging topology. The Active Directory will use the site topology information for directory replication. The Windows NT Administration programs will provide rich site manipulation, enabling administrators to move servers between sites, split sites, or join sites.</p>
<h4><a name="howsitesinteract"></a>How the sites interact</h4>
<p>
A Windows NT 5.0 domain, similar to a Windows NT 4.0 domain, is an administrative unit of the directory service that can contain computers, user accounts, groups, and contacts. A Windows NT 5.0 site, as mentioned above, is a group of Active Directory servers that can communicate over high-bandwidth, permanent, and synchronous connections that determine how directory information is replicated through the organization. In a real sense, no direct relationship exists between Windows NT 5.0 domains and sites. The following diagrams depict several possible Windows NT 5.0 organizations.</p>
<p>
<b>Figure 3.</b> In this first diagram, the Acme Company has three sites in three cities with relatively slow network connections between each of the sites. They currently have a single domain with all administration done in the Los Angeles site.</p>
<p>
<b>Figure4.</b> The company is located in one central location with high-speed connections between all users and servers, so it has a single site. However, for administrative purposes, it has three different domains for each of the functional divisions in the company, &ldquo;Support,&rdquo; &ldquo;Sales,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Development.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
<b>Figure 3.</b> This international corporation has two &ldquo;hub&rdquo; sites: Europe and North America. In each of these hubs are three small satellite sites used for sales offices. Similar to Figure 4, for administrative purposes they have three different domains for each functional division in the company.</p>
<p>
In a pure &ldquo;Platinum&rdquo; and Windows NT 5.0 environment you would see no Exchange sites, you would see only Windows NT 5.0 sites that contain Exchange servers and Windows NT 5.0 domains that contain mail-enabled objects (User, Group, Contacts, and so forth). However, as we move from previous versions of Exchange to &ldquo;Platinum,&rdquo; the Exchange recipients have a direct relationship with the objects in the Windows NT 5.0 domain, and most of the Exchange configuration information is directly mapped to the Windows NT 5.0 sites in preparation for the migration to the Active Directory. </p>
<p>
It&rsquo;s interesting to note that, unlike the current versions of Exchange, users are not tied to sites, rather user objects live in domains. This makes moving users between sites (such as Los Angeles to New York) invisible to the user. The underlying operation would be:
<ul>
<li>
Move the user&rsquo;s mail messages store on the Exchange server in Los Angeles to an Exchange server in New York.<br><br></li>
<li>
Modify the user&rsquo;s Directory entry to indicate that new mail should be routed to New York.<p>
Now all new mail messages are routed to the server in New York, and mail messages that were previously sent by the user from Los Angeles can be replied to and the reply will go to the New York server. This feature allows the previous PAB and OAB entries to remain valid.
</li>
</ul>
<h3><a name="management"></a>Management</h3>
<p>
Today, much of Microsoft Exchange management is accomplished by modifying entries in the Exchange Directory service. As we move forward to the &ldquo;Platinum&rdquo; Server, a similar model will emerge that will be greatly enhanced with improved security, per-property replication, and globally writable replicas. As mentioned earlier, all the configuration information currently stored in the Exchange Directory service will be moved into the Active Directory as well as most of the current Exchange registry settings. </p>
<p>
Windows NT 5.0 will deliver the MMC that provides a framework for all Windows NT administrative tools, called &ldquo;snap-ins.&rdquo; The Directory Service Administration snap-in will be the primary management tool for all objects located within the domain, including the User, Group, Contact and Computer. This snap-in will provide basic functionality to create, modify, and delete objects and organization units, as well as the ability to move objects between organizational units. After installing the &ldquo;Platinum&rdquo; Server, a new set of attributes (such as message size limits and delivery restrictions) and objectClasses (for example, Distribution-List and Public-Folder) will be added to the Active Directory schema. To administer these Exchange-specific items, Exchange will extend the Directory Service Administration snap-in to graphically expose the new attributes and classes so they are both viewable and modifiable.</p>
<p>
Additionally, Exchange will provide a snap-in or set of snap-ins to manage all the Exchange-specific configuration information, such as Connectors, Monitors, and Servers. </p>
<h3><a name="clientaccess"></a>Client Access </h3>
<p>
The &ldquo;Platinum&rdquo; Server will support all previous Microsoft Exchange clients and Internet standards-based clients. For Directory access, the Internet clients will access the Active Directory using the LDAP protocol. </p>
<p>
Exchange 5.5 clients as well as Exchange 4.0 or 5.0 with the latest Service Pack will be &ldquo;redirected&rdquo; to the Active Directory server. In this scenario, when the Exchange client starts up, the Exchange server notifies the client that the directory server it should talk to has been moved to another server (in this case an Active Directory server), and gives it the name of the new server to contact.</p>
<p>
<b>Figure 6. After upgrading, the Exchange client uses MAPI RPC to communicate directly with the Active Directory for all directory lookups and with the Exchange &ldquo;Platinum&rdquo; server for, example, reading and sending mail. By re-directing the existing client to the Active Directory, this allows you to consolidate the number of computers that need to run the directory service saving hardware costs and network bandwidth required for replicating directory changes.</b></p>
<p>
Alternatively, the Active Directory, acting as a Global Catalog server, can be run directly on the Exchange server and the client will communicate directly with a single machine for Directory and Messaging.</p>
<h3><a name="sectionsummary"></a>Section Summary</h3>
<p>
By clearly defining the relationship between Windows NT 5.0 sites and the new &ldquo;Platinum&rdquo; specifications, we&rsquo;ve been able to develop a migration plan that is both simple and effective. All information currently stored in the Microsoft Exchange Directory will be stored in the Active Directory, including Recipient information (Mailbox, Distribution Lists, and Custom Recipients) and Configuration information (such as Connectors, Monitors, and Protocols). With the release of &ldquo;Platinum,&rdquo; there will be only one definition of a site, and the Windows NT Administration programs will provide rich site manipulation, enabling administrators to move servers between sites, split sites, or join sites. </p>
<p>
Windows NT 5.0 will deliver the MMC that provides a framework for all Windows NT administrative tools, including Exchange. In addition, the release of &ldquo;Platinum&rdquo; will support previous versions of the Exchange client and Internet standards-based clients. With these features, &ldquo;Platinum&rdquo; has been designed to work simply, efficiently, and effectively with the new Active Directory server. </p>
<h2><a name="migrationandcoexistence"></a>MIGRATION AND COEXISTENCE</h2>
<p>
This section outlines the role of the Exchange replication agent in migration, the steps required to migrate from the Exchange version that you have now to &ldquo;Platinum&rdquo; with Windows NT 5.0 Active Directory server, as well as how your existing Exchange server will inter-operate with &ldquo;Platinum.&rdquo;</p>
<h3><a name="replicationagent"></a>Replication Agent</h3>
<p>
The Exchange replication agent, which will be available shortly after the release of Windows NT 5.0, plays a critical role in migration to and coexistence with the Active Directory. The replication agent maintains the consistency of the updates between directories, providing a single point of administration for all Exchange recipients in the Active Directory. It&rsquo;s also flexible enough to run on any machine on the network. </p>
<p>
The Exchange replication agent has several features:
<ul>
<li>
<b>Bidirectional replication.</b> The replication agent can communicate changes initiated on the Exchange Directory to the Active Directory, and vice versa. This bidirectional replication means that administrators can manage changes from either directory for greater flexibility.<br><br></li>
<li>
<b>Full fidelity of recipient objects.</b> Objects (such as Mailbox, Distribution List, and Custom Recipient) are replicated to the Active Directory. All address book information is transmitted with no loss of information in the replication process.<br><br></li>
<li>
<b>Customizable attribute mappings.</b> The replication agent offers a mechanism for administrators to define mapping between the Exchange attributes and Active Directory attributes, including the 10 Exchange attributes. <br><br></li>
<li>
<b>Replication of changes only.</b> On the object level, only changes are replicated. If, for example, of 100,000 users there are changes on 20 users, only the 20 users are replicated, reducing duplication and transmission time as well as network traffic.<br><br></li>
<li>
<b>Mail-based replication to remote or disconnected sites</b> (where a replication agent is running on the remote site). Changes made on a site can be replicated to a non-networked site (where a replication agent is running). The updates can be composed and transmitted as an e-mail message, and sent to the remote site for replication.</li>
</ul>
<h3><a name="howreplicationagentsworks"></a>How the Replication Agents Works</h3>
<p>
The replication agent works on two levels: the initial synchronization and the ongoing incremental synchronization. </p>
<h4><a name="initialsynchronization"></a>Initial synchronization</h4>
<p>
During the initial synchronization, the replication agent: 
<ul>
<li>
Updates schema on the Active Directory to include all Exchange attributes and objectClasses.<br><br></li>
<li>
Maps Exchange Mailboxes to Windows NT Users, maps Custom Recipients to Contacts, and maps Distribution Lists to Exchange Distribution Lists.<br><br></li>
<li>
Stamps Exchange DN (Distinguished Name) on all objects. This stamp identifies the object as having been mapped. This DN also allows the object to maintain its backward compatibility with existing PAB and OAB entries.<br><br></li>
<li>
Maps Windows NT Users who don&rsquo;t have mailboxes but who have e-mail addresses to Custom Recipients in Exchange, and maps Contacts who don&rsquo;t have mailboxes but who have e-mail addresses to Custom Recipients in Exchange. This last step ensures that all users who have an e-mail address are represented in the Exchange Global Address List (GAL).</li>
</ul>
<h4><a name="incrementalsynchronization"></a>Incremental<i> </i>synchronization</h4>
<p>
The Unique Synchronization Number (USN) is monotonically increasing value; after every directory update the current USN is stamped on the modified object (by the directory) and then the USN is incremented. During the ongoing incremental synchronization, the replication agent:
<ul>
<li>
Does a query for all objects that have a USN larger than the last synchronization against Exchange. If the Exchange object exists in the Active Directory, then the replication agent updates it. If it doesn&rsquo;t exist, it creates the object in the Active Directory.<br><br></li>
<li>
Does a similar query for all Active Directory objects that have a USN greater than the last synchronization number. If the object exists in the Exchange Directory server, then the replication agent updates it. Otherwise, the object is created. <p>
As we will discuss in the following sections, this bidirectional replication between the Exchange Directory and Active Directory provides a critical component to any migration/coexistence path.
</li>
</ul>
<h3><a name="phaseicoexistingwithwindowsnt5.0"></a>Phase I: Coexisting with Windows NT 5.0</h3>
<p>
When you upgrade to Windows NT 5.0, your existing Exchange servers will work just as they did with the Windows NT 4.0 servers. The Exchange servers will continue to do User validation through the standard Windows APIs (which Windows NT 5.0 will continue to support). When you upgrade the server on which Exchange is running to Windows NT 5.0, you will immediately notice some of the benefits of Windows NT 5.0, such as better performance, plug and play functionality, and the new set of Windows NT management tools (for Directory Service, Servers, Monitoring, and so forth). However, you will not have a unified directory until you upgrade to &ldquo;Platinum.&rdquo;</p>
<h3><a name="phaseiimigrating(upgrading)toplatinum"></a>Phase II: Migrating (Upgrading) to &ldquo;Platinum&rdquo;</h3>
<p>
Before upgrading your Microsoft Exchange server to &ldquo;Platinum,&rdquo; it is important to note that the Primary Windows NT User for all Mailboxes and Custom Recipients must be a Windows NT 5.0 User (or Group). This is because all of the Exchange attributes (first name, last name, and so forth) that must be migrated do not exist on a Windows NT 4.0 User.</p>
<p>
Upgrading to &ldquo;Platinum&rdquo; will be as simple as running the Setup program and answering a few basic questions. During the setup process, these high-level operations will occur:
<ul>
<li>
Active Directory schema will be upgraded. The Active Directory schema will be extended to include all the Exchange-specific objectClasses (for example, Connector) and attributes (for example, Message-Quota).<br><br></li>
<li>
The upgraded Exchange server will be installed into the Active Directory site where it currently exists (based on its IP address).<br><br></li>
<li>
Objects will be copied to the Active Directory. Any object that has a Primary Windows NT account (Mailbox and Custom Recipients) will be synchronized with their Windows NT User account. All other objects will be created as new objects in the Active Directory.<br><br></li>
<li>
If there are other Exchange servers in the organization, the replication agent will be installed to synchronize any future changes with either the Exchange Directory or Active Directory.<p>
After a server is upgraded:
</li>
<li>
The &ldquo;Platinum&rdquo; server&rsquo;s services interact directly with the Active Directory for reading configuration and user information. <br><br></li>
<li>
In a multiserver environment, all Exchange Recipient objects and Configuration objects can be managed from the Active Directory (via the Exchange MMC snap-in) and the changes can then be replicated to the &ldquo;pre-Platinum&rdquo; Exchange servers.<br><br></li>
<li>
In a multiserver environment, all Exchange Recipient objects and Configuration objects from the upgraded server are also available to the other Exchange server(s) in the site and can be administered with the old Exchange Administration program on a pre-&rdquo;Platinum&rdquo; server.<br><br></li>
<li>
All Internet clients will interact directly with the Active Directory for recipient lookups via LDAP.<br><br></li>
<li>
All existing Exchange 4.0 and 5.x clients on the upgraded server interact with the Active Directory using the existing RPC protocol, assuming: (a) they are running the proper Service Pack or (b) the Active Directory is running on the Exchange server. These &ldquo;legacy&rdquo; clients can be upgraded over time to the new and more effective &ldquo;Platinum&rdquo; client.</li>
</ul>
<h3><a name="phaseiiiplatinumcoexistingwithpreviousexchangeservers"></a>Phase III: &ldquo;Platinum&rdquo; Coexisting with Previous Exchange Servers</h3>
<p>
The ability of &ldquo;Platinum&rdquo; Server to coexist with existing Microsoft Exchange servers and sites is critical to the migration process. We&rsquo;ve designed most of the migration to be automatic and to be done by the installation process:
<ul>
<li>
An upgraded Exchange server will appear as if it exists in both its old Exchange site and its new Active Directory site. <br><br></li>
<li>
Directory changes, via the replication agent will be propagated between the two directories. <br><br></li>
<li>
The &ldquo;Platinum&rdquo; server can service both an Exchange MAPI client as well as Internet clients.<br><br></li>
<li>
&ldquo;Platinum,&rdquo; via the Active Directory, provides a single point of administration for all recipients across the entire Exchange organization.</li>
</ul>
<h3><a name="sectionsummary"></a>Section Summary</h3>
<p>
The Microsoft Exchange replication agent will be available shortly after the release of Windows NT 5.0. This agent maintains the consistency of updates and ensures a single point of administration. The replication agent works with an initial synchronization, mapping the Exchange Directory to the Active Directory, then with incremental synchronizations&mdash;on an administrator-defined interval&mdash;routinely updating the information between the directories. </p>
<p>
When you upgrade your present Exchange server to &ldquo;Platinum,&rdquo; you&rsquo;ll notice that most of the migration paths have been built directly in to the &ldquo;Platinum&rdquo; installation process. This simple, efficient upgrade allows you to take advantage of the breadth of resources available on the Active Directory, with the confidence of knowing that backward compatibility is ensured.</p>
<h2><a name="scenarios"></a>SCENARIOS</h2>
<p>
Following are three different scenarios that illustrate the installation and upgrade process for some typical configurations:
<ul>
<li>
A new installation of &ldquo;Platinum.&rdquo; <br><br></li>
<li>
An upgrade to a multiserver single site. <br><br></li>
<li>
An upgrade of a multidomain, multisite organization to &ldquo;Platinum.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<h3><a name="newinstallationofplatinum"></a>New Installation of &ldquo;Platinum&rdquo;</h3>
<p>
For a new installation of &ldquo;Platinum,&rdquo; the Windows NT Primary Domain Controller must be running Windows NT 5.0. When run, the setup program automatically does the following:
<ol type=1>
<li>
Upgrades Active Directory schema to &ldquo;Platinum.&rdquo;<br><br></li>
<li>
Adds the &ldquo;Platinum&rdquo; Server into the Active Directory site.<br><br></li>
<li>
Installs and starts the &ldquo;Platinum&rdquo; services.</li>
</ol>
<p>
Once the installation is complete: 
<ul>
<li>
The &ldquo;Platinum&rdquo; Server services interact directly with the Active Directory for reading configuration and user information. <br><br></li>
<li>
All &ldquo;Platinum&rdquo; Administration is handled via the &ldquo;Platinum&rdquo; MMC snap-in. <br><br></li>
<li>
All newly installed &ldquo;Platinum&rdquo; clients interact directly with the Active Directory for recipient lookups via LDAP.</li>
</ul>
<h3><a name="upgradingmultiserversingledomainsinglesitetoplatinum"></a>Upgrading a multiserver, single domain, single site to &ldquo;Platinum&rdquo;</h3>
<p>
When upgrading the first existing server to &ldquo;Platinum,&rdquo; the Windows NT Primary Domain Controller must be running Windows NT 5.0. When run, the setup program will automatically do the following:
<ol type=1>
<li>
Upgrades Active Directory schema to &ldquo;Platinum.&rdquo;<br><br></li>
<li>
Adds the &ldquo;Platinum&rdquo; Server into the Active Directory site.<br><br></li>
<li>
Migrates Exchange Recipient objects to the Active Directory.<br><br></li>
<li>
Migrates remaining Active Directory objects to Exchange.<br><br></li>
<li>
Migrates Exchange site configuration information that will be used by the &ldquo;Platinum&rdquo; Server.<br><br></li>
<li>
Installs and starts the replication agent.<br><br></li>
<li>
Installs and starts the &ldquo;Platinum&rdquo; services and Administration components.</li>
</ol>
<p>
At this point, similar to above, the &ldquo;Platinum&rdquo; services interact with the Active Directory and new clients interact directly with the Active Directory via LDAP. Additionally:
<ul>
<li>
All Exchange Recipient objects and Configuration objects can be managed from the Active Directory (via the &ldquo;Platinum&rdquo; MMC) and the changes are then replicated to the pre-&rdquo;Platinum&rdquo; servers.<br><br></li>
<li>
All Exchange Recipient objects and Configuration objects from the upgraded server are also available to the other Exchange server(s) in the site and can be administered with the old Exchange Administration program on a pre-&rdquo;Platinum&rdquo; server; the changes are then replicated to the Active Directory.<br><br></li>
<li>
Any Exchange 4.0 and 5.x clients on the upgraded server interact with the Active Directory, assuming (a) they are running the proper Service Pack or (b) the Active Directory is running on the Exchange server. These &ldquo;legacy&rdquo; clients can be upgraded over time to the new and more effective &ldquo;Platinum&rdquo; client.<p>
Visually, the results of this migration would look like the following diagram.
<p>
<b>Figure 7. After upgrading the first server in the Exchange site, the Replication Agent ensures the objects in both directories are in sync.</b>
</li>
</ul>
<h4><a name="upgradingsubsequentmicrosoftexchangeserversresultsinsetupprogramdoingfollowing"></a>Upgrading subsequent Microsoft Exchange servers results in the setup program doing the following:</h4>
<ul>
<li>
Adding the &ldquo;Platinum&rdquo; Server to the Active Directory site;<br><br></li>
<li>
Migrating &ldquo;Global&rdquo; and site configuration information that will be used by the &ldquo;Platinum&rdquo; Server; and<br><br></li>
<li>
Removing the Upgraded &ldquo;Platinum&rdquo; Directory Service from the intra-site replication list on the existing Exchange site. </li>
</ul>
<h4><a name="upgradinglastexchangeserverresultsinsetupprogramdoingfollowing"></a>Upgrading the last Exchange server results in the setup program doing the following:</h4>
<ul>
<li>
Adding the &ldquo;Platinum&rdquo; Server into the Active Directory site;<br><br></li>
<li>
Removing any configuration information in the Active Directory used for coexistence with the previous-version Exchange servers;<br><br></li>
<li>
De-installing the replication agent; and<br><br></li>
<li>
Installing and starting the &ldquo;Platinum&rdquo; services and Administration components.<p>
At this point, all Exchange servers have been upgraded to &ldquo;Platinum.&rdquo; 
<p>
<b>After all Exchange servers in the site are upgraded to &ldquo;Platinum,&rdquo; the replication is no longer needed and automatically removed.</b>
</li>
</ul>
<h3><a name="upgradingmultidomainmultisiteorganization"></a>Upgrading a Multidomain, Multisite Organization</h3>
<p>
Upgrading a multidomain, multisite organization is identical to upgrading a single- site, multiserver organization (covered in the previous scenario), with the following caveats:
<ul>
<li>
The Primary Windows NT User account for all Mailboxes on the server that is being upgraded must reside in a domain that has been upgraded to Windows NT 5.0.<br><br></li>
<li>
The replication agent will (optionally) be set up to replicate directly with all of the Exchange sites to which it has network connectivity.<br><br></li>
<li>
To enable bidirectional replication to remote Exchange sites, at least one server in the remote site must be upgraded with the newest Service Pack (available in the first half of 1998).<br><br></li>
<li>
Exchange servers in the organization can be upgraded to &ldquo;Platinum&rdquo; in any order.<br><br></li>
<li>
Exchange recipients in remote Exchange sites running in Windows NT 4.0 domains will be represented in the Active Directory as &ldquo;Remote Exchange Recipients&rdquo; and will show in the Active Directory Global Catalog.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a name="frequentlyaskedquestions(andanswers)"></a>FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS (AND ANSWERS)</h2>
<h3><a name="wheniupgrademyexchangeservertoplatinumwillineedtoupgradeallmymailclients"></a>When I upgrade my Exchange server to &ldquo;Platinum,&rdquo; will I need to upgrade all my mail clients?</h3>
<p>
No, you can upgrade the Exchange server first and then upgrade the clients over time. The Exchange 5.5 client will automatically be redirected to the to the &ldquo;nearest&rdquo; Active Directory; the Exchange 4.0 and 5.0 clients (with the latest Service Pack) will also automatically be redirected to the &ldquo;nearest&rdquo; Active Directory. Alternatively, by installing the Active Directory directly onto the &ldquo;Platinum&rdquo; server, Exchange 4.0 and 5.0 client without the Service Pack will continue to work without modification.</p>
<h3><a name="canpreviousversionsofexchangeserverplatinumcoexistinsamesite"></a>Can previous versions of Exchange Server and &ldquo;Platinum&rdquo; coexist in the same site?</h3>
<p>
Yes. Please see the &ldquo;Migration and Coexistence&rdquo; section for more information.</p>
<h3><a name="wheniupgradetoplatinumwhatdirectoryinformationwillilose"></a>When I upgrade to &ldquo;Platinum,&rdquo; what directory information will I lose?</h3>
<p>
No information will be lost when upgrading to &ldquo;Platinum.&rdquo; All the directory entries and attributes will by copied to the Active Directory.</p>
<h3><a name="whatisrelationshipbetweenexchangesitenewactivedirectorysite"></a>What is the relationship between an Exchange site and the new Active Directory site?</h3>
<p>
Conceptually, both sites define a collection of servers with high-bandwidth connectivity. Exchange will use the same site definitions as the Active Directory for message routing. During migration, &ldquo;legacy&rdquo; Exchange sites will coexist with Active Directory sites and will be used for message routing.</p>
<h3><a name="howwillmessagesberoutedbetweensites"></a>How will messages be routed between sites?</h3>
<p>
Currently, Exchange routes all mail messages based on the recipient&rsquo;s Distinguished Name (DN), which is one of the reasons why it is difficult to move users between containers and sites. In &ldquo;Platinum,&rdquo; mail will be routed on a new attribute <i>mail-drop</i>, which indicates the Exchange server (and indirectly the site) from which the recipients receives their mail.</p>
<h3><a name="willpublicfoldersusestandardwindowsnt5.0accesscontrollists"></a>Will Public Folders use standard Windows NT 5.0 Access Control Lists?</h3>
<p>
Yes. Access to Public Folders (and Private folders) will be based on the Windows NT 5.0 security access model. For more information on Windows NT 5.0 security, see the <i>Windows NT Security</i> white paper.</p>
<h3><a name="willallexistingconnectorsgatewaysrunonplatinum"></a>Will all existing connectors and gateways run on &ldquo;Platinum&rdquo;?</h3>
<p>
Yes. </p>
<h3><a name="willexchangedirectoryapi(dapi)besupportedonplatinum"></a>Will the Exchange Directory API (DAPI) be supported on &ldquo;Platinum&rdquo;?</h3>
<p>
DAPI will be supported for backward compatibility only. The interface to the directory in &ldquo;Platinum&rdquo; is the Active Directory Service Interface (ADSI).</p>
<h3><a name="willexchange4.0or5.xadministrationprogramworkagainstactivedirectory"></a>Will the Exchange 4.0 or 5.x Administration program work against the Active Directory?</h3>
<p>
No. All administration of the Active Directory will be through the new Windows NT and Exchange Microsoft Management Console (MMC). Any changes made using the Exchange Administration against an Exchange 4.0 or 5.<i>x</i> server will be propagated to the Active Directory via the Exchange replication agent. </p>
<h3><a name="willaddressbookviewsaccesscontrollistsbemigratedtoactivedirectory"></a>Will Address Book Views and access control lists be migrated to the Active Directory?</h3>
<p>
Yes. </p>
<h2><a name="conclusion"></a>CONCLUSION </h2>
<p>
With the upcoming releases of Windows NT 5.0 and &ldquo;Platinum,&rdquo; all user and configuration information will be accessible from a single, unified directory. Exchange Directory integration with Active Directory brings us closer to realizing the Zero Administration for Windows vision. </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Platinum&rdquo; has been designed to simply and efficiently migrate to the Active Directory while providing full backward compatibility. This consistent directory strategy offers many benefits, including reduced cost of ownership, improved replication, enhanced security and scalability, unified administration, and extensible schema, as well as client access protocols and a single common programming interface. </p>
<p>
As &ldquo;Platinum&rdquo; is being designed in tandem with the Active Directory, simple migration to, and coexistence with, the unified directory are inherent features in the upcoming release. The replication agent, available shortly after the release of Windows NT 5.0, ensures consistent updates between the Exchange Directory and the Active Directory, and efficient backward compatibility. And as &ldquo;Platinum&rdquo; is designed for migration to the Active Directory, the migration path is built into the installation process, making the transition simple, intuitive, and efficient.</p>
<p>
With the release of &ldquo;Platinum,&rdquo; administrators can look forward to a simple migration to the Active Directory, resulting in a single, unified directory.</p>
