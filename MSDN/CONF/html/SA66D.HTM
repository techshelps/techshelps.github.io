<h3>Distributed COM (DCOM)</H3><p>If you are a CIO, solution architect, or application developer who wants to create state-of-the-art distributed applications that scale equally well on an intranet, the Internet, or beyond, DCOM can help you. Use DCOM if your applications need to:</P>
<UL><LI>Provide fault-tolerance in the case of hardware failures.</LI><LI>Be installed in a small workgroup environment as well as a large corporate site.</LI><LI>Be robust in the presence of network failures.</LI><LI>Accommodate a wide variety of client machines with different capabilities or in different geographical areas.</LI><LI>Be more efficient in terms of network load.</LI></UL><p>DCOM can help you achieve these and other goals in existing applications and in completely new designs.</P>
<p>DCOM extends the Component Object Model (COM) to support communication among objects on different computers&mdash;on a LAN, a WAN, or even the Internet. With DCOM, your application can be distributed at locations that make the most sense to your customer and to your application.</P>
<p>Because DCOM is a seamless evolution of COM (the world's leading component technology) you can leverage your existing investment in COM-based applications, components, tools, and knowledge to move into the world of standards-based distributed computing. As you do so, DCOM handles low-level details of network protocols so you can focus on your real business: providing great solutions to your customers.</P></BODY></HTML>
