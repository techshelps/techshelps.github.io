<H2>BackOffice Family</H2><p>The Microsoft BackOffice family consists of Windows&nbsp;NT&trade; Server as the network foundation; Microsoft SQL Server&trade; for managing and storing data; Microsoft SNA Server for host connectivity; Microsoft Systems Management Server for managing PCs and servers; and Microsoft Mail Server for distributing information. Microsoft Mail Server will provide a direct upgrade path to Microsoft Exchange Server.</P>
<p>Microsoft BackOffice consists of the following products:</P>
<P><ul><li>    <B>Windows&nbsp;NT Server 3.5</B> is the network foundation of BackOffice. It provides the connectivity, reliability, base services, and administration tools necessary to deliver critical business information across a distributed network of computers. Windows&nbsp;NT Server supports nearly all desktop environments, as well as Novell&reg; NetWare&reg;, UNIX&reg;, LAN Manager, PATHWORKS&trade;, SNA-based systems, Banyan&reg; VINES&reg;, and Apple&reg; Macintosh&reg; networks. Increased performance, improved connectivity and management tools are the highlights of the most recent release. </P>
<P><li>    <B>Microsoft SQL Server 4.21a </B>relational database is the high-end database platform for <I>managing and storing data</I>. It supports transaction processing and decision support applications when high performance, reliability, and manageability are key requirements. Increased transaction throughput, direct support for PATHWORKS&trade; and AppleTalk&reg; networks using native protocols, and improved open database connectivity (ODBC) drivers are the highlights of the most recent release. </P>
<P><li>    <B>Microsoft SNA Server 2.1</B> offers host connectivity<I> </I>that connects Microsoft Windows&reg;, MS-DOS&reg;, Windows&nbsp;NT Workstation, Macintosh, and OS/2&reg; -based desktops with AS/400&reg; and IBM&reg; mainframes. It provides flexible access to applications and data on IBM mainframe and AS/400 systems. Improved performance, support of 10,000 sessions and 2000 clients, UNIX client support, and support of APPC and HLLAPI are highlights of the most recent release.</P>
<P><li>    <B>Microsoft Systems Management Server 1.0</B> manages PCs and servers, which helps reduce support costs by centralizing common network administrative tasks that typically cost organizations significant amounts of time and money. It has four primary functions: hardware and software inventory, automated software distribution and installation, remote systems troubleshooting and control, and network application management. </P>
<P><li>    <B>Microsoft Mail Server 3.2</B> distributes information, making it easy for end users to create, manage, and share information and provides a reliable messaging infrastructure with advanced tools for administrators. It is the easiest way to communicate with anyone, anywhere and is the foundation of a complete electronic messaging solution. Microsoft Mail will provide a direct upgrade path to Microsoft Exchange Server, the client-server messaging system scheduled to ship in 1995. </P></ul></BODY></HTML>
