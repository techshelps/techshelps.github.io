<H2>Summary</H2><p>The Windows&nbsp;NT Distributed Security Services Technology preview provides flexible solutions for building secure, scalable distributed applications. Security administration and management will have richer features for delegation and fine-grain account control. The next version of the Windows&nbsp;NT Directory Service will support domains with a much higher number of accounts in a structured naming environment of Organizational Units. Inter-domain trust management is simpler, providing greater flexibility to use domains in ways that reflect the needs of the Enterprise.</P>
<p>Windows&nbsp;NT security APIs for network authentication, data privacy, digital signatures, and encryption, supports secure application development for the Enterprise and the Internet. The SSPI and CryptoAPI interfaces, as well as higher-level COM and DCOM interface abstractions, make all of the integrated security features of Windows&nbsp;NT available for applications to use. The robust security architecture of Windows&nbsp;NT is used consistently across all system components and will be extended to support strong authentication and public-key security. These features are unmatched by any other distributed application platform available today.</P>
<p>Windows&nbsp;NT Distributed Security integrates mature Internet standards for authentication, while at the same time introducing new public-key security technology based on the direction of the industry and available standards. Many of the Internet public-key security standards are still forming. Microsoft is involved in the development of these standards but recognizes they are likely change over time. The Windows&nbsp;NT security architecture is specifically designed to incorporate new security technology, in the form of protocols, cryptographic service providers, or third-party authentication technology. Customers deploying Windows&nbsp;NT have choices about what security technology to use, how to integrate security into their application environment with minimum impact, and when to migrate to new technology as it becomes available.</P>
<p>The Windows&nbsp;NT Distributed Security Services Technology preview provides the foundation for secure Internet distributed computing.</P></BODY></HTML>
