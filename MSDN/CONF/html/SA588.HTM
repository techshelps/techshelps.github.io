<H2>Distributed File System:<BR> A Logical View of Physical Storage</H2><p>Microsoft&reg; Distributed File System (Dfs) for Windows&nbsp;NT&reg; Server is a network server component that makes it easier for you to find and manage data on your network. Dfs is a means for uniting files on different machines into a single name space. Dfs makes it easy to build a single, hierarchical view of multiple file servers and file server shares on your network.</P>
<p>The beta version of Microsoft Distributed File System (Dfs) is currently available for download from the Microsoft Web page at http://www.microsoft.com/ntserver. In addition, Microsoft has distributed a technology preview of its planned Directory Service enabled enhancements to Dfs. The technology preview of Dfs is a sub-set of the functionality planned for the next major version of Windows NT Server. The purpose of this paper is to cover the Dfs technology as a whole, including the version for Windows NT 4.0 operating system, which is currently in beta testing, and the Directory Services enabled technology preview. </P></BODY></HTML>
