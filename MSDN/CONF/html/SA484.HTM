<h3>DCOM and CORBA</H3><P>The Common Object Request Broker Architecture (CORBA) is a competing standard for distributed object computing. It defines an abstract object model that describes components and their interfaces. It also provides standard mappings from the abstract object definition to concrete programming languages, but it does not define a binary standard in any way.</P>
<P>Different ORB implementations that adhere to the standard can achieve, at the most, source level compatibility, but not interchangeability of binary components, one of the reasons that there is not, and probably will not be, a market for off-the-shelf reusable components. Component providers have to provide source code for their components or compile and test not only for each target platform, but for each target ORB implementation.</P>
<P>CORBA also defines a standard for inter-ORB communication that allows two compliant ORB implementations to invoke methods on objects on each other's machine.</P>
<P>ORB implementations like IBM's DSOM and Iona's Orbix commonly provide proprietary extensions to the object model, the language bindings, and the inter-ORB protocol. To take full advantage of a given platform, developers have to sacrifice cross-ORB interoperability and cross-ORB portability.</P>
<P>CORBA also defines a separate inter-ORB communication protocol called IIOP, which is targeted for use on the Internet. It accommodates the intersection of all inter-ORB protocols.</P>
<P>Please refer to [COM and CORBA] for more details.</P></BODY></HTML>
