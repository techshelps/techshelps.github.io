<H2>Creating an Easier to Manage DNS Environment</H2><p>DNS has historically been somewhat difficult to manage because it required the manual maintenance of text files containing the friendly name-to-address mapping for every computer in an organization. In the Windows&nbsp;NT Server operating system version 4.0, Microsoft introduced a DNS Server with built-in Windows Internet Naming Service (WINS) Integration. The DNS Server in Windows&nbsp;NT includes a graphical administration tool, designed to make editing DNS files less cumbersome. To eliminate manual assignment of addresses, the DNS Server in Windows&nbsp;NT is tightly integrated with WINS, a Windows&nbsp;NT service that dynamically updates the friendly name-to-address mapping file. In a Windows&nbsp;NT Server-based network, client computers are automatically assigned TCP/IP addresses at startup using the Distributed Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP). The clients then register their names and addresses in WINS. This is shown in Figure 3. The DNS Server in Windows&nbsp;NT uses WINS to resolve unrecognized names in the organization it serves. </P>

<p>Microsoft's solution for dynamically updating DNS tables, by integrating DNS and WINS, is a short-term solution. Currently, the Internet standards for DNS are being updated to support <I>Dynamic DNS</I>. Dynamic DNS will eliminate the need for WINS because it will allow clients with dynamically assigned addresses to register directly with the DNS server and update the DNS table dynamically. Servers running next generation Windows&nbsp;NT Directory Services will use Dynamic DNS to publish themselves in DNS. <B>By deploying Wi</B><B>n</B><B>dows&nbsp;NT 4.0, DNS, and WINS today, users lay the foundation for next generation Windows&nbsp;NT Directory Services and Dynamic DNS. </B></P></BODY></HTML>
