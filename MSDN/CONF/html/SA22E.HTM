Bob has spent the last six years creating hypertext and multimedia systems and tools for Microsoft and other local and national companies. His main areas of concern are information design, interface design, and custom authoring tool development.

<H2>Abstract</H2><p>This paper describes the authoring system we created for the Microsoft&reg; Visual Basic&reg;/Microsoft Access Multimedia application that is used on the Tech Ed 1995 CD-ROM. Focusing on the database, the paper presents some of the key problems and illustrates the solutions we developed for efficiently and effectively authoring and adding information to the Database.</P>
<p>The paper focuses mainly on the process we created to process content and fill our application database. I will talk briefly about the methods we used to process images and AVI files for inclusion on the CD-ROM.</P></BODY></HTML>
