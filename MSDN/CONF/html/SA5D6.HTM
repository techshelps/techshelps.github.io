<h3>Benefiting Resellers</H3><p>TAPI provides a great opportunity for resellers. The traditional telephony equipment resellers, who are selling PBXs and key systems, should see this as an opportunity to capitalize on their expertise, by applying it to the new world of client/server telephony. They can then profit from the substantial new business that can be found in selling client/server telephony solutions. Computer resellers, and those providing LAN networking solutions, will find that computer telephony enabled by the Windows telephony platform provides a natural extension of their existing businesses.</P>
<p>An additional benefit to knowledgeable resellers is that providing computer telephony integration (CTI) solutions, is a robust market, where opportunities abound for resellers to bring value-added solutions to their customers. There is a large opportunity for resellers who can combine expertise in the field of desktop and server computing with a solid knowledge of traditional telephony. There are also opportunities for businesses with computer expertise to join with those having telecom expertise to create new products and services.</P></BODY></HTML>
