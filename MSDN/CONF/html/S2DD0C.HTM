<H2>What is MMC?</H2>
<p>The MMC console is a Windows-based multiple document interface (MDI) application that heavily leverages Internet technologies. Both Microsoft and ISVs extend the console by writing MMC Snap-Ins,<I> </I>which<I> </I>are responsible for actually performing management tasks.</P>
<p>The MMC programmatic interfaces integratepermit the Snap-Ins to integrate with the console. These interfaces deal only with user interface extensions<SPAN CLASS="Symbol">¾</SPAN> how each Snap-In actually performs tasks is entirely up to the Snap-In. The Snap-In's relationship with the console is in sharing a common hosting environment, and in cross-application integration. The console itself offers no management behavior. </P>
<p>Both Microsoft and ISVs can develop management tools to run in MMC, and both Microsoft and ISVs can write applications to be managed by MMC administrative tools. Once the pre-release phase is complete, MMC will be part of the Windows Software Developers Kit (SDK) and available for general use. </P></BODY></HTML>
