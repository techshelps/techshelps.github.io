<H2>Easy Migration from Windows NT 3.5<I>x</I> and 4.0</H2><p>To provide smooth and trouble-free migration, next Generation Windows&nbsp;NT Directory Services were designed to operate in a mixed environment. A mixed domain, with both next generation and "down-level" Windows&nbsp;NT 3.5x and 4.0 domain controllers, works and acts just like a Windows&nbsp;NT 4.0 domain. A tree cannot be formed with a mixed domain, because the down-level domain controllers don't understand trees or Kerberos authentication. </P>
<p>The migration process from down-level servers to next Generation Windows&nbsp;NT Directory Services can take place one domain controller at a time, and when all of the domain controllers in the Windows&nbsp;NT 4.<I>x</I> domain have been upgraded, it can be switched to a next generation domain. <B>Therefore, the best way to prepare for next Generation Windows&nbsp;NT Directory Services is to install Windows&nbsp;NT 4.0 today. </B>To see how this would work, see the following section.</P></BODY></HTML>
