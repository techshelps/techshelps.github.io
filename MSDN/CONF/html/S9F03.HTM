<H2>Introduction</H2><p>Microsoft&reg; Windows&nbsp;NT&reg; network operating system has excellent security features for the Enterprise. A single sign-on to the Windows NT domain allows user access to resources anywhere in the corporate network. Easy-to-use administrator tools for security policy and account management reduce the cost of deploying Windows&nbsp;NT. The Windows&nbsp;NT Domain model is flexible so it can support a wide range of network configurations from a Single Domain at one location to Multimaster Domains spanning the globe.</P>
<p>Windows&nbsp;NT also provides a foundation for integrated security for BackOffice&trade; application services, including Microsoft Exchange, SQL Server&trade;, SNA Server, and Systems Management Server. The Windows&nbsp;NT security model provides a solid framework for deploying client/server applications for the Enterprise. Today, the Enterprise is opening up to the Internet. Businesses need to interact with partners, suppliers, and customers using Internet-based technologies. Security is essential for controlling access to resources in the Enterprise network, the intranet, and Internet-based servers.</P>
<p>intranets are quickly becoming the most effective way to share information for many different business relationships. Today, access to nonpublic business information by outside parties is controlled by creating user accounts for those who are part of the extended business "family." Business relationships help to define the trust that once applied to employees who used corporate assets but now includes many more people.</P>
<p>Security technologies are also changing rapidly. Public-key certificates and dynamic passwords are two technology areas that are growing rapidly as ways to meet higher-level security needs in today's environment. Remote access over public networks and Internet access for interbusiness communication are driving the evolution of security technology. The Windows&nbsp;NT security architecture is uniquely positioned to take advantage of these and other technology advances. Windows&nbsp;NT combines the ease-of-use for the user, excellent administration tools, and solid security infrastructure that supports both the Enterprise and the Internet.</P></BODY></HTML>
