<h3>Control Wizards</H3><p>Setting the many properties needed to get the desired behavior from controls requires a great deal of practice and patience; the Control Wizards can take on some of this burden.</P>
<p>For example, creating combo boxes, list boxes, and option groups requires setting many different properties. The properties are easily confused or overlooked, causing your controls to work incorrectly. When you add a control in Microsoft&nbsp;Access 2.0, a Control Wizard asks you questions about the control you want, then sets all these properties for you. The Option Group wizard even creates all the button controls in the group automatically.</P>
<p>You can always change control properties later in the property sheet if necessary. Additionally, if you don't want to use a Control Wizard, you can disable the feature by deselecting the button in the lower-left corner of the toolbox.</P>
<p>Perhaps the most useful application building tool is the Command Button Wizard. When you add a button to a form, the wizard gives you over 30 common actions that you can choose for the button to perform. The wizard gives the button a picture or text, and automatically sets up the code necessary to perform the action.</P></BODY></HTML>
