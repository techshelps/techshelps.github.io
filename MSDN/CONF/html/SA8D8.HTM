<h3>Disk Striping</H3><p>Disk Striping (Raid 0) is exactly like disk striping without the parity stripe. Because the parity stripe is not present, the set is not fault tolerant. Once a stripe has been lost, there is no way to recover it. Some disk drivers do provide in-drive, hot-fix capabilities that can help ensure the safety of the data. Disk striping can, however, increase both read and write performance, because multiple I/O commands can be active on the drives at the same time. A striped set must have between two and 32 disks. If the disks are different sizes, the smallest is used as the common partition size. The remaining free space may be used individually or in a volume set. Creation of a striped set is done via the Disk Administrator utility. Select the disks for the set and select the Create Stripe Set option under the Partition menu.</P>
<p>Volume and striped sets are not fault tolerant. Once an error is detected, the set is not recoverable. If the problem is detected during system initialization, a severe error is logged to the event log and the volume set or striped set is not available for use by the system.</P>
