<H2>TAPI 2.0</H2><p>The Microsoft&reg; Windows&reg; Telephony API (TAPI) 2.0, which ships as part of Microsoft Windows&nbsp;NT&reg; Server version 4.0 and Windows&nbsp;NT Workstation version 4.0 operating system, provides the most powerful and flexible platform for developing and using computer telephony applications. TAPI 2.0 abstracts the hardware layer, providing developers and users with the freedom of network and device independence. It is the only platform that enables applications for use on PSTN, ISDN, PBX, and IP networks.</P>
<p>Part of the Windows Open Systems Architecture (WOSA), TAPI 2.0 is supported by a full range of complementary APIs to enable a broad range of powerful and easy-to-use telephony and communications applications for a wide range of customers. In addition, new Microsoft ActiveX&trade; Controls further simplify and accelerate the process of development for a broader range of developers, enabling more customized telephony and related communications solutions. </P>
<p>Because TAPI 2.0 is built into Windows, it has a lower cost of deployment and ownership, and developers can create applications knowing that the large installed base of Windows&nbsp;95 and Windows&nbsp;NT operating systems are already equipped to support their telephony applications. All of this makes Windows an excellent telephony and network communications platform for the future.</P></BODY></HTML>
