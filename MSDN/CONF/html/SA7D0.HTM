<h3>Prevent "Microsoft&nbsp;Access Abuse" Now</H3><p>Organizations often build their first GUI-based applications on file sharing-based DBMSs like Microsoft&nbsp;Access database management system. These applications are not subject to the same requirements or planning as mainframe applications because they are labeled as "departmental," which really doesn't mean "has only a few users" as much as it means "it's PC-based, we can play it by ear."</P>
<p>The user base of these applications quickly skyrockets, and the corresponding maintenance and administrative tasks grow accordingly. The application becomes widely successful and is subject to numerous kludgy enhancements. Yearly maintenance costs are outrageous, often requiring a full-time resource or more. The cost of redeployment on a server-based DBMS is high as well, because the original development team never considered that the application would eventually need to be upsized. Everyone becomes afraid to kill "the beast".</P>
<p>Hopefully, this presentation will show that a little more effort can not only lay a solid foundation for future systems development, but will also be excellent opportunity to become familiar with client-server technology.</P></BODY></HTML>
