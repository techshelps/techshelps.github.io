<h3>PROCEDURE &lt;methodproc&gt; (param1, param2 ....)/ENDPROC</H3><p>This line of code defines a procedure method (a method that is a procedure as opposed to one that is a function). &lt;Methodproc&gt; refers to the name of the method. Parameters are accepted by enclosing the parameter variables in parens as shown above.</P>
<p>A few words of note are in order here.</P>
<p>There is no practical difference between creating a procedure method and a procedure we used to create in Microsoft FoxPro 2.x. The rules regarding memory variable scoping, coding constructs, and so forth, are virtually identical. A significant difference in scoping is the addition of the LOCAL scope, which scopes variables to the current procedure only.</P>
<p>Methods can be protected like member variables (i.e., they can only be called from other methods in the class) by adding the keyword PROTECTED before PROCEDURE (i.e. PROTECTED PROCEDURE &lt;methodproc&gt;).</P>
<p>Parameters can be accepted with the old PARAMETERS command. The syntax shown here is preferred from an OOP standpoint because it assigns a LOCAL scope to the variables. Note that there is a new LPARAMETERS command that not only accepts the parameters but also assigns them a LOCAL scope.</P>
<p>Procedure methods are closed with the ENDPROC command.</P></BODY></HTML>
