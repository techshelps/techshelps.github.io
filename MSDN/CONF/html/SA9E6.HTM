<h3>Members: Empty</H3><p>The Empty check box is used to filter empty members from the members list. The default Empty mode is off. The Empty on/off mode does not affect the instance list. An example of an Empty member might be the Click event method for a subclass of the Form class when no code is associated with the Click event.</P>
<p>If Empty members is off, only defined members are included and any blank members are not included in the member list for the selected class.</P>
<p>If Empty members is on, both non-blank members and blank members are included in the member list for the selected class.</P></BODY></HTML>
