<h3>Using Microsoft Fax</H3><p>Windows&nbsp;95, in conjunction with Microsoft Exchange, provides PC users with the ability to send and receive faxes directly from their desktop. This capability, called Microsoft Fax, sets the standard for desktop fax as an easy-to-use messaging facility that is well integrated with Windows.</P>
<p>Microsoft Fax in Windows&nbsp;95 provides the following key features:</P>
<P>     Fax high-resolution printed documents from within your favorite Windows-based applications using a fax printer driver.</P>
<P>     Microsoft At Work&trade; Binary File Transfer (BFT) capability sends original documents to users of Windows&nbsp;95, Windows for Workgroups 3.11, and other Microsoft At Work–enabled platforms as e-mail attachments via fax.</P>
<P>     Secure exchange of confidential documents using encryption and digital signatures.</P>
<P>     High-speed communications with popular Class 1 fax modems, and the millions of traditional Group 3 fax machines worldwide.</P>
<P>     Networked users of Windows&nbsp;95 can send and receive faxes through a shared fax modem on one of the Windows&nbsp;95 workstations on the network.</P>
<P>     A fax viewer that allows you to browse multipage faxes using either 'thumbnails' or full-page view mode.</P>
<P>     A cover page designer that lets you easily create new fax cover pages that incorporate graphics and text, or customize one of the predefined cover pages that are included with Microsoft Fax.</P>
<P>     Connect easily to fax-on-demand systems using a built-in 'poll retrieve' feature that allows you to download faxes directly to your desktop.</P>
<p>Microsoft At Work fax is integrated into Windows&nbsp;95 as a MAPI transport service, leveraging Microsoft Exchange's "universal inbox," rich message creation, and browsing capabilities to deliver ease of use and consistency to the management of fax messages. The fax provider coexists with other information or messaging services that the user may have installed, and leverages Microsoft Exchange's common address book and inbox.</P>
