<H2>The Real Business</H2><p>Let's look at something a bit more meaningful. This application is something I created as a part of my ham radio hobby. I initially wanted to decode slow-scan TV pictures, but I ended up creating a modular signal processing facility. This wasn't easy. I found that the MFC architecture wasn't really designed for this sort of application, and consequently, I had to do a fair bit of work to get it to look the way I wanted it. Having done that, a lot of the rest of the work was just plain fun. Creating new modules was easy and exciting to do! Once a few modules had been written, I got very excited about all sorts of things my new system could do. A bazillion words can't explain what a simple demo can, so let's look at what it does.</P></BODY></HTML>
