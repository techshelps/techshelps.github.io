<h3>Objects</H3><p>There are many different types of objects that can be stored within your directory. Some common ones are the User, Group, Workstations, Printers, etc. You can also put references to an application's object or component. You can use the directory to located distributed applications across your infrastructure. Most of the objects you are accustomed to have been expanded to allow the directory to hold more useful information. You can also expand the properties to suit your own specific needs. For example, you might also want to place an employees "Signing Limit" for Purchase Orders with your user's object. This would allow a purchasing workflow application to easily determine if further approvals are needed.</P></BODY></HTML>
