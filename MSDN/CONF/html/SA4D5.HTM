<h3>Why is Active Directory Important?</H3><p>One of the challenges of working within a large, distributed computing environment is identifying and locating resources such as users, groups, print queues, and documents. A directory service is part of a distributed computing environment that provides a way to locate and identify the users and resources available in the system. The directory service is like a phone directory. Given a name for a person or a resource, it provides the information necessary to access that person or resource. You do not have to use specific binding information to access a resource on the network.</P>
<p>Most enterprises already have many different directories in place. For example, network operating systems, electronic mail systems, and "groupware" products all have their own directories. Many issues arise when a single enterprise deploys multiple directories. These issues include usability, data consistency, development cost, and support cost, among others.</P>
<p>Active Directory<B> </B>addresses these issues by providing a single, consistent, open set of interfaces for managing and using multiple directories.</P></BODY></HTML>
