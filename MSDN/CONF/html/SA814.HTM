<h3>UNIX Integration</H3><p>TCP/IP, a de facto standard for UNIX networking, is included in Windows&nbsp;NT Server to help you create heterogeneous networks. Configuring of Windows&nbsp;NT Server for TCP/IP after installation allows you to set the IP address, subnet mask and broadcast parameters with DHCP/WINS graphical interface. Windows&nbsp;NT includes the most common TCP/IP utility: File Transfer Protocol (ftp and tftp). This familiar UNIX utility provides easy file transfer between Windows&nbsp;NT and UNIX hosts. With Windows&nbsp;NT, you can set up an anonymous ftp server as well as connecting to UNIX-based hosts. For terminal access to a UNIX host, the familiar Windows Terminal "applet" has been upgraded to provide Telnet capability. Through a DCE-compatible remote procedure call (RPC) mechanism, Windows Sockets and built-in TCP/IP support, client can be connected to any version of UNIX. </P>
<p>Users get network connectivity between Windows family and UNIX systems through technologies and products like Network File System (NFS), LAN Manager for UNIX (LMU), TCP/IP, and the X Window System&trade; protocol. Microsoft has made the Windows application program interfaces (APIs) available to developers on UNIX systems through the Windows Interface Source Environment (WISE) licensing program. With WISE products, users will be able to run shrink-wrapped Windows applications on UNIX systems. Microsoft's object technology, OLE, will also become available on UNIX systems through WISE. Users and developers get cross-platform database services between Windows family and UNIX systems through Open Database Connectivity (ODBC) and Open Data Services. Users can send and receive email between the Windows family and UNIX systems using products like Microsoft Mail and Microsoft Exchange Server. System managers can manage heterogeneous systems using Microsoft Systems Management Server and third party Windows family based Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) management software such as OpenView and NetView&reg;.</P></BODY></HTML>
