<h3>Providing Economic Benefits</H3><p>Microsoft Virtual Private Networking (VPN) will be integrated into the Windows NT 4.0 operating system, providing the tunneling solution for remote access at no extra cost. Microsoft also plans to provide PPTP support for Windows 95 by the end of the year. </P>
<p>Significant cost-savings can be achieved by using Microsoft VPN to turn the vast reach of the Internet into your own virtual private network. In addition to saving the costs of leased lines and long distance dialing, businesses can escape the cost of purchasing and managing redundant banks of modems, and specialized software. VPN allows the same equipment used for Internet access to be used for providing remote access.</P>
<p>The transition for remote users is as simple as a few clicks of the mouse, as VPN is smoothly integrated into the same Windows dialup commands they may already be using.</P>
<p>All of this makes Microsoft's multiprotocol VPN the easiest way for businesses to securely and economically extend their private networks across the Internet to remote users. </P></BODY></HTML>
