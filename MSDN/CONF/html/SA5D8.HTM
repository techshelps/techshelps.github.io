<h3>Benefiting Call Center Managers</H3><p>Call center managers benefit in much the same way as IS and telecom managers&mdash;with more competition and lower costs. The purpose of a call center is to provide rapid, high-quality customer service, and good tools let managers stay right on top of events, determine the nature of calls, and monitor agent availability. Historically, call center applications were only available from a limited number of vendors, and required mainframe or minicomputer class hardware support. They were also difficult to customize as the needs of the business changed, such as for short term promotions. Part of the advantage of client/server technology is that it enables the power, simplicity, and choice associated with of networked computing to be exploited. Thanks to applications such as Microsoft SNA Server, a move to client/server computing allows a company to continue to get value from its legacy mainframe and mini computers.</P></BODY></HTML>
