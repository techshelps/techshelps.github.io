<H2>Introduction</H2><p>Many customers and ISVs are unsure of just how to exploit the frontier of the World Wide Web and the Internet<FONT FACE="Symbol">¾</FONT>whether to customize out-of-box server applications or start from scratch with custom implementations of everything above the Internet Protocol level. What language should be used<FONT FACE="Symbol">¾</FONT>Visual Basic<FONT FACE="Symbol">Ò</FONT>, C, C++, or Java<FONT FACE="Symbol">Ô</FONT>. And what about the new scripting mechanisms? What about this ActiveX<FONT FACE="Symbol">Ô</FONT> Template Library? Where do COM and DCOM fit into this? And, most important, from the customer's point of view, what happens to the existing stable applications, both client/server and stand-alone that users are comfortable with? How can they take advantage of the improved functionality and efficiency of browser technology, without losing everything they have invested in desktop applications? </P>
<p>This paper describes a number of ways in which you can exploit the power of Internet and browser technology  to give classic applications greater functionality and ease of use by placing them on a company intranet, or by making information available over the Internet to everyone. The choices described range from the simplest way to publish documents on the Web, to transforming a standard desktop application into a dynamically created, interactive application that takes advantage of a tremendous array of new technologies and techniques. Finally, we offer a recommended series of breakout sessions that will give you the information you need to tailor your applications for the Web.</P></BODY></HTML>
