<h3>Decisions, Decisions...</H3><p>There are many articles and seminars on the evolving theory of building solid client-server architectures. MIS managers and application developers, though, are often left with the overwhelming responsibility of choosing from a myriad of alternatives&mdash;planning a client-server application architecture involves many more choices than a traditional mainframe centralized processing environment. These choices need to work together properly, coexist with legacy systems, and provide needed functionality now and in the future.</P>
<p>This session will take a more practical than theoretical approach by demonstrating a complete and robust client-server decision support application architecture that incorporates products like Microsoft&reg; Visual Basic&reg; programming system, Microsoft SQL Server&trade; client-server database management system, Microsoft Windows&nbsp;NT&trade; operating system, and Microsoft Office Suite. It will leave the listener with a recommended, proven starting point that can be adapted to other environments.</P>
<p>It will cover business versus presentation logic, data warehousing, security, transaction processing, stored procedures, performance tuning, and database layout. It will provide reusable code and a sample application as well.</P></BODY></HTML>
