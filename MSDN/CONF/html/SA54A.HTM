<H2>Moving Beyond the Traditional Directory</H2><p>Traditionally, directory services have been a tool for organizing, managing, and locating "interesting" objects in a computing system. "Interesting" objects are things users (and applications) need to do their jobs, such as printers, documents, e-mail addresses, databases, users, distributed components, and other resources.</P>
<p>In its simplest form, directory services are like the white pages of a telephone book: Using specific input (a person's name), a user can receive specific output (a person's address and telephone number). Directory services also provides the functionality of the yellow pages: Using general input (that is, where are the printers?), a user can receive a browsable listing of printer resources.</P>
<p>But directory services must do more as networked environments become larger and more complex&mdash;even before connecting to the global environment of the Internet. The next generation Windows&nbsp;NT Directory Services were created for this next generation challenge of unifying and bringing order to diverse name spaces. </P></BODY></HTML>
