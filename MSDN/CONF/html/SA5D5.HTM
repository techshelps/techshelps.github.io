<h3>Benefiting Hardware Manufacturers</H3><p>Telephony network, switch, and hardware manufacturers benefit because there are more applications which can run with their products. They can focus on the area of their expertise&mdash;hardware, switching, network integrate&mdash;without needing to come up to speed on programming of user interfaces, database access, or other high-level tasks. A related benefit is that the open platform of TAPI 2.0 and Windows&nbsp;NT will mean that a full-range of broad- and vertical-market applications will emerge from third parties, greatly expanding the market for telephony hardware for PC platforms and PCs with integrated telephony capabilities&mdash;which means switch vendors will sell more hardware.</P></BODY></HTML>
