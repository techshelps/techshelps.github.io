<h3>Purpose and Use of Binding Options</H3><P><img src="40670.gif"></P>
<p>The Windows&nbsp;NT network architecture consists of a series of layers. The components in each layer provide specific functions to the layers above and below it. The bottom of the network architecture ends at the network adapter card, which moves information between computers. </P>
<p>Binding is the linking of network components on different levels to enable communication between those components. You can bind a network component to one or more network components above or below it. The services each component provides can be shared by all other components bound to it.</P>
<p>When adding network software, Windows&nbsp;NT automatically binds all dependent components accordingly.</P>
<H4> </A>Configuring Network Bindings</H4><p>To configure the bindings, choose the Bindings button in the Networks option. The Network Bindings dialog box shows the bindings of the installed network components as a series of "bound paths," from the upper layer services and protocols to the lowest layer of network adapter drivers.</P>
<p>Bindings can be enabled and disabled, based on your use of the network components installed on your system.</P>
<p>Bindings can also be ordered to optimize the systems use of the network. For example, if a system has NetBEUI and TCP/IP installed on it and the majority of servers that are connected to it are only running TCP/IP, the Workstation bindings should be examined. In looking at the Workstation bindings, the administrator of this system would want to make sure that the Workstation bound to TCP/IP is the first binding listed, with the Workstation bound to NetBEUI at the bottom. This way, when a user attempts to connect to a server, Workstation will first try using TCP/IP to establish the connection.</P></BODY></HTML>
