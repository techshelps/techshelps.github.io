<h3>Using NWLink to communicate with NetWare</H3><p>NWLink is an IPX/SPX-compatible transport protocol for Windows&nbsp;NT. It can be used to establish connections between Windows&nbsp;NT computers and either MS-DOS, OS/2, Windows, or other Windows&nbsp;NT computers via RPC, Sockets (either Windows Sockets or NetWare&reg; sockets), or Novell&reg; NetBIOS. It does not, however, allow a Windows&nbsp;NT computer to connect to a Novell NetWare server or to act as a server to a Novell NetWare client. To connect to a Novell NetWare server, you need to purchase Novell's NetWare Client for Windows&nbsp;NT or you need the Client Services for NetWare.</P>
<p>NWLink is useful if you have NetWare client applications that use the IPX/SPX API or if you have applications which use NetBIOS or Novell NetBIOS. NWLink can also serve as the protocol used by the default redirector and server for Windows&nbsp;NT and Windows&nbsp;NT Server.</P>
<H4> </A>NetBIOS and Windows Sockets</H4><p>User-mode applications can use RPC, NetBIOS APIs, or Windows Sockets APIs to access the network through NWLink or other IPX/SPX protocol drivers. Both NetBIOS and Windows Sockets are supported in the Windows 32-bit, Windows 16-bit, and MS-DOS environments. Programs that run in the OS/2 environment can use NetBIOS but not Windows Sockets APIs. All subsystems and VDMs can use logical drives that are established by the redirector via NWLink.</P>
<H4> </A>Client Services for NetWare (CSNW)</H4><p>Microsoft's Client Services for NetWare allows Microsoft Windows&nbsp;NT workstations to access files, directories, and printers on Novell NetWare servers.</P>
<p>Because CSNW uses the IPX protocol, NWLink transport must be installed before you install CSNW.</P>
<H4> </A>Gateway Services for NetWare (GSNW)</H4><p>GSNW is a 32-bit Windows&nbsp;NT service equivalent to the NetWare requestor. It allows Windows&nbsp;NT servers to access files, directories, and printers on Novell NetWare servers, and also to transparently pass those resources on to clients on the Windows Network.</P>
<p>GSNW allows users to connect to what appear to be NT Server resources, but which in reality are resources that exist on a NetWare server connected with the Windows&nbsp;NT network. This capability allows Windows&nbsp;NT Server to act as a nondedicated gateway to NetWare file systems for any SMB (Server Message Block) client (including Windows for Workgroups, Windows&nbsp;NT, and MS-DOS clients under LAN Manager).</P></BODY></HTML>
