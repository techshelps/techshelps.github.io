<H2>UNC Names</H2><p>The next generation Windows&nbsp;NT Directory Services support the Universal Naming Convention used in Windows&nbsp;NT Server-based networks to refer to shared volumes, printers, and files. A user can refer to a shared file published in next generation Windows&nbsp;NT Directory Services by a UNC name, for example:</P>
<P CLASS="spacing"><BR></P>
<pre><FONT FACE="Courier New" SIZE="3">\\Myco.Com\division.product.Sys.SomeVolume\XLSheets\Budget.XLS</font></pre>
<P>Using Open Standards for Cross-Platform Directory Services</P>
<p>The next generation Windows&nbsp;NT Directory Services have APIs integrated into their code to allow communication with other directories. As noted earlier in this document, next generation Windows&nbsp;NT Directory can exchange information with any application or directory equipped with LDAP or other key X.500 protocols including DAP, DSP, and DISP. </P>
<p>The next generation Windows&nbsp;NT Directory Services provide the interoperability network administrators need to more efficiently manage their resources during the migration to the ideal next generation system. The ability of next generation Windows&nbsp;NT Directory Services to subsume and manage other directories, provides a unification that can greatly reduce the number of directories and name spaces with which network administrators&mdash;and users&mdash;must contend. </P>
<P>Combining the Best of DNS and X.500</P>
<p>The next generation Windows&nbsp;NT Directory Services combine the best of DNS as a locator service with the best of X.500 while avoiding the failings of both while advancing Internet standards. The details of this implementation will be discussed in the following section.</P></BODY></HTML>
