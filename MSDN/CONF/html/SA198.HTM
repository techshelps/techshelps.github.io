<h3>Netware Integration</H3><p>The Services for NetWare outlined below provide seamless integration between Novell NetWare and Windows NT environments.</P>
<H4> </A>Client Service for NetWare</H4><P><img src="40387.gif"></P>
<P>Connects Windows&nbsp;NT Server to NetWare servers</P>
<p>The Client Service for NetWare in Windows&nbsp;NT Workstation allows Windows&nbsp;NT Workstation-based computers to connect to files and printers on the NetWare servers. Windows&nbsp;NT Workstation-based computers can store and print information on NetWare servers, and have access to many of the most commonly used NetWare-aware applications such as NetWare SAA&trade; and Lotus Notes&reg;. Users who have supervisor rights will also be able to run the administrative utilities commonly used in managing NetWare servers, such as SysCon and PConsole.</P>
<p>The Client Service for NetWare integrates the Windows&nbsp;NT and NetWare environments. It can be configured so that a single logon can provide access to a computer running the Windows&nbsp;NT Workstation, NetWare file and print servers, or Windows&nbsp;NT Server operating systems.</P>
<H4> </A>Gateway Service for NetWare</H4><P><img src="40388.gif"></P>
<p>The Gateway Service for NetWare provides local and remote users who are connected to Windows&nbsp;NT Server access to the files and printers on NetWare servers. It is an ideal integration tool for companies who have systems which run on both NetWare and Windows&nbsp;NT in a heterogeneous server environment. The network administrator controls who and how many people have access to the gateway so only those with permission can use file and print resources on designated NetWare servers. </P>
<H5 CLASS="h4"> </A>Clients connected to Windows&nbsp;NT Server can access files and printers on the NetWare server</H5><p>Customers use the Gateway Service for NetWare to isolate IPX/SPX traffic and ease the transition to TCP/IP as well as run Microsoft Remote Access Service. Users with Microsoft Windows For Workgroups, MS-DOS, or the Windows&nbsp;NT platform can use Remote Access Service and still maintain connectivity to a NetWare server.</P>
<p>The Gateway Service for NetWare is installed as a service on the Windows&nbsp;NT Server. It is available to authorized users as long as the system is running and requires no special intervention once it is configured. </P>
<H4> </A>NWLink: The SPX/IPX compatible transport for Windows&nbsp;NT</H4><P><img src="40389.gif"></P>
<p>NetWare clients can access server applications such as Microsoft SQL Server, SNA Server and others running on Windows&nbsp;NT Server without changing their client software by using NWLink, the IPX/SPX compatible transport which comes standard with Windows&nbsp;NT.</P>
<H5 CLASS="h4"> </A>Add Windows&nbsp;NT Server as an application with no change to NetWare Clients or network</H5><p>Windows&nbsp;NT Server will automatically check the network during installation to see which transport is currently running on the network. If it finds SPX/IPX, the server will automatically default to the NWLink (IPX/SPX) transport.</P>
<H4> </A>Migration Tool for NetWare</H4><p>The Migration Tool for NetWare in Windows&nbsp;NT Server aids network administrators by copying user accounts and files from NetWare 2.x and 3.x servers to a Windows&nbsp;NT Server-based computer while maintaining security. It has the capabilities of both an integration and migration tool.</P>
<P><img src="40390.gif"></P>
<P>Provides an easy way to migrate Windows&nbsp;NT Servers<BR> to achieve a single network logon</P>
<p>In a migration environment, the Migration Tool for NetWare allows the administrator great flexibility in transferring user accounts and data to the Windows NT platform. Users can migrate a single NetWare server to a single Windows&nbsp;NT Server, multiple NetWare servers to a single Windows&nbsp;NT Server, or many other configurations allowing for the redistribution of information across the servers in your network. Since there are some security differences between NetWare and Windows&nbsp;NT Server, the Migration Tool includes a trial migration process that generates detailed log files. These files eliminate the guesswork and assist the administrator in keeping track of any changes that may occur during the migration process.</P>
<p>The Migration Tool for NetWare simply copies the users, groups, files, and directories to the Windows&nbsp;NT Server without affecting the NetWare server. Server applications such as SQL Server, SNA Server and Exchange Server share the same user account database as Windows&nbsp;NT Server. Therefore, you can use the migration tool to automatically copy user accounts from the NetWare server and mirror those NetWare accounts on the Windows&nbsp;NT Server, saving the administrator valuable time with the initial server setup. </P>
<H4> </A>Microsoft File and Print Service for Netware</H4><p>Sold separately from Windows&nbsp;NT Server, Microsoft File and Print Service for NetWare makes it easy to bring Windows&nbsp;NT Server functionality into a NetWare network. File and Print Service for NetWare makes a Windows&nbsp;NT Server machine a fully NetWare 3.x compatible file and print server. This means that Windows&nbsp;NT Server can supply both the file and print services customers use today plus the advanced application, communication, and management services Windows&nbsp;NT Server is known for <FONT FACE="Symbol">-</FONT> all without modifying the existing NetWare network, client software or user login scripts. </P>
<p>In addition, NetWare administrators will be able to manage Windows&nbsp;NT Server easily. Windows&nbsp;NT Server already integrates seamlessly with SNMP-based management solutions such as Novell's NetWare Management System. In addition, third-party tools, such as McAfee's NetTools, are available today for Windows&nbsp;NT Server. Frye Utilities for Networks (including StatRack), Saber's Enterprise Application Manager (and other tools), and Symantec&reg;'s Norton AntiVirus are also being ported to Windows&nbsp;NT Server. </P>
<p>In Windows&nbsp;NT Server 3.5, Microsoft included the Migration Tool for NetWare. The Migration Tool for NetWare automatically migrates NetWare user and group accounts, files and directories, and security and permissions to Windows&nbsp;NT Server. With the release of File and Print Service for NetWare, Microsoft has enhanced its Migration Tool for NetWare to migrate NetWare user login scripts. By automatically migrating these components, Migration Tool for NetWare saves administrators the time and effort of recreating user accounts, files, directories, permissions, and login scripts thereby making the transition to Windows&nbsp;NT Server extremely easy.</P></BODY></HTML>
