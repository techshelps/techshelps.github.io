<H2>Conclusion</H2><p>The benefits of using MAPI are the ability to take applications where applications have never gone before. Users may obtain data from anywhere, using whatever e-mail system is available. The remote application will perform better, and there may be some improvement with the host database.</P>
<p>The challenge in implementing MAPI is the ability to resolve the issues and design for the environment. A successful design will be highly structured and may have several layers to simplify the design.</P>
<p>The design presented here was written in Visual Basic. The same design may be implemented with other products using DLLs and Visual Basic for Applications (VBA).</P></BODY></HTML>
