<h3>Architecture Overview</H3><p>The Visual Basic application uses a multiple document interface (MDI) container. After logging the user on to the DBMS, the application displays only one child form, called the "SnapShot Manager." </P>
<p>This form allows the user to select a particular chunk of data to retrieve from the server into a new child form, called a "SnapShot." The SnapShot Manager should allow the user to filter and select a level of detail on concepts such as customer, product, location, time, sales rep, etc. The form enables and disables functionality based on server security settings.</P>
<p>Once the user has made a selection and directed the application to take a snapshot, the SnapShot Manger form loads a new child SnapShot form and passes the user's selection. </P>
<p>The newly created SnapShot form runs a stored procedure via ODBC against SQL Server to retrieve a result set that corresponds to the user's selection. It creates an instance of a Microsoft Excel workbook, and loads the result set into a pivot table in the workbook. Each SnapShot form has its own workbook "linked" to it.</P>
<p>The SnapShot form then allows the user to view the multidimensional result set, abstracting the complexities of the pivot table from the user but leveraging its computational power.</P>
