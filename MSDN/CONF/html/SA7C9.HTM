<H2>Microsoft BackOffice Tuning</H2><p>Having designed an optimal Microsoft BackOffice solution architecture based on the knowledge of the performance characteristics of each Microsoft BackOffice component, you are now ready to tune the system to an even finer detail. The tuning process at this stage is now an exercise in what may be referred to as "traditional" Windows&nbsp;NT performance tuning. Therefore, it is beyond the scope of this paper to adequately address this process in detail. However, there is an excellent text by Russ Blake, <I>Optimizing Windows&nbsp;NT,</I> Microsoft Windows&nbsp;NT Resource Kit, Volume 3, which discusses in great detail how to further optimize your Windows&nbsp;NT environment. Furthermore, you may refer to another excellent tuning source, Tech Ed 95 seminar NT301, presented by Scott Suhy, which presents critical aspects of the Windows&nbsp;NT tuning process.</P></BODY></HTML>
