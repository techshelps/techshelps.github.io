<h3>Configuring the Messaging Subsystem</H3><p>Users of Windows&nbsp;95 can configure which messaging services they wish to use, in what combination, by using the <B>Mail &amp; Fax</B> applet in the Control Panel. Users can save multiple configurations, each with a different name, for use under different conditions. These configurations are called <B>Messaging Profiles</B>. Profiles are configured by using the Mail &amp; Fax Control Panel applet. This applet lets you configure:</P>
<P>     Which messaging services will be installed &mdash; <I>Services</I> tab</P>
<P>     Which message store new e-mail will be delivered to by default. Depending on the mail systems installed, this might be your local Personal Information Store, or it might be a mailbox on an e-mail server &mdash; <I>Delivery</I> tab.</P>
<P>     Which address book to show by default, and in what order to search through your address books when resolving names &mdash; <I>Addressing</I> tab.</P>
<p>The illustration below shows an example of a fairly complex profile, with six different messaging services installed. When using the profile "Bob Smith's Mail Settings" the user will be able to:</P>
<P>     Send and receive mail via CompuServe, Microsoft Mail, and the Internet</P>
<P>     Send and receive faxes using a fax modem</P>
<P>     Store and manage e-mail addresses for users on all of these mail systems in a common Personal Address Book</P>
<P>     Receive e-mail from all these services in a "Universal Inbox" and maintain other Personal Folders for storing messages</P>
