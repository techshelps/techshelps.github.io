<h3>Authentication of External Users</H3><p>Support for public key certificate authentication in Windows&nbsp;NT allows client applications to connect to secure services on behalf of users who do not have a Windows&nbsp;NT domain account. Users who can be authenticated based on a public key certificate issued by a trusted Certificate Authority can be granted access to Windows&nbsp;NT resources. The Directory Service administration tools allow administrators, or delegated authorities, to associate one or more external users to an existing Windows&nbsp;NT account for access control. The subject name in the X.509 Version 3 certificate is used to identify the external user that is associated with the account.</P>
<p>Businesses can share information in a secure manner to selected individuals from other organizations without having to create many individual Windows&nbsp;NT accounts. Many-to-one mapping of certificates to Windows&nbsp;NT user objects provides for strong authentication based on public-key certificates and common access-control permissions. Client authentication of external users still requires the system administrator to configured the Certificate Authority for the external user's certificates as a trusted CA. This prevents someone with a certificate issued by an unknown authority from authenticating to the system as someone else.</P></BODY></HTML>
