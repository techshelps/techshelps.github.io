<H2>SNA Server Performance Profile</H2><p>Microsoft SNA Server emulates IBM SNA devices, allowing client software applications to emulate IBM terminals and printers, to transfer files to and from the IBM host, or to contact other software applications running with the SNA network.</P>
<p>SNA Server provides access into IBM mainframe environments by emulating the function of a traditional IBM cluster controller (PU2), and the various types of devices (LUs) that a PU2 can support. Hence, SNA Server is the Microsoft BackOffice component that provides for communication between the mainframe and client-server worlds.</P>
<p>With respect to Microsoft BackOffice component interaction and performance, SNA Server is relatively benign as far as its consumption of systems resources is concerned. However, SNA Server does require a basic level of system resource support and as such, the following information will paint a performance picture that will aid in the design and deployment of optimal Microsoft BackOffice architectures that include SNA Server as a component.</P></BODY></HTML>
