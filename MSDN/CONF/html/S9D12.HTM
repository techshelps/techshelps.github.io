<H2>Getting Started with Lan Emulation</H2><p>As was noted earlier, ATM resides comfortably on a heterogeneous network, which is fortunate because it allows network managers to incrementally build toward a homogenous ATM environment. A key part of transitioning toward a full ATM network implementation is Microsoft's testing and logo certification program for third-party LAN Emulation modules, which allow ATM cards to function like Ethernet cards before ATM is fully implemented on the network.</P>
<p>During this period of transition, the power of QoS won't be available, but the LAN Emulation Module provides the substantial benefit of accommodating legacy transport drivers as an organization moves toward the upgrade to a homogenous ATM network.</P></BODY></HTML>
