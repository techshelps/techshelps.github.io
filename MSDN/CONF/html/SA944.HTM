<H2>Summary </H2><p>This session has demonstrated how Microsoft Access and Visual Basic may be used to leverage your mainframe data by building complex applications in a few hours or days. The key is not changing the tools and products to match the old processes, but to adapt the business needs to the products directly. This can be called zero-base design or re-engineering, or many other names, but its name is not important. The adaptation to new technology is the important thing.</P>

A historian finally found the answer: His job had been to control the horses. The last time the regiment used horses was 1932.</I></P></BODY></HTML>
