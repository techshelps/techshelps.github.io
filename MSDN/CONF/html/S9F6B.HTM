<h3>Recommended Sessions</H3><H4> </A>Fundamentals of DCOM</H4><p>Do you need to get started right now? This first session, <I>Fundamentals of DCOM,</I> focuses on the general development and configuration challenges you may face when you start to build your distributed applications. Also included is a sneak preview of the class store&mdash;available in the technology preview&mdash;to show how you can easily centralize administration of COM and DCOM objects.</P>
<p>In addition, some very useful troubleshooting tips will be discussed, plus common pitfalls that you want to avoid. This session uses straightforward demonstrations and code examples for developers who are familiar with COM, OLE, or Remote Automation (Visual Basic 4.0).</P>
<H4> </A>Advanced DCOM Techniques for Performance and Scalability </H4><p>Are you writing high-performance, secure COM  servers or multithreaded GUI interfaces? Get the most out of your programs by coming to this talk and digging into the guts of the DCOM runtime. Topics in this second session include by-value and other custom object marshaling, free-, apartment-, and mixed threading, as well as advanced security techniques. Numerous code samples and sample applications will be provided during this session.</P>
<H4> </A>Building Distributed ActiveX Applications Using Java and DCOM </H4><p>You already know that Java and COM work together seamlessly. Monday's final session will show you how to develop distributed Java applications today using the combined power of Java and DCOM. This talk shows just how powerful DCOM is for your Java development tasks through sample applets as well as discussions of development techniques to use with Visual J++ and Microsoft&reg; Internet Explorer 3.0.</P></BODY></HTML>
