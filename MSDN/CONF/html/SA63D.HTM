<h3>Guide to Migration</H3><p>The purpose of this paper is to help customers who have existing implementations of Windows&nbsp;NT&reg; Server understand how to migrate to Microsoft's next generation Directory Service. This is an introduction and an overview of migration to the next generation Directory Service; it is not a tutorial on how to design great Windows&nbsp;NT directory trees. Two of the main features of the next generation Directory Services are: 1) complete interoperability with Windows NT 3.<I>x</I> and 4.<I>x</I>, and 2) a very easy migration from Windows NT 4.<I>x</I> domains. This paper will give you examples of how such a migration will take place for the traditional Windows NT 4.<I>x</I> domain models.</P>
<p>As we proceed through the document there are <I>three things</I> to remember about migrating to the next generation Directory Service:</P>
<UL><LI>You can proceed at your own pace, and stop at any time. </LI><LI>Compatibility with existing Windows&nbsp;NT 3.x and 4.x domains and their clients is maintained at all times both during and after the migration.</LI><LI>The view of the system from the end user's perspective does not change until you want it to change.</LI></UL></BODY></HTML>
