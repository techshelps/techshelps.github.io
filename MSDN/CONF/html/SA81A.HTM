<h3>Hardware Support</H3><p>Through Windows&nbsp;NT Server, corporations can choose to deploy Windows-based applications not only on thousands of different brands of Intel&reg; x86-based PCs, but also on computers based on RISC chips that include the DEC Alpha AXP&reg; and the MIPS&reg; Rx400 family today; with the PowerPC&trade; and other RISC chips in the near future. Additionally, with seamless symmetric multiprocessing (SMP) support, the Windows family brings incredible scalability for any business solution based on the standard Win32&reg; API. Through complete source-code portability for all Win32-based (32-bit) applications, Windows-based solutions can be scaled from CISC-based (Intel x86 and Pentium&trade;) and RISC-based computers incorporating from one to 32 CPUs (with support for even more processors soon).</P></BODY></HTML>
