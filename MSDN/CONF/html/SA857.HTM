<h3>Expense Reporting</H3><p>A common activity in many companies is filling out expense reports. Often, these are paper-based forms, which are prone to math errors and take too long to fill out.</P>
<p>In an Office/Mail-based solution, individuals can fill out periodic expense reports using a familiar Microsoft Excel template, which performs the necessary calculations. The template can be programmed to automatically route the completed report to an accounting department for processing via electronic mail. From the user's point of view, a custom button or command on the sheet is all that is necessary to submit the report.</P>
<p>The expense reporting template could even be developed to handle routing of the report to appropriate individuals for approval before it gets to accounting. Once in accounting, another Microsoft Excel application could be written to interface the information with a database for corporate-wide reporting and analysis.</P></BODY></HTML>
