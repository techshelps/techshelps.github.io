<H2>MS-DOS and UNIX Programmers Can Survive in the Windows&nbsp;NT World</H2><p>Not all applications for Windows&nbsp;NT need to be graphical. Windows&nbsp;NT has command-line console-application support similar to the Microsoft MS-DOS&reg; operating system or UNIX. So if you really feel you aren't ready for graphical programming yet, it's very simple to port many command-line applications to Windows&nbsp;NT as console applications. In fact, this can be simply a matter of recompiling the source code. Well-written source code should port with very few problems. Those of you with a somewhat more relaxed attitude to your programming might find Microsoft's C compiler a little more picky than others you may have used!</P>
<p>So the bottom line here is that "Hello World" on MS-DOS or UNIX is still a valid application on Windows&nbsp;NT.</P></BODY></HTML>
