<h3>Exploiting Distributed Services</H3><p>Object services, database and messaging services, as well as Internet and networking services are all part of this theme. The foundation for this new generation of distributed services is DCOM. It is the object model that database and messaging services such as Viper and Microsoft Message Queue are built on. In addition, Internet and networking services such as the Distributed File System (DFS) and Universal Directory Service API (Active Directory) are all supported by the DCOM foundation.</P></BODY></HTML>
