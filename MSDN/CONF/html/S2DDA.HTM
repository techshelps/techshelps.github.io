<H1>Comparing MMC to Other Tool Platforms</H1><p>MMC offers both UI and APIs that can integrate multiple tools together. MMC was designed specifically to address the issues of integration, delegation, and task orientation, be general enough to be reusable by most tools, and to offer simplicity for simple usage scenarios and advanced features for complex management scenarios.</P>
<p>The MMC APIs were designed to the core concept that tools are documents (able to be created, saved and passed around) and that people should be able to create and customize many new tools. Another key goal was to enable ISVs to build Snap-Ins that are can entwine themselves with the Snap-Ins provided by others and yet enable the user to experience a single tool. A user using such a tool does not even realize that it is composed of Snap-Ins created at different times by different vendors. </P>
<p>The MMC UI addresses both simple and advanced scenarios and those in between&mdash;Microsoft believes that administration occurs on a continuous spectrum of levels of experience, rather than a few defined roles (such as user, operator, and administrator). With MMC, senior administrators can create an infinite number of tools, with varying levels of complexity, and pass these tools on to less experienced people who will actually use them. MMC enables the administrators to build a tool that is perfectly tuned to the ability and role of its user, and the needs of the network.</P></BODY></HTML>
