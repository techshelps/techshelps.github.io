<h3>Overview</H3><p>This course breaks down into two distinct sections:</P>
<P>     The first section is an architectural overview of client/server application development technologies using Microsoft&nbsp;Access. This section provides essential background on each component, explains how the components are used, and how to optimize your application for your environment.</P>
<P>     The next section is an overview of a transaction processing system. This application is the Northwind Traders sample database that ships with Access version 2.0. For the purpose of this class, it has been migrated to a client/server environment giving us an opportunity to discuss the issues and solutions involved in migrating a transaction-processing file server application to client/server with a database many of us are familiar with.</P>
<p>The applications will be available on your Tech<FONT FACE="Symbol"> </FONT>Ed compact disk. The application is for your personal use to learn from and reuse code segments. <I>They cannot be redistributed for production use.</I></P>
<p>The reader is assumed to be familiar with the design of Microsoft&nbsp;Access version 2.0 applications and conversant with Access Basic programming techniques. No prior experience with using the Structured Query Language (SQL) database data sources is assumed for this session. This session is about optimizing database server usage in Microsoft&nbsp;Access.</P></BODY></HTML>
