<h3>What is Active Directory?</H3><p>Active Directory abstracts the capabilities of directory services from different network providers to present a <B>single set of directory service interfaces</B> for managing network resources. The standard Active Directory objects are those found within multiple <B>namespaces.</B> The typical namespaces for Active Directory are directory services for various network operating systems. Administrators and developers can use Active Directory services to enumerate and manage the resources in a directory service, no matter which network environment contains the resource. </P>
<p>Active Directory makes it easier to perform common administrative tasks, such as adding new users, managing printers, and locating resources throughout the distributed computing environment. </P>
<p>Active Directory makes it easy for developers to "directory enable" their applications. Administrators and developers deal with a single set of directory service interfaces&mdash;regardless of the installed directory service(s).</P>
<p>Active Directory is one component of the Windows&reg; Open Services Architecture (WOSA) Open Directory Service Interfaces (ODSI).</P></BODY></HTML>
