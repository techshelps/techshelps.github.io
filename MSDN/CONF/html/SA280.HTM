<h3>The Workstation Service</H3><P><img src="40665.gif"></P>
<p>All user mode requests go through the Workstation service. This service consists of two components:</P>
<P><ul><li>    The user-mode interface. </P>
<P><li>    The redirector (RDR.SYS) &mdash; A file system driver that interacts with the lower level network drivers via the TDI interface.</P></ul>
<p>The Workstation service receives the user request and passes it to the kernel mode redirector.</P>
<H4> </A>Workstation Service Dependencies</H4><p>The Workstation service is dependent on the following components:</P>
<P><ul><li>    A protocol that exposes the TDI interface at its top level must be started for the Workstation service to load.</P>
<P><li>    Multiple Universal Naming Convention Provider (MUP)</P></ul>
<H4> </A>The Workstation Service (Redirector) as a File System Driver</H4><p>The redirector is a component through which one computer gains access to another computer. The Windows&nbsp;NT redirector allows connection to Windows&nbsp;NT, Windows for Workgroups, LAN Manager, LAN Server, and other MS-Net servers. The redirector communicates to the protocols via the TDI interface.</P>
<p>The redirector is implemented as a Windows&nbsp;NT file system driver. Implementing a redirector as a file system has several benefits:</P>
<p>Allows applications to call a single API (namely the Windows&nbsp;NT I/O API) to access files on local and remote computers. From the I/O Manager's perspective, there is no difference between accessing files stored on a remote networked computer and accessing those stored locally on a hard disk.</P>
<p>Runs in kernel mode so it can directly call other drivers and other kernel mode components such as the Cache Manager. This improves the performance of the redirector.</P>
<P><ul><li>    It can be loaded and unloaded dynamically, just like any other file system driver.</P>
<P><li>    It can coexist easily with other redirectors.</P></ul>
<H4> </A>Accessing a Remote File</H4><p>When a process on a Windows&nbsp;NT computer tries to open a file that resides on a remote computer, the following steps occur:</P>
<P><ul><li>    The process calls the I/O Manager to request that the file be opened.</P>
<P><li>    The I/O Manager recognizes that the request is for a file on a remote computer, so it passes it to the redirector file system driver.</P>
<P><li>    The redirector passes the request to lower-level network drivers that transmit it to the remote Server for processing.</P></ul></BODY></HTML>
