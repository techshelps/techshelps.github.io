<h3>Remove the PageFrame and Page</H3><p>For each Form in the FormSet, the PageFrame and Page should be removed. Before deleting them, however, make sure that all controls contained within the Page are copied to the clipboard (select all controls contained within the Page and press Ctrl-C or select Copy from the Edit menu. Note that you will need to make the Page the current object in the property sheet before you will be able to select the controls contained within it. Once all the controls have been copied to the clipboard, re-select the PageFrame and press the delete key. This should delete the PageFrame and Page from the Form (if the PageFrame remains, press the delete key one more time to make sure it is removed). Make the Form the current object in the property sheet and press Ctrl-V or select Paste from the Edit menu. This will place the controls that were copied to the clipboard back on the Form. The controls may need to be moved.</P></BODY></HTML>
