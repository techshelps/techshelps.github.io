<h3>Alternate Sessions</H3><p>Monday's alternate sessions cover:</P>
<UL><LI><I>Using the Integrated Security Features of Windows NT:</I> This session examines how the security features of Windows NT can be used to integrate Windows NT domain accounts and single sign-on authentication into your distributed applications. These features allow users to use a single user ID and password to access multiple protected resources anywhere in the <BR>Windows NT domain. </LI><LI><I>Programming for Windows 95 and Windows NT:</I> This session looks at the features of Windows 95 and Windows NT, focusing on the key differences between them. It examines these differences in detail, demonstrating coding techniques you can use to overcome them so your applications can run on both platforms.</LI><LI><I>Advanced Programming with SQL Server:</I> This session examines how to enhance the functionality and performance of Microsoft&reg; SQL Server&trade; <BR>applications. In addition, ODBC design guidelines, use of Automation stored procedures, extending SQL Server, leveraging system, Microsoft&reg; BackOffice&trade; services, and much more will be discussed. </LI><LI><I>Wolfpack:</I> This session examines how to use Microsoft&reg; Cluster Manager for Windows NT Server, Microsoft's clustering technology, to make your application highly available and robust. The Cluster Manager functions cover cluster management, node management, and group and resource management. In this session, you'll learn how to write a resource DLL to enable your application to be truly cluster-aware.</LI><LI><I>DCOM on other Platforms:</I> This session demonstrates cross-platform DCOM in action. In addition, an overview of DCOM, current status, and announce planned deliverables will be discussed. Developers will be on hand to answer any questions you might have about DCOM.</LI><LI><I>Scalable Computing:</I> Systems trends are driving both hardware and software prices down. This session examines the economic and technological trends that make it practical to address very large application problems with a collection of cooperating systems. The roles of MSMQ (message queuing), OLE DB, and Viper (transaction applications) in the scope of this emerging scalable world will be discussed.</LI></UL></BODY></HTML>
