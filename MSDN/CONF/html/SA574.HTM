<H2>Recoverability and Reliability</H2><p>Recoverability and reliability are critical. If a system has a hardware failure and goes down in the middle of indexing five million documents, it isn't efficient to be forced to begin re-indexing the entire corpus. So great effort was put into making sure that the indexing system is recoverable. When a system comes up after a failure and disk integrity is verified, Index Server can then be activated to do a full integrity check of all indexes. Using the same kind of logging and recoverability mechanism that the file system uses, Index Server can detect corruptions and fix them. </P>
<p>Index Server works in a transaction-oriented manner when writing data to the disk, which avoids indexing only half a document. Either the entire document is there, and guaranteed to be correct once the data is indexed, or the document isn't accepted. This eliminates any inconsistent states due to partial indexing.</P>
<p>Index Server is built upon the solid and robust foundation of the Windows&nbsp;NT operating system to assure reliable service in a full 24-hour by 7-day operation on a mission-critical server.</P></BODY></HTML>
