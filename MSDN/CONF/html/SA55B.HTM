<H2>Private Key Security</H2><p>Along with next generation Directory Services, the next release of Windows&nbsp;NT Server will also implement a distributed security model. This distributed security model is based on the MIT Kerberos authentication protocol. Kerberos authentication is used for distributed security within a tree, accommodating both public and private key security using the same Access Control List (ACL) support model of the underlying Windows&nbsp;NT operating system. Next generation Directory Services are the store for the security system, including user accounts, groups, and domains. They replace the registry account database and are a trusted component within the Local Security Authority (LSA).</P>
<p>A single sign-on to the Windows&nbsp;NT domain tree allows user access to resources anywhere in the corporate network. Easy-to-use administrator tools for security policy and account management reduce the cost of deploying Windows&nbsp;NT. Windows&nbsp;NT also provides a foundation for integrated security for Microsoft BackOffice&trade; family of products application services, including Microsoft Exchange, Microsoft SQL Server&trade;, Microsoft SNA Server, and Microsoft Systems Management Server. The MIT Kerberos V5 authentication protocol is supported with extensions for public key-based authentication in addition to password-based (secret key) authentication.</P></BODY></HTML>
