<h3>Accessing a Member Variable</H3><p>A member variable of an object is treated much like any other FoxPro variable. It can be used, modified, queried, and so forth. The only difference is that a member variable is always referenced with its object as follows:</P>
<P CLASS="spacing"><BR></P>
<pre><FONT FACE="Courier New" SIZE="3">? oObject.&lt;MemVarName&gt;
oObject.&lt;MemVarName&gt; = &lt;Value&gt;</font></pre>
<p>Remember, if a member variable is protected, attempting to access it outside of the class will produce an error.</P>
<p>Finally, you can access a member from an object that is contained within another object by accessing the variable with the full object hierarchy. For example, assume we had a member called STATUS of oLight. Assuming that oLight is a member of oPhone., we would access the STATUS member as follows:</P>
<P CLASS="spacing"><BR></P>
<pre><FONT FACE="Courier New" SIZE="3">? oPhone.oLight.Status</font></pre></BODY></HTML>
