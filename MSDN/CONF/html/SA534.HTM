<H2>Introduction</H2><P>The next generation of Windows&nbsp;NT will contain an Enhanced Directory Services implementation. There will be a new way to think about domains, users, groups, and trusts. Enhanced DS domains will map directly to DNS domains, and administration for users and groups can be delegated to Organizational Units (OU) in the directory. The new Enhanced DS domains will be much more functional than Windows&nbsp;NT Server domains today.</P>
<P>The key thing to understand from a DNS implementation perspective, is that DNS will become the primary locator service in the Enhanced Directory Services network. The Enhanced DS clients will use DNS, similar to the way that clients running Windows&nbsp;NT 4.0 use WINS today, to find other servers running the DS service and other hosts on the network.</P>
<P>This section takes a look at some of the new Enhanced Directory Services concepts as well as some of the new standards that will effect DNS in the future. It then goes into what a good DNS/DS design might look like in the future and hopefully will give you an indication of how you might design your network today to be prepared for this future migration.</P></BODY></HTML>
