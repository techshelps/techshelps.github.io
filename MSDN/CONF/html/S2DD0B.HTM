<H2>Why is Microsoft Developing MMC?</H2>
<p>MMC is the result of Microsoft's effort to create better tools to administer Windows. The Windows administration development team defined a common host for many of its own tools. The MMC project's initial goal was to support simplified administration through integration, delegation, task orientation, and overall interface simplification - all key customer problems. </P>
<p>As Microsoft addressed that goal, it increased the project's charter to include all Microsoft administration tools, and to offer this generalized framework for management to its many ISVs as well. </P>
<p>MMC is a core part of Microsoft's future management strategy. Most Microsoft development groups will use MMC for future management applications.</P>
