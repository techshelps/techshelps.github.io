<H2>Working Toward the Future of Searching</H2><p>Indexing and query technology is a key element of the next generation computing vision, summarized by the phrase "Information At Your Fingertips." Microsoft is working aggressively on pushing this technology forward. In the future, the system will provide feedback to users to help them focus their search. As a result, users will be able to perform very tightly focused queries without needing to understand a cryptic query language.</P>
<P>Indexing to Provide the Foundation for Querying</P>
<p>To allow users to resolve their queries quickly and efficiently, Microsoft Index Server has a powerful indexing engine as an optimization which dramatically improves the performance of querying. Some queries bypass the index entirely, but for certain advanced querying techniques, an index provides the only practical means of implementation. So efficient indexing results in greater value for the user. </P></BODY></HTML>
