<H2>Introduction</H2><p>Microsoft&reg; Visual FoxPro&trade; 3.0 (FoxPro&reg;), a database or database management system, includes a number of tools for developers and end users. Notable among these are Wizards and Builders. </P>
<p>Wizards automate common tasks by presenting a sequence of simple questions, guiding users through their desired tasks, such as creating a one-to-many form or making a remote connection to a backend server and then building a query on tables in the remote database.</P>
<p>Builders present a set of frequently used properties for building an object to the user, who may otherwise be overwhelmed by the number of properties available. For example, using a grid control or writing triggers help enforce relational integrity in the new data dictionary. Builders offer additional opportunities for developers to leverage and automate their work. </P>
<p>These tools are not just for new users; they are powerful enough to be used by developers to quickly build the basic pieces of an application. </P>
<p>This presentation covers how Wizards and Builders are accessed and registered, and how you can modify or add styles to them, and create your own Builders in FoxPro 3.0. </P></BODY></HTML>
