<H2>Introduction</H2><p>The next major version of Windows NT will be host to a whole new generation of services that will enable applications to take advantage of distributed functionality. By following the distributed services theme, you will gain an understanding of the development challenges you'll face when building distributed applications; challenges such as high-performance secure COM servers and multi-threaded GUI front-ends. You'll learn how distributed COM (DCOM) naturally extends the programming model and constructs introduced by the Component Object Model (COM) in OLE 2 to work across the network, as well as find out why Location Transparency, Packaging Transparency, Free-Threaded Objects, Launch Security, Access Security and Call-Level Security are important technologies in building your distributed application.</P></BODY></HTML>
