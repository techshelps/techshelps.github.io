<h3>Benefiting Corporate Information Service and Telecom <BR>Managers</H3><p>Corporate Information Service, network, and telecom managers will benefit because TAPI 2.0 and the Windows platform will open the door to a new world of telephony applications. Managers will see greater choices and benefit from increased vendor competition as the hardware abstraction of TAPI knocks down the old barriers created by stand-alone proprietary systems.</P>
<p>In addition to what should be lower purchase prices, managers will also benefit from lower costs of ownership from not having to manage a collection of disparate applications, tools, and operating systems. TAPI-enabled applications will also give managers the ability to provide new features for their customer population within their organization. And the convergence of Internet and PSTN technology should allow network managers to make more efficient use of existing network facilities.</P></BODY></HTML>
