<H2>Summary</H2><p>Network management is an integral element in developing any kind of network service or device. This is apparent as more and more corporations are requiring network components, services and devices to work with SNMP in order to be considered for rolling out on corporation networks. Not only are network admins setting stringent requirements, but several software vendors are building up large management frameworks based on SNMP. By defining a MIB and implementing the instrumentation for that MIB using the NT extendible agent architecture, adminstrators can easily provide most major corporations with the required management functionality as well as take advantage of working with these management framework applications. Deciding to instrument via SNMP relieves developers of new network services and relieves devices of having to develop a management UI. They can instead concentrate on providing an excellent service, provide prudent instrumentation and rely on existing SNMP management consoles to provide the necessary UI.</P>
