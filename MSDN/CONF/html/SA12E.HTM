<H2>Mail Server and Schedule+ Performance Profiles</H2><p>The Microsoft Mail Server and Schedule+ applications may be constituents of your Microsoft BackOffice architecture. Hence, we address them in the paper as applications that can greatly influence performance.</P>
<p>To begin with, these applications are both "disk bound" from a performance perspective, as they make use of the Mail Server Post Office facility, which is based on the Shared File System architecture. In addition, these applications tend to generate an appreciable amount of disk and network I/O when under heavy access. Therefore, the following information will aid in the understanding of the performance characteristics associated with these applications.</P></BODY></HTML>
