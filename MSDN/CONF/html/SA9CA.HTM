<H2>Creating Composite Classes</H2><p>A composite class is a class that has members that are themselves instances of other classes. A perfect example of this is a class that is based on a <I>container</I> class such as a form. When you think of it, a form in and of itself is a class. Yet the objects in it are classes also. So, we have one object that has other objects contained in it (hence the name Container Class). </P>
<p>When using code, object members are added to the class in the INIT method using the ADDOBJECT() method. For example, I could have a class called PHONE that I wanted to have a member of class LIGHT. In the INIT method of class PHONE, I would do the following:</P>
<P CLASS="spacing"><BR></P>
<pre><FONT FACE="Courier New" SIZE="3">PROCEDURE init
    this.addobject("oLight", "Light")
ENDPROC</font></pre>
<p>If I instantiated an object called oPhone, it would have a member called oLight.</P>
<p>The syntax of the AddObject() method is:</P>
<P CLASS="spacing"><BR></P>
<pre><FONT FACE="Courier New" SIZE="3">&lt;object&gt;.AddObject(&lt;Member Name&gt;,&lt;Class Name&gt;)</font></pre></BODY></HTML>
