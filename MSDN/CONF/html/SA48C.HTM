<h3>The LAN Emulation Testing Process</H3><p>The testing process has three basic parts. The first involves two ATM cards in the same PC. One card sends traffic out across the LAN to an ATM switch and back into the second card. The second test involves two ATM cards, each in a separate PC. Data is sent from one ATM card, across the LAN to an ATM switch, and to the ATM card on the other PC. The third test involves one PC containing an ATM card and another PC containing an Ethernet card. Data is sent from the ATM card, through an ATM switch, to the Ethernet card. Different aspects of the LAN Emulation protocol are testing with these three scenarios. These tests are conducted on the particular processor type for which the customer seeks certification, such as Intel or MIPS. This testing process takes only a few days, and the results are completely confidential&mdash;although card vendors are free to publish their card's results.</P>
<p>The testing is done over twisted pair as well as fiber, at both 25 Mb/s and 155 Mb/s. The server side of the ATM LAN Emulation services test uses the UNI 3.1 call manager. To assure interoperability, each card is tested with a combination of cards from different vendors. Madge Network Systems and Adaptec were certified for ATM LAN Emulation in time for the drivers to be in the box with Windows&nbsp;NT 4.0. Other ATM LAN Emulation drivers which have passed the logo testing process, such as the FORE Systems driver, are available through the Microsoft hardware compatibility page at www.microsoft.com/hwtest.</P>
<p>While Ethernet has been tested already, the same test configuration process will be provided for token ring when there are enough cards available and the other testing criteria are met.</P></BODY></HTML>
