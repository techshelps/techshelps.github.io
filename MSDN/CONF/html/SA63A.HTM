<H2>Providing a Smooth Migration to The Next version of Domains</H2><p>Migrating from a Windows&nbsp;NT 4.0 environment to the next version of Windows&nbsp;NT domain will be easy because of backward compatibility for existing Windows&nbsp;NT security and account replication protocols. A smooth migration is available because Windows&nbsp;NT has the following interoperability features:</P>
<UL><LI>The next version of the Windows&nbsp;NT domain controller will play the role of a Windows&nbsp;NT 4.0 BDC and receive domain account replication from an existing Windows&nbsp;NT 4.0 PDC. </LI><LI>Windows&nbsp;NT 4.0 workstations can send network authentication requests using the NTLM authentication protocol to the next version of the Windows&nbsp;NT Domain Controller, thereby acting as a BDC in the Windows&nbsp;NT 4.0 domain.</LI><LI>The next version of Windows&nbsp;NT Domain Controllers will establish trust relationships with Windows&nbsp;NT 4.0 domains and support pass-through authentication between domains. This means that not all domains in an enterprise are required to upgrade to the next revision oft he Windows&nbsp;NT domain security at the same time.</LI></UL><p>The next version of the Windows&nbsp;NT Domain Controllers will eventually replace Windows&nbsp;NT 4.0 Domain Controllers in a gradual upgrade of Windows&nbsp;NT 4.0 BDCs to next version of the Windows&nbsp;NT Domain Controllers. Windows&nbsp;NT 4.0 account management tools are used on the Primary Domain Controller as long as the PDC is running Windows&nbsp;NT 4.0. Eventually, all domain controllers can be switched to use the Windows NT Server Distributed Services Technology preview  for account management and multimaster account replication.</P>
<p>Windows&nbsp;NT support for multiple authentication protocols means that from a single domain logon at the desktop, users can access Windows&nbsp;NT services anywhere in a mixed domain environment, including:</P>
<UL><LI>A Windows&nbsp;NT server in the logon, or home domain, using Kerberos session tickets issued by the Key Distribution Center (KDC) on the domain controller.</LI><LI>A Windows&nbsp;NT server in a trusted domain, using a Kerberos referral to the KDC in the trusted domain, to issue a session ticket to the remote server.</LI><LI>Or, a Windows&nbsp;NT 4.0 server in a trusted domain using NTLM pass-through authentication between the client, the Windows&nbsp;NT 4.0 server, and the trusted domain controller.</LI></UL><p>Because Windows&nbsp;NT will continue to support NTLM authentication, Windows&nbsp;NT 4.0 clients that do not use Kerberos authentication will also be able to connect to next version of Windows&nbsp;NT servers.</P>
<p>These interoperability features allow flexibility for organizations to plan and implement a migration strategy to the next version of Windows&nbsp;NT servers that fit their business needs.</P></BODY></HTML>
