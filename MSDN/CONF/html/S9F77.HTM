<h3>Recommended Sessions</H3><H4> </A>Security Issues in Viper Environments</H4><p>High-performance scalable applications pose special requirements for security. This session describes the security features provided with Viper and the recommended solutions for securing applications in a three-tier environment.</P>
<H4> </A>Advanced Application Design Issues</H4><p>Scalable systems are easy to build unless an application needs to share rapidly changing information across many different clients. Most applications can use database management systems to hold their shared information. Some high-end systems find this impractical. This session presents a number of sample application problems related to high performance sharing of information and describes how these problems can be solved in a Viper environment.</P>
<H4> </A>Distributed File System</H4><p>Would you like a single directory namespace that can use an unlimited number of File servers and shares? This session covers the capabilities on the new Microsoft Distributed File System and the DFS functions (using both C++ and Visual Basic) that you can use to build such a structure.</P>
<H4> </A>Admin Guide to DS Extensibility</H4><p>In this session we'll cover live examples of extending a DS Web-based administration tool. After this session, you'll know what you should change and what not to touch. You'll have guidelines for adding resources to the directory, and you'll want to know more about Active Pages.</P></BODY></HTML>
