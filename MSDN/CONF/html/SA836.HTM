<h3>Overview</H3><p>Our objective n developing the SDIS for Third-Wave Technologies was to control four information domains: client information and communication, time reporting, test results, and problem reports. Because several of our employees and nearly all of our clients only have remote access to our information, Microsoft Mail was utilized as the core technology for the solution. </P>

<p>SDIS was developed to demonstrate how Microsoft's Workgroup Strategy could be deployed as a complex solution. The solution was developed using Microsoft Visual Basic&reg; as the solution development platform and Microsoft Visual C++&trade; as the component platform. SDIS relies heavily on Object Linking and Embedding (OLE) and OLE automation to provide object management and abstraction of the underlying technologies.</P></BODY></HTML>
