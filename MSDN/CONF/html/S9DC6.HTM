<h3>Nslookup</H3><P>Nslookup will probably be one of your primary diagnostic tools when debugging a Domain Name System (DNS) architecture. It can be used to display any resource record on any DNS server including UNIX-based DNS implementations. NSLookup from most other DNS implementations should also work against the Microsoft-based DNS server. This is a command line utility and has the following syntax.</P>
<P><B>nslookup [[-option ...] [computer-to-find]] | - [server]</B></P>
<H4> </A>Modes</H4><P>Nslookup has two modes: interactive and non-interactive.</P>
<P>If you only need to look up a single piece of data, use non-interactive mode. For the first argument, type the name or IP address of the computer to be looked up. For the second argument, type the name or IP address of a DNS name server. If you omit the second argument, the default DNS name server will be used.</P>
<P>If you need to look up more than one piece of data, you can use interactive mode. Type a hyphen for the first argument and the name or IP address of a DNS name server for the second argument, or omit both arguments and the default DNS name server will be used.</P>
<H4> </A>Parameters</H4><P><B>-option . .. </B></P>
<P>You can specify one or more nslookup commands as a command-line option. For a list of commands, see "Nslookup Commands" in the WINNT.HLP file supplied with Windows&nbsp;NT 4.0. Each option consists of a hyphen (-) followed immediately by the command name and, in some cases, an equal sign (=), and then a value. For example, to change the default query type to host (computer) information and the initial timeout to 10 seconds, you would type:</P>
<P>nslookup -querytype=hinfo -timeout=10</P>
<P>The command line length must be less than 256 characters.</P>
<P><B>computer-to-find</B></P>
<P>This instruct Nslookup to Look up information for computer-to-find using the current default server or using server if specified. If computer-to-find is an IP address and the query type is A or PTR, the name of the computer is returned. If computer-to-find is a name and does not have a trailing period, the default DNS domain name is appended to the name. (This behavior depends on the state of the set options: domains, srchlist, defname, and search.) To look up a computer not in the current DNS domain, append a period to the name.</P>
<P>If you type a hyphen (-) instead of computer-to-find, the command prompt changes to Nslookup interactive mode.</P>
<P><B>server</B></P>
<P>Use this server as the DNS name server. If you omit server, the default DNS name server is used.</P>
