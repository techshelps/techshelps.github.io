<h3>Summary </H3><p>Microsoft Virtual Private Network (VPN) technology is based upon the industry-standard point-to-point tunneling protocol (PPTP). It allows users to achieve secure connectivity between remote clients and private networks via the Internet or other public carriers. VPN provides businesses with an economical and easy-to-implement strategy for securely using the Internet as an extension of their private network. The security, reliability, ease of use, and speed of PPTP-enabled Windows NT Servers, combined with the DNS infrastructure, provides significantly enhanced business-to-business communications across the Internet.</P>
<p>The movement to the open PPTP protocol standard signals an opportunity for remote access system vendors, Internet Service Providers, and firewall vendors to provide great value-added benefits for their customers. PPTP-enabled systems can be deployed now with the confidence that Microsoft will ensure compatibility with the PPTP standard as it evolves through the IETF and into the future. </P></BODY></HTML>
