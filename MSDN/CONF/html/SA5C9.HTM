<h3>Auto Attendant</H3><p>"If you know the extension of your party, enter it now. If you would like to speak to an operator, press two." Auto attendants are being used more and more by businesses large and small to handle initial routing of incoming telephone calls. TAPI makes it easy to create and use auto attendant applications, meaning that small businesses, and even individuals, can take advantage of it. This is one way that a small business can appear to the outside world to be a much larger business. By making use of these kinds of technologies, which people tend to associate with large businesses, they will enhance their customers' perceptions of them. TAPI will provide those functions at a level which is very affordable for even a small company. Auto attendant also saves labor on the part of receptionists and others, which is another cost savings. It is a way of automating certain routine tasks, such as rudimentary queries. These can often be predicted, and an auto attendant can often handle them. Human labor can then be allocated to other customer service tasks.</P></BODY></HTML>
