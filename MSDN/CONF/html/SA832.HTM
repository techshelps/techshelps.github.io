<h3>Using Internet Mail</H3><p>Windows&nbsp;95 also includes a set of MAPI drivers that allows the Microsoft Exchange client to send and receive mail directly on the Internet. Because Windows&nbsp;95 already includes great support for TCP/IP, including remote TCP/IP over PPP dial-up lines, everything you need is "in the box" to connect to the Internet and start sending and receiving mail. You can make a LAN connection if your company has direct access to the Internet, or you can obtain access through one of many Internet "service providers." Thanks to MAPI, you can configure the Microsoft Exchange client to <I>simultaneously</I> support Internet mail along with other mail systems, such as the built-in Microsoft Mail. </P>
<p>Features of Microsoft Mail Internet drivers:</P>
<P>     Supports Internet electronic mail standards, including SMTP and POP.</P>
<P>     True Windows Sockets application &mdash; leverages the great built-in TCP/IP support of Windows&nbsp;95.</P>
<P>     Runs either via direct LAN connection or by using Remote Network Access and PPP protocol.</P>
<P>     Supports MIME (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions) to allow interchange of video, images, voice, text, and graphics with other Internet users in mail messages. MIME Associations Option lets you associate multimedia elements with a program on your PC so you can directly "launch" them from your favorite applications.</P>
<P>     Remote Preview. Supports Microsoft Exchange header and selective download options to make the most of your connect time on the Internet (see Using Your Microsoft Mail Postoffice Remotely, above).</P>
<P>     Automatically uses standard encoding (UUENCODE) to send and receive binary attachments with other Internet or UNIX&reg; mail users.</P>
<P>     Great International support, including support for character sets of all countries with rapidly growing Internet usage.</P>
<P>     Ability to send rich-text e-mail over the Internet to other users of Windows&nbsp;95 (other users receive plain text messages).</P>
<P>     Complete integration with all other Microsoft Exchange client features, including Custom Views, Filtering, Searching, etc.</P>
<P>     Simple, graphical configuration and management tools, including detailed troubleshooting and logging facilities.</P>
<p>The Microsoft Mail Internet Service is a set of MAPI drivers that allows you to send and receive mail on the Internet by connecting a computer running Windows&nbsp;95 and Microsoft Exchange to a server with access to the Internet. Microsoft Mail Internet Service is MIME compliant (MIME is documented in RFC 1521). MIME allows you to send messages containing sound, images, video, and other attachments over the Internet. Microsoft Mail Internet Service's MIME capabilities vastly improve the text-only mail messages sent on the Internet. </P>
<p>Most servers that provide access to the Internet run a combination of simple messaging transport protocol (SMTP), or Postoffice Protocol version 3 (POP3). SMTP is used to send Internet messages from the Internet Mail Service to the final destination. POP3 is used to retrieve messages sent to you from a POP3 account mailbox.</P>
<p>To successfully connect to a POP3/SMTP server, you must add Microsoft Mail Internet Service to a Microsoft Exchange Profile and configure the Microsoft TCP/IP protocol to use either a network adapter or the Microsoft Dial-Up adapter. For more information about installing and binding these protocols, see the Windows&nbsp;95 Resource Kit.</P>
<p>To run the Microsoft Mail Internet Service, you need the following information from your Internet service provider. Be sure to have this information before you add Microsoft Mail Internet Service to your Microsoft Exchange Profile:</P>
<P>     Internet Mail Server (POP3) account name and password. </P>
<P>     Your IP address on your Microsoft Mail Internet (POP3) Server. If you have DHCP server that maps the domain name service (DNS) to IP addresses, you do not need an IP address. If you have a DHCP server, you disable DNS in TCP/IP setup in Control Panel. If DNS is not enabled, then the IP address must be entered. For more information, see the Windows&nbsp;95 Resource Kit.</P>
<P>     Your electronic mail address, that is, your mailbox name (host name) followed by the at symbol (@) and domain names (joellen@microsoft.com). This is used to address replies to any messages that you have sent. </P>
<p>The easiest way to install Microsoft Mail Internet Service is during Custom Setup of Windows&nbsp;95. You can also install it after Windows&nbsp;95 installation in Add/Remove Programs in Control Panel.</P>
<p>To install Internet Mail Service during Windows 95 installation</P>
<P>1.    Choose Custom Setup Type, and in the Select Components screen, click Microsoft Exchange, and then click the Change Option button.</P>
<P>2.    In the Details dialog box, click Internet Mail Service.</P>
<p>After you install Internet Mail Service, you must add it to as an information service to a Microsoft Exchange profile. </P>
<p>To add Microsoft Internet Mail Service</P>
<P>1.    Double-click the Mail &amp; Fax icon in Control Panel, and then click a profile.</P>
