<h3>Description of Sessions:</H3><p><I>Developing Internet and Intranet Systems with WinSock 2.0</I>: This session shows you how to use the basic Winsock APIs for interprocess communication. Topics include: an overview of  Winsock 2.0 enhancements over Winsock 1.1, using multiple protocols using winsock; using name resolution API's to access DNS, SAP X.500, using multicast and multipoint and QOS features in Winsock 2.0, and a discussion of performance issues when using Winsock 2.0 APIs.</P>
<p><I>Microsoft Internet Security Framework</I>: This session provides an overview of technologies to build a secure web site, including Authenticode, SSL, and Certificates technologies. We'll show how to use Win32 APIs to integrate Windows NT domain accounts and single sign-on authentication into your applications.  This allows users with a single User ID and password to access multiple protected resources anywhere in the Windows NT domain.  Topics include discussion of user account management APIs, network authentication using SSPI, implementing access control on server resources, impersonation and delegation, and audit features.  Primary focus on integrated network authentication and access control for secure distributed applications.</P>
<p><I>Microsoft Merchant System</I>: Microsoft Merchant Server is designed for full integration with the Microsoft BackOffice family of server software products. When used with BackOffice, Microsoft Merchant Server offers a high degree of flexibility and scalability. An online store can be set up with either a single Merchant Server or multiple servers, on one computer or several computers with support for multi-processor and multi-network installations.  This session includes a demonstration and discussion of how to programmatically build on the services provided by Microsoft Merchant System.</P></BODY></HTML>
