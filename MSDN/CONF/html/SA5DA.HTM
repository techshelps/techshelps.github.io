<h3>Benefiting Public Network Operators</H3><p>For public network operators, such as telephone companies and Internet service providers, TAPI-based applications and client/server telephony provide many of the same benefits as those enjoyed by application developers, such as the use of common tools. This greatly accelerates their ability to offer new services, which can either be provided by software and hardware developed internally, or purchased from a broad spectrum of vendors, thereby resulting in shorter time to market. TAPI-based applications also allow telephone companies and Internet service providers to provide value-added outsourced services for their customers, who will no longer have to purchase their own equipment. For companies that sell solutions, TAPI-based applications expand the range of products for them to sell to their customers.</P></BODY></HTML>
