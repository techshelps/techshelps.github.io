<h3>Highlights </H3><p>Windows&nbsp;NT Distributed Security Services has many new features to simplify domain administration, improve performance, and integrate Internet security technology based on public-key cryptography. The highlights of the Windows&nbsp;NT Distributed Security Services Technology preview include:</P>
<UL><LI>Integration with the next generation Windows NT Server Directory Services to provide scalable, flexible account management for large domains, with fine-grain access control and delegation of administration.</LI><LI>Kerberos Version 5 authentication protocol, a mature Internet security standard, is implemented as the default protocol for network authentication and provides a foundation for authentication interoperability.</LI><LI>Strong authentication using public-key certificates, secure channels based on Secure Sockets Layer version 3.0, and CryptoAPI version 2.0 deliver industry-standard protocols for data integrity and privacy across public networks. </LI></UL><p>This White Paper describes the Windows Nt Distributed Security Services Technology preview that provides features to support the demands of the Internet-based Enterprise. Most of the material described here is scheduled to be delivered in the next release of Windows&nbsp;NT to follow after Windows&nbsp;NT version 4.0. These features are not currently available in Windows&nbsp;NT&nbsp;4.0, except where noted. </P></BODY></HTML>
