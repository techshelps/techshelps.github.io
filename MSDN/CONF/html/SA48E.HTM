<h3>Benefiting Vendors </H3><p>ATM card vendors can make use of the logo testing process to ensure a higher degree of customer satisfaction with their products. The logo testing program provides a standard measure of compatibility and performance for ATM card vendors, a standard which has, to date, been lacking. </P>
<p>Vendors will benefit even more when Microsoft releases the NDIS extensions for native ATM support and begins offering native ATM drivers. Native ATM support at the operating system level will enable a new class of guaranteed quality-of-service (QoS) based applications. Because native support will mean that the call manager and LAN Emulation will be provided in the operating system (for both Windows&nbsp;NT and Windows&nbsp;95), developers will be free of the need to develop or license their own call managers and LAN Emulation modules. This support should allow ATM hardware to be more easily and more quickly developed and lower the costs to develop and deploy ATM-based solutions.</P></BODY></HTML>
