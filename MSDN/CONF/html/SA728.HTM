<h3>Setting Connection Timeout</H3><p>Regardless of the type of server you're using, if someone is running your application but hasn't taken any action for a long time, you may want to close connections to the server. By default, connections are closed after 600 seconds (10 minutes) of idle time. You can change this interval by setting the ConnectionTimeout entry in the [ODBC] section of the initialization file (MSACC20.INI) to the number of seconds you want to wait before closing idle connections. Microsoft Jet closes connections even if forms displaying remote data are still open, and then it automatically reconnects when the connection is needed again. </P>
<p>Even if the idle time has expired, Microsoft Jet can't close a connection if:</P>
<P><ul><li>    There is a pending transaction on the connection. You must commit or rollback the transaction before the connection can be closed.</P>
<P><li>    Results of a query are pending. Microsoft doesn't close a connection if it's in the process of fetching query results from a server (see Releasing Connections above)</P></ul>
<p>For more information on connection management, see the "Jet Database Engine ODBC Connectivity White Paper" (reference 1).</P></ul></font></BODY></HTML>
