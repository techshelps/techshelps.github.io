<h3>Systems Management Server Service Components and Performance</H3><p>By default, all Systems Management Server services are installed on a site server. These services enable Systems Management Server to manage the site and communicate with other sites. The services are:</P>
<P>     Systems Management Server Site Hierarchy Manager</P>
<P>     Systems Management Server Site Configuration Manager</P>
<P>     Systems Management Server Executive</P>
<P>     Package Command Manager</P>
<P>     Inventory Agent</P>
<P>     Systems Management Server SNA Receiver (Only if SNA Sender is installed)</P>
<p>The following sections describe the service and the associated performance impact to a Microsoft BackOffice solution architecture.</P>
<H4> </A>Systems Management Server Site Hierarchy Manager</H4><p>The Systems Management Server Site Hierarchy Manager service monitors the site database for changes to the configuration of that site or its direct secondary sites. If the Systems Management Server Site Hierarchy Manager detects a change in a site's proposed configuration, it creates a site control file (which contains all proposed configurations for a site) and sends it to the site. The Systems Management Server Site Hierarchy Manager exists only on primary sites.</P>
<p><B>Performance Impact:</B> The Systems Management Server Site Hierarchy Manager initiates transactions to the Systems Management Server SQL Server database, as well as initiating requests of other Systems Management Server services which result is network and disk I/O. Since this service monitors site configurations (new or existing), I/O is typically minimal.</P>
<H4> </A>Systems Management Server Site Configuration Manager</H4><p>The Systems Management Server Site Configuration Manager watches for site control files created by the Systems Management Server Site Hierarchy Manager. If the site control file contains changes to a site's configuration, the Systems Management Server Site Configuration Manager makes the changes. The Systems Management Server Site Configuration Manager exists on both primary and secondary sites.</P>
<p><B>Performance impact:</B> The Systems Management Server Site Configuration Manager can initiate substantial disk I/O on a site server on which configuration changes are to be made. In addition, substantial network activity is generated as the Systems Management Server Site Configuration Manager performs its site monitoring functions. These monitoring functions can be tuned via interval values associated with this service. In addition, this service can initiate jobs with other Systems Management Server services that result in further network I/O.</P>
<H4> </A>Systems Management Server Executive</H4><p>The Systems Management Server Executive service functions as a master controller of the following Systems Management Server components. For a detailed description of these Systems Management Server Executive service components see the Systems Management Server System Reference, Appendix A.</P>
<P>     Maintenance Manager</P>
<P>     Inventory Processor</P>
<P>     Site Reporter</P>
<P>     Scheduler</P>
<P>     Despooler</P>
<P>     Inventory Data Loader</P>
<P>     Senders (LAN, RAS, and SNA)</P>
<P>     Applications Manager</P>
<P>     Alerter</P>
<p><B>Performance impact:</B> All of these Systems Management Server Executive service components can initiate substantial Systems Management Server server disk and network I/O and/or database transactions.</P>
<P>     If a RAS Sender is in use, it requires that Windows&nbsp;NT Server RAS server be running, thus consuming additional system resources.</P>
<P>     If an SNA Sender is in use, it requires the Microsoft BackOffice SNA Server communications service, also consuming additional system resources.</P>
<P>     The Scheduler and Despooler service components may initiate compression and decompression activities that will consume moderate to substantial CPU resources.</P>
<p>Due to potential resource limitations on a single Microsoft BackOffice hardware platform the following Systems Management Server Executive service components may be moved to Systems Management Server Helper servers. Accordingly, work load may be balanced across several Microsoft BackOffice hardware platforms.</P>
<P>     Scheduler</P>
<P>     Despooler</P>
<P>     Inventory Data Loader</P>
<P>     Inventory Processor</P>
<P>     Sender(s)</P>
<H4> </A>Package Command Manager</H4><p>The Package Command Manager (PCM) service is installed on all servers running Windows&nbsp;NT Server at a Systems Management Server site. This service provides unattended package installation.</P>
<p><B>Performance impact:</B> The PCM service is a polling type service, initially polling every one minute. The polling interval value may be changed. This service generates I/O via the execution of package jobs. Upon completion of such jobs, initiation of other service component processes occurs, thereby resulting in further I/O.</P>
<H4>Bootstrap</H4><p>The Bootstrap service is used to set up the site server for a secondary site.</P>
<p><B>Performance impact:</B> This service is basically a temporary service in that it is removed after completing the secondary site set up. The service initiates package decompression, creates directory structure, performs file maintenance, and starts the Site Configuration Manager service, which then removes the Bootstrap service. If this occurs on a new dedicated Systems Management Server secondary site server, there is little performance impact to other Microsoft BackOffice applications. Otherwise, this activity will result in some performance degradation until complete.</P>
<H4> </A>Inventory Agent</H4><p>The Inventory Agent service performs inventory of Systems Management Server components on servers.</P>
<p><B>Performance impact:</B> This service functions on a 24-hour interval, at which time by default it scans the hardware and software inventories of the associated server. This activity results in some CPU utilization as well as file creation. This in turn initiates a process whereby the inventory information is sent to the Systems Management Server central site for storage in the database. Since this occurs on a timed interval performance impact can be controlled via the scan and service interval values.</P>
<H4> </A>Systems Management Server SNA Receiver</H4><p>The SNA Receiver processes information sent from remote SNA Sender sites.</P>
<p><B>Performance impact:</B> Aside from the overhead associated with the service, the performance impact is negligible.</P>
<H4> </A>Conclusion</H4><p>Based upon the performance impact information it is clear that Systems Management Server is indeed a resource-hungry Microsoft BackOffice application. Hence, Systems Management Server as a component of a Microsoft BackOffice solution will require significant system resources and depending upon work loads may not co-exist well with other Microsoft BackOffice components. This is especially true of Microsoft BackOffice components, such as Microsoft SQL Server, that require dedicated system resources for efficient and optimal operation.</P></BODY></HTML>
