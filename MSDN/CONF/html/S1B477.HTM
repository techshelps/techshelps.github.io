<H1>Microsoft Access Developer's Toolkit</H1><H2>The Essential Tools for Microsoft Access Developers</H2><p><img src="58747.gif"></P>
<p><img src="58748.gif"></P>
<p>Microsoft Access Developer's Toolkit contains everything you need to create, manage, and distribute powerful solutions built with the Microsoft Access database management system. From the enhanced Setup Wizard to the new Replication Manager, you get serious tools. Built for serious developers.</P>
<p>Microsoft Access is the world's most popular database for the Microsoft Windows&reg; operating system. And as developers everywhere have discovered, the Microsoft Access database management system is also a powerful development platform. With an equally robust integrated development environment. </P>
<H2>The Microsoft Access Developer's Toolkit. </H2><p>It's designed specifically for professional developers and contains everything you need to create, manage, and distribute powerful solutions.</P>
<p>Prebuilt OLE controls let you quickly add powerful new features to every solution you create. The Replication Manager simplifies creating and managing replication schemas. The Office Compatible Technical Kit shows you how to create applications that look and work like other Microsoft Office applications. And a two-volume printed reference helps you learn Microsoft Visual Basic&reg; for Applications.</P>
<p>And distributing solutions is amazingly easy. The Setup Wizard makes it easy to give them a consistent, intuitive setup routine. The Replication Manager lets you update database replicas across entire networks, even reaching mobile and rarely connected users. And the royalty-free run-time license lets you upgrade your solutions to the full power of Microsoft Access at any time.</P>
<p>All this is in addition to many of the flexible, powerful tools you'll find in Microsoft Access itself. For starters, it now includes Microsoft Visual Basic for Applications, the same language engine as in <BR>the Microsoft Visual Basic programming system 4.0 and Microsoft Excel and Microsoft Project for the Windows 95 operating system. Innovations such <BR>as the Performance Analyzer Wizard and Table Analyzer Wizard make it easy to fine-tune your solutions fast. Plus there's an improved 32-bit Jet database engine with full support for replication, an enhanced forms design environment that makes it easy to create great forms, and OLE support.</P>
<p>Of course, both Microsoft Access and the <BR>Microsoft Access Developer's Toolkit contain much more. In fact, they offer everything you need for the most important job of all. Creating great solutions.</P>
