<h3>The Server Service</H3><P><img src="40666.gif"></P>
<p>Windows&nbsp;NT also includes a component called the server that resides above TDI. Like the redirector, the server is implemented as a file system driver and directly interacts with various other file system drivers to satisfy input/output (I/O) requests such as reading or writing to a file. </P>
<p>The server processes the connections requested by client-side redirectors, and provides them with access to the resources they request. Like the Workstation service, the Server service is composed of two parts:</P>
<p>Server &mdash; A service that runs in the SERVICES.EXE process. Unlike the Workstation service, it is not dependent on the MUP service, because the Server is not a UNC provider. It does not attempt to connect to other computers, but other computers connect to it. </P>
<p>SRV.SYS &mdash; A file system driver that handles the interaction with the lower levels and interacts directly with various file system devices to satisfy command requests, such as file read and write.</P>
<H4> </A>Processing Remote Requests</H4><p>When the server service receives a request from a remote computer asking it to read a file that resides on the local hard drive, the following steps occur:</P>
<P><ul><li>    The low-level network drivers receive the request and pass it to the server driver.</P>
<P><li>    The server passes a file read request to the appropriate local file system driver.</P>
<P><li>    The local file system driver calls lower-level disk device drivers to access the file.</P>
<P><li>    The data is passed back to the local file system driver.</P>
<P><li>    The local file system driver passes the data back to the server.</P>
<P><li>    The server passes the data to the lower-level network drivers for transmission back to the client computer.</P></ul></BODY></HTML>
