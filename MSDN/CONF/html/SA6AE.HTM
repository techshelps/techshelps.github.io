<h3>With ODBC SQL statements, use pass-through where possible</H3><p>One of the major enhancements to Microsoft Jet 2.0 was the ability to create pass-through queries. With an ordinary query, Microsoft Jet compiles and runs the query, combining the power of the server with the capabilities of the Jet database engine. With a pass-through query, you enter an SQL statement that Microsoft Jet sends directly to the server without stopping to compile the query. </P>
<p>Pass-through queries offer the following advantages over other queries. Some of the more important ones are:</P>
<P><ul><li>    Pass-through queries can use server-specific functionality &mdash; such as stored procedures and server-based intrinsic functions &mdash; that have no Visual Basic equivalent.</P>
<P><li>    Pass-through queries can log informational messages returned by the server, such as warnings and statistics.</P>
<P><li>    Update, delete, and append pass-through action queries are faster than action queries based on attached remote tables, especially when many records are affected. However, a pass-through action query cannot partially succeed as an ordinary action query can. (In addition, you are limited to action queries that your server can run; if an action query uses multiple tables, you may have no choice but to use an ordinary query.)</P></ul>
<p>Full details on pass-through queries can be found by searching Microsoft&nbsp;Access Help for <I>SQL: pass-through queries</I>. See also the <I>Developing Client/Server Applications </I>chapter of Building Application in the Access Developer's Toolkit.</P></BODY></HTML>
