<h3>Video</H3><p>Our front-end allowed us to play Audio\Video Interleaved (AVI) video files in response to a hyperlink. With the text and graphics, we were faced with issues of conversion and editing. With the video, our issues were ones of creation and enhancement. </P>
<p>Because the titles we have created are about computer software, the sequences mostly the application screen as an imaginary user performs a particular procedure. To create the video we used the screen capture application called Cameraman. This application creates an AVI file of a particular region of the screen as the operator performs actions there. </P>
<p>Once the video sequences were created, we used Adobe Premier, Microsoft VidEdit and MacroMind Director to edit and enhance the sequences. We then added a spoken sound track and sound effects such as mouse clicks.</P></BODY></HTML>
