<H2>Internet Security for Windows&nbsp;NT</H2><p>Microsoft is developing an Internet Security Framework to provide a public-key security architecture for Windows platforms. Public-key cryptography is the security technology that enables strong security for Enterprise and Internet communications. Microsoft's Internet Security Framework technologies include an Certificate Services, Secure Channel security provider that implements SSL/PCT protocols, the SET secure payment protocol for credit card transactions, and CryptoAPI version 2.o components for certificate management and administration.</P>
<p>The components of Microsoft's Internet Security Technologies are shown below.</P>

<P CLASS="cap"><B>Figure 6: Microsoft's Internet Security Framework</B></P>
<p>Microsoft's Internet Security Framework is based on industry standards for public-key security, including support for RSA Public Key Cipher, X.509 certificate formats, and PKCS standards.</P>
<p>The Windows&nbsp;NT 4.0 release includes the first components for using public-key security. The foundation includes the following components:</P>
<UL><LI><B>CryptoAPI version 1.0</B> provides programmer support for key generation and exchange, digital signatures, and data encryption using a provider architecture to support installable Cryptographic Service Providers.</LI><LI><B>Secure Channel</B> implementation of the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) version 2.0 and Private Communications Technology (PCT) version 1.0 public-key security protocols.</LI><LI><B>Authenticode&trade;</B> technology, a solution using digital signatures to verify the integrity of software downloaded from the Internet and identification of the software publisher.</LI></UL><p>Microsoft's Internet Security Framework builds on these components and provides additional functionality to support public-key security for Windows platforms, including Windows&nbsp;NT. Many of the Internet Security Framework components are used by Microsoft Internet Explorer and Internet Information Server. The new features of Microsoft's Internet Security Framework for the Windows&nbsp;NT Distributed Security Services Technology preview include:</P>
<UL><LI>Client Authentication with SSL 3.0 based on public-key certificates</LI><LI>Certificate Services for issuing certificates to Windows&nbsp;NT domain accounts</LI><LI>CryptoAPI version 2.0 features with support for X.509 certificates and PKCS standards</LI></UL><p>The next version of Windows&nbsp;NT security will use Internet standards for public-key security with features built into the operating system.</P></BODY></HTML>
