<h3>Alternate Sessions</H3><p>Wednesday's alternate sessions cover:</P>
<UL><LI><I>Viper Architectural Overview, Part 1(COM Components in Viper): </I>This session is designed for hardcore developers who want to understand more about issues related to COM components. Threading, class factories, management of instance state, and efficient allocation of component resources are all described. </LI><LI><I>Active Directory: The Universal Directory Service Interface:</I> Do you want to know about the single set of functions for accessing Directory Services from any vendor? Attend this session to hear the architect of Active Directory talk about the architecture and motivation behind Active Directory. Analyze a sample application to see how to use Active Directory functions to navigate the directory tree in any Directory Service and bind to an object. Learn how to create new object classes and add objects of that class to the DS. Find out how Active Directory can help you build powerful Internet and intranet applications.</LI><LI><I>Viper Architectural Overview, Part 2 (Resource Dispensers &amp; Resource Managers):</I> This session is for developers who are serious about low-level integration with Viper. We'll discuss the mechanisms used for sharing process-wide information in Resource Dispensers and explain the internals of the ODBC Resource Dispenser. Next, we'll provide an overview of how to integrate Resource Managers (for example database management systems) into Viper using the OLE Transactions interface. Finally, we'll sketch the Viper support for the X/Open XA interface for Resource Managers.</LI></UL></BODY></HTML>
