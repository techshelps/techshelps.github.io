<H2>Example: Migrating from Windows&nbsp;NT 4.0 to Next Generation Windows&nbsp;NT</H2><H3> </A>Initial State: Windows&nbsp;NT 3.5<I>x</I> / 4.0 Domain</H3><p>In this example, we will assume we have a Windows&nbsp;NT Domain with 3 domain controllers: one Primary Domain Controller and two Backup Domain Controllers (BCDs).</P>
<P><img src="39259.gif"></P>
<p></P>
<H3> </A>Beginning the Migration</H3><p>To begin the migration, we will install a new Domain Controller running next generation Windows&nbsp;NT and configure it to emulate a Windows&nbsp;NT 4.<I>x</I> Backup Domain Controller. Another option would be simply to upgrade one of the existing BDCs to next generation Windows&nbsp;NT, but for the purposes of this example we are taking the most conservative approach.</P>
<P><img src="39260.gif"></P>
<p>The new "BDC" receives a replicated copy of the Domain directory from the PDC. When we are confident of the stability of next generation Windows&nbsp;NT Domain Controller running in BDC emulation, we can promote it to be the Primary Domain Controller (PDC) for the domain.</P>
<P><img src="39261.gif"></P>
<p>By promoting next generation Windows&nbsp;NT Domain Controller to PDC we have made next generation Windows&nbsp;NT Directory Services the "master" copy of the domain directory. At this time we can begin performing all of the account maintenance in the domain using Next generation Windows&nbsp;NT graphical tools. The Windows&nbsp;NT 3.5<I>x</I> and 4.0 BDC's and the client systems in the domain are unaware of this change and continue to operate normally.</P>
<H3>Finishing the Migration</H3><p>Finally, we can upgrade each BDC to next generation Windows&nbsp;NT. When each BDC is converted, it becomes a peer of the PDC. Windows&nbsp;NT 4.0 replication is replaced by the multimaster next generation <BR>Windows&nbsp;NT replication.</P>
<P><img src="39262.gif"></P>
<p></P>
<p>When all remaining BDCs have been upgraded, the "mixed" domain has become a "pure" next generation domain and can be joined into a domain tree. Down-level client systems will continue to see the domain as a Windows&nbsp;NT 3.5<I>x</I> or 4.0 domain. Next generation clients will see the domain as a next generation domain and will be able to make full use of next generation Windows&nbsp;NT Directory Services capabilities. </P></BODY></HTML>
