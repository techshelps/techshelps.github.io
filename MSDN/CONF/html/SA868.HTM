<h3>Microsoft Word</H3><p>In Word, MAPI is hosted by the WordBasic language. In some ways, WordBasic is the most limited of all the versions of Basic. Limitations on passing strings and a lack of user-defined types necessitates the use of a "wrapper" DLL, WBMAPI.DLL, to implement mail functionality within Word. This DLL changes the MAPI interface to a form that WordBasic can understand. WBMAPI.DLL, in turn, communicates with MAPI.DLL.</P>
<p>WBMAPI.DLL adds several new functions to deal with attachments and recipients since WordBasic cannot manipulate user-defined types directly.</P>
<p>From the Word developer's point of view, a series of functions from WBMAPI.DLL are declared in the body of a WordBasic macro. Both WPMAPI.DLL and MAPI.DLL must be present to use these functions.</P>
<p>The full set of declarations and support routines are provided and described in the Word sample application described later in the paper.</P></BODY></HTML>
