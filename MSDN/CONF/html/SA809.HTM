<H2>What is BackOffice</H2><p>Microsoft&reg; BackOffice is an integrated family of server software built on the Windows&nbsp;NT&trade; operating system. This family is the core of an information network which provides traditional file and print services plus rich new network services on which you can build a new generation of information applications. These information applications are client-server solutions that help companies improve decision making and streamline business processes. They allow desktops to access and integrate information from a variety of sources with unparalleled ease and price/performance.</P>
<p>Since Bill Gates introduced the vision of <I>Information at Your Fingertips</I> at Comdex 1990, Microsoft has been focused on providing easier and more powerful ways to access and manipulate information. Microsoft BackOffice is the result of over four years of work to realize this vision. </P>
<p>Because the unique open architecture of Microsoft BackOffice is designed to integrate easily with a wide range of existing systems, new services and capabilities can be added with a minimum of difficulty. It offers a powerful, secure, reliable, and open infrastructure to connect the enterprise.</P>
<p>Whether companies are developing new client-server business applications or downsizing existing applications, Microsoft BackOffice can be used as the hub of an information network to build custom solutions. It can also be used to add new functionality to existing minicomputer and mainframe systems and to evolve these to pure client-server or distributed applications as business needs dictate. In addition, Microsoft BackOffice provides small companies a way to build business applications that previously could not be considered because of expense and complexity.</P>
<p>BackOffice is the information server on which you build information solutions that form the hub of a new kind of network &mdash; the information network. Information networks improve business decisions and streamline business processes.</P></BODY></HTML>
