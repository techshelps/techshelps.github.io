<h3>Cluster Application Development</H3><p>Microsoft development tools will be enhanced to support the easy creation of cluster-aware applications. Facilities will be provided for automatic fail-over of applications. It is also important to note that not all server applications will need to be cluster-aware to take advantage of cluster benefits. Applications that build on top of cluster-aware core applications, such as large commercial database packages (such as an accounting or financial database application on top of SQL Server), will benefit automatically from cluster enhancements made to the underlying application (such as SQL Server). Many server applications that take advantage of database services, client/server connection interaction, Internet/intranet web publishing, and file and print services will benefit from clustering technology without application changes. </P>
