<h1><a name="__response_file_command"></a>@ Response File Command</h1>
<p>
<b>midl @</b><i>response_file</i>
<dl>
<dt>
<i>response_file</i></dt>
<dd>
Specifies the name of a response file. The response filename must immediately follow the <b>@</b> character. No white space is allowed between the <b>@</b> character and the response filename.
</dd>
</dl>
<h4>Examples</h4>
<pre><code>midl @midl.rsp 
 
midl /pack 4 @midl1.rsp /env win32 @midl2.rsp itf.idl 
 </code></pre>
<h4>Remarks</h4>
<p>
As an alternative to placing all the options associated with a switch on the command line, the MIDL compiler accepts response files that contain switches and arguments.</p>
<p>
A response file is a text file containing one or more MIDL compiler command-line options. Unlike a command line, a response file allows multiple lines of options and filenames. This is important on systems such as MS-DOS, which limit the number of characters in the command line.</p>
<p>
Options in a response file are interpreted as if they are present at that place in the MIDL command line.</p>
<p>
Each argument in a response file must begin and end on the same line. The backslash character ("\") cannot be used to concatenate lines.</p>
<p>
When it is part of a quoted string in the response file, the backslash character can only be used before another backslash (\or before a double quotation mark character ("). When it is not part of a quoted string, the backslash character can only be used before a double quotation mark character.</p>
<p>
MIDL supports command-line arguments that include one or more response files combined with other command-line switches.</p>
<p>
The MIDL compiler does not support nested response files.</p>
