<p>
As an alternative to placing all the options on the command line, the MIDL compiler accepts response files that contain switches and arguments. A response file is a text file containing one or more MIDL compiler command-line options. Unlike a command line, a response file allows multiple lines of options and filenames. This is important on systems such as MS-DOS that have a hard-coded limit on the length of a command line. You can specify a MIDL response file as:</p>
<p>
<b>midl @</b><i>filename</i>
<dl>
<dt>
<i>filename</i></dt>
<dd>
Specifies the name of the response file. The response filename must immediately follow the @ character. No white space is allowed between the @ character and the response filename.
</dd>
</dl>
<p>
Options in a response file are interpreted as if they were present at that place in the MIDL command line.</p>
<p>
Each argument in a response file must begin and end on the same line. You cannot use the backslash character (\) to concatenate lines. </p>
<p>
MIDL supports command-line arguments that include one or more response files, combined with other command-line switches: </p>
<pre><code>midl -pack 4 @midl1.rsp -env win32 @midl2.rsp itf.idl
 </code></pre>
<p>
The MIDL compiler does not support nested response files.</p>
