<P>The Microsoft&#174; NetMeeting&#153; 2.1 Software Developers Kit (SDK) provides application programming interfaces (APIs) that enable authors and developers to integrate conferencing capabilities into other applications using C, C++, or Visual Basic&#174;. For example, developers can extend the functionality of NetMeeting to integrate:
<UL><LI>A business-card exchange capability.
<LI>A collaborative x-ray viewing program.
<LI>Conferencing capabilities into applications using macro-based scripting languages.
</UL>
<P>The <A HREF="netm0007.htm#netm_0008000000000000" TARGET="TEXT">SDK Usage Examples</A> section provides suggestions for exploiting the robust capabilities of the NetMeeting SDK to improve internal business operations, interaction with customers, education, and entertainment.
<P>In addition, the NetMeeting SDK includes an ActiveX&#153; control for conferencing, which Web site creators can use with ActiveX Scripting solutions (such as JScript&#153; and Visual Basic&#174; Scripting Edition) to add conferencing functionality directly to their Web sites.

<P>For more information about the NetMeeting SDK, visit the <A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/netmeeting/authors/" TARGET="_top">NetMeeting Authors &amp; Developers site</A>.

<P>The NetMeeting Resource Kit, available at the <A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/isapi/redir.dll?PRD=netmtg&Ar=news/" TARGET="_top">Microsoft NetMeeting Web site</A>, is an invaluable resource for implementing NetMeeting and utilizing the NetMeeting SDK.


<P>The NetMeeting SDK can also be used in a number of ways to open new market opportunities for third-party software developers, solution providers, and Web site professionals. These include:
<UL><LI>Integrating real-time multipoint data-conferencing capabilities into existing conferencing solutions, such as video conferencing.
<LI>Developing custom conferencing solutions to enhance service offerings.
<LI>Integrating conferencing functionality into Web pages.
<LI>Extending the features of NetMeeting by building a conferencing-aware application that runs on each meeting participant's computer and uses NetMeeting to send and receive data. 
</UL>
<P>The key features of the NetMeeting 2.1 SDK include:
<P>
<UL><LI>A Component Object Model (COM) interface that enables developers to add NetMeeting functionality to their applications, manage calls, replace the NetMeeting User Interface, and write applications that work within a NetMeeting conference.
<LI>A complete Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) client API for accessing all the capabilities of the Internet Locator Server (ILS) directory used by NetMeeting. Application developers can use the client API for NetMeeting applications or for any application in need of the dynamic storage facilities provided by ILS servers.
<LI>Codec installation for enabling vendors of audio and video codecs to install their products, and for making NetMeeting leverage them in calls.
<LI>New purpose-specific samples and tutorials that make it simple to learn the ins and outs of programming collaborative applications.
<LI>Enhanced documentation enabling you to access information quicker and easier.
<LI>A Frequently Asked Questions section that addresses the issues we've been asked about the most.
</UL>
