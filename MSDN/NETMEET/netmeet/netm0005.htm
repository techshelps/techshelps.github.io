<P>NetMeeting features support for industry standards set by the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) and the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), as well as other standards organizations.
<P>Standards enable products from different vendors to communicate. The broad industry support for the standards used by NetMeeting (over 60 leading vendors have announced products and services that work with and enhance use of NetMeeting) enables you to connect and communicate with products from different vendors just as people using different makes and models of telephones can communicate.
<P>Among the standards NetMeeting supports are the ITU H.323 standard for audio and video conferencing, the ITU T.120 standard for multipoint data conferencing, and the IETF LDAP standard for directory services. Overview information for these standards is provided in the sections below. For those seeking greater detail, links to conferencing standards organizations are also provided.

<H2><A NAME="standards_0006000101000000">The H.323 Standard</A></H2>
<P>H.323 is an ITU standard that specifies how terminals (PCs), equipment, and services for multimedia communicate over networks that do not provide a guaranteed quality of service (such as the internet). H.323 terminals and equipment can carry real-time video, voice, and data, or any combination of these elements. Products that use H.323 for audio and video let you connect and communicate with other people over the Internet, just as people using different makes and models of telephones can communicate using the telephone. 

<P>H.323 is actually a series of standards that define:
<UL><LI>How calls get set up.
<LI>The capability negotiation (the process of getting two machines to communicate with each other) framework.
<LI>How data is transmitted on the wire.
<LI>Default audio and video codecs (audio and video codecs encode and decode input/output from audio and video sources for communicating between nodes).
</UL>
<P>For low bandwidth use, the H.323 standard specifies standard codecs for audio (G.723) and for video (H.263) that enable H.323 products to send and receive voice and video images. H.323 also specifies use of the T.120 standard for data conferencing. More than 120 leading companies in the industry publicly announced their intent to support and implement H.323 in their products and services. This broad support establishes H.323 as the leading solution for audio and video conferencing over the Internet.

Support for RTP and RTCP enables the receiving node to synchronize the received packets in the proper order so the user hears or sees the information correctly.

<H2><A NAME="standards_0006000103000000">Lightweight Directory Access Protocol</A></H2>
<P>The Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP), as its name implies, is a standard method for application clients to query and access information stored on directory servers over TCP/IP connections. Typically, a published directory contains data about people or other entities that users can access. The most common examples of paper-based directories are the yellow and white pages of telephone books, which enable a customer to look up the telephone number for a person or company. An example of an electronic directory is a published e-mail address book, which enables an e-mail user to look up a person's e-mail address and other details, such as office location and internal phone extension.
<P>LDAP is derived from the X.500 global directory and the Directory Access Protocol (DAP), a complex access protocol for performing a wide variety of directory functions. LDAP is a lightweight offspring of DAP, shedding the unnecessary features of client-server access scenarios. The result of the weight loss is LDAP, a protocol that greatly simplifies implementation, reduces software complexity, improves performance, and in the process, encourages wider adoption.
