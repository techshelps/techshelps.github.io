Binding</i></b></font></a></p>

<p><font size="2">If your control supports simple data binding,
verify that the <i>Control Source</i> and <i>Locked </i>properties
are shown on the <i>Data</i> tab of the merged property sheet for
the control. You should also verify that these properties work
correct when the control is bound to columns of various data
types. You can check the scenarios such as dirtying the current
record using the control, or through the UI of the form by
changing the value through another control (say a textbox) which
is also bound to the same field in the form&#146;s recordset. Try
committing the record or canceling the change to the dirty
record. Verify that binding is working correctly when the user
places the control in the details section of a bound report and
binds the control to a field in the report&#146;s recordset. When
the report is previewed, the control should show each value for
the bound value as the underlying data for that record. Access
limits this case to reports since for forms the user cannot set
the <i>Default View </i>property to <i>Continuous Forms </i>when
the form contains an ActiveX Control, sub-form, or bound chart. </font></p>
