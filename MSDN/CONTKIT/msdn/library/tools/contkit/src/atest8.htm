<p><font size="2">Another, relatively common bug can appear after
the control is inserted onto the form or report. Resize the
control, then browse the form via <i>View | FormView</i>. Note
the size of the control, then switch back to design view and note
the size of the control again. Repeat these steps: resize the
control, and switching back to browse view. The control may
appear to look like it was not notified that the property has
changed and that the control is dirty. To see an example of this,
try this with the Microsoft Web Browser Control from IE 3.0 or IE
3.01. Verify that your control is persisting appropriate property
changes in design correctly, and marking the control as dirty.</font></p>

<p><font size="2">The bottom line is to ensure that the control
persists properties that are modified at design-time and not
those modified at run-time. This not only includes when the form
is finally saved and the form and control information persisted
out to a jet table, but also when switching between design and
browse modes since there is a sort of persistence in memory of
the cached changes occurring at that time as well.</font></p>
