State</i></b></font></a></p>

<p><font size="2">When a control is inserted into an Access form
or report, it is inserted in Passive Design Mode (this term is
from the Visual C++ tool ActiveX Control Test Container). In
other words, the control is not UI Active, and therefore not
responding to UI interaction or firing events. To get a better
idea of this, insert the Calendar Control that ships with Access
into the ActiveX Control Test Container. On the <i>Options </i>menu
you will see two different modes listed: Passive Container Mode,
and Simulated Design Mode. The later is the default, and
therefore the most commonly used when testing a control in this
tool. However, test your control using Passive Container Mode as
well, since this simulates more closely how the control behaves
in design view of an Access form or Report.</font></p>
