of Access Forms and Reports</i></b></font></a></p>

<p><font size="2">Make sure that your control paints correctly
when the Metafile representation of the control&#146;s UI is
requested. Insert your control on an Access form or report and
Print Preview to ensure it looks correct. Again, this should be
similar to inserting your control into the ActiveX Control Test
Container (the tool that ships with Visual C++) in Passive
Container Mode, and then choosing <i>Edit | Draw Metafile</i>
from the menus.</font></p>

<p><font size="2">Although it is a similar code path you may want
to verify that actually printing the form or report with your
control on it looks correct as well. Obviously, if your control
is invisible at runtime, it should not be painting when the form
is browsed via <i>View | FormView</i>, or when printed or
previewed. It also should not invalidate the region on the form
or report surface where it is located either. It should not be
visible at all.</font></p>
