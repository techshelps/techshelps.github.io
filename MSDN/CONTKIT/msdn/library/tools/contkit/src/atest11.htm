Control Property Pages</i></b></font></a></p>

<p><font size="2">In form or report design, the user can
double-click on a control to invoke the default verb for an OLE
object. In the case of <i>most</i> custom controls, this default
verb is to show the controls property pages. Try this for your
control. Create a new form, insert the control, then double click
on the control. This isn&#146;t the case in all control
containers. For example, in Visual Basic you&#146;ll notice that
you&#146;ll always get to the default code method behind the
object by doing this. In Access, you see the property pages (or
the result of whatever the default OLE verb is for the object).
For controls that don&#146;t support property pages you&#146;ll
see a generic OLE error &quot;The operation on the Foo Control
object failed.&quot; It&#146;s not required that controls supply
their own property pages. However, if they do supply one or more
pages, make sure they work correctly. Since Access merges all of
the control's properties into its property sheet used by all of
the Access intrinsic controls, you&#146;ll still be able to set
and view these properties through the UI. The Microsoft Forms 2.0
controls (that ship with Office &#146;97) and the Microsoft Web
Browser Control are examples of controls that don&#146;t supply
property pages via a UI, but rely on the host to expose a UI.</font></p>

<p><font size="2">Another way to invoke the control's property
pages is to right-click and choose the name of the control on
this pop-up menu. On the next pop-up menu you will see a list of
the OLE verbs available and a <i>Convert&#133;</i> menu item.
Selecting the <i>Properties</i> menu shows the property pages for
the control. You should try the <i>Convert</i> menu to ensure
that the control doesn't cause any problems when this code is
exercised, even though the only available option will be to
convert the control to its own type. This feature is more useful
for intrinsic Access controls to morph controls like listboxes to
textboxes, combo-boxes, or pictures.</font></p>
