<p><font size="2">This document is a compilation of tips, common
bugs, and interesting information relating to using and testing
ActiveX Controls in Access &#146;97. Specifically, it calls
attention to common bugs that may appear in ActiveX Controls when
hosted in Microsoft Access. This is not a full test plan or
comprehensive guide to everything that is tested with respect to
ActiveX Controls and Access as a control container. Rather, it is
an overview that highlights common mistakes, anomalies, and bugs
found in ActiveX Controls as they interact with Access. It will
also provide some insight into how Access interacts with controls
in specific cases and some pitfalls to avoid when developing your
control. This will improve the quality of interaction between
ActiveX Controls and Access by arming the control developer with
knowledge about scenarios that may be troublesome.</font></p>
