the Clipboard</i></b></font></a></p>

<p><font size="2">Another common bug with ActiveX Controls is
when they are copied and pasted using the clipboard. A simple way
to ensure the mechanism is working for your control is to create
a new form, copy the control to the clipboard, and then paste the
control back to the form. Next, select both controls, copy them
to the clipboard, and paste them back. Also, try pasting the
controls using PasteSpecial as each type that is listed in the
dialog. Be aware that you will get an error, &quot;You can&#146;t
paste the object as the type specified,&quot; if you have written
the control using the BaseCtl framework and have not implemented
the IDataObject interface. The PasteSpecial as the other two
types available will work however. If you are developing your
control using VB 5.0 or MFC, the framework supplies a default
implementation of this for you.</font></p>

<p><font size="2">PasteSpecial as type picture is often missed
(or omitted) by many control developers, but can leave a rather
unattractive white rectangle on the form or report. This is not
terribly important if the control is not going to be used in this
fashion. However, I believe this is the same code that is
responsible for many controls looking unprofessional when print
previewed since the metafile representation of the control is
used, so it may be worth while to add it. This is discussed later
in this document.</font></p>

<p><font size="2">It&#146;s also interesting to try using <i>Edit
| Undo</i> after a paste of multiple controls, as well as after
the other operations listed above.</font></p>
