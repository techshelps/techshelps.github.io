Key Handling</i></b></font></a><font face="Arial"><b><i> </i></b></font></p>

<p><font size="2">If the control supports mnemonics, make sure
they work correctly when the form with additional controls is
browsed and the user sends the appropriate accelerator key. For
example, if you are writing an ActiveX tab control with
customizable captions for each tab, the user could enter in
&quot;&amp;Foo&quot; for the first tab, and &quot;B&amp;ar&quot;
for the second tab. Verify that sending an Alt-F and Alt-A switch
the tab selection in the control. Even if the focus in a textbox
control on the form, the ActiveX Control will get first crack at
handling the accelerator before Access does to allow say for
instance the <i>File</i> menu commandbar to drop down in the
Alt-F case. Also, arrow keys in both the Tab Control and the
Calendar Control may perform tasks such as switching tabs or
moving the selected day in the control. Verify the keys that the
control should handle, and those that are not handled are passed
on to the container. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">You should also verify that if your control has
set any of the miscellaneous control bits like
acts-like-default-button, that this behavior is working for your
control when interacting with other controls on the Access form.</font></p>
