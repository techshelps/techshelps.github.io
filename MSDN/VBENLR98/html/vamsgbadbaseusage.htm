<p>
You cannot use the name of a base class by itself. This error has the following causes and solutions:
<ul type=disc>
<li>
You tried to use the name of a base class by itself without making clear that you were trying to access the base class' default member.<p class=tl>
Place the base-class name within parentheses to indicate you want to access the default member.</P></li>
<li>
You used the base-class name in an expression but the member you were trying to access was ambiguously specified.<p class=tl>
Use a disambiguator ( for example, an exclamation point) between the base-class name and the member you are interested in.</P></li>
<li>
You used the base-class name in a <b>Set</b> statement as though it contained a reference to the class.<p class=tl>
Use the base-class name to retrieve a reference for example, using GetObject.</P></li>
</ul>
