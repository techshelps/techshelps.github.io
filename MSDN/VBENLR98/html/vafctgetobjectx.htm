<h2><a name="vafctgetobjectx"></a>GetObject Function Example</h2>
<p>
This example uses the <b>GetObject</b> function to get a reference to a specific Microsoft Excel worksheet (<code>MyXL</code>). It uses the worksheet's <b>Application</b> property to make Microsoft Excel visible, to close it, and so on. Using two API calls, the DetectExcel <b>Sub</b> procedure looks for Microsoft Excel, and if it is running, enters it in the Running Object Table. The first call to <b>GetObject</b> causes an error if Microsoft Excel isn't already running. In the example, the error causes the ExcelWasNotRunning flag to be set to True. The second call to <b>GetObject</b> specifies a file to open. If Microsoft Excel isn't already running, the second call starts it and returns a reference to the worksheet represented by the specified file, mytest.xls. The file must exist in the specified location; otherwise, the Visual Basic error Automation error is generated. Next the example code makes both Microsoft Excel and the window containing the specified worksheet visible. Finally, if there was no previous version of Microsoft Excel running, the code uses the <b>Application</b> object's <b>Quit</b> method to close Microsoft Excel. If the application was already running, no attempt is made to close it. The reference itself is released by setting it to <b>Nothing</b>.</p>
