<H3>Dynamic Standard Cursors</H3><P CLASS="t">In a dynamic standard cursor, committed changes that are made by anyone and uncommitted changes that are made by the cursor owner become visible the next time the user fetches data. Changes include insertions and deletions, as well as changes in order and membership. (Deleted rows do not leave holes.) Dynamic standard cursors cannot use a GROUP BY or HAVING clause. Dynamic standard cursors can use an ORDER BY clause in SQL Server version 6.5, but only if the table has a unique index.</P>
<P CLASS="t">Specify dynamic standard cursors by issuing the SET SCROLLOPTION DYNAMIC statement. This statement sets the keyset equal to the size of the fetch buffer, which is one row in Embedded SQL. Given a results set of N rows, the keyset and the fetch buffer are identical. They both contain a single row, which moves forward through the results set as each FETCH statement is executed.</P>
