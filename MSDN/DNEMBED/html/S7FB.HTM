<ul>
    <li>To build an Embedded SQL application for the
        Windows&nbsp;NT or the Windows&nbsp;95 operating systems,
        you must compile the application on a computer that is
        running Windows&nbsp;NT or Windows&nbsp;95. </li>
    <li>To build an Embedded SQL application for the 16-bit
        Windows operating system, you must compile the
        application on a computer that is running MS-DOS or
        16-bit Windows. </li>
    <li>To build an Embedded SQL application for the MS-DOS
        operating system, you must compile the application on a
        computer that is running MS-DOS version 6.22 or later.</li>
</ul>

<p class="t">The following illustration shows how application
code that contains Embedded SQL statements is compiled,
precompiled, and linked, and how the application operates during
run time.</p>

<p class="t">When you compile an Embedded SQL application, the
general process of creating an executable program is the same
regardless of which operating system you are compiling for. The
specific procedures for precompiling, compiling, and linking
Embedded SQL applications for Windows&nbsp;NT, Windows&nbsp;95,
16-bit Windows, and MS-DOS are described later in this chapter. </p>
