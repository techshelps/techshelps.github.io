To a Windows®-based Terminal Server client, the Terminal Server is the local computer. Consequently, devices such as disk drives and printers attached to the Terminal Server appear as local devices to a Terminal Server client. In contrast, drives and printers attached to a client terminal appear to be remote devices. To access a device attached to a client terminal, you must use the UNC name of the client share or printer, just as you would any other remote share or printer. </p>
<p>
The initial release of Windows-based Terminal Server does not support applications that send output directly to serial, parallel, and sound ports attached to the client terminal. In other words, the serial, parallel, and sound ports attached to the client terminal are not treated as local ports. However, you can use the built-in redirectors to do the appropriate "net share" and "net use" commands to share these devices. </p>
