<p>
<span style=color:#FF0000>[This is preliminary documentation and subject to change.]</span> </p>
<p>
Microsoft® Windows®-based Terminal Server is similar to a terminal-based, centralized host, or mainframe, environment in which multiple terminals connect to a host computer. Each terminal provides a conduit for input and output between a user and the host computer. A user can log on at a terminal, and then run applications on the host computer, accessing files, databases, network resources, and so on. Each terminal session is independent, with the host operating system managing conflicts between multiple users contending for shared resources.</p>
<p>
The primary difference between Windows-based Terminal Server and the traditional mainframe environment is that the dumb terminals in a mainframe environment only provide character-based input and output. A Windows-based Terminal provides a complete graphical user interface including a Windows desktop and support for a variety of input devices, such as a keyboard and mouse.</p>
<p>
In the Terminal Server environment, an application runs entirely on the Terminal Server. The Terminal Server client performs no local processing of application software. The Terminal Server transmits the graphical user interface to the client. The client transmits the user's input back to the server. </p>
