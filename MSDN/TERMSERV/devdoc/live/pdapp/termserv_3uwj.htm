<p>
Multiple users can be logged on simultaneously to a Windows®-based Terminal Server. Consequently, it is not safe to assume that the computer name or the IP address assigned to the computer are associated with a single user. This differs from a traditional Windows NT system, in which only one user is logged on at a time. </p>
<p>
Applications that use the computer name or IP address for licensing or as a means of identifying an iteration of the application on the network will not work properly in the Terminal Server environment because the server's computer name or IP address can be associated with many users.</p>
<p>
In the Terminal Server environment, each client terminal or terminal emulator has a separate IP address and computer name, but these addresses and names are visible only to the Terminal Server. Applications can detect only the IP address of the Terminal Server. Similarly, the <object id=alink_1 type="application/x-oleobject"
