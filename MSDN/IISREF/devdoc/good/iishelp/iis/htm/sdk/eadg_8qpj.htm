<p>
Open Internet standards, coupled with the explosive popularity of the Web, have changed the architecture of distributed computing forever. The basic language of the Web, HTML, has developed into an ideal language for representing the elements of the user interface. Cross-platform support for scripting languages and Java applets makes it possible to combine dynamic elements with static text for a more interactive user experience. Embedded ActiveX components provide another level of interactivity, and can be used as navigation controls or to add multimedia to Web applications. Web technologies aren't solely for use on the Internet, however. They have been adapted for use by businesses to: 
<ul>
<li>
Create an environment for component-based development. </li>
<li>
Enable distribution of applications throughout an enterprise. </li>
<li>
Customize and create new applications quickly. </li>
<li>
Take part in intranet-enabled database processing. </li>
<li>
Add transaction processing to Web applications. </li>
<li>
Manage resources and enable remote system administration. </li>
</ul>
<p>
This section outlines the technological advances that brought dramatic change to programming paradigms, and how this change will shape the way you will build applications in the future.
