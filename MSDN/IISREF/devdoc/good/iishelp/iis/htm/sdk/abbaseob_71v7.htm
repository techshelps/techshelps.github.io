<h3><a name="_k2_reserved_identifiers_and_user_types"></a>Reserved Identifiers and User Types</h3>
<p>
Each data entry in the metabase is assigned a unique identifier. An identifier is a DWORD containing a number that uniquely identifies the data in the metabase. Identifiers used by IIS are assigned from a pool of reserved numbers. The first 32K is reserved by the system for IIS data and the second 32K is reserved for Microsoft® FrontPage™ data. If you create identifiers in the metabase, use identifier numbers greater than 65535 (0x0000ffff) to avoid conflicts with current or future system data.</p>
<p>
Each identifier is also assigned a user type, which is a DWORD that specifies how the data is used. Current IIS user types include IIS_MD_UT_SERVER for server configuration parameters, IIS_MD_UT_FILE for file and directory properties, IIS_MD_UT_WAM for web application management, and ASP_MD_UT_APP for ASP application configuration. User types enable you to classify your identifiers by application. You must assign a user type to each identifier you create in the metabase, although each identifier is not required to have a unique user type. The numbers from 0 to 2,000 are reserved for current and future system user types. User types you create must be above 2,000 to avoid conflicts with current and future system user types. </p>
<p>
You can use the user type to filter data requested from a key. For example, the <b>GetAllData</b> method has a parameter, <i>dwUserType</i>, you can use to specify that only data of a certain user type is to be returned. For example, if this parameter is set to IIS_MD_UT_SERVER during the method call, only data related to the server will be returned. </p>
<p>
<b>Note</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;Metabase identifiers must be unique, but multiple identifiers can have the same user type and data type. </p>
