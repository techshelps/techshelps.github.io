<h2><a name="_k2_about_web_application_management"></a>About Web Application Management</h2>
<p>
A Web application is composed of script and component files within a directory structure boundary. The application directory structure must be associated with a Web server, and the structure must be mirrored in the <a href="aaadmin_7h9h.htm"><b>IIS Metabase</b></a>. You can use the <b>Internet Service Manager</b> user interface, the <a href="aoiisao_2kfn.htm"><b>IIS Admin Objects</b></a> with ASPscripts, or the <a href="abbaseob_41x0.htm"><b>IIS Admin Base Object</b></a> with C++ to establish your application's directory structure in the metabase. Every file and directory subordinate to your application's starting point directory will be included in its boundary, except for those directories and files that are contained in a previously defined application. </p>
<p>
After you have established your application's directory structure in the metabase, you can use the IIS Admin Objects to create an application definition package that IIS and MTS use to manage the execution of the application. Additional methods are available to delete or unload the application, or to retrieve its status. You can also use special methods to disable an application definition package while retaining the definition, so you can rename the application, or move or copy it to another location in the metabase and then enable its definition package again. </p>
<p>
You can find iwamreg.h and other relevant header files in the \inetpub\iissamples\sdk\include directory. </p>
