<p>
To take advantage of IIS custom extensions, your program must register itself as an in-process COM interface, and you must place a subkey named by its CLSID in the registry under the key specified by IISADMIN_EXTENSIONS_REG_KEY. IISADMIN will co-create the interface and call your <b>Initialize</b> and <b>EnumDcomCLSIDs</b> methods when the service starts, and your <b>Terminate</b> method when the service terminates. Your program provides DCOM CLSIDs that IISADMIN registers and stores in a list in a metabase property where they are available until IISADMIN terminates IIS services. </p>
<p>
The thread on which these are called is initialized as COINIT_MULTITHREADED. The <a href="abbaseob_41x0.htm"><b>IIS Admin Base Object</b></a> interface, <b>IMSAdminBase</b>, will be available during these calls to provide access to the <a href="aaadmin_7h9h.htm"><b>IIS Metabase</b></a>. </p>
