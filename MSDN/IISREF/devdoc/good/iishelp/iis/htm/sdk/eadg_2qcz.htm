<p>
Remote Data Service (RDS) replaces the Advanced Data Connector (ADC), which is now considered obsolete. In particular, the ADC remoting functionality (the ability to manipulate and modify sets of records on the client) has been integrated into ADO as RDS. Client-side RDS components send queries to the Web server. The server-side RDS components process these requests and send them to the DBMS via a business object. The DBMS responds to the request, sending back the data. The RDS components on the Web server transform that data into an ADO Recordset object. The data is parsed for transport to the client and sent back across the network to the client computer where it may be displayed in data-aware controls, such as a text or combo box, which are bound to the data by the <b>AdvancedDataControl</b> object. One <b>AdvancedDataControl</b> can channel data to many data-aware controls.</p>
