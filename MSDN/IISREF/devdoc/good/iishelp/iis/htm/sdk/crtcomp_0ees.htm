<p>
You can implement your component using any development environment that is suitable for creating COM components. There are, however, some differences in how different environments approach this procedure. This section briefly outlines the approaches to implementation taken by <a href="crtcomp_5ueb.htm"><b>Visual Basic</b></a>, <a href="crtcomp_4lsv.htm"><b>Visual J++</b></a> <a href="crtcomp_4lgf.htm"><b>Visual C++</b></a>. More information on implementation can be found through the section titled <a href="crtcomp_9rar.htm"><b>Additional Resources on Creating Components</b></a>. </p>
<p>
You should implement your server component as a DLL (in-process) server. Because you implement your component as a DLL, it will run in the same process as the Web application that contains the ASP script that creates the component instance. Running a component in-process with applications provides superior performance to out-of-process servers. </p>
<p>
If you implement your component as an out-of-process server there are several issues which you should consider. These issues are discussed in the Advanced Web Application Development topic, <a href="eadg_07u6.htm">Simplifying Development with Process Isolation</a>.</p>
<p>
If you have trouble registering components on Windows NT Server and Windows NT Workstation, you may be using the wrong version of Regsvr32.exe. Use the version that is installed with Internet Information Server or Personal Web Server. By default, this file is installed in C:\Winnt\System32\Inetsrv.</p>
