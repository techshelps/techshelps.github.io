<h2><a name="_k2_about_the_iis_admin_objects"></a>About the IIS Admin Objects</h2>
<p>
The IIS Admin Objects (IISAO) are COM objects that your ASP script or custom application can use to change IIS configuration values stored in the <a href="aaadmin_7h9h.htm"><b>IIS Metabase</b></a>. For example, metabase properties <b>AccessRead</b>, <b>AccessWrite</b>, <b>AccessExecute</b>, and other file and directory access permissions used by IIS are stored in the metabase; you can efficiently set these permissions for one or many files and directories with a simple ASP script.</p>
<p>
Individual IIS Admin Objects correspond to keys in the metabase and are addressed by their paths within the metabase. Each object has properties and each property corresponds to a property in the metabase. Modifying an IIS Admin Object property changes the corresponding value of a metabase property, enabling you to configure individual elements of IIS such as the Computer, FTP server, or Web server. Because of the hierarchical structure of the metabase and its property inheritance feature, you can easily configure properties for a single file, a single server, all Web servers, all FTP servers, or the common properties of many other groups of objects </p>
<p>
The IIS Admin Objects also implement properties and methods of the Microsoft® Active Directory Services Interface (ADSI) specification, so the IIS Admin Objects together implement an ADSI namespace provider for IIS. This provides a common set of address paths, properties, and methods for your program to use. </p>

The <a href="aoiisao_6pkp.htm"><b>Object Hierarchy</b></a> topic describes the relationship of the IIS Admin Objects to the metabase and how you address these objects in your program.</li>
<li>
The <a href="aoiisao_2ek3.htm"><b>ADSI Features</b></a> topic describes how the IIS Admin Objects implement common properties and methods that you can use.</li>
