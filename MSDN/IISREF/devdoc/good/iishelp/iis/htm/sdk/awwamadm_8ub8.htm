<p>
You can use the <b>IWamAdmin </b>interface with your C++ programs to manage your Web applications. This interface provides the same functionality as the Automation methods available in the IIS Admin Objects. You can use the <b>IWamAdmin</b> interface to create Web applications for in-process or out-of-process execution, and to reconfigure them from in-process to out-of-process or the reverse. You can also retrieve the status of your applications and unload applications running out-of-process. </p>
<p>
<b>IWamAdmin</b> also enables<b> </b>you to delete applications, which removes the application definitions but does not remove the directories and files that compose the application. You can use special interface methods to mark applications as deleted so that you can move, copy, or rename them in the metabase, and later restore them to application status. </p>
