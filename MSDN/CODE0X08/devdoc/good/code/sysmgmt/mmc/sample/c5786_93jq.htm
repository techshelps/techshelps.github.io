<pre><code>Microsoft Management Console SDK Release Notes <br> <br>******Sample****** <br>In the &lt;SDK Root&gt;\samples\sysmgmt\mmc directory is the MMC snapin sample. <br>The sample requires ATL (ActiveX Template Library).  If you have the Platform  <br>SDK you can build the sample by type "nmake -a" or "nmake -a nodebug=1" in <br>the sample directory or you can load the snapin.mak in to Visual C++.   <br> <br>Be sure to install the MMC runtime before trying to test the sample. Once <br>you have MMC installed and built the sample, you can test the sample by <br>running "mmc.exe" and then choosing "Add/Remove Snap-in..." from the console <br>menu.  After adding the sample, you should have a "Files" node with Company  <br>and User data. <br> <br>******Extensions****** <br>Extensions are implemented in the sample application included with the  <br>MMC SDK but they are not discussed in the SDK documentation. This is  <br>a temporary situation and more information will be available soon. <br> <br>******MMC Programming Tutorial****** <br>We are currently working on a tutorial that discusses implementing  <br>the MMC's COM interfaces and other programming elements in a <br>"how-to" way. The tutorial will provide other helpful information  <br>and sample code to simplify the task of developing a snap-in. It will <br>be available within the near future. <br> <br>******Other Helpful Documentation****** <br>The MMC SDK Overview contains suggestions for finding additional <br>programming information that relates to developing snap-ins.  <br>In terms of convenience, you will find virtually everything you need <br>to know about COM and Win32 in the Microsoft Platform SDK. Topics  <br>like structured storage and data objects are beyond the scope of the  <br>MMC SDK but are covered thoroughly in the material available there. <br> <br>******Our website****** <br>The current MMC executable and the most recent MMC-related information <br>is available on our website. You can reach us at the following URL: <br> <br>http://www.microsoft.com/management </code></pre>
