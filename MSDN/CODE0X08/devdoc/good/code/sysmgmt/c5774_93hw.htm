<pre><code>The \Mssdk\Samples\SysMgmt directory contains samples for the following  <br>Platform SDK components: <br> <br>* Microsoft Management Console (MMC) <br>* Task Scheduler <br>* Windows 95 Migration DLLs for Windows NT 5 setup (beta) <br>* Microsoft System Management Server <br>* Setup and Microsoft Installer Service (beta) <br> <br>The build environment (headers, libraries, and minimum build <br>tools) for the Platform SDK must be installed in order to build <br>any of the samples in the \Mssdk\Samples directory. The build <br>environment can be installed from the readme.htm or by running <br>setup.exe on the root of the Platform SDK compact disc. The most <br>recent version of the build environment is also available at <br>http://www.microsoft.com/msdn/sdk/platform.htm. <br> <br>Some components may also require you to install runtimes, depending <br>on the platform on which you are trying to run the sample. <br>Redistributables are available in the \Mssdk\Redist subdirectory <br>on the Platform SDK compact disc. <br> <br>Documentation for the components listed above can be installed <br>from the Platform SDK compact disc, or can be viewed online at <br>http://premium.microsoft.com/msdn/library/. This is a free service; <br>registration is necessary. <br> <br>If you do not see any subdirectories in the \Mssdk\Samples\SysMgmt  <br>node, you'll need to install the Setup and Systems Management components  <br>from the Platform SDK compact disc or download and install them <br>from http://www.microsoft.com/msdn/sdk/platform.htm.  <br> <br></code></pre>
