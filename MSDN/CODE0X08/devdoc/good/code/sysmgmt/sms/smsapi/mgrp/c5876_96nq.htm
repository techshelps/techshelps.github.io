<pre><code>SMS API Example: creation of machine group (mgrp.exe) <br>    ===================================================== <br> <br>This sample shows how to create a machine group using the SMS API. <br> <br>Currently the API only allows top-level machine groups to be created, in <br>other words you cannot a) modify existing machine groups, and b) you <br>cannot create nested machine groups. <br> <br>There has been one addition to the API set in order to enable this; this is <br>the SmsDupFolder API. <br> <br>The sample opens a machine container, and a machine group container. <br>From the machine container we select the machines that we want inserted into <br>the machine group that we are about to create. In this example we just select <br>all the Personal Computer architecture machines, a real-world usage would be <br>more judicious in its selection. <br> <br>From the machine group container we create a new machine group folder. <br>We then enter a loop duplicating each machine folder (SmsDupFolder) and <br>inserting it into the machine group folder (SmsLinkFolder) and committing <br>the insertion. <br> <br>When the loop terminates we set the scalars for the new machine group folder. <br>There are two scalars: Name and Comment. The Comment is optional and can be <br>any text string. The name however, must be unique. This is solicited from the <br>user. <br> <br>The new folder is then linked and committed. <br> <br>The contents of this machine group folder are then displayed. Note that this <br>can be very lengthy. <br> </code></pre>
