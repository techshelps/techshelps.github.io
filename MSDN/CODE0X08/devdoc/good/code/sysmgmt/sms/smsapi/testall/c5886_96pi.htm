<pre><code><br>Sample: testall <br>=============== <br> <br>DESCRIPTION: <br> <br>    This program illustrates the use of the SMS APIs to examine either <br>    a site container, a jobs container, or a package container. The <br>    only difference in code between them is the setting of filters. <br> <br>    For the specified container, this program will set a standard set of <br>    filters for that container type, and then begin enumeration of that <br>    container and all the folders within it. <br> <br>    After the preliminary work of soliciting from the user the datasource <br>    information and making a connection to that datasource, the program <br>    then solicits the container type to enumerate and sets appropriate <br>    filters (see below). A loop is then entered which retrieves and <br>    stores the handles of all folders in that container. The container <br>    is then closed. Closing a container as soon as possible has a space <br>    advantage in that an open parent causes a folder's reference count to <br>    be incremented. The folder will not be closed until this count reaches <br>    zero. If the container is left open then no folders at all will be <br>    removed from memory. <br> <br>    We then loop through the list of folders and display them one at a time, <br>    after which the program either terminates or restarts (using the same <br>    datasource), according to the user's request. <br> <br>    Displaying folders. <br>    This is accomplished in the DisplayFolder() function. <br> <br>API USAGE: <br>    The following APIs are used in this program: <br> <br>      SmsAPIVer <br> <br>      SmsDataSourceConnect <br>      SmsDataSourceDisconnect <br> <br>      SmsOpenContainer <br>      SmsSetFilter <br>      SmsPopulate <br>      SmsGetFolderCount <br>      SmsCloseContainer <br> <br>      SmsCreateFilter <br>      SmsGetToken <br>      SmsGetTokenCount <br>      SmsAddToken <br>      SmsCloseFilter <br> <br>      SmsGetFolderID <br>      SmsGetFolderType <br>      SmsGetNextFolder <br>      SmsGetScalarCount <br>      SmsGetNextScalar <br>      SmsCloseFolder <br> <br> <br>1. Site hierarchy <br>----------------- <br>This program will display the site/domain/machine/MIF group <br>tree for the associated datasource according to certain filter <br>conditions. <br>o site filter:         select either root site or specific site. <br>o architecture filter: select machines of architecture Personal Computer. <br>o machine filter:      only machines with SystemRole=Server. <br>o group filter:        select the identification group. <br>o greoup filter:       select the netcard group. <br> <br>2. Jobs <br>------- <br>The user can select from the following types of jobs: workstation <br>install, server share, remove package, system. Selections are <br>ORed together, thus it is possible to select both workstation <br>install and remove package jobs. It is also possible to select <br>none of the above in which case the system defaults to selecting <br>all of them. <br>This might sound illogical, quite the contrary. A filter is a <br>restriction, if there are no restrictions then none are disallowed. <br> <br>3. Packages <br>----------- <br>This uses the package filter to allow selection of any or all of the <br>following types of packages: <br>o Workstation <br>o Server <br>o Inventory <br> <br> <br>The program will enumerate all folders in the specified container, <br>for each folder it will display all scalars and then enumerate <br>all sub-folders. <br> </code></pre>
