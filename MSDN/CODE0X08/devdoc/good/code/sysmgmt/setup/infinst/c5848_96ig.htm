<pre><code>The InfInst sample demonstrates the basic use of the Win32 Setup APIs. <br> <br>Win32 Setup APIs are a series of functions for installing files,  <br>modifying the registry, and modifying INI files.  The primary way <br>to use the Win32 Setup APIs is to combine the INF handling functions <br>with one or more INF files that describe the actions to perform  <br>during your install or uninstall.  One benefit of the Win32 Setup APIs <br>is that it provides dialog boxes that are consistent, familiar to user  <br>from the NT and Windows 95 setup, and localized if the OS is  <br>localized.  Moreover, the copy operations can handle things like <br>version checking and replacing in use files.  See the thorough  <br>documentation in the Win32 SDK help.   <br> <br>Below are the primary APIs used in this sample. These are implemented <br>in the doinst.c file.  The rest of the sample is a basic wizard  <br>that collects simple information from the user. The wizard is based <br>on the win32\wizard sample and is not complete in its error handling <br>and in helping the user determine things like disks space. <br> <br>The install process overview is: <br>  TASK                       SETUPAPI <br>  open a specific inf        SetupOpenInfFile <br>  call the wizard for input  (CreateWizard implement in the sample) <br>  set the directory ids      SetupSetDirectoryId <br>  create a file queue        SetupOpenFileQueue <br>  create a queue context     SetupInitDefaultQueueCallback <br>  add files to queue         SetupInstallFilesFromInfSection <br>  do the copy                SetupCommitFileQueue <br>  do the registry stuff      SetupInstallFromInfSection <br>  close the queue            SetupTermDefaultQueueCallback <br>  close the inf              SetupCloseFileQueue <br> <br>Many of the Win32 Setup APIs are specific to device driver <br>installations which are not addressed in this sample.  </code></pre>
