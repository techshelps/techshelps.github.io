<pre><code>Readme.txt for Msispy <br> <br>Overview <br>-------- <br>Msispy is a tool that provides a component level view of the products <br>and features installed on a system, using either an MSI Package, or <br>the registry information. Msispy also displays the status of each, <br>and allows you to partially or completely re-install missing or <br>damaged items. You can also re-configure any product or feature, <br>selecting the install level and specifying whether to install it <br>locally or run it from a CD or network server. <br> <br>Msispy allows you to save the system configuration, and restore it <br>at a later date. <br> <br> <br>Installing Msispy <br>----------------- <br>Msispy can be installed from any of the three Msispy installation  <br>packages available: <br>I386\Msispy.msi:   Intel (SHIP),  <br>DEBUG\MsispyD.msi: Intel (DEBUG) and <br>ALPHA\Msispy.msi:  ALPHA (SHIP) <br> <br>Msispy can be installed  <br>(a) on your local machine, <br>(b) to run from CD or a network server, <br>(c) as a combination of both <br>(d) advertised (install-on-demand), on NT 5 only <br> <br>The typical install installs the most frequently used components <br>of Msispy on your local machine, and leaves the rest to be run <br>from the CD when needed. This takes up less disk space, but you  <br>will need the source CD everytime you use any of the features that  <br>have been configured to run from the CD. <br> <br>The complete install copies all the files over to your local <br>hard-drive. This will take up more disk space, but you will not <br>need the CD again (unless Msispy files are deleted). <br> <br>The custom install option allows you to configure which features <br>of Msispy you would like to install locally, and where on the <br>local drive these files should reside. It also gives you the <br>diskspace that you will need for your selection. <br> <br> <br>Resiliency <br>---------- <br>If any of the Msispy files are deleted from the local drive, <br>they are copied back on from the CD when they are needed. Feel <br>free to delete all of Msispy's files and launch Msispy- It will <br>automatically copy over ("fault in") the required components as <br>and when they are needed. (Keep the source CD handy!) <br> <br>If you are using Windows NT 4.0, or Windows 95 (or earlier  <br>versions), the file Msispy.EXE will not be faulted in when you  <br>click on the shortcut. (You will need to run the installer again <br>to fix Msispy if you delete Msispy.exe). <br> <br>On MSI descriptor enabled systems (NT 5.0, Windows 98, with  <br>IE 4.0) even if you delete Msispy.exe, clicking on the shortcut <br>will automatically fault in the required components, (including <br>Msispy.exe) <br> <br> <br>Help <br>----  <br>Once you have installed Msispy, help is available under the Help <br>Menu (select "Overview"). You can run the hlp file directly <br>before installation from the CD by clicking on spyENU.hlp (for the <br>English (US) version) or spyDEU.hlp (for the German (Std) version)  <br> <br> <br>Source <br>------ <br>Many of the MSI initialisation functions performed by Msispy are  <br>in the source file InitMSI.cpp, available under the "samples"  <br>directory (..\samples\InitMSI.cpp). This file serves as an example  <br>of an app using the functions. <br> <br>Language <br>-------- <br>For the Japanese DLLs, the font MS UI Gothic is used, which will only <br>show up correctly on NT5 J or Windows98, unless the font is installed. <br> <br> <br>Compatibility <br>------------- <br>Msispy is compatible with Windows NT 4.0. At this time, Msispy is NOT  <br>fully compatible with the Windows-95 environment. <br> <br>THIS TOOL AND INFORMATION ARE PROVIDED "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY <br>OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT <br>LIMITED TO THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND/OR <br>FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  <br> <br></code></pre>
