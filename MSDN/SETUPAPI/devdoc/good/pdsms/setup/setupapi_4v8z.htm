<h1><a name="_setupapi_file_queues"></a>File Queues</h1>
<p>
The setup functions include file queue functionality. A file queue is a list of file copying, renaming, and deletion operations. These operations can be sent to the queue in any order. When the queue is committed, these operations are processed as a batch, in order of the operation type.</p>
<p>
The following sections explain what a queue is and how to use it when creating a setup application. Also discussed is the order in which the enqueued file operations are processed as the queue commits and what notifications the queue sends to a callback routine at each stage.</p>
