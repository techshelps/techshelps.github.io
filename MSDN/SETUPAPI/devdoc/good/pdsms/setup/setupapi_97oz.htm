<h3><a name="_setupapi_introducing_inf_files"></a>Introducing INF Files</h3>
<p>
Before you develop a Windows NT or Windows 95 setup application, you will probably want to create an information (INF) file. </p>
<p>
An INF file is made up of different types of sections. Each type of section has a particular purpose; for example, to copy files or to add entries to the registry. Each line in a section contributes to that section's purpose. The number and type of sections used in an INF file depends on the installation procedure. </p>
<p>
Each section type has a particular format. The setup functions use this format to retrieve information from the INF file. This format is described in the following topics. </p>
<p>
To be used by the operating system installer, an INF section must contain one or more items. </p>
<p>
In addition to the formatted INF sections, an INF file can contain private sections. You can use a private section to store specialized information required by your setup application. The format of a private section will depend on your application. </p>
<p>
The Setup API includes low-level functions that you can use to retrieve information from these private sections. Low-level setup functions, such as the <a href="setupapi_6lbo.htm"><b>SetupGetLineText</b></a><b> </b>and <a href="setupapi_29yc.htm"><b>SetupGetIntField</b></a> functions, retrieve information from the INF file at the line and field level. </p>
<p>
Additional sections types are used when installing device drivers. For more information about these other sections, see the <i>DDK Programmer's Guide</i>. </p>
