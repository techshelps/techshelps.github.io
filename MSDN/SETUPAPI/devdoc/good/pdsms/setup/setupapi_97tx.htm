<h3><a name="_setupapi_platform_path_override"></a>Platform Path Override</h3>
<p>
After a platform path override is set by a call to <a href="setupapi_0wrp.htm"><b>SetupSetPlatformPathOverride</b></a>, any setup function that queues file copy operations will examine the final component of the source path. If the final component matches the name of the user's platform, the setup function will replace it with the override string set by <b>SetPlatformPathOverride</b>. </p>
<p>
For example, when installing printer drivers onto a MIPS server, you might want to install drivers for all supported platforms. Queueing the files normally would install the files specified in the MIPS-dependent sections of the INF file, with source paths such as \\root\source\mips. </p>
<p>
To install the files for a second platform, you must call <b>SetupSetPlatformPathOverride</b> to set a platform override. The following example shows the specific function call to set the platform to Alpha.</p>
<pre><code>test = SetupSetPlatformPathOverride("alpha");
 </code></pre>
<p>
After you set the platform to Alpha, file copy operations sent to the queue with a source path of \\root\source\mips would have their source path changed to \\root\source\alpha. You would repeat this process for each platform of interest.</p>
