<h3><a name="_setupapi_extracting_files_from_cabinets"></a>Extracting Files from Cabinets</h3>
<p>
You can extract files from a cabinet in two ways. The first and simplest way is to take advantage of the automatic cabinet processing built into the setup functions.</p>
<p>
The installation functions, such as <a href="setupapi_5nz9.htm"><b>SetupCommitFileQueue</b></a>,<b> <a href="setupapi_8put.htm">SetupInstallFile</a></b>, and <a href="setupapi_0zvy.htm"><b>SetupInstallFromInfSection</b></a>, check the compression on each file. If the file is in a cabinet, the functions first search for a file of that name outside the cabinet. If found, the functions install the external file, ignoring the file inside the cabinet. This enables you to update a single file inside the cabinet without rebuilding the cabinet.</p>
<p>
The setup functions also track which files in a cabinet have been retrieved, so that a file is extracted only once, even if it is installed several times. </p>
<p>
The second way to extract files from a cabinet is by using <a href="setupapi_61bo.htm"><b>SetupIterateCabinet</b></a>. This function iterates through each file in a cabinet, sending a notification to a callback routine for each file found. The callback routine then returns a value that indicates whether the file should be extracted or skipped.</p>
<p>
<b>Note</b>  The Setup API does not supply a default callback routine to handle cabinet notifications. If you call <b>SetupIterateCabinet </b>explicitly, you must supply a callback routine to process the cabinet notifications that the function returns.</p>
