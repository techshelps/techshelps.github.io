Microsoft Visual Basic 6.0 includes two Help Workshop applications that allow you to create Help topics in Windows Help (WinHelp) format or HTML format.</p>
<h2>WinHelp</h2>
<p>
The Help Compiler Workshop included with Microsoft Visual Basic 6.0 can be used to create online Help files that display bidirectional text. Following are additional tips for creating Help files.
<ul type=disc>
<li>
The created files will display bidirectional text correctly only when run in a bidirectional 32-bit Microsoft Windows environment.<br><br></li>
<li>
To build an online Help file that displays bidirectional text, you must first create an .RTF format file containing bidirectional text and formatting attributes such as right-to-left paragraphs. Certain bidirectional-enabled word processors will automatically add this information to .RTF format files they create. Microsoft Word for Windows 95-Arabic Edition or later and other Middle East versions of Microsoft Word for Windows 95 are examples of such products.<br><br></li>
<li>
If the online Help file you create will be run on a platform other than a bidirectional version of 32-bit Microsoft Windows, be sure to specify the appropriate LCID language option in the Help project file. For example, if the file will be run on the U.S. English version of Windows 95, choose English as the language of the Help file.<br><br></li>
<li>
For each .RTF file compiled with Help Compiler Workshop, all Latin text in right-to-left paragraphs will have the same appearance regardless of the attributes that may have been assigned during file editing. This limitation causes the affected Latin text to be assigned the attributes (for example, font and font size) of the Default Latin font. This limitation does not exist for left-to-right paragraphs.<br><br></li>
<li>
Right-to-left tables, a standard feature of word processors such as Arabic Microsoft Word, are not a supported feature of Help Compiler Workshop. Help Compiler Workshop will compile a right-to-left table as if it is a left-to-right table.</li>
</ul>
<h2>HTML Help</h2>
<p>
The HTML Help Workshop is a worldwide-ready Help tool that allows you to create Help topics in HTML as well as convert existing WinHelp files. The HTML Help Workshop has built-in bidirectional support; however, to view topics containing bidirectional text your audience will need a bidirectional-enabled Internet browser. Bidirectional-enabled versions of Microsoft Internet Explorer 3.x and Microsoft Internet Explorer 4.x are available in Middle East markets. Refer to external resources such as PSS, Readme files, and subsidiary Websites for special tips on developing HTML Help topics.</p>
