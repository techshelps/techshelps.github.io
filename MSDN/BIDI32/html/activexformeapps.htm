Microsoft Visual Basic 6.0 includes features to create ActiveX controls that you can use in your applications. If you create an ActiveX control for your Middle East application, you may want to use the RightToLeft ambient property to improve its usability. Refer to the discussion of Ambient Property and AmbientProperties Object in online Help for details about ambient properties.</p>
<p>
An ActiveX control may inspect ambient properties provided by the control container to suggest behavior to controls. As an example, BackColor is one of the standard ambient properties; by providing this property, the container is suggesting what the well behaved control should set its back color property to.</p>
<p>
The RightToLeft ambient property is also a standard ambient property defined in the ActiveX Controls Standard. All of the standard ambient properties are contained in the AmbientProperties object provided by Visual Basic. The RightToLeft ambient property is used to communicate the RightToLeft setting of the control container to the ActiveX control. The Visual Basic supplied default if the container does not support this property is False.</p>
<p>
The Form object is a typical container for ActiveX controls you create and provides ambient RightToLeft property information. If the form's standard RightToLeft property setting is True, then the RightToLeft ambient property will also be set to True.</p>
<p>
By inspecting the RightToLeft ambient setting, an ActiveX control that is being newly created on a form can adapt its visual features and behavior to be consistent with the form on which it resides. For example, an ActiveX control that has a RightToLeft property can set the initial value of this property based on the ambient RightToLeft property setting of the form.</p>
