A key aspect of Visual Basic to developers of Middle East applications is its ability to seamlessly create run time versions of applications that include <a href="bidipopup.htm">bidirectional</a> feature support. However, there are a few points to keep in mind when creating distribution disks:
<ul type=disc>
<li>
Most bidirectional features of Middle East applications installed from distribution disks will run successfully only in a bidirectional 32-bit Microsoft Windows environment.<br><br></li>
<li>
The user interface for the Setup program included on distribution disks is English.</li>
</ul>
<p class=indent>
<B><b>Important</b></B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For applications to be run on bidirectional operating systems you need to manually include Vbame.dll in the Setup.lst created by the Setup Wizard. You can do this by adding the file at the File Summary step when running the Setup Wizard, by editing the Setup.lst directly or by adding an entry for Vbame.dll to the Vb6dep.ini file so it will be automatically added to the Setup.lst whenever you run the Setup Wizard.</p>
