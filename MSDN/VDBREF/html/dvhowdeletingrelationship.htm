Delete a relationship when you no longer want to relate columns in two related tables. When you redesign tables, it’s often necessary to delete relationships and then recreate them after your new design is complete. For example, if you decide to normalize a database and store all address data in one table, you would delete all the relationships to <code>address</code> columns between existing tables, create a new table containing the <code>address</code> columns, and then create relationships from the new <code>address</code> table to every table that requires an address.</p>
<p class=label>
<b>To delete a relationship</b>

<li>
Right-click the relationship line and choose <b>Delete Relationship from Database</b> from the shortcut menu.<br><br></li>
<li>
A message box prompts you to confirm the deletion. Choose <b>Yes</b>.</li>
</ol>
<p class=indent>
<B><b>Note</b></B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you delete a relationship, the relationship line is removed from your diagram and every other diagram in which it appears. It is deleted from the database when you save the diagram or either of the tables that it related.</p>
