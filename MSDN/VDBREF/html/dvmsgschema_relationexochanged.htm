<h1><a name="dvmsgschema_relationexochanged"></a>Relationship '&lt;0s&gt;' was modified or deleted since the diagram was loaded.</h1>
<p>
A modified relationship is about to be saved. It is possible that a table involved in the relationship has been deleted from the database by another user.</p>
<p>
Verify whether this relationship is meant to be modified. Changing or deleting a relationship for a table may affect other tables.</p>
<p>
