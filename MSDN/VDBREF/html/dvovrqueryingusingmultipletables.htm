<h1><a name="dvovrqueryingusingmultipletables"></a>Querying Using Multiple Tables</h1>
<p>
You can retrieve data from two or more tables in the same query by joining the tables. Joined tables have a <a href="dvovrvisualdatabasetoolsglossary.htm#dvmsgrelationship">relationship</a> to one another based on data they have in common.</p>
<p>
For example, in a publishers application, the <code>publishers</code> and the <code>titles</code> tables might each contain a publisher ID column. If so, you can create a query that joins the two tables and produces results that include the publisher name for each book, as shown in the following illustration:</p>

<p>
Joining tables creates a <a href="dvovrvisualdatabasetoolsglossary.htm#dvmsgresultset">result set</a> consisting of a virtual table with rows that combine information from all joined tables. You can specify which columns appear in the result set by selecting particular columns from each of the joined tables. You can also include sort specifications and <a href="dvovrvisualdatabasetoolsglossary.htm#dvmsgsearchcondition">search conditions</a>, just as you do for queries involving single tables.</p>
<p>
To join tables, you specify a <a href="dvovrvisualdatabasetoolsglossary.htm#dvmsgjoincondition">join condition</a>. You can create join conditions based on any comparison operator. The most common join condition is to match values exactly — that is, the query matches a value in a column of the first table against values in a column of the other table exactly. (This is sometimes referred to as an "<a href="dvovrvisualdatabasetoolsglossary.htm#dvmsgequijoin">equijoin</a>.") For example, in the earlier illustration, the join condition is that the <code>pub_id</code> column in both tables are equivalent.</p>
<p>
You can join any number of tables. If you join more than two tables, two tables are joined, the resulting virtual joined table is joined with the next tables, and so on, until a single virtual joined table is obtained.</p>
<p>
Typically, you join tables that are in the same database. However, depending on what database server you are using, you might be able to join tables from different databases.</p>
