<p>
Suppose a colleague has created a Visual Basic application that inspects the repository database directly, preparing various reports about the structure of her Visual Basic projects. You want to run this application periodically to inspect and report on the structure of <i>your</i> projects.</p>
<p>
To benefit from your colleague’s application, you must ensure that the repository represents the structure of all of your projects.</p>
<p class=label>
<b>To represent your projects in the repository</b>
<ol>
<li>
Register the Repository Add-in for Visual Basic as an add-in.<br><br></li>
<li>
Open and close each existing Visual Basic project whose structure you want represented in the repository.<br>
By opening a Visual Basic project, you ensure that the Repository Add-in inserts a representation of the project structure into the repository.<br><br></li>
<li>
Create any new projects as you would normally.<br>
For each new project you create, the Repository Add-in automatically inserts the project structure into the repository.<br><br></li>
<li>
Modify any projects as you would normally.<br>
Each time you modify a project’s structure, the Repository Add-in automatically ensures that the new project structure is represented in the repository.</li>
</ol>
<p>
Now that the structures of your projects are online in the repository, you can profitably run your colleague’s application to report on them.</p>
