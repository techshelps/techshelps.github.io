<h1><a name="reconchoosinghowtouserepositorywithvisualbasic"></a>Choosing How to Use Repository with Visual Basic</h1>
<p>
You can choose how to use Repository. The choices you make affect how you set up your Visual Basic projects that use Repository. 
<ul type=disc>
<li>
<i>Do you use Repository to manage your Visual Basic projects? </i>If so, you must enable the Repository Add-in for Visual Basic as an add-in. Only after you register it can it automatically populate the MDO Model with information about your Visual Basic projects. You make the choice only once; whatever you decide affects all your Visual Basic projects.<br><br></li>
<li>
<i>Does your project directly manipulate Repository? </i>Your project manipulates Repository directly only if it uses an open connection with a repository via an Automation object of type Repository. If your project manipulates Repository directly, you must include a reference to the Microsoft Repository type library.<br><br></li>
<li>
<i>Does your project need to respond to events triggered by the Repository Add-in for Visual Basic?</i> If your project is an add-in, it might need to respond to particular events triggered by the Repository Add-in for Visual Basic. Include a reference to the Microsoft Repository Add-In type library. Your project should register for particular events to which you need to respond.<br><br></li>
<li>
<i>Does your project store values in extensions to the MDO Model, or does your project read information directly from the MDO Model?</i> If it does, add references from your project to the Microsoft Development Objects type library and to the Microsoft Repository type library.</li>
</ul>
