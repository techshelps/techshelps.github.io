<pre><code>Networking (LAN Manager) API Sample <br> <br> <br>This module illustrates how to use a Null session to overcome access <br>problems during network related query operations. <br> <br>One example of the scenario this approach addresses is as follows: <br> <br>User logs onto workstation A as the local administrator. <br> <br>Administrator tries to query user information using the NetUserGetInfo() <br>API call on server B.  This call fails with ERROR_ACCESS_DENIED. <br> <br>The reason this problem occurs is that the administrator password on <br>workstation A does not match the administrator password on server B. <br> <br>During the network query operation, the default behavior is to establish <br>a connection to the remote server using the credentials of the logged-in <br>user.  In some scenarios, this behavior is not appropriate, and the <br>solution is to establish a connection using either known credentials, <br>or the Null credentials.  Null credentials are suitable for most query <br>operations against a remote machine.  However, if administrator <br>related actions are necessary, it is necessary to supply credentials <br>which have administrative privilege on the remote machine.  Valid <br>credentials consist of a username, password, and optional domain name. <br> <br>Establishing a connection in this manner requires that no existing <br>connections exist to the remote machine tied to the current logon <br>session. <br> <br>Note: Null sessions are those where the user credentials passed in the <br>session setup SMB are null.  This sample only implements a function to <br>establish a Null session, rather than a session with specific credentials. <br> <br>Processes and Services running in the Local System account security context <br>have Null credentials by default, so establishing Null sessions in this <br>scenario is not required. <br> <br>Applications that run only on Windows NT 4.0 and above can use <br>WNetAddConnection2() rather than NetUseAdd() to establish a Null session. </code></pre>
