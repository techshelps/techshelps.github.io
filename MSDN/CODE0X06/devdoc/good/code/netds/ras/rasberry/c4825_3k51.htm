<pre><code>RASberry - A demonstation of the RAS API set. <br> <br>THIS CODE AND INFORMATION IS PROVIDED "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF <br>ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO <br>THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND/OR FITNESS FOR A <br>PARTICULAR PURPOSE. <br> <br>Copyright (C) 1993-1995  Microsoft Corporation.  All Rights Reserved. <br> <br> <br>PURPOSE: <br>    To demonstrate the Remote Access Service (RAS) API set.  RASberry <br>    allows the user to enumerate current RAS connections, display the <br>    status of a selected connection, dial entries from the default <br>    phone book, and hang up a active connection. <br> <br>RAS APIs USED: <br>    RasDial <br>    RasEnumConnections <br>    RasEnumEntries <br>    RasGetConnectStatus <br>    RasGetErrorString <br>    RasHangUp <br> <br>COMMENTS: <br>    This sample may be built as a 16 or 32 bit application.  The default <br>    is 32 bits.  To build a 16 bit version, define MAK16 on the build <br>    command line. <br> <br>    32 BIT SPECIFICS: <br>    - Before the application exits, it should insure that the RAS state <br>      machine has been reset if there has been a hang up.  This may be  <br>      done by calling Sleep(3000).  See documentation on RasHangUp for  <br>      more information. <br> <br>    - The 32 bit RasDial API can either function syncronously or <br>      asyncronously.  This sample demonstrates the asyncronous ability. <br>      The asyncronous RasDial call requires a callback function to <br>      receive a notification of a change of state in the connection <br>      process.  The function is not associated with a window or message <br>      queue.  To provide a single source for both Win32 and Win16  <br>      applications, the RasDialFunc in RASbeery, just posts a message <br>      to a window, and the window's message handle takes the  <br>      appropriate action.  <br> <br> <br>    16 BIT SPECIFICS: <br>    - The RasDial API is only asyncronous for Win16.  RasDial sends <br>      a WM_RASDIALEVENT message to the window specified in the call to <br>      RasDial.  An application may perform any tasks during the handling <br>      of this message, but it should not call EndDialog().  If it is  <br>      desired that the window be closed, a shut down message should be <br>      posted to the window as in this sample. <br> <br> <br>MODULE MAP: <br>    RASberry- Implements message handlers for the main window.  Maintains <br>              the list of current RAS connections. <br>    StatDlg - Displays the status of a connection selected from the main <br>              application window. <br>    PhbkDlg - Displays contents of default phone book and allow the user <br>              to dail an entry. <br>    AuthDlg - Obtains authentication information from user before making <br>              a connection. <br>    DialDlg - Displays the states of the RAS connection during the initial <br>              connection phase. <br>    RasUtil - Utilities used by modules listed above. <br>    Dispatch- Message dispatching routines <br>    WinMain - Calls initialization functions and processes the message loop <br>    Init    - Performs application and instance specific initialization <br>    About   - Defines a standard about dialog box. <br>    Misc    - Defines the applications specific commands not related to <br>                a specific module. </code></pre>
