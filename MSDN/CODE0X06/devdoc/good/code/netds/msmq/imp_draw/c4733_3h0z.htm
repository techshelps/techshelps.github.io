<pre><code><br>This sample demonstrates how to use the MSMQ ActiveX components with the #import  <br>compiler directive new to Visual C++ 5.0. This program also demonstrates how to p <br>erform asynchronous receive using MSMQ ActiveX Events in C++. <br> <br>This sample program functions identically to the VB_Draw and C_Draw samples included  <br>with the MSMQ product and will inter-operate with those two samples. <br> <br>In order to handle ActiveX Event notification a new class, CMSMQEventHandler, has been <br>defined.  This class can be used in other projects by deriving a new class from  <br>CMSMQEventHandler and overriding the Arrived and ArrivedError methods. <br> <br>Aside from this new class the majority of code in this project was taken or adapted  <br>from the existing C_Draw and VB_Draw samples. </code></pre>
