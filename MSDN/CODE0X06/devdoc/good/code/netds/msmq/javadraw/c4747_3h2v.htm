<pre><code>The JavaDraw sample demonstrates how to implement a distributed drawing application  <br>using Java SDK 2.0 and MSMQ ActiveX components.   It sends and receives MSMQ messages  <br>which store drawings using safearrays, charater data as strings, as well as a  <br>"Clear screen" message to both the sender and the receiver.  The sample also demonstrates  <br>how to handle MSMQ ActiveX Events in Java. <br> <br>The sample prepares and sends one message for the entire stroke ( drawing between  <br>mouse-down and mouse-up ).  It demonstrates an object oriented approach to send and <br>receive different data types using Java.  <br> <br>VB and C-based versions of disdraw samples on MSMQ SDK will not  <br>interoperate with this sample since they send one message per pixel of drawing.  A  <br>compatible version of JavaDraw can be made by reducing the functionality and removing  <br>the safe-array part with simple text  <br> <br>In order to compile the sample code, you MUST use the latest Java compiler included  <br>in SDK 2.0.   Before building the sample, run the JActiveX tool on MSMQ type library  <br>( MQOA.dll ) to generate java wrapper classes for MSMQ ActiveX components.   For a  <br>description of JActiveX tool, please refer to the Microsoft SDK for Java 2.0  <br>documentation available at http://www.microsoft.com/java/sdk <br> <br>SafeArrays and Variants are described in the Microsoft SDK for Java 2.0 documentation  <br>which is available from http://www.microsoft.com/java/sdk. <br></code></pre>
