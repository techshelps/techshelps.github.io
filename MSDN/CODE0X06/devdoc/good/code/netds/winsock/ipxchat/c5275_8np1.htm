<pre><code>IPXCHAT Example Application <br> <br>This program demonstrates the use of Windows Sockets to communicate  <br>over the IPX/SPX protocol. <br> <br>Setup: <br> <br>IPXCHAT requires that an IPX protocol is loaded.  The "IPX/SPX  <br>Compatible Transport" shippd in the box is the protocol which was  <br>used for testing this application.  Make sure that the protocol is <br>configured correctly for the same frame type on the two machines  <br>which are talking to each other. <br> <br>To use IPXCHAT: <br> <br>There are two sides to a sockets application, the server side (the  <br>listening side), and the client side (the calling side).  On the first <br>machine you will need to set up IPXCHAT as the server.   <br> <br>Start IPXCHAT and select Options-&gt;Listen. <br> <br>You will be prompted to enter a socket number.  A default of 2FFF will be <br>offered to you although you may change it to anything you want.  Be aware  <br>that there are well known XNS sockets which you should stay away from.  See <br>Novell's "IPX Router Specification" for a list of these. <br> <br>When you select OK, IPXCHAT will initialize Windows Sockets and start <br>listening on the specified socket.  In the status box of the dialog you <br>will see a message "listening on &lt;netnum&gt;.&lt;nodenum&gt;.&lt;socknum&gt;" where <br>netnum will be a number specifying the network number, nodenum specifies <br>the node number, and socknum specifies the socket number.  You will need <br>these numbers to enter on the client side in order to connect. <br> <br>On the second machine (actually it can be the same machine as the server): <br> <br>Start IPXCHAT and select Options-&gt;Connect. <br> <br>You will be prompted to enter the Network Number, Node Number, and Socket  <br>Number indicated on the server (the three numbers in the status box of  <br>the server's listen dialog).  Once you connect you should be able to  <br>type in the top edit control and it should appear on the bottom of your <br>counterpart's edit control. <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> </code></pre>
