<pre><code>Global Chat Sample for Windows Sockets  <br> <br> <br>SUMMARY <br>======= <br> <br>The GLOBCHAT sample allows two clients to carry on a conversation using a  <br>server as the intermediary. By using the Name Resolution and Registration  <br>functions, the clients need not even have the same transport protocols  <br>loaded. The server acts as a gateway between the two clients, forwarding  <br>messages over the appropriate Windows Sockets interface. <br> <br>MORE INFORMATION <br>================ <br> <br>To run Global Chat: <br> <br>  - Load the server side, GLOBCHAT.EXE, on a Windows NT server. This machine  <br>    should run every protocol that a potential client might run. <br> <br>  - On a client machine, run GLOBCL.EXE. Choose Connect from the Options  <br>    menu to get to the dialog box for selecting the protocol of your choice  <br>    and give yourself a name to be known by. <br> <br>  - Once you enter the protocol and your name, the Global Chat Client finds  <br>    the server and gives you a list of other users who you can chat with.  <br>    Pick one, wait for them to accept your offer of a chat, and start  <br>    typing. <br> <br>The Global Chat Server displays the protocols it is using, the number of  <br>client machines connected using each protocol, a list of all the client  <br>names currently connected, and the status of each. <br> <br>Note: Some of the supported protocols simply use the first Global Chat  <br>Server that they find. This means that if more than one Global Chat Server  <br>is running on your network, you may not connect to the right one. <br> <br></code></pre>
