<pre><code>3-D Maze Game <br> <br> <br>SUMMARY <br>======= <br> <br>The Mazelord sample is a 3-D maze game. The objective is to get as high a <br>score as possible by zapping other players, and by destroying automated <br>drones which wander around the maze. When there are no other players, <br>zapping drones still makes an interesting game in itself. <br> <br>Mazelord is a networked or non-networked game, depending upon how it is <br>invoked. In both versions, the player is placed in a room of sanctuary in a <br>palace. In this room, players may not shoot, and drones cannot hurt players. <br>Once outside of its 3x3 confines, however, anything goes. Your task is to  <br>hunt down drones and other players and 'zap' them. Zapped players are  <br>teleported back to the sanctuary, and zapped drones are teleported to a  <br>random location in the maze. <br> <br>MORE INFORMATION <br>================ <br> <br>Drones appear as gray robots. The number and speed of drones is configurable  <br>under the Options. A suggestion is 20 drones, speed 2. <br> <br>The controls to Mazelord are simple: <br> <br>  - UpArrow:    Move one square forward. <br>  - LeftArrow:  Turn left, stay in same square. <br>  - RightArrow: Turn right, stay in same square. <br>  - DownArrow:  Move one square backwards. <br>  - Space:      Zap whatever is in line of sight. <br>  - X:          Exit the game. <br>  - W:          Whisper something. Anyone within the specified # of squares <br>                of you can hear your message. <br>  - S:          Shout something. Same as whisper, except people who are <br>                farther away can hear your message. <br> <br>To play, ideally you should be running on a 486 or MIPS with lots of memory <br>and sound enabled, although the game should work on other systems. Note that  <br>if you don't have sound, you can still play. The important sounds are  <br>changed to speaker beeps. <br> <br>Upon invoking Maze, you have several options: <br> <br>File Menu <br> <br>    NewGame:   Starts a new game. Make sure you have configured the game <br>               under the OPTIONS menu unless you want the defaults and want <br>               to play Locally rather than over the network. <br>    PauseGame: Pauses the movement of all drones, but you will be a sitting <br>               duck if someone shoots at you. <br>    StopGame:  Resets the game. <br>    Exit:      Exits the game. <br> <br>Options Menu <br> <br>    Networked/Local: Determines whether you will be playing against other <br>               people on your network domain or not. It's fine to run  <br>               NETWORK'd when there is no one else playing. Default is  <br>               LOCAL. <br>    PlayerSettings: Brings up a dialog with two list boxes. The first shows  <br>               a list of bitmaps you can choose from to be your character. <br>               Currently, there is a fish and a smiley face, but the number  <br>               of choices will be increasing. You can also choose a home  <br>               maze. This isn't used right now, but soon your home maze will  <br>               be added to a random part of the existing maze, and you will  <br>               be able to teleport there at will. <br>    Drones:    Brings up the drones configuration dialog box. Select the  <br>               number of drones you want and the speed you want them to go,  <br>               (# of moves per second). Move algorithm is currently ignored,  <br>               as all drones use the same semi-random algorithm. <br> <br>The display consists of the following: <br> <br>  - A 3-D view of the maze. There are drawing bugs in terms of correctness, <br>    but unless you're watching for them, they generally don't make a  <br>    difference. If you have doubts about a wall, you can verify its  <br>    existence on the overhead view. <br> <br>  - Overhead view: This view is two squares in each direction from where  <br>    you are located. You can't see other players on the overhead map, but  <br>    you can see a small triangle in the center, which indicates which way  <br>    you are facing. This window is an ABSOLUTE view; up is ALWAYS north  <br>    on the window, regardless of which direction you're facing in the maze. <br> <br>  - Text window: This gives information about what is happening in the game, <br>    such as who you zap or who zaps you, and notification when players enter  <br>    or leave the game. You will also see messages whispered or shouted by  <br>    other players if they are close enough. <br> <br>  - Score window. This shows all players active in your domain if you're <br>    networked. The display includes the bitmap being used by the player, their <br>    score, and a directional indicator to show the ABSOLUTE direction you  <br>    need to go to reach the square that player is in. These are updated  <br>    every time they change. <br> <br>Have fun with the game! </code></pre>
