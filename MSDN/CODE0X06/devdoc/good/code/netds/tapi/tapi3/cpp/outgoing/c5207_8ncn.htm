<pre><code>TAPI 3.0 <br>OUTGOING Sample Application <br> <br> <br>Overview: <br> <br>Outgoing is a sample TAPI 3.0 application that makes outgoing phone <br>calls. <br> <br>This sample shows the most basic TAPI 3.0 functionality - finding an <br>appropriate address object and creating a call on it. <br> <br>How to use: <br> <br>To run the OUTGOING sample application, simply build and run t3out.exe. <br> <br> <br>A small dialog box will appear.  The user can type in a destination address <br>and choose the address type of the destination address.  TAPI 3.0 currently <br>supports the following address types: <br> <br>    Conference Name <br>    Email Name <br>    Machine Name <br>    Phone Number <br>    IP Address <br> <br>Microsoft's H.323 Service Provider supports the Email Name, Machine Name, <br>and IP Address address types.  Microsoft's IP Conferencing Service <br>Provider supports the Conference Name address type. <br> <br>When the user types in a destination address, chooses an address type, <br>and presses the "Dial" button, the application will find a TAPI address <br>that support the address type selected, as well as the audioin and audio <br>out media types.  Then it will make a call on that address. <br> <br>If the address also support video, and the machine has video capabilities, <br>the application will also set up a video stream. <br> <br> <br> <br>What functionality does this sample show: <br> <br>The outgoing sample application shows how to make a phone call with <br>TAPI 3.0. <br> <br> <br>What this sample does not show: <br> <br>This sample is extremely simple.  It does not allow the user to select <br>the address or terminals that the user is interested in.  It does not <br>see call state messages, and does not listen for incoming calls. <br>  <br> <br>Hints: <br> <br>This sample should be able to run as long as you have TAPI devices <br>installed.  Many computers have a modem.  If the modem is installed <br>correctly, it will show up as a TAPI device. <br> <br>  </code></pre>
