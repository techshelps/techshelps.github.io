<pre><code>----------------------------------------------------------- <br>                      Java TAPI 3.0 Outgoing Call Sample <br>                                 August 1997 <br>          ----------------------------------------------------------- <br>                   (c) Copyright Microsoft Corporation, 1997 <br> <br> <br>-------------------- <br>      CONTENTS <br>-------------------- <br>SUMMARY <br>BEFORE YOU COMPILE/RUN THE SAMPLE <br>HOW TO COMPILE THE SAMPLE <br>HOW TO RUN THE SAMPLE <br>USER'S GUIDE <br>MISC INFO ABOUT THE SAMPLE <br> <br> <br>SUMMARY <br>======= <br> <br>The JT3Call sample application/applet demonstrates the use of the Telephony API <br>3.0 to make outgoing calls. <br> <br>Depending on installed hardware, the applet will allow you to communicate with <br>others over a network connection using streaming audio and video.  One-to-one <br>connections are supported, but you may also connect to network conferences in <br>which you can communicate with multiple parties simultaneously. <br> <br> <br>BEFORE YOU COMPILE/RUN THE SAMPLE <br>================================= <br> <br>Before you can compile/run the sample you must perform the following steps: <br> <br>1. Configure the Telephoney API 3.0 <br>----------------------------------- <br>TAPI 3.0 is installed by default in Windows NT 5.0.  To ensure that telephoney <br>support is properly configured on your machine, go to the control panel and <br>open the "Telephoney" control panel applet. <br> <br>2. Install the MS Virtual Machine for Java (build 4.79.2174 or greater) <br>----------------------------------------------------------------------- <br>To check which version of the VM you currently have, open Windows Explorer and <br>go to the root directory of your Windows installation (e.g., C:\Winnt).  Find <br>the file Jview.exe and right-click it with the mouse.  On the popup menu that <br>appears click the "Properties" item.  When the properties dialog appears <br>select the "Version" tab. <br> <br>If you must upgrade to a newer version of the VM, install the version that <br>comes with the SDK for Java 2.0 (http://www.microsoft.com/java) since you will <br>need the SDK for the following step. <br> <br>3. Generate Java/COM Integration Classes for TAPI 3.0 <br>----------------------------------------------------- <br>To generate these classes you will need to have the SDK for Java 2.0 installed. <br>Once you have installed the SDK, go to the \bin directory under the main SDK <br>install directory (C:\SDK-Java.20 by default) and execute the following <br>commands: <br> <br>JActiveX /javatlb /xh /X:m- C:\Winnt\system32\tapi3.dll <br>Jvc C:\Winnt\java\trustlib\tapi3\*.java <br> <br>WARNING! You must use Jvc version 1.02.3920 or greater to compile files <br> generated by JActiveX. <br> <br>This will generate the .class files needed to access TAPI 3.0 from Java in the <br>C:\Winnt\java\trustlib\tapi3 directory. <br> <br>Note, you should replace "C:\Winnt" in the above paths with the path of your <br>Windows installation.  For more information on how to generate Java/COM <br>integration classes refer to the SDK for Java 2.0 documentation. <br> <br> <br>HOW TO COMPILE THE SAMPLE <br>========================= <br> <br>Once the above steps are complete you can compile JT3Call by executing the <br>makeall.bat file. <br> <br> <br>HOW TO RUN THE SAMPLE <br>===================== <br> <br>You may run the sample as an application by typing the following from the <br>sample directory: <br> <br>Jview JT3Call.class <br> <br>or <br> <br>JT3Call.exe <br> <br>The sample is also an applet and may be executed by viewing JT3Call.htm in <br>Microsoft Internet Explorer. <br> <br> <br>USER'S GUIDE <br>============ <br> <br>The first thing to note is the "Source Address" combo-box.  It displays <br>addresses for different service providers installed on your machine.  If a <br>connect operation does not work, it could be that you are trying to connect <br>using the wrong source address (e.g., you must use a conferencing source <br>address to join conferences). <br> <br>The "Destination Address" text field is where you enter the address you wish <br>to connect to.  This can be an IP address, a machine name, etc. depending on <br>the type of connection you are trying to establish. <br> <br>The "Static Terminals" listbox shows the available static terminals. <br> <br>Just below the static terminals listbox is the "Number of Video Wnds" text <br>field.  Here, you enter the number of incoming video streams you want to <br>see.  Video windows are dynamic terminals. <br> <br>By the way, terminals are end-points for connections.  There are two types <br>of them: static and dynamic.  Static terminals are usually tied to hardware <br>(e.g., speakers or microphones) and have a specific count.  Examples of <br>dynamic terminals are video windows and files. <br> <br> <br>MISC INFO ABOUT THE SAMPLE <br>========================== <br> <br>Platforms Supported <br>------------------- <br>The sample has been tested on Windows NT 5.0 using the Microsoft Virtual <br>Machine for Java. <br> <br>Hardware Requirements <br>--------------------- <br>Hardware requirements for each type of media is listed below: <br>Audio Capture  ... Sound card and microphone <br>Audio Playback ... Sound card and speakers <br>Video Capture  ... Video capture card and camera <br>Video Playback ... N/A (just uses monitor) <br></code></pre>
