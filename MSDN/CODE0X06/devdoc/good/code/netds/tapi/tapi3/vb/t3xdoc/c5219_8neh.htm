<pre><code><br>TAPI 3.0 <br>T3XDOC Sample Application <br> <br> <br>Overview: <br> <br>T3XDOC is a sample ActiveX document that uses TAPI 3.0 to make an outgoing  <br>synchronous call. This ActiveX document was developed using Visual Basic 5. <br> <br>The ActiveX document must be opened with Internet Explorer and shows up  <br>as a Visual Basic form, that lets the user select the address from which  <br>to make the call, the media type and the terminal desired. <br> <br> <br>How to use: <br> <br>To run the T3XDoc sample, use Visual Basic's Application Setup Wizard: <br>this will create the DLL, the CAB file as well as the HTM file that points  <br>to the ActiveX Document. (Note: the setup wizard will suggest you to  <br>include tapi3.dll in the cab file; you should say no, since this application <br>is designed to work on Windows NT 5.0, that already has tapi3.dll installed,  <br>as well as all the other dll components of the Tapi 3.0 product). <br>Then launch Internet Explorer and point it to the HTM file created by the  <br>setup wizard. This will automatically load the ActiveX document T3XDoc. <br>The document will show up as a VB5 form that lets you type in the  <br>destination address and then dial by pressing Connect.  <br>Before that, anyway, press the button "What to Use for Connect", which  <br>will open a dialog box. This dialog box is named "Connect using" and  <br>lets you select the address from which the call is to be made, as well  <br>as the media type and terminal desired. <br> <br> <br>What functionality does this sample show: <br> <br>The T3XDOC sample application shows how to make a synchronous outgoing  <br>call with TAPI 3.0, from a Visual Basic ActiveX document. <br> <br> <br>What this sample does not show: <br> <br>This sample does not allow the user to select more than 1 MediaTerminal  <br>on the call. Though, Tapi3 allows selection of multiple MediaTerminals  <br>on the call, and it's up to the telephony provider to actually support  <br>them. <br>(A "MediaTerminal" means a valid pair of "media type" and "terminal".) <br> <br>The sample also is not implemented to support more than one call per  <br>address. But Tapi 3.0 is designed to allow creation of multiple calls per  <br>address, and it's only up to the telephony provider to actually support  <br>them. <br> <br>The sample does not show how to receive incoming calls. <br> <br> <br>Hints: <br> <br>1. For information about how to package ActiveX documents for Internet  <br>distribution, see Visual Basic (5) Books Online - Component Tools Guide - <br>Building Internet Applications - Packaging ActiveX Components. <br>This will also show how to digitally sign and mark safe for scripting and  <br>initializing the ActiveX document. <br>For more info about how to write an ActiveX document, see again  <br>Visual Basic 5 Books Online - Component Tools Guide - Creating ActiveX  <br>Components - Creating an ActiveX Document. <br> <br>2. For being able to make audio calls, a sound card needs to be installed <br>on the machine. <br> <br>3. For being able to make video calls, a video card and a camera are needed. <br>However, they are mandatory only for sending video streams, for receiving <br>video streams no special hardware is required. <br> <br>4. For being able to make phone calls, a modem needs to be installed. <br>For this special case of phone (Unimodem) calls, depending on the terminal  <br>selected on the call, in order to actually talk, you will use: <br>- the telephone set plugged into the modem - if modem terminal was selected. <br>In this case, the app simply dials the number for you, then you use the  <br>phone to talk. <br>- the microphone (talk in microphone and listen in the phone from the other  <br>end of the call) - if audio out + microphone were selected <br>- the speakers (talk in the phone set from the other end of the call and  <br>listen in your computer's speakers) - if audio in + speakers were selected. <br>For data calls, you need to select the media type "data modem" and the Null <br>terminal. <br> <br>5. The media types supported by an address are up to the telephony provider <br>which exposes that address. Unimodem supports "audio in/out" and "datamodem", <br>H323 and IPCONF support "audio in/out", "video in/out". However, for these <br>media types to be actually used, the correspoding devices must be installed  <br>on the machine, i.e. sound and/or video cards. </code></pre>
