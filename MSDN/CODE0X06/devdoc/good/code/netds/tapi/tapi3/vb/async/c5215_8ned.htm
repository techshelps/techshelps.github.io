<pre><code><br>TAPI 3.0 <br>ASYNC Sample Application <br> <br> <br>Overview: <br> <br>ASYNC is a sample TAPI 3.0 application that makes outgoing asynchronous  <br>audio (and eventually video) calls.  <br>It was developed using Visual Basic 5. <br> <br>This sample shows the most basic TAPI 3.0 functionality - finding an <br>appropriate address object and creating a call on it. <br> <br> <br>How to use: <br> <br>To run the ASYNC sample application, simply build and run ASYNC.exe, using <br>Visual Basic 5. <br>A dialog box will appear, and the user can type in a destination address <br>to dial. The user also must indicate the address type (phone number, machine <br>name, etc). So the destination address must match the selected address type. <br>Simply select an address type (e.g. "phone number"), type in a destination  <br>address (e.g. a phone number) and press the Dial button. <br> <br> <br>What functionality does this sample show: <br> <br>The ASYNC sample application shows how to make an asynchronous outgoing  <br>call with TAPI 3.0 from VB. <br>It will make an audio call and, if present, video will also be selected <br>on the call. If no audio capabilities are detected, no call is made at all. <br> <br> <br>What this sample does not show: <br> <br>This sample does not allow the user to select the media types or terminals  <br>that the user is interested in.  <br> <br>It also selects an address by picking up the first one that matches the  <br>selected address type and that supports at least the audio media types. So if  <br>there are more addresses that meet this same criteria, only the first address  <br>will be selected, the user cannot choose among them. <br> <br>The sample does not show how to receive incoming calls. <br>  <br> <br>Hints: <br> <br>1. In order for this sample to run for each of the possible address types  <br>(phone number, machine name, email name, ip address, conference name), on  <br>the computer there must be installed those service providers that support  <br>these address types: Unimodem for "phone number", H323 for "machine name,  <br>email name, ip address", IPConf for "conference name". Check Control Panel's <br>Telephony Applet to see which providers are installed and to add new providers. <br> <br>2. Depending on the selected address type, a certain device must be installed <br>on the machine, in order for the call to succeed:  <br>- for "phone number": a modem must be installed (either data modem or voice  <br>modem). <br>- for all other address types: a full duplex sound card must be installed <br>(or a sound card with a full duplex driver) so that both "audio in" and  <br>"audio out" can be selected on the call in the same time. See also the next <br>paragraph. <br> <br>3. The application selects on the call the audio media types (audio in and out),  <br>and, if present, also the video media types (video in and out).  <br>This will work only if the corresponding default device supports full duplex:  <br>the default audio device should support full duplex audio, and the default <br>video device (if video is supported) should allow full duplex video. <br>Check Control Panel - Multimedia Applet to see what are the installed  <br>audio terminals, and see/change which is the default one. If the installed  <br>sound card is not full duplex, the sample should be changed to use only  <br>1 audio media type instead of 2. <br> <br>4. The addresses of type "machine name", "email name", "ip address", and  <br>"conference name" support the video (in/out) media type too. The "video in" <br>should always be available for these address types even if the machine does  <br>not have any special hardware (but the network card, that is used to  <br>implement the address object). <br>The "video out" media type can be used only if a video card with a camera  <br>are installed on the computer.  <br>If video "in" or "out" capabilities are detected, the sample application  <br>will use them, however the calls will succeed even without a video card being  <br>installed. If no video capabilities are present, the calls will be audio only. <br> <br>Note: in order to use the "video in" media type the dynamic terminal  <br>"video window terminal" must be used, because there exists no default terminal  <br>for "video in". Dynamic terminals are created by using the desired dynamic  <br>terminal class from the collection of dynamic terminal classes exposed by the  <br>desired address. Only H323 and IPCONF addresses will enumerate video media  <br>types and therefore video dynamic terminal class. </code></pre>
