<pre><code><br>Description: <br> <br>This sample exercises MprAdmin API's against an NT 5.0 Dial-Up Server/Router <br>to enumerate info on connected ports and users, to retrieve and clear port <br>statistics, to reset and disconnect ports, and to retreive and set users' <br>dialin and callback privileges. <br> <br> <br>Platform: NT 5.0**  <br>  ** or NT 4.0 + "Routing and Remote Access" add-on, which is available as a  <br>     free download from www.microsoft.com <br> <br> <br>Requirements:  <br> <br>NT Server running Dial-Up Server/Router, configured with dialin ports.  The <br>dialin ports can be any valid media (e.g. modem, ISDN, PPTP, etc), as long <br>as a user can make a RAS connection to the server. <br> <br> <br>Source code: <br>admapit.c <br> <br>Build instructions: <br>TBD <br> <br> <br>Usage: <br> <br>1. Run this console application via the command-line: <br> <br>ADMAPIT \\SERVERNAME <br> <br>   where \\SERVERNAME is the computername of a local or remote NT Dial-Up <br>   Server/Router,   which is currently running and has ports configured  <br>   for remote users to dialin. <br> <br>2. Make a RAS connection to the server, and ADMAPIT will cycle through and <br>   enumerate port and user info, dumping statistics, resetting the port,  <br>   manipulating user permissions, and finally disconnecting the RAS  <br>   connection.  View results in the debugger and/or in three log files  <br>   (*.LOG) which are created in the directory where ADMAPIT is run. <br> <br> <br> <br>Limitations: <br> <br>This sample is designed to run against an NT Server that is a member of an  <br>NT Server domain.  If run against a standalone server, MprAdminGetPDCServer <br>will fail due to incorrect parameters, and consequently the API's <br>MprAdminUserGetInfo and MprAdminUserSetInfo will not get exercised. <br> <br> <br>List of API's exercised in the sample application: <br> <br>MprAdminIsServiceRunning <br> <br>MprAdminServerConnect <br>MprAdminServerDisconnect <br> <br>MprAdminPortEnum <br>MprAdminPortGetInfo <br>MprAdminPortClearStats <br>MprAdminPortReset <br>MprAdminPortDisconnect <br> <br>MprAdminConnectionEnum <br>MprAdminConnectionGetInfo <br>MprAdminConnectionClearStats <br> <br>MprAdminGetPDCServer <br>MprAdminUserGetInfo <br>MprAdminUserSetInfo <br> <br>MprAdminBufferFree <br> <br>MprAdminGetErrorString <br> <br> </code></pre>
