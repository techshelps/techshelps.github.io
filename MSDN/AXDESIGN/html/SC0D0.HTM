<H2>Licensing an ActiveX Designer</H2><P>ActiveX designers, like ActiveX controls, support <I>license keys</I> which can be built into an application. Using license keys, a designer can distinguish between a license valid for creating new applications that use it (a design-time license) and a license valid to run an application that uses it (a run-time license).</P>
<P>One way of handling licensing is to supply a license file (.lic) with your software components. The preferable method, however, is to register a license in the registry as part of your designer's setup procedure. Licenses are stored under the <B>Licenses </B>subkey.</P>
<P>The host handles all licensing through the <B>IClassFactory2 </B>interface. At design time, the host assumes that an ActiveX designer is appropriately licensed if the class factory successfully creates the visual designer. When the host attempts to create an executable application (.exe file), it requests a license for the run-time object. If the designer presents a license, the host uses it; if no license is presented, the host assumes that none is required.</P></FONT>
