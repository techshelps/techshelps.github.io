<H2>The Service Architecture</H2><P>A <I>service</I> is a group of related interfaces that perform a task, such as finding the code attached to an object or displaying help. A host provides services to ensure that these tasks are accomplished in a uniform way across its contained objects. </P>
<P>ActiveX designers access services through their site. The interfaces that make up the service may be implemented on the site object or on any other object to which the site has access. </P></FONT>
