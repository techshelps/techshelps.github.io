<H1>Designing and Implementing an ActiveX Designer</H1><P>The ActiveX designer model allows for flexibility in implementation. While all ActiveX designers must be embedded, in-process ActiveX components, register as designers, and provide a visual design-time interface, you still must decide what features to provide in the user interface and how to structure the run-time objects that users create. </P>
<P>In general, an ActiveX designer has two distinct parts: a visual designer, also called a design-time object, and a run-time object. The visual designer is an embedded, in-place object that is invoked in the host's environment. Through its visual user interface, end users can write code and change properties, methods, and events to create an executable application.</P>
<P>The run-time object is the customized object that the visual designer creates. When the end user builds the application, the ActiveX designer saves the information necessary to run the application. At run time, the system uses the saved information to load instances of the run-time object.</P>
