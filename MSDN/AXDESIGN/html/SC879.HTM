<H3>Browsing and Editing Properties</H3><P>ActiveX designers are not required to support per-property browsing, though it is strongly recommended that they do so. Designers that implement this feature use the ActiveX property page interfaces to create and manage property sheets. For more information, see "Managing Properties" in Chapter 4, "<font class="MissingLink" meta="adsdkSupportingActiveXInterfaces">Supporting ActiveX Interfaces</font>."</P>
<P>Visual Basic provides the <B>STrackSelection</B> service to track the user's selections and pass them appropriately to the ActiveX designer. By using the service, you can ensure that the designer's user interface works much like selecting controls on a form. See Chapter 6, "<A class="normal" href="SC840.HTM">Services</A>," for details on the service architecture.</P></FONT>
