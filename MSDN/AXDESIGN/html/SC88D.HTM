<H3>Levels of Property Support</H3><P>ActiveX Designers may support property browsing in several ways:</P>
<SPAN CLASS="list"><UL><LI CLASS="ULI1">By providing minimal support for browsing only. Users cannot change property values with the host's default mechanisms.</LI><LI CLASS="ULI1">By allowing users to view and change properties through the host's Properties window and to support changes to properties from other sources. </LI><LI CLASS="ULI1">By implementing their own property browsing mechanism that uses property pages. </LI></UL></SPAN><P>For maximum flexibility, ActiveX Designers should support all three methods.</P>
<P>If the ActiveX Designer supports only property browsing through the host's Properties window, and does not allow users to change any properties, it must support <B>IDispatch</B>. The host gains access to the set of properties to browse through the designer's implementation of <B>IProvideClassInfo</B> or <B>IProvideDynamicClassInfo</B>.</P>
<P>If the properties can change in any way other than through the property browser, the ActiveX Designer must support the connection point interfaces and <B>IPropertyNotifySink</B>. These interfaces are used to inform the host's property browser of changes to properties.</P>
<P>ActiveX Designers can also support their own property browsing through the property page mechanism. This approach allows for the most general, host-independent code, and gives your ActiveX Designer the greatest flexibility. To do this, ActiveX Designers need to support <B>IPerPropertyBrowsing</B>, <B>IPropertyPage, IPropertyPage2, IPropertyPageSite</B>, and <B>ISpecifyPropertyPages</B> in addition to <B>IDispatch </B>and the connection point interfaces.</P></FONT>
