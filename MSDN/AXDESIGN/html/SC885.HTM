<H3>Returning Object Status</H3><P>The <B>GetMiscStatus </B>method returns status information about the ActiveX Designer's <I>aspect</I>; that is, how it should be displayed and what types of behavior it supports. This method is not required by OLE or ActiveX, but ActiveX Designers must implement it. </P>
<P>For each aspect your ActiveX Designer supports, this method returns the value of the OLE miscellaneous status flags. These flags are defined in the <B>OLEMISC</B> enumeration. For ActiveX Designers, the OLEMISC_INVISIBLEATRUNTIME flag must be true if the run-time object does not have a user interface. </P>
<P>At a minimum, ActiveX Designers must handle the DVASPECT_CONTENT case, which indicates how the designer should be displayed on screen or in print, as an embedded object inside a container. This aspect defines the display of the ActiveX Designer within the host.</P>
<P>Some ActiveX Designers may also need to handle DVASPECT_DOCPRINT. This constant specifies how to display a preview of printed output. This aspect is useful for showing how a visual design-time object might be rendered. </P>
<P>You can ignore the DVASPECT_THUMBNAIL and DVASPECT_ICON values, which denote miniature and iconic representations. Currently, hosts do not use these aspects for ActiveX Designers.</P></FONT>
