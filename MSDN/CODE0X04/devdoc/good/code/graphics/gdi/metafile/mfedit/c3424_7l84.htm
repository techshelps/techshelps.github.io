<pre><code>Enhanced Metafile Editor <br> <br> <br>SUMMARY <br>======= <br> <br>The MFEDIT sample demonstrates the enhanced metafile functions. <br> <br>The metafile editor provides the following features: <br> <br> 1. Playback and recording of GDI calls. <br> 2. Embedding bitmaps and enhanced metafiles into another enhanced metafile  <br>    with transformations. <br> 3. Hit-testing against enhanced metafile records. <br> 4. Random-access playback. <br> 5. Playback of metafile records one-by-one. <br> 6. Selective recording of existing enhanced metafile records into a new  <br>    enhanced metafile. <br> 7. Drawing with pens, text, beziers, lines, ellipses, and rectangles,  <br>    embedding bitmaps, and embedding enhanced metafiles. <br> <br>MORE INFORMATION <br>================ <br> <br>1. Playback and Recording of GDI Calls <br> <br>To playback an existing enhanced metafile, choose Load Metafile from the  <br>File menu or click on the Eject button to bring up the Open File dialog box  <br>and select the appropriate file. Then click on the Play button to play it on  <br>the drawing surface. <br> <br>To record, click on the Record button and draw on the drawing surface with  <br>the graphic tools provided. When you are done, click on the Stop button. <br> <br>The GDI calls are recorded as c:\metafx.emf where x is 0, 1, 2, 3, etc. If  <br>you want to save the metafile with a different name, choose Record Metafile  <br>As from the File menu. The new filename will be used as the root for all  <br>metafiles recorded; 0, 1, 2, etc, will be appended to the root name. <br> <br>The default drawing tool is "pen". To select a different drawing tool, click  <br>on the desired tool button in the Control Panel. <br> <br>2. Embedding Bitmaps and Enhanced Metafiles Into Another Enhanced Metafile <br>   with Transformations <br> <br>Click the Record button. Select the Bitmap or Metafile tool and then embed  <br>the currently loaded bitmap or metafile as described in section 7 below.  <br>When you are done, click the Stop button. <br> <br>3. Hit-Testing Against Enhanced Metafile Records <br> <br>Playback an enhanced metafile by clicking on the Playback button. Then  <br>choose Hit Test from the Edit menu. The cursor will be changed to a cross  <br>when the mouse pointer is over the drawing surface. <br> <br>Then, click on the graphic object played back in the drawing surface. The  <br>editor will search through the metafile record after record to find the  <br>record that corresponds to the object based on the mouse position. The  <br>search provides a visual cue by changing the graphic objects to red as it  <br>goes until it hits the corresponding object. If there is a hit, the record  <br>number is displayed on the Control Panel, a beep is issued, and a hit  <br>message is displayed on the bottom. <br> <br>When you are done, remove the check from the Hit Test menu item.  <br> <br>4. Random Access Playback <br> <br>Click on the number button in the Control Panel to playback a particular  <br>record. To access a non single-digit record, click on the 10+ button an  <br>appropriate number of times, and then the appropriate number button, to  <br>bring the sum to the record desired. <br> <br>5. Playback of Metafile Records One-by-One <br> <br>Click on the Fast Forward button to play the metafile records one at a time. <br> <br>6. Selective Recording of Existing Enhanced Metafile Records into a New <br>   Enhanced Metafile. <br> <br>Click on the Record button and the appropriate number button for playing  <br>back selected metafile records in the drawing surface. The playback records  <br>are recorded into the new metafile. When you are done, click on the Stop  <br>button. <br> <br>7. Drawing With Pens, Text, Beziers, Lines, Ellipses, and Rectangles, <br>   Embedding Bitmaps, and Embedding Enhanced Metafiles <br> <br>The default pen is black. To change the pen color, simply choose the Pen  <br>menu item from the Options menu. <br> <br>The default brush used by the Fill Rectangle and Fill Ellipse routines is  <br>black. To change the brush color, simply choose Brush from the Option menu. <br> <br>The "Text" tool uses the default system font. To change the font and font  <br>attributes, simply choose Font from the Options menu. <br> <br>The "Bezier" tool takes four points initially and three thereafter. To draw  <br>a bezier curve, simply select the "Bezier" tool and click on the drawing  <br>surface three or four times to place the control points. <br> <br>To embed a currently loaded bitmap, simply select the "Bitmap" tool and  <br>click three points on the drawing surface to describe the destination of  <br>where you would like the bitmap to go. The editor will do the proper  <br>transform to the bitmap and embed the bitmap to the drawing. <br> <br>To load a bitmap, simply choose Load Bitmap from the File menu and do the  <br>selection. The "Bitmap" tool optionally takes a mask bitmap. The mask bitmap  <br>has to be a monochrome bitmap. <br> <br>To load a mask bitmap, simply choose Load Mask Bitmap from the File menu to  <br>do the selection. Select a color bitmap as the mask has the effect of  <br>resetting the mask to none. <br> <br>To embed a currently loaded enhanced metafile, simply select the "Embed  <br>Enhanced Metafile" tool and click three points on the drawing surface to  <br>describe the destination of where you would like the enhanced metafile to  <br>go. The editor will do the proper transformation on the metafile and embed  <br>it to the drawing. </code></pre>
