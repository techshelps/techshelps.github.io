<pre><code>Demonstration of the Font Functions <br> <br> <br>SUMMARY <br>======= <br> <br>The TTFONTS sample is an easy-to-use, powerful utility that allows you to  <br>explore the font system. There is a toolbar on top of the main frame window  <br>with buttons that allow the following actions: <br> <br>  - Enumerating all of the fonts installed for the display. <br>  - Getting TEXTMETRIC &amp; OUTLINETEXTMETRIC information. <br>  - Creating a font based on an arbitrary LOGFONT structure. <br>  - Getting "font data" by using the GetFontData function. <br>  - Enumerating all of the fonts available to the default printer. <br> <br>MORE INFORMATION <br>================ <br> <br>This sample is designed to provide the user with an easy interface to the  <br>function calls related to the font system. It will not protect against  <br>meaningless values, nor will it hide system oddities. Most of the buttons  <br>on the toolbar are self explanatory and represent a single system function. <br> <br>Pressing the EnumFonts button shows all of the face names, listed  <br>horizontally, and each of the fonts within that face name, listed  <br>vertically. TrueType fonts are marked with a small colored TT bitmap. Fonts  <br>that have the DEVICE_FONTTYPE bit are marked with a small bitmap image of a  <br>printer. When the enumeration windows are showing, you can click the left  <br>mouse button to copy the information about a selected font into the LOGFONT  <br>and TEXTMETRIC dialog boxes. You can dismiss this window without changing  <br>the dialog boxes by clicking the right mouse button or typing any character. <br> <br>The Display window is able to operate in any one of three modes. These are  <br>listed in the Display menu. The first just writes Hello in the middle of the  <br>screen and grids the background. This is useful when utilizing the  <br>lfEscapement and lfOrientation fields of the LOGFONT structure. The second  <br>mode writes all of the glyphs between the tmFirstChar and tmLastChar values  <br>stored in the TEXTMETRIC structure. The final mode is used only for true  <br>type fonts. It calls GetFontData, finds the cmap table, and displays glyphs  <br>from the different ranges in this table. Use the horizontal scroll bar in  <br>the display window to step through the ranges. </code></pre>
