<pre><code>PlgBlt Demonstration <br> <br> <br>SUMMARY <br>======= <br> <br>The PlgBlt function can copy a bit image onto an arbitrary parallelogram. <br>Applications can use this function to easily rotate or shear bitmaps. The <br>PLGBLT sample is an easy-to-use demonstration of how this can be done. <br> <br>MORE INFORMATION <br>================ <br> <br>The program presents a dialog box that displays the input parameters to the  <br>PlgBlt function. By choosing the "New Src" or "New Mask" button, the user  <br>can select a new bitmap for use as the source bitmap or as the monochrome  <br>mask bitmap. The client area of the window is divided into three regions.  <br>The region on the left contains the result of the PlgBlt operation. The  <br>region in the middle provides the source HDC, and the region on the right  <br>provides the mask bitmap for the PlgBlt operation. <br> <br>In each of the three regions, there is a "direct manipulation object." This  <br>object may be picked up and moved by clicking the left mouse button in the  <br>upper-left corner and dragging. The three objects are restricted in their  <br>response to user actions to correctly reflect the parameters to the PlgBlt  <br>function. The object in the mask region may be moved only. The object in the  <br>source region may be moved or sized. The object in the destination region  <br>may be moved, sized, sheared, or rotated. Please see the WXFORM sample for  <br>more information on how this direct manipulation is accomplished.  </code></pre>
