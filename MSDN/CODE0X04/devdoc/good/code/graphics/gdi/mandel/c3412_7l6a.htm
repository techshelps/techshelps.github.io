<pre><code>Demonstrating GDI and USER Functions in Fractals <br> <br> <br>SUMMARY <br>======= <br> <br>The MANDEL sample demonstrates GDI and USER functions by working with  <br>fractals. The Mandelbrot Dream provides the following features: <br> <br>  - Drawing the Mandelbrot set and the corresponding Julia set. <br>  - Zooming into any of the sets. <br>  - MDI fractal drawing windows. <br>  - Floating point math and fixed point math. <br>  - Shifting color table entries. <br>  - Changing palette entries and animating palette (color cycling). <br>  - Loading and saving bitmaps created with special effects. <br>  - Changing bitmap colors with flood fill. <br>  - Boundary tracing and creating a clip region for special effects. <br>  - Enumerating printers. <br>  - Loading RLE (or converting .bmp files to RLE) for playing in viewer. <br>  - Saving the RLE in memory to disk. <br> <br>Note: The sample makes use of 64-bit integers for its fixed point math. <br> <br>MORE INFORMATION <br>================ <br> <br>Drawing the Mandelbrot Set and the Corresponding Julia Set <br> <br>  - Choose the Mandelbrot Set menu item from the Create menu to create an  <br>    MDI child window to draw the set in, if one has not already been  <br>    created. <br> <br>  - Choose either "use Fix Point math" or "use Floating Point math" from the  <br>    Draw menu to decide if floating point or fixed point math is to be used. <br>    Fixed point is faster, however, you lose resolution sooner as you zoom  <br>    in. <br> <br>  - Choose the number of iterations from the Iteration menu item and choose  <br>    Step from the Draw menu. The higher the number of iterations, the more  <br>    detail in the picture, but the more time it takes to generate the  <br>    picture. The step determines whether every scan line is drawn. The more  <br>    scan lines, the better the picture, but the longer it takes to generate  <br>    the picture. <br> <br>  - Choose Draw Set from the Draw menu. <br> <br>  - Use the right mouse button to select a point in the Mandelbrot set (the  <br>    drawing surface of the Mandlebrot window). A new Julia MDI window is  <br>    created. Choose Draw Set from the Draw menu to start drawing. <br> <br>  - The point selected with the right mouse button determines the complex  <br>    constant to use for the Julia Set. <br> <br>Zooming Into Any of the Sets <br> <br>  - Click, drag and release with the left mouse button to describe the zoom  <br>    in the region. A new MDI child of the same type as the parent  <br>    (Mandelbrot window or Julia window) is created. <br> <br>  - Choose Draw Set from the Draw menu to start drawing. <br> <br>MDI Fractal Drawing Windows <br> <br>  - Choose either Mandelbrot Set or Julia Set from the Create menu to create  <br>    a new MDI window for drawing. <br> <br>  - Or, use the left mouse button to describe a zoom-in region in either a  <br>    Mandelbrot or Julia MDI window to create a new MDI window for drawing. <br> <br>  - Or, click on the Mandelbrot window with the right mouse button to create  <br>    a Julia MDI window corresponding to the mouse click position in the  <br>    Mandelbrot window. <br> <br>Floating Point Math and Fixed Point Math <br> <br>Choose the appropriate menu item ("Floating Point math" or "Fix Point math")  <br>from the Draw menu. The Fix Point math uses 20.11 fixed point integer  <br>arithmetic for calculations. <br> <br>Shifting Color Table Entries <br> <br>Choose Shift from the Color menu or hit F10 to shift the color table entry.  <br>The picture of the active MDI window is updated. <br> <br>Changing Palette Entries and Animating Palette (Color Cycling) <br> <br>Choose Cycle from the Color menu or hit F11 to start color cycling the  <br>picture. The menu item is grayed if the display device does not support  <br>palette management. <br> <br>Loading and Saving Bitmaps Created With Special Effects <br> <br>Choose Load Bitmap from the Bitmap menu to load a bitmap into the active  <br>child window. Or, choose Save Bitmap As to save the picture in the active  <br>MDI child window. <br> <br>Changing Bitmap Colors With Flood Fill <br> <br>Choose Custom from the Color menu to select a color. The cursor is changed  <br>to a paint can over the active child window. Click with the left mouse  <br>button on the picture; the old color under the cursor is changed to the new  <br>color. <br> <br>Boundary Tracing and Creating a Clip Region For Special Effects <br> <br>From any active Mandelbrot window, choose Set Mandelbrot Clip region from  <br>the Region menu. The boundary of the escape region is traced. The region is  <br>then selected as a clip region. Thus, if you load a bitmap for display, the  <br>bitmap only shows through the clip region. The new picture can then be  <br>saved. To remove the clip region, choose Remove Clip Region from the Region  <br>menu. <br> <br>Note:  The boundary tracing algorithm may trace out a small island of only  <br>several pixels and stop. If that happens, change the size of the window or <br>create another zoom window and trace again.  <br> <br>Enumerating Printers <br> <br>On start up, the Mandelbrot Dream enumerates the printers and inserts the  <br>printers into the Print menu. Selecting the printer on the Print menu prints <br>the picture in the active MDI window. <br> <br>Loading RLE (or convert .bmp files to RLE) for Playing in Viewer <br> <br>  - Choose the Viewer item from the Create menu to create a viewer window or  <br>    bring any existing viewer window to the top. <br> <br>  - Select Load Bitmap(s) from the File menu for loading RLE or .bmp files  <br>    into the memory from disk. <br> <br>  - Select Play or Play Continuously from the Options menu for viewing. <br> <br>  - For a demonstration, load the .\rsc\julia.rle file and select Play  <br>    Continuously. The Julia.rle is a collection of the various julia sets  <br>    along the boundary of escaping and non-escaping points of the Mandelbrot  <br>    Set. <br> <br>Saving the RLE in Memory to Disk <br> <br>  - Choose the Viewer item from the Create menu to create a viewer window or  <br>    bring any existing viewer window to the top. <br>   <br>  - Select Save Bitmap(s) from the File menu for saving the RLE(s) from  <br>    memory to disk. </code></pre>
