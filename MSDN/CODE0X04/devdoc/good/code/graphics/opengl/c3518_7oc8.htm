<pre><code>Windows NT OpenGL(R) Release Notes <br> <br>1.  OpenGL Functionality Notes <br>2.  Compiler warnings and include files <br>3.  Redistributable components for Windows 95 <br>4.  Sample Applications <br> <br> <br>1.  Functionality Notes <br>----------------------- <br> <br>The OpenGL API is supported on a variety of graphics hardware; the <br>software in this release provides support for graphics hardware including <br>basic emulation on any video adapter that is supported with the operating <br>system. This release of OpenGL will run on all supported hardware under  <br>Windows NT 4.00 and Windows 95, including VGA and Super VGA 16 color mode  <br>displays, and, for WIndows NT, including all RISC platforms. <br> <br>The runtime libraries for Windows NT are also available bundled with the <br>NT workstation and server products.  The runtime libraries for Windows 95 <br>are not bundled with the Windows 95 operating system, but application <br>developers may freely redistribute from this SDK along with their applications  <br>to other Windows95 systems.  In addition, the Windows 95 libraries have been <br>bundled with the Windows95 operating system in the OEM system release 2, so <br>OEM Windows 95 systems shipping later in 1996 will begin appearing with the <br>OpenGL runtime libraries included. <br> <br>To achieve good shaded rendering with OpenGL applications, you should use a  <br>color graphics mode with 256 or more colors.  Reasonable shading is  <br>possible for most OpenGL applications with 256 colors. <br> <br>The Windows NT 4.0 and Windows 95 releases of OpenGL includes new functionality  <br>and performance enhancements.  These include: <br> <br>1) A complete implementation of OpenGL 1.1.  OpenGL 1.1 contains several  <br>functions, including vertex array, polygon offset, logic ops, and several new  <br>functions for handling textures.  The vertex array and texture calls are  <br>particularly significant, as they may enable order of magnitude performance  <br>improvements in some applications. <br> <br>2) Overlay planes extensions.  These Microsoft OpenGL extensions permit <br>applications to manage and render into overlay planes where supported <br>in the graphics hardware.  This permits applications to bring up dialog boxes <br>and other UI features without overwriting 3D renderings. <br> <br>3) Extended metafile support.  Applications may encapsulate OpenGL calls and <br>data in GDI extended metafiles.  This, together with NT 4.0 print spooler  <br>enhancements for remote metafile rendering, makes it possible to print OpenGL  <br>graphics at high resolution on the print server.  This feature is limited to  <br>the Windows NT release. <br> <br>4) Performance.  The software renderer has been tuned for this release.   <br>Performance tuning has been carried out for the front end of the OpenGL  <br>pipeline as well as for rendering particular primitives, especially  <br>anti-aliased lines and texturing.  Software rendering is generally 2-4x  <br>faster. <br> <br> <br>2.  Compiler warnings and include files <br>--------------------------------------- <br> <br>When developing or porting OpenGL source code for Windows NT, you may  <br>notice certain compiler warning messages related to floating point type  <br>conversions. <br> <br>Microsoft has recognized "acceptable" type-conversion warnings and has  <br>provided a means to ignore them in the provided OpenGL sample source files.  <br>See the included "glos.h" header file.  When using this file, be certain <br>to include it at an analogous location in your source file. <br> <br> <br>3. Redistributable components for Windows 95 <br>-------------------------------------------- <br> <br>The OpenGL redistributable components for Windows 95 are in the  <br>\MSTOOLS\OPENGL95 directory.  Under this are the following subdirectories: <br> <br>- DLL contains the runtime dynamic-link libraries for OpenGL and GLU. <br>  We recommend either of two methods for redistributing these libraries <br>  with your application on Windows 95 (for Windows NT, the libraries are <br>  bundled with the operating system and should not be redistributed): <br>  1) In your setup program, install these libraries in the  <br>     application directory along with your application.  This gives you <br>     greater control over the version of OpenGL that your application <br>     will link to (an issue if other applications install other versions <br>     of the library), but also gives you greater responsibility for  <br>     updating your customers' libraries if and when that is required <br>     to address defects, add functionality, etc. <br>  2) In your setup program, install these libraries in the windows <br>     system directory.  If you do this, you should use the Win32 setup <br>     API call VerInstallFile to help prevent installing an older version <br>     of the libraries over another application's installation of a more <br>     recent version of the libraries. <br> <br>- MGA contains the binaries for Matrox MGA Impression Plus graphics card. <br>  It includes 3D DDI support for enhanced OpenGL performance in 1024x768 <br>  at 256 color mode or 800x600 at 16bpp mode on WIndows 95.  (3D DDI is <br>  not supported in this release of Windows NT.)  Note that 4MB of video <br>  memory is required for these modes.  No 32bpp accelerated modes are <br>  supported at this time.  (In addition, index color mode fails buffer <br>  invariance conformance tests.) <br> <br>- SCRSAVE contains 4 screen savers for Windows95 systems.  These should  <br>  be copied into the windows system directory of your system. <br> <br> <br>4.
