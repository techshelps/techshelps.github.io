<pre><code>DPLAUNCH <br>-------- <br> <br>Sample application to demonstrate how to launch a DirectPlay application <br>using the IDirectPlayLobby::RunApplication function. You can also use the <br>BELLHOP sample lobby client application and the sample lobby server to do <br>this. <br> <br>Note: MSVC may include older versions of the DirectX header files and <br>libraries.  This sample requires DirectX 5.  In order to avoid compile <br>errors, make sure the path to the DirectX 5 header files and libraries are <br>listed BEFORE the MSVC header files and libraries through the <br>Tools -&gt; Options -&gt; Directories menu. <br> <br>Instructions: <br> <br>1) Choose which application to launch. This dropdown listbox uses <br>   IDirectPlayLobby::EnumLocalApplications to see what applications <br>   are available. <br>2) Choose which service provider to use. <br>3) Choose the player name for this machine <br>4) Choose either "Host Session" and supply a name for the session <br>        - or - <br>   Choose "Join Session" and supply the network address of the machine <br>   that is hosting the session.  IPX requires no network address, <br>   Internet TCP/IP requires an IP address or machine name, modem requires <br>   a phone number to call and a modem. <br>5) Click on "Run Application" <br> <br>Notes: <br> <br>- Make sure you use DPLAUNCH to launch an application on one machine <br>  with the "Host Session" option first.  Then launch the application <br>  on other machines (using DPLAUNCH) with the same service provider using <br>  the "Join Session" option and the network address of the host (if needed) <br> <br>- DPLAUNCH will only join sessions that were created using DPLAUNCH. The <br>  reason is that the session instance GUID is hard coded in DPLAUNCH. <br>  Normally, DirectPlay generates one (if the application was not lobbied) <br>  or a lobby server generates one and passes it to the lobby clients. <br> <br>- A real lobby client would be an application similar to DPLAUNCH but it <br>  would be communicating with some lobby server to obtain all the <br>  parameters for the IDirectPlayLobby::RunApplication call. </code></pre>
