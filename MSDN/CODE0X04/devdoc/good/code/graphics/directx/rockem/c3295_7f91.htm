<pre><code>Rockem 3D Sample Game <br>--------------------- <br> <br>This game demonstrates many of the features of Direct X, including DirectDraw, <br>Direct 3D &amp; DirectSound. It also demonstrates DirectSound3D. <br>It is important to note that this game is not optimised for raw speed.  It <br>is meant to give a clear demonstration of how the DirectX technologies can <br>be used. <br> <br>When you build this sample, it will create a rockem3d.exe file in either <br>the retail or debug subdirectories, depending on which version you built. <br>However, you must then copy the .exe up one directory to the Rockem sample <br>root (i.e. c:\dxsdk\sdk\samples\rockem).  This is because rockem also needs <br>to find its .wav files and other resources from that dir. <br> <br>The commands which this game recognizes are listed on the opening screen. <br> <br>    ESC            - Quit <br>    F1              - Camera side view <br>    F2              - Camera behind view <br>    F3              - Camera head view <br>    F5              - Toggle stats <br>    F6              - Go up a video mode <br>    F7              - Go down a video mode <br>    END             - Highest video mode <br>    HOME            - Lowest video mode <br>    Control - M     - Toggle music <br>    Control - S     - Toggle sound <br>    Control         - Block <br>    SpaceBar        - Attack <br>    Up Arrow        - Move forward <br>    Down Arrow      - Move backwards </code></pre>
