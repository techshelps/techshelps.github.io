<pre><code>Mid2Strm Sample Readme File <br>=========================== <br> <br>This sample is related to the mstream sample, and contains a subset of the <br>functionality of mstream. <br> <br>Mid2strm converts a .mid file (standard midi file) into a format which can <br>be easily sent to the the midiStreamXxx APIs.  It takes a .mid file as <br>input, and produces a .mds file as output.  Note that .mds files are not <br>a standard Windows file format; for example, they can't be played back by <br>mplayer.  Your application must play the file back by sending the data to <br>the midiStreamXxx APIs as shown in the mstream sample. <br> <br>The midiStreamXxx APIs expect a buffer containing 3 DWORDs per MIDI event: <br>the event, the time stamp, and the stream ID.  The mid2strm sample will <br>create a buffer of this format and store it as a .mds file.  Of course, <br>the file will be larger than the .mid file.  To save space, you can specify <br>the -c option.  This specifies that stream IDs should not be included in the <br>file, compressing the file by 1/3.  This assumes that all stream IDs will be <br>zero; for most applications, this is sufficient.  Note, however, that the <br>stream ID DWORD will have to be inserted into the buffer before it is sent <br>to the midiStreamXxx APIs. <br> <br>Please see the mstream readme file for more information. </code></pre>
