<pre><code>DPSLOTS.EXE <br>------------ <br> <br>Sample application to demonstrate how to build a client/server <br>application using DirectPlay. <br> <br>Note: MSVC may include older versions of the DirectX header files and <br>libraries.  This sample requires DirectX 5.  In order to avoid compile <br>errors, make sure the path to the DirectX 5 header files and libraries are <br>listed BEFORE the MSVC header files and libraries through the <br>Tools -&gt; Options -&gt; Directories menu. <br> <br>CLIENT/SERVER <br>------------- <br> <br>DPSLOTS is really two applications in one. When you host a session, it acts <br>as a server. The server maintains a simple database of account balances for <br>every user that is allowed to log in. Clients can request their current <br>balance from the server and can request that the server spin the wheels and <br>calculate the amount won or lost. <br> <br>The server uses a simple text file to record the balance for each user. Each <br>line of the text file contains the user account ID and a 8-character balance <br>figure separated by a comma, as in: <br> <br>Account1,    1000 <br>Account2,     500 <br> <br>You will have to manually add lines to this file for each user. <br> <br>When you join a session, DPSLOTS acts as a client and sends messages to the <br>server for all operations. After requesting a spin from the server, it <br>animates the tumblers and displays the results. The client may be required <br>to log the user into the server using a name and password. <br> <br>SECURITY <br>-------- <br> <br>DPSLOTS can be hosted using security by clicking the "Require Secure Login" <br>checkbox after choosing to host.  By leaving the "Security Provider" editbox <br>blank the default NTLM security package will be used.  If you have an <br>alternate SSPI security package installed, it may be specified here. <br> <br>Once this is done, the server will host a secure session and clients will <br>have to securely log in with a user name and a password before being <br>allowed access to the server. All messages between the client and server <br>will be digitally signed and encrypted. <br> <br>When hosting a secure server, the account ID for each user will be defined <br>by the security package being used. This account ID must be stored in the <br>database file along with the appropriate balance. <br> <br>The default security package is NTLM, which uses a domain and a user name <br>for the account ID. For example, if your domain is "GAMES" and you have two <br>users "Bob" and "Jane", your database file would look like: <br> <br>GAMES/Bob,    1000 <br>GAMES/Jane,     500 <br> <br>Currently you can only host a secure session using NTLM on Windows NT <br>workstation or server. However, you can log into the server from Windows 95 <br>or Windows NT. </code></pre>
