<pre><code>DirectSound Streaming Test (dsstream) <br>------------------------------------- <br> <br>This sample illustrates how to play a long sound using a streaming <br>DirectSoundBuffer.  Because of this design, it may not work correctly when <br>using very short sounds, like only 1 or 2 seconds long.  Those files are  <br>more appropriate for static buffers; see DirectSound Mixing Test (dsshow) <br>for examples of how to code such buffers. <br> <br>Open a .wav files using the File.Open dialog.  The UI of the sample only <br>allows you to open one file at a time; however, this is a limitation of the <br>sample, not a limitation of DirectSound. <br> <br>There are buttons to Play and Stop the file, and a checkbox to indicate <br>whether the file should be looped or not.  Regardless of the checkbox, <br>the DirectSoundBuffer will be played with looping since a streaming buffer <br>is being used. <br> <br>There are sliders to control the sound's frequency, pan, and volume settings. <br>In addition, there is a slider indicating the progress through the sound <br>data. <br> <br>The last thing to know: you can toggle Options.Enumerate Drivers, which <br>will show you what objects DirectSoundEnumerate will list for you, and allow <br>you to select one.  This only happens when you start up Dsstream, so to see <br>the effect, select this menu item, exit Dsstream, and then run Dsstream <br>again. <br> </code></pre>
