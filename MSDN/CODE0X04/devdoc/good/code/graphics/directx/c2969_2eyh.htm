<pre><code>DirectX 5 Release Notes for the Platform SDK <br>---------------------------------------------- <br> <br>Setting up your DirectX build environment <br>----------------------------------------- <br>To setup your DirectX build environment, edit the  <br>&lt;sdkdir&gt;\samples\graphics\directx\dxsetenv.bat <br>file to point to the location of your compiler, assembler, and the location <br>of the Platform SDK. Run the dxsetenv.bat batch file. <br> <br>Windows 95-specific libs (VC and Watcom) are installed to &lt;sdkdir&gt;\lib.  <br>Windows 95-specific libs (Borland) are installed to &lt;sdkdir&gt;\lib\borland.  <br> <br>If you have problems building the samples when running under a DOS Command  <br>box, try using a NT DOS CMD box instead. Start\Run, Type "CMD", hit enter".     <br> <br>If you encounter problems building samples using the default build  <br>environment, you may need to edit the DXSETENV.BAT file to use WINDEF.H  <br>released with Microsoft Visual C++ version 5.0. <br> <br>SDK Samples <br>----------- <br> <br>To ensure compatability with all editors, all tabs in sample source code files <br>have been replaced with spaces. <br> <br>All SDK samples are designed to be built in the directory they are in.   <br>Once your Win32 development environment is set up, you  <br>can go to any sample directory and do a make. <br> <br>There is a main make file in each sample directory: <br>MAKEFILE        - for use with Microsoft VC++ 2.0 or higher (NMAKE) <br> <br>There are 2 ways to build each sample, debug or retail.   To build a <br>sample as retail with VC++, just type: <br> <br>nmake nodebug=1 <br> <br>To build a sample as debug with VC++, just type: <br> <br>nmake <br> <br>There is also a master make file in the SAMPLES directory that will compile <br>all the samples at once: <br>MAKEFILE        - for use with Microsoft VC++ 2.0 or higher (NMAKE) <br> <br> <br>Creating a setup program for your game <br>--------------------------------------- <br>We have included the source code to a sample setup program for a game <br>which uses the DirectX runtimes. The source for this program is located in  <br>&lt;sdkdir&gt;\samples\Graphics\DirectX\setup. Note that to build  <br>your own custom setup program, all you need to do is edit the copy_list  <br>at the start of DINSTALL.C to be your list of files, search for  <br>"fox", and then for "bear", and change things appropriately. <br> <br>Next, create a game directory that includes your files and the setup program  <br>you have built. Xcopy /s the &lt;sdkdir&gt;\redist\DirectX5\win95\directx directory to the  <br>root of your game directory, i.e.: <br> <br>XCOPY /S c:\mssdk\redist\DirectX5\win95\directx\*.* D:\FUNGAME <br> <br>If you are building an autorun CD title, you can copy the AUTORUN.INF at  <br>&lt;sdkdir&gt;\samples\Graphics\DirectX\setup to the root of your game directory.  <br>If your installation program is called SETUP.EXE, you will not have to make  <br>any changes to this file. If it is called something else, then you can edit  <br>AUTORUN.INF appropriately. <br> <br> <br>Notes for users of Visual C++ 4.2 <br>--------------------------------- <br>Visual C++ 4.2 includes the DX2 header files and libraries.  If you are <br>getting errors compiling the samples, make sure that the DX5 include <br>and lib paths come before the MSVC++ 4.2 include and libs. <br> <br> <br>Notes for users of Watcom C/C++ <br>------------------------------- <br>Watcom C/C++ v10.6 is required to compile the DXSDK samples. <br>v10.0 is not sufficient. The Microsoft Windows Platform SDK is also required <br>and is expected to be in \MSTOOLS on the same drive as your DXSDK <br>sample files. If the Platform SDK is elsewhere, you can set the MSTOOLS <br>environment variable to point to its root directory (e.g. set <br>MSTOOLS=\MSTOOLS). <br> <br>Change lines 408-410 of SAMPLES\WIN32.MAK from: <br>        libc = libc.lib oldnames.lib <br>        libcmt = libcmt.lib oldnames.lib <br>        libcdll = msvcrt.lib oldnames.lib <br>to: <br>        libc = <br>        libcmt = <br>        libcdll = <br> <br>The Watcom makefiles expect the WATCOM environment variable <br>to be set, as it should have been by the Watcom installation procedure. <br> <br>Only a subset of the samples have Watcom makefiles. <br> <br>Watcom and Watcom C/C++ are trademarks of Powersoft, Watcom Division. <br></code></pre>
