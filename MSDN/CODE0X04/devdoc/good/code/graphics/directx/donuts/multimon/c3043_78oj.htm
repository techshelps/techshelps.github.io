<pre><code>MultiMonitor Space Donuts (Donuts2) <br>----------------------------------- <br> <br>This sample game demonstrates multimonitor DirectDraw programming. <br>Multiple display monitors are supported in Windows98 and Windows NT 5.0 <br>and versions of DirectX beginning with DX5A. <br> <br>Donuts2 will only run on multimonitor capable systems - that is, it requires <br>that your system have installed the software listed above. If this is <br>the case, Donuts2 will run on any number of monitors from one (single <br>display) to a maximum of nine (monster display). <br> <br>The play area in Donuts2 is determined by the monitor configuration of <br>your Windows desktop, which may be adjusted in the Display/Settings tab of <br>the Control Panel. The amount of video RAM you have on each video card <br>will determine the maximum resolutions at which you will experience a <br>reasonable frame rate. <br> <br>The commands which this game recognizes are listed on the opening screen. <br> <br>    ESC, F12        - Quit <br>    NUMPAD 4        - Turn left <br>    NUMPAD 6        - Turn right <br>    NUMPAD 5        - Stop moving <br>    NUMPAD 8        - Accelerate forward <br>    NUMPAD 2        - Accelerate backward <br>    SPACEBAR        - Fire <br>    NUMPAD 7        - Shield <br>    ENTER           - Starts game <br>    F5              - toggle frame rate display <br>    F3              - toggle audio <br>    F1              - toggle cheesy trails effect <br> <br>Command line switches: <br> <br>    -S              - turn off sound <br>     <br> <br>Sound code <br>---------- <br> <br>The sound code in this application is deliberately designed <br>to be stressful.  For example, each bullet on the screen uses a different <br>sound buffer.  Over 70 sound buffers are created (including duplicates) <br>and 20-25 may be playing at any time.  This could be made much more <br>efficient, but we wanted code to stress our API and mixer. <br> <br> <br>Make files <br>---------- <br> <br>Two makefiles are provided: MAKEFILE builds Donuts2 without sound support, <br>and MAKEWSND builds Donuts2 with sound support. Specify nodebug=1 on the <br>NMAKE command line to build a release version. <br> </code></pre>
