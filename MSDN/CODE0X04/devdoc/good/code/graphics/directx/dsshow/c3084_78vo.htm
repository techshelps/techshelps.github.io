<pre><code>DirectSound Mixing Test (dsshow) <br>-------------------------------- <br> <br>This app allows the user to play with most of the controls exposed by <br>DirectSoundBuffers, including the mixing of multiple sounds, and changing <br>frequency, pan, and volume of those sounds. <br> <br>Open one or more .wav files using the File.Open dialog.  A control bar will <br>be displayed for each file opened.  Dsshow uses static buffers for its sounds <br>and is therefore designed for short sounds only.  If you try to open a file <br>that is very large, you will run out of system memory - beware! <br> <br>The control bar for each sound contains a bunch of things.  First, the file <br>name is displayed at the top.  The next line states whether the buffer is <br>mixed in software (SW) or hardware (HW), and whether the buffer is playing <br>or stopped.  Dsshow will put buffers in hardware whenever possible.  On the <br>next two lines, the current play and write cursors are displayed.  They are <br>updated every half second or so.  Then there are sliders to control the <br>buffers frequency, pan, and volume settings.  At the bottom, there is a <br>Play/Stop button (it morphs back and forth, try it!) and a Close button (to <br>delete the file from the view), and a checkbox for Looping. <br> <br>The dsshow title bar tells you information about the hardware mixing <br>capabilities of your sound card.  It displays the number of free hw mixing <br>channels and hw memory (if you have an ISA card like most people).  If both <br>of those numbers are 0, your card does not have hardware mixing. <br> <br>There are also two interesting things you can do from the Options menu. <br>First, you can set the format of the primary buffer by selecting <br>Options.Output Type.  This will list the formats supported by the primary <br>buffer, and let you choose one.  Also, you can toggle Options.Enumerate Drivers <br>which will show you what objects DirectSoundEnumerate will list for you, <br>and allow you to select one.  This only happens when you start up Dsshow, <br>so to see the effect, select this menu item, exit Dsshow, and then run Dsshow <br>again. <br> </code></pre>
