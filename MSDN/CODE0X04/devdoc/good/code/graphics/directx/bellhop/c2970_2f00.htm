<pre><code>BELLHOP.EXE <br>----------- <br> <br>Bellhop is a DirectPlay sample that demonstrates how to write a lobby client <br>application using the DirectPlay API. <br> <br>Note: MSVC may include older versions of the DirectX header files and <br>libraries.  This sample requires DirectX 5.  In order to avoid compile <br>errors, make sure the path to the DirectX 5 header files and libraries are <br>listed BEFORE the MSVC header files and libraries through the <br>Tools -&gt; Options -&gt; Directories menu. <br> <br>To use the Bellhop application, a DirectPlay lobby server must be running on <br>a computer on the network. <br> <br>Lobby Server Setup <br>------------------ <br>The lobby server application is called LSERVER.EXE and can be found in the <br>\sdk\bin folder.  Double click on this application to start it. <br> <br>To initialize the lobby server in its default mode, click on the "Server" <br>menu. Choose "Start" to start the lobby server.  The lobby server will create <br>several default top-level groups to start with. Users will only be allowed <br>to create sub-groups within the top-level groups, staging areas, or shortcuts <br>to staging areas. <br> <br>By choosing "Test Mode" in the "Server" menu before clicking "Start", the <br>lobby server will be in test mode.  No default top-level groups will be <br>created. Users are free to create any group hierarchy they want to any depth. <br> <br>By choosing "Secure Mode" in the "Server" menu before clicking "Start", the <br>lobby will require clients to login to the lobby server but only if the lobby <br>server is being run on Windows NT 4.0 as described in the DirectPlay readme. <br> <br>The lobby server will then ask which service provider to use - all clients <br>connecting to the server will need to select this same service provider. <br>Provide a name for the lobby server session. <br> <br>Bellhop <br>------- <br>Bellhop is used by people trying to find other people to play games with. By <br>launching Bellhop and connecting to the lobby server, you can navigate <br>through the "rooms" (represented by a door icon) on the lobby server to <br>find other people whom you can chat with.  You can create or join "staging <br>areas" (represented by the triangle icon) to launch DirectPlay lobby aware <br>games. <br> <br>Starting Bellhop: <br> <br>After launching bellhop, you will be asked to select a "lobby provider".  A <br>lobby provider is a DLL installed on your system that is used by DirectPlay <br>to communicate with a particular lobby server.  A sample lobby provider is <br>installed as part of the SDK.  Other lobby server developers will need to <br>create and install their own lobby providers in order for Bellhop to work <br>with them.  Choose "Lobby Connection for DirectPlay" <br> <br>You will then be presented with a dialog asking you to select a service <br>provider. The sample lobby server and lobby provider are capable of operating <br>over any network supported by DirectPlay which is why you are presented with <br>this choice.  Select an appropriate service provider (like TCP/IP) and click <br>OK. <br> <br>As usual with TCP/IP, you will be prompted for the address of the lobby <br>server.  You may leave it blank to try to find it on your local network or <br>you can enter the computer name or its IP address.  When the lobby server <br>name is displayed, join it. <br> <br>Using Bellhop: <br> <br>To move your player from doorway to doorway, double-click on the doorway you <br>wish to enter.  You can also drag and drop the icon representing your player <br>on top of the doorway. <br>  <br>There is optional support for allowing players in multiple rooms <br>simultaneously. To enable it, uncomment the code in the CreatePlayer section <br>of CGroupTree and rebuild.  For every player created, a player is added to <br>the root of the tree control. You can enter simultaneous rooms by dragging the <br>player icon from the top level onto a doorway. <br> <br>You can only see the contents of rooms that you are a member of.  Once you <br>leave a room, all the doorways and players in that room will disappear. <br> <br>Context menus are enabled throughout the tree control. Right clicking on a <br>player or group will present you with the options available for that specific <br>item. If you right click on the background of the tree control, you can <br>select refresh to re-enumerate all the groups and players your player is <br>aware of. <br> <br>To create a staging area, right click on the folder which you want to create <br>it in.  Select "CreateGroupInGroup".  In this dialog, you can create either a <br>sub-folder or a staging area. If you choose to create a staging area, you <br>will need to select which game to play from the listbox (only registered <br>lobby-aware applications are listed) and which connection to launch the game <br>on. Optionally, you can specify a password for the session and the maximum <br>number of players. <br> <br>If you want to join a staging area, you can right click on the icon and <br>select "GetGroupConnectionSettings" which shows you properties of the staging <br>area. You can modify these settings using "SetGroupConnectionSettings". <br> <br>To start a game from a staging area, right click on the staging area icon and <br>select "StartSession".  This will launch the application on the machines of <br>all the people in the staging area and connect them together in a session. <br> <br>If you move into the staging area after the session has started, you may <br>select "StartSession" to join the session in progress. If the session is in <br>progress, the icon will change from a green triangle to a red and black <br>triangle.  <br> <br>You can create a shortcut to a room by drag dropping one doorway on top of <br>another.  The icon will appear as a doorway surrounded by a magic portal. <br> <br>You can change the name of local groups or players by selecting <br>SetGroupName\SetPlayerName from the appropriate context menu or by single <br>clicking on the text of the item within the tree control. <br> <br>Spectators are essentially the same as a regular player within the lobby.  </code></pre>
