<pre><code>Direct3DRM Object Viewer <br>Copyright (C) 1995, 1996 Microsoft Corporation. All Rights Reserved. <br> <br>This is a stand alone D3DRM app that allows you to load and view 3d <br>objects. <br> <br>The initial scene has a light source in the top right. To see this the <br>view can be moved backwards and forwards using the T and R <br>keys. Additional objects can be loaded from the file menu, and new <br>light sources can be added from the lights menu.  Objects can be <br>rotated with the left mouse button and dragged with the right. <br> <br>The last object that was rotated or dragged remains the current <br>selection. <br> <br>The device quality can be altered using the Renderer menu. Using this <br>menu the type of device used can also be switched from ramp to <br>RGB. When using the RGB device the color of lights in the scene can be <br>changed in the same way as you change the color of objects. In 256 <br>color mode it is advisable to dither an RGB device for best results. <br> <br>Additional keyboard controls <br> <br>T Forwards <br>R Back <br>Z Move current selection forwards <br>X Move current selection back. <br>Ctrl+G Gouraud shade <br>Ctrl+F Flat Shade <br>Ctrl+D Dither toggle. <br>Arrow Keys Move left/right/up/down <br>Delete Delete the current selection. </code></pre>
