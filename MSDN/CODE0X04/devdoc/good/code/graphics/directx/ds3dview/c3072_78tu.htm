<pre><code>Reality Lab / DirectSound 3D Viewer Sample <br> <br>DS3DVIEW.EXE <br> <br>This sample is a simple extension of the 3D object viewer sample that shipped <br>with DirectX 2.  It allows you to attach sounds to objects and move them around <br>a bit in 3D. <br> <br>Viewer Notes: <br>------------- <br>The initial scene has a light source in the top right. To see this the view <br>can be moved backwards and forwards using the T and R keys. Additional objects <br>can be loaded from the file menu, and new light sources can be added from the <br>lights menu.  Objects can be rotated with the left mouse button and dragged <br>with the right. <br> <br>The last object that was rotated or dragged is the current selection. <br> <br>The device quality can be altered using the Renderer menu. Using this menu the <br>type of device used can also be switched from ramp to RGB. When using the RGB <br>device the colour of lights in the scene can be changed in the same way as you <br>change the colour of objects. In 256 colour mode it is advisable to dither an <br>RGB device for best results. <br> <br> <br> <br>Additional keyboard controls <br> <br>T               Forwards. <br>R               Back. <br>Z               Move current selection forwards. <br>X               Move current selection back. <br>G               Gouraud shade <br>F               Flat Shade <br>D               Dither toggle. <br>Delete  Delete the current selection. <br> <br> <br>Sound Notes: <br>------------ <br> <br>To attach a sound to an object, select the object and then select the "Attach Sound" <br>command from the Sound menu.  You can then select a WAV file to load.  To hear the <br>sound, select "Play Sound Once" or "Play Sound Looping."  To hear some neat effects, <br>try "Orbit" which will orbit the object/sound around the listener, or "Bullet," <br>which will shoot the object/sound past the listener's head. <br> <br>Properties for the sound or the listener can also be modified using the appropriate <br>menu commands and dialogs. <br> <br> </code></pre>
