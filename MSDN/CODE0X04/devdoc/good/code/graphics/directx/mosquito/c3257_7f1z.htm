<pre><code>MOSQUITO is a simple app to demonstrate the use of overlays in DirectDraw. <br>To run the app you must have a display adapter and driver which support <br>overlays. <br> <br>On a machine with overlay support, the app creates a big flapping mosquito <br>which flys around the screen.   If you're card doesn't support "Source Color <br>Keying" of overlays, you'll see an ugly black rectangular background around <br>the mosquito. <br> <br>Some cards have better overlay support in certain resolutions that others. <br>If you know your card has overlay support through DirectDraw, but Mosquito <br>is having problems creating or displaying the overlay, try running the <br>application in a lower screen resolution and/or color depth. </code></pre>
