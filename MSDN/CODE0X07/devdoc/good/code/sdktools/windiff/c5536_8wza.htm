<pre><code>A Graphical Difference Program <br> <br> <br>SUMMARY <br>======= <br> <br>The WINDIFF tool takes two files, or two directories, and does a  <br>byte-for-byte file comparison. It then displays the results in a scrollable  <br>window, lining up the identical parts, and marking with color the parts of  <br>the files that differ. This application can be useful for doing source level  <br>management of code.  <br> <br>This multithread tool allows you to interact with the window while the file  <br>comparisons occur in the background. <br> <br>MORE INFORMATION <br>================ <br> <br>Usage: <br> <br>WINDIFF [paths] [saveoption] <br> <br>paths <br> <br>Can be either of the following forms: <br>    <br>    path  <br>        Compare what's in the path with what's in the current directory. <br>    <br>    path1 path2 <br>        Compare what's in path1 with what's in path2. <br> <br>saveoption <br> <br>Can be any combination of the following flags: <br> <br>    -s: Write the names of files that appear in both paths. <br>    -l: Write the names of files that appear in only the left-hand path. <br>    -r: Write the names of files that appear in only the right-hand path. <br>    -d: Write the names of files that appear in both paths, but the files  <br>        are different. <br> <br>Colors: <br> <br>RED designates text from the left-hand file. <br>YELLOW designates text from the right-hand file. <br>BLUE designates a moved line. <br>BLACK is used for everything else. </code></pre>
