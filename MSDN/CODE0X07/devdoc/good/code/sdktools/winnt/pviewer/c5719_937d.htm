<pre><code>Process Viewer <br> <br> <br>SUMMARY <br>======= <br> <br>The PView tool reads the information (counters) from the registry that  <br>relate to the threads and processes running on your machine. It also allows  <br>you to change the priority of the processes. There is about a third of the  <br>code necessary to do the same thing on a thread-by-thread basis. If you wish  <br>to learn more, you may want to try to complete the code. <br> <br>MORE INFORMATION <br>================ <br> <br>Two list boxes present themselves on startup. One list box is the list of  <br>processes. When a particular process is selected, the other list box will  <br>contain the threads that are associated with the selected process. Clicking  <br>on the Memory Details button brings up another dialog box that contains more  <br>detail on how the memory associated with that process is being used. Another  <br>list box allows you to see how the memory usage breaks down at the DLL  <br>level. <br> <br>NOTE: There is also code in the program to allow you to look at the threads  <br>on other machines. The implementation and activation of this feature is left  <br>as an exercise for the user. <br> <br>The way the program works may not be obvious at first. It is important to  <br>note that when the programmer named a function PaintAddressSpace, it wasn't  <br>named this way because it fills the monitored process/thread's memory.  <br>PaintAddressSpace fetches all of the information associated with the  <br>specified process/thread. <br> </code></pre>
