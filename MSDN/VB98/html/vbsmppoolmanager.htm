This sample app is an example of a simple pool manager that could be used to maintain open instances of Automation servers for client applications. Using this scheme, client applications ask the pool manager for a pointer to an object they want to use. The pool manager checks the pool, and either grants or denies the request. This approach has a number of benefits:
<ul type=disc>
<li>
It avoids the lengthy Automation server creation costs associated with each client request. This is because the pool is typically created before a client needs a server.<br><br></li>
<li>
Based on the frequency of client requests, the potential number of clients, and the duration of server tasks, a pool size can be created (or even adjusted as demand dictates at various times) that is significantly smaller than a one-to-one allocation scheme for clients and servers. For example: if the number of clients is 60, the average frequency of requests is one per minute per client, and the average duration of a server task is one second. A linear allocation plan would suggest that one server is needed to meet the needs of 60 clients. Realistically, requests will not be perfectly spaced; therefore, a reasonable level of redundancy, for instance a pool size of 5 Automation servers, could be used to meet the normal needs of the 60 clients.<br><br></li>
<li>
It limits the number of servers that can be created of a specific type to a threshold that has been determined by the server administrator. This can be a very useful tuning parameter, and can also be useful in preventing the server from being abused by a peak request of a low priority server.</li>
</ul>
<p>
The server in this project uses a visible form purely for demonstration purposes. There is no functional need for the server to have any UI, though state information presented through a UI can help with debugging or run-time monitoring needs. (State monitoring requirements can also be addressed by providing a status method on the server that can be queried by a monitor application.)</p>

<h3>To Run</h3>
<p>
From the Visual Basic <b>File</b> menu, choose <b>Open Project</b> and select the Pmgr_svr.vbp file, which is listed in the <object id=alink_2 type="application/x-oleobject"
	classid="clsid:adb880a6-d8ff-11cf-9377-00aa003b7a11">
<PARAM name="Command" value="ALink">
<PARAM name="DefaultTopic" value="_topic_not_found.htm">
<PARAM name="Item1" value="">
<PARAM name="Item2" value="vbsamples">
</object><a href=JavaScript:alink_2.Click()>Samples</a> directory. Press F5 or choose <b>Start</b> from the <b>Run</b> menu to run the server project.</p>
<p>
Once running, this project temporarily registers its classes in the system registry. You can then start a second instance of Visual Basic to run Pmgr_cli.vbp, the client that uses the class modules defined in Pmgr_svr.vbp.</p>
<p class=indent>
<B><b>Note</b></B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Automation server can be run on the same machine as the client, or it can be run on a remote machine to benefit from distributed processing power and support multi-user access. The Automation server does not need to be recompiled or changed in any way to support this location independence.</p>
