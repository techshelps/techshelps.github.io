<p>
The DHTML ShowMe (DhShowMe.vbp) sample application demonstrates how you can use features of dynamic HTML to create special effects in your DHTML applications. See "Developing DHTML Applications," in the <i>Building Internet Applications</i> book of the C<i>omponent Tools Guide</i> for more information on the concepts in this sample.</p>

<h3>To Run</h3>
<p>
From the Visual Basic <b>File</b> menu, choose <b>Open Project</b> and select the DhShowMe.vbp file, which is listed in the <object id=alink_1 type="application/x-oleobject"
	classid="clsid:adb880a6-d8ff-11cf-9377-00aa003b7a11">
<PARAM name="Command" value="ALink">
<PARAM name="DefaultTopic" value="_topic_not_found.htm">
<PARAM name="Item1" value="">
<PARAM name="Item2" value="vbsamples">
</object><a href=JavaScript:alink_1.Click()>Samples</a> directory. Press F5 or choose <b>Start</b> from the <b>Run</b> menu to run the application.</p>
<h3>To View at Design Time</h3>
<p>
In order to view the application at design time, you may need to reset the SourceFile property for each .dsr file to indicate the location to which you installed the design time .htm files, if your directory structure is different than the directory structure used for the original file. For example, if you installed the samples onto drive D: in a subdirectory called \mydocuments\samples\vb\, you would edit the SourceFile property for the event bubbling page to be "d:\mydocuments\samples\vb\eventbub.htm."</p>
<p class=indent>
<B><b>Note</b></B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This restriction applies to design time only. The path of the SourceFile property has no effect on running the previously-compiled application. You only need to reset this property if you cannot view the pages at design time, or if you recompile the project.</p>
