Sub Main is designated as the Startup Object in the <b>Project Properties</b> dialog, however, the current project doesn't have a Sub procedure named Main in any module.
<ul type=disc>
<li>
Sub Main was created in a Form or Class module, instead of in a standard module.<p class=tl>
Add a standard module to the project, and in that module create a Sub procedure named Main.</P></li>
<li>
The project was created as a Visual Basic 4.0 OLE server (that is, it had at least one class module whose <b>Public</b> property was <b>True</b>) and a form was designated as its Startup Object.<p class=tl>
A form should not be used as the startup object of a component (see “Starting and Ending a Component,” in “General Principles of Component Design” in the <i>Component Tools Guide</i>). Visual Basic 4.0 could not prevent forms as startup objects of components (OLE servers).</P><p class=tl>
Later versions of Visual Basic correct this problem. When loading a project that has both a public class and a form that's been designated as the Startup Object, Visual Basic designates Sub Main as the Startup Object instead. The resulting error message alerts the user to the change.</P><p class=tl>
If you wish to show a form when your component starts, you can do so from Sub Main. It is recommended that you do so only if your program is an EXE project, and is starting because the user selected it from the Startup menu or from the Windows Explorer. You can detect this by testing <b>App.StartMode</b> at the beginning of Sub Main.</P></li>
