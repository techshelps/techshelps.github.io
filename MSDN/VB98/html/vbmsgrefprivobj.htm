<p>
You included a reference to a private object as an argument or return value in a property or method call. Private objects should never be passed outside a project. The following, all of which are prohibited, are possible causes for the error:
<ul type=disc>
<li>
A client invoked a property or method of an out-of-process component and attempted to pass a reference to a private object as one of the arguments. <br><br></li>
<li>
A client invoked a property or method of an out-of-process component and the component attempted to return a reference to a private object, or to assign such a reference to a ByRef argument.<br><br></li>
<li>
An out-of-process component has invoked a call-back method on its client and attempted to pass a reference to a private object.<br><br></li>
<li>
An out-of-process component attempted to pass a reference to a private object as an argument of an event it was raising.<br><br></li>
<li>
A client attempted to assign a private object reference to a ByRef argument of an event it was handling.</li>
</ul>
<p>
The error will always appear in the client, even if it is the fault of the server code.</p>
<p class=indent>
<B><b>Note</b></B> &nbsp; Although Visual Basic prevents you from passing references to private objects across processes, there are some cases in which Visual Basic can't detect this error and thus can't prevent it. Private objects are not designed to be used outside your project. If you pass them to a client, you may jeopardize program stability and cause incompatibility with future versions of Visual Basic. If you need to pass a private class to a client, set the Instancing property to a value other than Private.</p>
