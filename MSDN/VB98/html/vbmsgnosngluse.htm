This error occurs under one or more of the following conditions:
<ul type=disc>
<li>
A project that is running in the development environment contains a class whose Instancing property is set to <b>SingleUse</b>.<br><br></li>
<li>
A client project has previously created an instance of this <b>SingleUse</b> class.<br><br></li>
<li>
A client (it may be the same client, or another client) attempts to create a second instance of the <b>SingleUse</b> class.</li>
</ul>
<p>
The error occurs because a <b>SingleUse</b> object can only be created once per instance of the component that provides it. (That is, once an ActiveX Exe project is compiled, creating multiple instances of its <b>SingleUse</b> class will run multiple instances of the Exe component.) However, when the project is in the development environment, it is not possible to start a second instance of the project.</p>
<p>
This is a restriction on debugging projects that provide <b>SingleUse</b> classes.</p>
<p class=indent>
<B><b>Note</b></B> &nbsp; The error will occur even if the first client has released its instance of the <b>SingleUse</b> class. This is because a compiled Exe cannot provide a second instance of a <b>SingleUse</b> class, even after the first has been released.</p>
