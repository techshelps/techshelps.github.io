<p>
A record can’t be updated because it was previously deleted. This error has the following cause and solution:
<ul type=disc>
<li>
Because the <b>LockEdits</b> property for the <b>Recordset</b> object was set to <b>False</b> (optimistic locking) while the record was being edited, another user was able to delete the record before it could be updated.<p class=tl>
Set the <b>LockEdits</b> property to <b>True</b> (pessimistic locking).</P></li>
</ul>
