<h1><a name="vbevtvalidateeventcausesvalidationpropertyexamplex"></a>Validate Event, CausesValidation Property Example</h1>
<p>
The example uses three controls to demonstrate the use of the Validate event and <b>CausesValidation</b> property. By default, the <b>CausesValidation</b> property of the two TextBox controls are set to <b>True</b>. Thus when you try to shift the focus from one TextBox to the other, the Validate event occurs. If Text1 doesn't contain a date, or if Text2 doesn't contain a number larger than 10, the shift of focus is prevented. Because the <b>CausesValidation</b> property of the Command1 control is set to <b>False</b>, however, you can always click the Help button.</p>
<p>
To try the example, place one <b>CommandButton</b> and two <b>TextBox</b> controls on a form. Paste the code into the Declarations section of the form and run the project. Attempt to shift the focus by pressing the Tab key.</p>
<pre><code>Private Sub Form_Load()
   ' Set the button's CausesValidation property to False. When the user 
   ' clicks the button, the Validate event does not occur. 
   ' Set the Caption property of the button to "Help".
   With Command1
      .<span class=cfe><b>CausesValidation</b></span> = False
      .Caption = "Help"
   End With

   Show
   With Text1 ' Select text of Text1 and set focus to it.
      .SelLength = Len(Text1.Text)
      .SetFocus
   End With
End Sub

Private Sub Command1_Click()
   ' Give the user help when the button is clicked.
   MsgBox _
   "Text1 must be set to a date." &amp; VbCrLF &amp; _
   "Text2 must be a number less than 10."
End Sub

Private Sub Text1_<span class=cfe><b>Validate</b></span>(KeepFocus As Boolean)
   ' If the value is not a date, keep the focus, unless the user
   ' clicks Help.
   If Not IsDate(Text1.Text) Then 
      KeepFocus = True
      MsgBox "Please insert a date in this field.", ,   "Text1"
   End if
End Sub
   
Private Sub Text2_<span class=cfe><b>Validate</b></span>(KeepFocus As Boolean)
   ' If the value is a number larger than 10, keep the focus.
   If Not IsNumeric(Text2.Text) Or Val(Text2.Text) &gt; 10 Then 
      KeepFocus = True
MsgBox _
"Please insert a number less than or equal to 10.", , "Text2"
   End If
End Sub
