<H2 CLASS="h1">Managing Remoteboot Clients</H2><P CLASS="t">When you have installed the Remoteboot service and the MS-DOS operating system files, and you have defined some profiles, you can use Remoteboot Manager to manage the remoteboot clients. You must boot at least one client on MS-DOS before you can install Windows&nbsp;3.1 or Windows&nbsp;95 remoteboot clients.</P>
<P CLASS="t">This section provides procedures&nbsp;for:</P>
<UL><LI>Enabling and disabling the hard disk on a client.</LI><LI>Adding a client to the Remoteboot service.</LI><LI>Removing a client from the Remoteboot service.</LI><LI>Installing Windows&nbsp;95 for Windows&nbsp;95 clients (includes setting up a Server-Based Setup server and, optionally, a server to hold machine directories).</LI><LI>Installing Windows&nbsp;3.1 for MS-DOS clients.</LI></UL><P CLASS="t">When a user starts a remoteboot client, what appears as the client's C drive is actually mapped to various locations on servers, such as a personal directory on a separate server. For an MS-DOS or Windows&nbsp;3.1 client, the remoteboot server maps directories and files from various locations to the virtual C drive using a File Index Table (FIT) file; for more information, see "File Index Tables" later in this chapter. If the remoteboot client has a hard disk, the hard disk appears as drive D. Floppy disk drives keep their original drive letters.</P>
<P CLASS="t">Before you can use the Remoteboot service, each remoteboot client must have a network adapter with an RPL ROM chip installed. For a list of supported network adapters, see "Setting Up and Starting the Remoteboot Service" earlier in this chapter.</P></BODY></HTML>
