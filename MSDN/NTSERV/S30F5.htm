<H1 CLASS="title">Chapter 3 - Windows&nbsp;NT Browser Service</H1><P CLASS="t">Users on a Windows&nbsp;NT network often need to know what domains and computers are accessible from their local computer. Viewing all the network resources available is called <I>browsing</I>. The Windows&nbsp;NT Browser service maintains a list (called the <I>browse list)</I> of all available domains and servers. The browse list can be viewed using Windows&nbsp;NT Explorer and is provided by a browser in the local computer's domain.</P>
<P CLASS="t"><B>Note</B></P>
<P>For the purposes of this discussion, the term <I>server </I>refers to any computer that can provide resources to the rest of the network. If a computer running Windows&nbsp;NT Workstation can share file or print resources with other computers on the network, it is considered a server in the context of the browser system. The computer does not have to be actively sharing resources to be considered a server. </P>
<P CLASS="t">This chapter includes descriptions of the following topics.</P>
<UL><LI>The types of browser computers</LI><LI>How browsers can work together to provide an accurate browser list, even if the master browser fails</LI><LI>Master-browser elections</LI><LI>The API calls used to register computers for the browser list and to receive the list from the master browser</LI><LI>How browsing across domains is handled</LI></UL></BODY></HTML>
