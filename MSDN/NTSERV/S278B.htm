<H3>Analyzing Interrupt and DPC Rates</H3><P CLASS="t">You can observe the rates of interrupts and DPCs during periods of high, medium, and low server activity. Note the rate of interrupts and DPCs when processor use is very high, especially when a processor queue is developing. </P>
<P CLASS="t">A very high rate of interrupts can indicate a problem with a component that generates interrupts, such as the disk subsystem or a network adapter card. Test your components and rule out a hardware problem before proceeding.</P></BODY></HTML>
