<H2 CLASS="h2">Enabling the Bandwidth Throttler</H2><P CLASS="t">Use the Bandwidth Throttler in Internet Server Manager to limit the bandwidth available to Internet Information Server. You can enable the Bandwidth Throttler from the property page for any of the three IIS services. The limit you set applies to the combined bandwidth used by all three IIS services, regardless of which property page you set it from.</P>
<P> <FONT FACE="Symbol">Û</FONT>    To enable the Bandwidth Throttler</P>
<P>    1.    On the <B>WWW Service Properties</B>, <B>FTP Service Properties</B>, or <B>Gopher Service Properties </B>page, click the <B>Advanced </B>tab, then click <B>Limit Network Use by all Internet Services on this computer</B>.</P>
<P>    2.    In the <B>Maximum Network use</B> box, type the maximum amount of bandwidth you want the combined IIS services to use, in kilobytes per second.</P>
<P></P>
<P CLASS="t">You do not need to restart the server or the service to activate the Bandwidth Throttler. The Bandwidth Throttler is enabled dynamically. Because you do not need to restart the server, you can enable and disable the Bandwidth Throttler or change the value of <B>Maximum Network use</B> as needed. For example, you can restrict use of bandwidth by Internet Information Server during peak morning hours to make more bandwidth available for electronic mail.</P>
<P></P>
<P></P>
<P>Note</P>
<P>The value that you enter in the <B>Maximum Network use</B> box is stored in the <B>BandwidthLevel </B>value entry in the Registry. <B>BandwidthLevel</B> does not appear in the Registry until you enable the Bandwidth Throttler. If you later disable the Bandwidth Throttler, the value of <B>BandwidthLevel</B> is set to 0xFFFFFFFF.</P>
<P>You can enable the Bandwidth Throttler by adding the <B>BandwidthLevel</B> value entry to the Registry and setting <B>BandwidthLevel</B> to a value lower than 0xFFFFFFFF. However, if you edit the Registry, you must stop and restart the server to make the change effective.</P>
<P></P>
<P>For more information on <B>BandwidthLevel</B>, see Regentry.hlp, the Registry Help file, on the <I>Supplement 1 </I>CD.</P>
<P></P>
<P></P>
<P>Warning</P>
<P>To add or modify a Registry value entry, use administrative tools such as Control Panel or System Policy Editor whenever possible. Using a Registry editor (Regedit or Regedt32) to change a value can have unforeseen effects, including changes that can prevent you from starting your system.</P>
