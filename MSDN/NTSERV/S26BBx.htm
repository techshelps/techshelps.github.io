Chapter 5, "Network Services: Enterprise Level," provided the business justification for selecting Windows NT Server services to interoperate the heterogeneous networks. It also presented specific information on the installation and configuration of Enterprise level services that support the network itself and keep the corporation-wide information synchronized. </P>
