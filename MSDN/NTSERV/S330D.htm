<H2 CLASS="h1">Introduction to Windows Internet Name Service </H2><P CLASS="t">NetBIOS is a session-level interface used by programs to communicate over NetBIOS- compatible transports, including TCP/IP. One function of the NetBIOS interface is to establish logical names for networking programs. </P>
<P CLASS="t">Microsoft&nbsp;Windows Internet Name Service (WINS) is compliant with RFC 1001 and RFC 1002. Microsoft WINS is designed to provide a flexible solution to the problem of locating NetBIOS resources in routed, TCP/IP-based networks. </P>
<P CLASS="t">When using TCP/IP to communicate on a network, a "friendly" Windows-based NetBIOS computer name, such as "mycomputer," must be resolved to an IP address. This is necessary because TCP/IP requires an IP address, such as 172.16.48.1, to establish a connection to a network device. Several different name resolution methods provide NetBIOS name resolution. These methods include: </P>
