<H3 CLASS="h2">IP Address</H3><P CLASS="t">An IP address is used to identify a node (such as a workstation, a server, or a printer) on any network (such as your intranet or the Internet) and to specify routing information from one network or subnet to another network or subnet. Each node on a network or subnet must be assigned a unique IP address. </P>
<P CLASS="t">For Dial-Up Networking clients, the RAS server can automatically assign IP addresses to remote workstations when they connect. The IP address is obtained from a static pool that has been reserved for use by the RAS server, or through dynamic allocation from a Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) server. (For more information about DHCP, see the next section.)</P>
<P CLASS="t">Where needed, the RAS server can be configured to allow remote clients to specify their own IP addresses. This is useful for remote workstations that each need to be guaranteed a specific IP address when they are connected to the network.</P>
<P CLASS="t">Subnet masks are used in conjunction with the IP address to create subnets within an IP address space. Subnet masks are usually provided by the TCP/IP network administrator, such as an Internet service provider. If you need more information about subnet masks, see the <I>Windows&nbsp;NT Server Networking Supplement</I>.</P></BODY></HTML>
