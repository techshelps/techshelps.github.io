<H2 CLASS="h1">Internet Information Server FTP and Gopher Services</H2><P CLASS="t">In this scenario, the Terra Flora Human Resources department is setting up methods to ensure that all employees have access to Human Resources information currently provided through the WWW service. Some employees still use computers that run the MS-DOS or UNIX operating system; they cannot use Internet Explorer. And in addition to reading files, some Human Resources employees need to add and delete files by using the File Transfer Protocol (FTP) service. </P>
<P CLASS="t">Terra Flora adds the FTP and Gopher services to the same computer running the WWW service that was installed in the scenario described in "Internet Information Server as a Single Intranet Server" in Chapter 4. Human Resources employees will use the FTP service to maintain the files. All other employees can use the FTP or Gopher service to view the files. </P></BODY></HTML>
