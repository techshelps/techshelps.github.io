<H3>Analyzing Processor Time</H3><P CLASS="t">You should observe the proportion of the processor's time that is spent servicing interrupts and DPCs. Compare the values of the Processor: % Interrupt Time and Processor: % DPC Time counters to Processor: % Processor Time. </P>
<P CLASS="t">If a busy processor is spending the majority of its time servicing interrupts and DPCs, the processor probably cannot function effectively and a processor bottleneck is likely to develop. Consider upgrading or adding processors to handle the workload.</P>
<P CLASS="t">Alternatively, if the processor has some excess capacity (if Processor: % Processor Time &lt; 85%), or if it is spending a relatively small amount of its time (if Processor: % Interrupt Time and Processor: % DPC Time &lt; 20%) servicing interrupts and DPCs, you probably do not have a problem with interrupts and DPCs.</P></BODY></HTML>
