<h3>Creating Tests of Multiple Networks</h3>
<p>
The sample test configurations provided with WCAT are designed for a test environment based on a single, dedicated TCP/IP network. However, WCAT can be run in a multiple-network environment, and you can create a WCAT test to evaluate the performance of an Internet Information Server connected to multiple networks. This feature means you can simulate real-world production environments and evaluate the effect of connecting your Internet Information Server to multiple subnets. The following figure illustrates a multiple network model.</p>

<p>
To create a custom test by using multiple networks, each network must be connected to the other networks, either directly or by an intermediary network. Each network must support TCP/IP. </p>
<p>
Before starting a multiple network test, verify all computers used in the test can connect to each other. For more information on doing so, see &ldquo;Verifying Connections,&rdquo; earlier in this guide. Note that you can optimize routing of client requests and network responses by using IP addresses rather than computer names or DNS host names. </p>
