<H3 CLASS="h2">Domain Security Policies</H3><P CLASS="t">Windows&nbsp;NT Server and Windows&nbsp;NT Workstation settings can provide different levels of security for user actions on the domain or computer, respectively. </P>
<P CLASS="t">You can define three security policies that apply to the domain as a whole:</P>
<UL><LI>The <I>Account policy</I> controls how user accounts use passwords. </LI><LI>The <I>Audit policy</I> controls the types of events the security log records.</LI><LI>The <I>Trust Relationships policy</I> controls which domains are trusted and which domains are trusting domains. A trust relationship requires two or more single domains. This policy is available in a single-domain model (in which  only one domain exists) only if the domain administering the computer is a domain controller.</LI></UL><P CLASS="t">The <I>User Rights policy</I> controls access rights given to groups and user accounts. User rights are applied at the domain level, and affect overall domain security.</P>
<P CLASS="t">For more information about the account policy, the audit policy, and the trust relationships policy, see "Managing Windows&nbsp;NT Server Domains" and for more information about the user-rights security policy, see "Working With User and Group Accounts," in the <I>Microsoft Windows&nbsp;NT Server 4.0</I> <I>Concepts and Planning Guide</I></P></BODY></HTML>
