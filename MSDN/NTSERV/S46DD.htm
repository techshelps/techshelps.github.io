<H3 CLASS="h2">Checking and Changing Network-Adapter Settings</H3><P CLASS="t">The Network Client Setup program examines your computer's configuration and attempts to determine the network adapter's base memory address and interrupt request (IRQ) setting. If Setup incorrectly identifies these, Network Client will not start. </P>
<P CLASS="t">For information about determining the correct settings yourself, see the documentation that came with the network adapter. </P>
<P CLASS="t">After you determine the correct base memory address and interrupt setting, you can specify them by running Setup again. </P>
<P CLASS="t"><B>To change the base memory address or interrupt setting </B></P>
<P>    1.    Start the Network Client Setup program, as described earlier in this chapter.</P>
<P>    2.    Select Change Network Configuration by pressing the UP ARROW key, and then press ENTER. </P>

<P>    4.    If you want to change the setting for the network adapter's interrupt, proceed to step 5. If you want to change the setting for the network adapter's base memory address, do the following: </P>
<UL><LI>Select the setting for the base memory address by pressing the UP ARROW key, and then press ENTER. This setting is named Memory Window, RAM Address, or something similar. You might have to press the PAGE UP or PAGE DOWN key to find this setting. </LI></UL><P>A list of values appears. </P>
<UL><LI>Select the base memory address you want by pressing the UP ARROW or DOWN ARROW key, and then press ENTER. </LI></UL><P>The new value appears on the base memory address line in the list of network-adapter settings. </P>
<P>    5.    If you do not want to change the network adapter's interrupt setting, proceed to step 6. If you want to change the setting, do the following: </P>
<UL><LI>Select the interrupt setting by pressing the UP ARROW key, and then press ENTER. This setting is named IRQ_Level, Interrupt, or something similar. You might have to press the PAGE UP or PAGE DOWN key to find this setting. </LI></UL><P>A list of values appears. </P>

<P>    6.    Choose The Listed Options Are Correct by pressing ENTER. Then follow the instructions on the screen to complete Setup. </P>
<P>    7.    When Setup is complete, restart the computer by pressing ENTER. </P>
