<H3 CLASS="h2">Backing Up Data on Your Hard Disks</H3><P CLASS="t">Regularly backing up data on hard disks minimizes data loss or damage caused by disk failures, power outages, virus infection, and many other possible computer problems. If your backup operation is based on careful planning and reliable equipment, file recovery should be relatively easy.</P>
<P CLASS="t">Windows&nbsp;NT includes a backup program, Ntbackup.exe, that you can use to save data to cartridge tape on computers running Windows&nbsp;NT Server and Windows&nbsp;NT Workstation. Whether you use this program or another type of tape backup system, you need to consider the following:</P>
<UL><LI>What data to back up.</LI><LI>What hardware to get.</LI><LI>Where to locate your tape drive.</LI><LI>What type of backup procedure to use. </LI><LI>What backup schedule to follow.</LI><LI>Where to store tapes.</LI></UL><P CLASS="t">Once you have designed a backup operation, document both your backup and restore procedures. After your backup system is in place, it is a good idea to periodically practice restoring an entire server, as well as individual files. </P>
<P CLASS="t">For more details about what you should cover in your backup plan, see the section titled "Backup Strategy," in Chapter 4, "Planning a Reliable Configuration." For more information about the Ntbackup program, and planning your backup procedure, see Chapter 6, "Backing Up and Restoring Network Files," in the Microsoft Windows&nbsp;NT Server <I>Concepts and Planning</I> book.</P></BODY></HTML>
