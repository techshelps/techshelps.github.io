<H3 CLASS="h2">TCP/IP Security Filters</H3><P CLASS="t">Security filtering for TCP/IP allows you to control the type of network traffic passed up the TCP/IP protocol stack to upper-layer protocols and programs. Security filters are one of the security mechanisms typically used on Internet servers. </P>
<P CLASS="t">TCP/IP security filters control the ports on which TCP connections and UDP datagrams are accepted (For more information ,see Appendix B, "Port Reference for MS TCP/IP.") The filters also control which IP protocol can be assessed by using raw sockets. </P>
<P CLASS="t">If TCP/IP security filters are configured on a computer running under Windows NT, incoming connection requests and datagrams are accepted or rejected based on the configured security filters. Outgoing connection requests and datagrams are not affected.</P>
<P CLASS="t">Security filters are configured separately for each network adapter to which TCP/IP is bound. Filters are applied to network traffic based on the adapter that received the traffic.</P>
<P CLASS="t">For specific information about configuring advanced TCP/IP security, see Microsoft TCP/IP Help.</P></BODY></HTML>
