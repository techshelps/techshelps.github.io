<H2 CLASS="h2">Suggestions for Maximizing Bandwidth</H2><P CLASS="t">If the bandwidth on your server is not sufficient to support demand, you can solve the problem by increasing overall server bandwidth. For information on how this can be done, see Chapter 3, "Adding Bandwidth for Internet Connectivity."</P>
<P CLASS="t">You can also solve the problem by increasing the effective bandwidth of existing communication links. Some suggestions on how to do so follow. Many involve tuning parameters that can only be modified by editing the Registry. For more information about editing Registry entries, see Regentry.hlp, a Registry Help file on the <I>Supplement 1 </I>CD. This newest version of Regentry.hlp includes an updated list of the Registry entries for Internet Information Server.</P></BODY></HTML>
