<H3 CLASS="h2">Using the Hardware Compatibility List (HCL)</H3><P CLASS="t">The most common cause of hardware problems is the use of hardware that is not listed on the Hardware Compatibility List (HCL). The HCL included in the <I>Windows&nbsp;NT Server Resource Kit</I> lists the hardware components that have been tested and have passed compatibility testing with Windows NT version 4.0. It is especially important for you to refer to the HCL if you plan to use any modems, tape backup units, and SCSI adapters. </P>
<P CLASS="t">The latest HCL is available on:</P>
<UL><LI>The Web at http://www.microsoft.com/ntserver/</LI><LI>Microsoft's FTP server at ftp://microsoft.com/bussys/winnt/winnt_docs/hcl</LI></UL><P CLASS="t">To avoid problems, make sure that you are using a device make and model that is listed on the HCL. If several models from one manufacturer are included in the HCL, only those models are supported; a slightly different model might cause problems. Where special criteria are required for a model to be supported (for example, if a particular version of driver is required), this information is described as a footnote in the HCL. As additional hardware is tested, the HCL is updated, in this way new device drivers and other system components are added to the HCL. The updated list and software are available through the electronic services listed at the end of the HCL.</P></BODY></HTML>
