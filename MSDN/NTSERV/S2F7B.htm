<H2 CLASS="h1">FTP Service</H2><P CLASS="t">FTP is the protocol used to transfer files between two computers on a network that uses Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP). FTP was one of the earliest protocols used on TCP/IP–based networks and the Internet. Although the World Wide Web has replaced most functions of FTP, FTP is still the only way to copy files from a client computer to a server over the Internet.</P>
<P CLASS="t">To use FTP to transfer files between two computers, both computers must support their respective FTP roles. In other words, one needs to be an FTP client and the other an FTP server. The FTP client can issue commands to the server, such as commands to download files, upload files, create directories on the server, and change directories on the server.</P>
<P CLASS="t">FTP uses TCP as its transport protocol for all communication and data exchanges between the client and the server. However, Internet Information Server communicates with Windows Sockets, then Windows Sockets communicates with TCP.</P>
<P CLASS="t">TCP is a <I>connection-oriented</I> protocol. "Connection-oriented" means that the communications session is established between the client and the server before data is transmitted. The connection remains active during the entire FTP session. Connection-oriented sessions are known for their reliability and error-recovery features. This means that FTP file transfers are very reliable.</P>
<P CLASS="t">TCP has the features described in Table 1.6.</P>

<P CLASS="spacing"><BR></P><P CLASS="t"><B>Note</B></P>
<P>Do not confuse FTP with Trivial File Transfer Protocol (TFTP). TFTP is a fast, simple file transfer protocol that uses the User Datagram Protocol (UDP) transport. UDP, unlike TCP, is a connectionless protocol and cannot retransmit packets. This means that UDP is not as reliable as TCP.</P></BODY></HTML>
