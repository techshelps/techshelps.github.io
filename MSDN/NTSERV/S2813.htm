<H2 CLASS="h2">AllowedPaths: Exceptions to winreg</H2><P CLASS="t">The <B>AllowedPaths</B> subkey in <B>winreg</B> contains a single value entry, <B>Machine</B>, which stores a list of paths from the <B>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE </B>subtree. The paths named in <B>AllowedPaths </B>are known as <I>exception paths. </I>Users who are not included in the <B>winreg</B> ACL can connect to the Registry to access one of these exception paths.</P>
<P CLASS="t"><B>AllowedPaths</B> was added to enable users to use system services that require that they connect to the Registry. Users must have permission to access the final subkey in an exception path before they can view or edit the Registry remotely.</P>
<P></P>
<P>Note</P>
<P>The exception paths in <B>AllowedPaths</B> are necessary to maintain backward compatibility with system components that need remote Registry access. If you add a <B>winreg</B> subkey to the Registry, be sure to also add an <B>AllowedPaths</B> subkey under it, and then add the default values for the <B>Machine</B> value entry, as described following.</P>
<P></P>
<P></P>
<P CLASS="t">The allowed paths are stored in the <B>Machine</B> value entry in the <B>AllowedPaths</B> subkey. <B>AllowedPaths</B> must appear in the following Registry path:</P>
<P CLASS="t">HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System<BR>    \CurrentControlSet<BR>        \Services<BR>            \SecurePipeServers<BR>                \winreg<BR>                    \AllowedPaths</P>
<P CLASS="t">The <B>Machine</B> value entry appears as follows:</P>
<P CLASS="t"><B>Machine</B>    REG_MULTI_SZ<BR>Range:        <I>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE registry paths<BR></I>Default:        System\CurrentControlSet\Control\ProductOptions<BR>                System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Print\Printers<BR>                System\CurrentControlSet\Services\EventLog<BR>                Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion</P>
<P CLASS="t">Administrators can add paths to this list. However, if you delete a path, you might disable an essential system service.</P>
<P CLASS="t">The exception granted to paths listed in <B>Machine</B> applies to the last subkey listed in the path and to all subkeys it contains. For example, if <B>Machine</B> includes <B>System\CurrentControlSet\Services\EventLog</B>, any user could connect remotely to the <B>EventLog</B> subkey or to any of its subkeys (or to the subkeys of its subkeys), but not to any other subkey directly under <B>Services,</B> unless that other subkey was specifically listed in <B>Machine</B>.</P></BODY></HTML>
