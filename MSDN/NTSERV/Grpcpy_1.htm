<h2>IntroductionBackground</h2>
<p>
Grpcopy.exeRPCPY.EXE is a graphical program that runs only under Windows&nbsp; NT. Its purpose is to allowsenable users to copy the usernames in an existing group to another group, in the same or another domain or on a computer running Windows&nbsp;NTa Winnt machine. Users of this program must have at least account operator privileges into the domains within which they want to work with.</p>
<p>
There are four menus on the menu bar of the main GrpcpyRPCPY window: <b>Group</b>, <b>Edit</b>, <b>View,</b> and <b>Help</b>. The <b>Group</b> menu contains options that allow you to choose the domains and groups with which to workthat you&rsquo;ll be working with. The <b>Edit</b> menu allows you to use the Clipboard to transfer information between groups. The <b>View</b> menu allows you to display or hidetoggles the toolbar and status bar on and off. The <b>Help</b> menu containsoffers only the <b>Help/About</b> command; option--there is no Help file. The application does not havefeature any reporting capabilities.</p>
<p>
The options on the toolbar, from left to right, are: <b>Set Source Group</b>,; <b>Set Destination Group</b>,; <b>Create New Group</b>,; <b>Copy Existing Group</b>,; <b>Copy from Clipboard</b>,; and <b>About</b>.</p>
<p>
The upper left list in the upper-left part of the screencontrol contains the names of the groups available in the domain that you have chosen as the source domain. The upper right list in the upper-right control contains the group names from the destination domain. The list at the bottom displays an event log that grows as you copy groups from one location to anotheraround; this log includes a record of any errors that mightmay have occurred during the preceding operations. Some of the errors you could potentially receive are: duplicate user in destination group; and network-related errors.</p>
<h4>Note</h4>
<p>
Throughout this program, wherever the term &ldquo;domain&rdquo; is used, the context also applies to the name of a specific computer running Windows&nbsp;NT Workstation or Windows&nbsp;NT Server. This is because each computer running Windows&nbsp;NT effectively has its own built-in one-computer domain.</p>
<p>
<b>Note: </b>Throughout this program, wherever the term &ldquo;domain&rdquo; is used, the context also applies to the name of a specific Windows NT workstation/server. This is because each NT box effectively has its own build-it one-machine domain.</p>
