<H3 CLASS="h2">Network Architecture</H3><P CLASS="t">Terra Flora standardized on Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) as its single network protocol. It chose TCP/IP as its primary protocol because all of the network operating systems in use at Terra Flora support TCP/IP. Also, TCP/IP routing minimizes network traffic both on the local network and across wide area network (WAN) links.</P>
<P CLASS="t">With TCP/IP, Terra Flora can use applications that have been developed to comply with the standards put forth in requests for comment documents (RFCs) created by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF). These international standards, such as the Hypertext Transport Protocol (HTTP) and the TCP/IP protocol suite, enabled the global Internet to develop.</P></BODY></HTML>
