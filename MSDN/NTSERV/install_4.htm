<h3>The PPTP Server</h3>
<p>
The computer that is configured as a PPTP server must have the minimum configuration required to run Window NT Server version 4.0. In addition, two network adapter cards, also referred to as network interface cards (NICs), are required. One adapter is connected to the Internet; the other is connected to the private enterprise network.</p>
<p>
One of the primary advantages of PPTP is that it reduces or eliminates the need for dedicated, telecommunications equipment to support remote and mobile users who need to connect to the enterprise network. PPTP enables secure use of public or outsourced telecommunication networks. This reduces the cost of owning and maintaining dedicated, telecommunications equipment. </p>
