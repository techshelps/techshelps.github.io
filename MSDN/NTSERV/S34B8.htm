<H2 CLASS="h1">Maintaining Configuration and Essential System Information</H2><P CLASS="t">Hardware failures, power failures, and human errors can corrupt information that your computer needs to start Windows&nbsp;NT. </P>
<P CLASS="t">Recovery is easier if:</P>
<UL><LI>You know the configuration of each computer and its history.</LI><LI>You back up critical system files every time you make certain changes to your Windows&nbsp;NT configuration.</LI></UL><P CLASS="t">On computers running Windows&nbsp;NT Server, you can purchase disk subsystems that maintain redundant information on the disks. The redundant information is either parity information, or a complete, separate copy of the data. Having redundant information makes the disk subsystems fault tolerant, meaning that you can continue to access the data when one disk in a fault-tolerant configuration fails. This fault-tolerant technology is called RAID, for Redundant Array of Inexpensive Disks. A disk subsystem that implements fault tolerance using RAID technology is also called a RAID array.</P>
<P CLASS="t">Windows&nbsp;NT Server implements two of the fault-tolerant configurations in software: mirror sets, and stripe sets with parity. For a description of mirror sets and stripe sets with parity, see Chapter 4, "Planning a Reliable Configuration."</P>
<P CLASS="t">For complete information about RAID, RAID terminology, and RAID arrays, see <I>The RAIDbook, A Source Book for Disk Array Technology</I>. The RAID Advisory Board in St. Peter, MN, publishes this book. The June 1995 edition is the basis for RAID information in this chapter. <I>The RAIDbook, A Source Book for Disk Array Technology</I> also contains information about parity. </P></BODY></HTML>
