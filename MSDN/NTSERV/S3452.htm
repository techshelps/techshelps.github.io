<H2 CLASS="h1">Guidelines for Configuring Your Mass Storage</H2><P CLASS="t">There is no optimal mass storage configuration for your Windows&nbsp;NT computer. The tradeoffs involved in deciding your configuration depend upon such variables as cost, performance, and how much time you can afford to take to completely rebuild a disk. This section discusses why you might want to use mirror sets, stripe sets with parity, or a combination of the two fault-tolerant software techniques on your Windows&nbsp;NT Server.</P>
<P CLASS="t">In general, you only need to use fault-tolerant configurations for information that you must have readily available in case of hardware failure or unrecoverable disk errors. You do not need to have your page file on a fault-tolerant volume, and you definitely should not have the page file on a stripe set with parity because of potential performance impacts. </P>
<P CLASS="t"><B>Note</B></P>
<P>If you configure your computer running Windows&nbsp;NT Server to write a memory dump file each time it generates a Kernel STOP error, your page file must be located on the boot partition. If you configure your computer this way, and create a mirror set of your boot partition, the page file will be mirrored.</P>
<P CLASS="t">You might not need to configure application programs on a fault-tolerant volume. If you are considering having application programs and other common files on more than one computer running Windows&nbsp;NT Server, you can use replication to keep them all consistent and to provide the redundancy. If you have applications on a single computer running Windows&nbsp;NT Server, you only need to configure them on a fault-tolerant volume if you cannot tolerate them being unavailable for the amount of time it takes you to restore them from a backup. Be sure to back up the application program volume any time you install a new application or change default settings for an application.</P>
<P CLASS="t">You can put the application programs on a stripe set to get the fastest I/O performance for reading data. </P>
<P CLASS="t">If space is a consideration, you can format your application program volume with the NTFS file system (or convert a FAT volume to an NTFS volume), and use NTFS compression for folders and files on the volume. See Chapter 18, "Choosing a File System," in the <I>Windows&nbsp;NT Workstation Resource Guide</I> for details about NTFS compression. </P></BODY></HTML>
