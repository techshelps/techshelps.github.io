<H1 CLASS="title">Chapter 16 - MS Network Client Version&nbsp;3.0 for MS-DOS</H1><P CLASS="t">This chapter tells how to install and use Microsoft Network Client version 3.0 for MS-DOS. Network Client is software that you install on a computer running the MS-DOS operating system so that the computer can use resources on a network. For example, a computer with Network Client can use printers, programs, and data stored on a computer running Windows&nbsp;NT Server.</P>
<P CLASS="t">With Network Client, your computer can use resources on Microsoft networks, as well as other networks such as Microsoft LAN Manager networks. </P>
<P CLASS="t">In addition, if the computer had Novell NetWare installed before you install Network Client, you can still connect to NetWare resources (in addition to Microsoft network resources). For more information, see the Readme.txt file located in the directory that contains the Network Client files.</P></BODY></HTML>
