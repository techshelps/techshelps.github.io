<H2 CLASS="h2">Using Performance Monitor to Monitor Client Requests</H2><P CLASS="t">Performance Monitor includes a set of counters that measure the rate of requests to CGI and ISAPI applications running under each IIS service. These counters are included in the HTTP Service, FTP Server, and Gopher Service performance objects. However, Internet Information Server 2.0 supports ISAPI only on the HTTP service. The ISAPI counters on other services always display a value of zero.</P>
<P CLASS="t">The following table lists the counters that count requests to ISAPI and CGI applications. Please note that these counters display the last observed value, not an average. It is important to log these counters over time and to display the results in a chart, as opposed to a report.</P>

<P CLASS="t">By themselves, these counters are indirect indicators of processor activity. When combined with information about server performance, however, these counters can help you judge the effects of different levels of activity on the performance and efficiency of your server.</P></BODY></HTML>
