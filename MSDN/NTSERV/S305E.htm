<H3 CLASS="h2">Communication Between Layers</H3><P CLASS="t">Communication between layers within a computer is handled differently from communication between two computers. The layers within a computer communicate with each other using vertical interfaces. The layers on different computers communicate with their counterparts using protocols. </P>
<H4 CLASS="h3"><A NAME="sec0"></A>Peer Relationships—Protocols</H4><P CLASS="t">Peer-to-peer communications are performed using protocols. For example, layer 4 on one computer carries on a conversation with layer 4 on another computer. The rules and conventions used in this conversation are collectively known as the layer-4 protocol. The communication between the layers is considered peer-to-peer communication. Functions performed in layer 4 of one computer are communicated to layer 4 of another computer. </P>
<H4 CLASS="h3"><A NAME="sec1"></A>Vertical Relationships—Interfaces</H4><P CLASS="t">Each layer ultimately communicates with its peer on the other computer. However, no data passes directly from layer 4 on one computer to layer 4 on another. Instead, each layer passes data and control information to the layer immediately below it, until the lowest layer is reached and the data is transmitted onto the network media. The receiving computer then passes the data and control information from layer to layer until it reaches its own layer 4. </P>
<P CLASS="t">There is a well-defined interface between each pair of layers. The interface defines which services the lower layer offers to the upper one and how those services will be accessed.</P></BODY></HTML>
