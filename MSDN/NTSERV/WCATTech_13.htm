<h3><i>Performance Counters File</i></h3>
The performance counter file (extension: .pfc) specifies the counters to be monitored on the server while the test is running. Many system counters and user-level counters are exposed to the user locally and remotely. The Web Capacity Analysis Tool controller remotely samples the performance counters and averages them during the test. The data collected can help to identify and trace the dynamics of the system.
All counters to be monitored are specified in the performance counter file. Each line in this file specifies one counter. The name of the counters should match the names visible when Performance Monitor is started. The controller samples the counters once every 10 seconds and writes data to file with same prefix used for the log file, but with the extension .prf. </code>
