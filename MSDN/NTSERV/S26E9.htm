<H2 CLASS="h2">How to Monitor Overall Server Memory</H2><P CLASS="t">Internet Information Server and its component services, HTTP Service (WWW), the File Transfer Protocol (FTP) Service, and Gopher Service, run jointly in a user-mode process called Inetinfo.exe. Like most well-designed user-mode processes, the IIS services derive much of their benefits from the Windows&nbsp;NT operating system architecture, including the Windows&nbsp;NT Security model, RPC communication, messaging, the file systems, and other operating system services. Thus, monitoring memory for Internet Information Server begins with monitoring overall server memory, even on a multipurpose server.</P></BODY></HTML>
