<H2 CLASS="h1">Windows for Workgroups and Windows&nbsp;95 as Master Browsers</H2><P CLASS="t">The Vserver.386 and Vredir files on the Windows&nbsp;NT Server versions 3.51 and 4.0 compact discs are different from the files of the same names on the Windows&nbsp;NT Server version 3.5 compact disc. </P>
<P CLASS="t">These two files have been modified so that computers running Windows for Workgroups 3.11b or Windows&nbsp;95 can be master browsers for a network. This enables a computer on a network with computers running only Windows for Workgroups 3.11b and Windows&nbsp;95 to browse Windows&nbsp;NT domains on other networks.</P>
<P CLASS="t">As the master browser for the network, a computer running Windows for Workgroups 3.11b or Windows&nbsp;95 will communicate with the PDC of the domain to obtain the browse list for the entire domain.</P>
<P CLASS="t">The Windows for Workgroups 3.11b or Windows&nbsp;95 master browser will function as if a Windows&nbsp;NT master browser were on the network. The Windows for Workgroups 3.11b or Windows&nbsp;95 master browser will contact the PDC every 15 minutes to give it the local network's browse list and to obtain the domain-wide browse list.</P>
<P CLASS="t">The following conditions must exist for a computer running either Windows for Workgroups 3.11b or Windows&nbsp;95 to function properly as a master browser.</P>
<UL><LI>The computer must also be running TCP/IP.</LI><LI>WINS must be used for name resolution.</LI><LI>The domain's PDC must be a WINS client.</LI><LI>The Windows for Workgroups 3.11b or Windows&nbsp;95 client must be in a workgroup that has the same name as the domain, and must also be a WINS client.</LI></UL></BODY></HTML>
