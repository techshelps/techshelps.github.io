<H2 CLASS="h2">ISDN - Primary Rate Interface</H2><P CLASS="t">The U.S. standard for ISDN-PRI consists of 24 digital channels: 23 B channels and 1 D channel, commonly referred to as a 23B+D connection. ISDN-PRI provides a total bandwidth of 1.544 megabits per second and is designed for transmission over a North American - standard T1 line connection. The European standard for ISDN-PRI provides a total of 31 or 32 digital channels. Each of these channels is a 64 – kilobit per second B channel, except one that is the D channel for the entire group. In Europe, ISDN-PRI is designed for transmission over a European-standard E1 line connection. A PRI D channel can be used to control one or multiple T1 or E1 lines. </P>

<P CLASS="t">The following figure illustrates the main difference between BRI and PRI, which is the greater number of channels that allows PRI to provide higher bandwidth than the BRI service.</P>
