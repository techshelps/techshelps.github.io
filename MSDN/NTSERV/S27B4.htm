<H3>Troubleshooting the Internet Information Services Counters</H3><P CLASS="t">When you are monitoring a server remotely, the Internet Information Services Global, HTTP Service, FTP Server, and Gopher Service performance objects and counters appear in Performance Monitor only when the related IIS service is running on the computer being monitored. If you do not see these objects in the <B>Add to Chart</B> dialog box, close Performance Monitor on your computer, start the IIS service on the computer being monitored, and then start Performance Monitor again.</P>
<P CLASS="t">If the objects and counters still do not appear in the <B>Add to Chart</B> dialog box, or if they appear intermittently, make certain that no one else is using Performance Monitor to monitor the remote computer. All remote users must restart Performance Monitor after the IIS service is started for any of them to see the Internet Information Server counters. Also, check the Event Viewer application event log for errors. Errors in the service or in loading the counters can also prevent Performance Monitor from displaying the counters.</P>
<P CLASS="t">For more information on troubleshooting extensible Performance Monitor counters, see "Troubleshooting Features" in <I>Windows&nbsp;NT Workstation Resource Guide</I>, Chapter 10, "About Performance Monitor."</P>
