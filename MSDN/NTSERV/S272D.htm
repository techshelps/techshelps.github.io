<H2 CLASS="h2">Evaluating the Bandwidth Capability of Connectivity Services </H2><P CLASS="t">As previously stated, this chapter focuses on Internet communications that use the PSTN networks to provide connectivity between remote users. PSTNs are based on circuit-switching with dedicated capacity to transfer and route traffic throughout the PSTN. </P>
<P CLASS="t">Data communication on the Internet, however, is based on packet switching, designed for high throughput of all communications, including data, audio, and video. Packet-switching networks provide the highest rates of data transfer available; however, the Internet relies on PSTNs to deploy the packet-switching technologies. You can select different PSTN line services that will support data communications on Internet, and to support WANs and local area networks (LANs). </P>
<P></P>
<P CLASS="t">The next two sections describe the transmission technologies and telephone connections that you can choose to connect to the Internet. After you select a telephone line service that provides the amount of bandwidth you need, use the <I>Windows NT Hardware Compatibility List </I>to identify the hardware devices that you can select that will support the line service you chose. </P></BODY></HTML>
