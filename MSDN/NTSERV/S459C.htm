<H3 CLASS="h2">Internet Gateway Configuration</H3><P CLASS="t">The scenario described in this section was an actual pilot test of Windows&nbsp;NT as an Internet gateway server at Microsoft Corporation. For security reasons, the Internet gateway server was installed on an isolated network, which was in turn connected to the Internet by third-party routers. The RAS server and the third-party routers were not connected to the corporate network.</P>

<P>Figure 6.4    Windows&nbsp;NT as an Internet gateway server</P>
<P CLASS="t">In this scenario, the computer running Windows&nbsp;NT Server has a leased line to an Internet service provider through third-party routers. The Remote Access Service is installed. This enables traffic from the Internet to be routed to and from computers on the private network. The Remote Access Service enables Windows Dial-Up Networking clients or other dial-up clients to connect to the RAS server by using ISDN or a POTS line (plain old telephone service, also known as PSTN or public switched telephone network), giving them Internet access. </P>
<P CLASS="t">The Internet gateway server for the pilot test had the following configuration:</P>
<UL><LI>A MIPS Rx4000 RISC-based computer (with 32 MB of RAM) running the Remote Access Service </LI><LI>TCP/IP networking protocol on all computers that will use the Internet</LI><LI>Network interface cards on all computers</LI><LI>Third-party (Cisco) routers</LI><LI>A Digi International PC/2e serial adapter, which enables multiple remote clients to dial in on telephone lines to the computer running the Remote Access Service</LI><LI>A Digi International PCIMAC4 ISDN adapter, which enables multiple remote clients to dial in on ISDN lines to the computer running the Remote Access Service</LI><LI>Dial-Up Networking on remote clients that will dial in to the RAS server</LI><LI>Modems or ISDN cards on remote clients that will dial in to the RAS server</LI><LI>ISDN lines and standard analog telephone lines</LI><LI>A DNS server</LI><LI>Internet browsers, such as Internet Explorer, on all computers that will access the Internet</LI></UL><P></P>
