<H2 CLASS="h1">Creating Floppy Disks for Starting Your Computer</H2><P CLASS="t">For x86-based computers and RISC-based computers, you should create a floppy disk to use to start Windows&nbsp;NT if you cannot start up from the hard disk. For x86-based computers, you can also create a bootable floppy disk that you can use to start MS-DOS if you cannot start Windows&nbsp;NT.</P>
<P CLASS="t">Creating each floppy disk requires two steps:</P>
<UL><LI>Format the disk.</LI><LI>Copy files to the disk.</LI></UL><P CLASS="t">After you create the Windows&nbsp;NT startup floppy disk or the MS-DOS bootable floppy disk, run a virus scan program to make sure the disk is not infected. Lock the floppy disk after you finish running the virus scan. (Most floppy disks have a tab on their back side that you slide down to lock the disk. You cannot write on a floppy disk when the tab is in the locked position.)</P>
<P CLASS="t">You should test each disk before you have to use it. You should also be familiar with using the programs that you copy to the floppy disks.</P>
<P CLASS="t">Depending on your disk configuration and whether you are using an x86-based computer or a RISC-based computer, you might also have to create alternate boot selections to your Windows&nbsp;NT startup floppy disk. For a description of the ARC pathname conventions that you need to use in boot selections, see "Understanding ARC Pathnames," presented earlier in this chapter.</P>
<P CLASS="t">Whenever possible, you should use an ARC pathname created by Windows&nbsp;NT Setup during an installation. When in doubt, install a copy of Windows&nbsp;NT onto the disk that you want to use for the boot partition, and then copy that ARC pathname, changing the partition number and folder name as necessary.</P></BODY></HTML>
