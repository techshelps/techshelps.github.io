<H3 CLASS="h2">Microsoft WINS Server Push and Pull Partners</H3><P CLASS="t">A given network should have one or more WINS servers that WINS clients can contact to resolve a computer name to an IP address. It is desirable to have multiple WINS servers installed on an intranet for the following reasons:</P>
<UL><LI>To distribute the NetBIOS computer name query and registration processing load</LI><LI>To provide WINS database redundancy, backup, and disaster recovery </LI></UL><P CLASS="t">Microsoft&nbsp;WINS servers communicate with other Microsoft&nbsp;WINS servers to fully replicate their databases with each other. This ensures that a name registered with one WINS server is replicated to all other Microsoft&nbsp;WINS servers within the intranet, providing a replicated and enterprise-wide database.</P>
<P CLASS="t">When multiple WINS servers are used, each WINS server is configured as a <I>pull</I> or <I>push</I> partner of at least one other WINS server. The following table describes the pull and push partner types of replication partners.</P>
<P CLASS="cap"><B>Table 8.1   WINS Server Replication Partners</B></P>

The pull partner pulls new WINS database entries by requesting entries with a higher version number than the last entry it received during the last replication from that push partner. A pull partner can notify push partners that replication is needed by using either of the following:</P>
<P>   An arbitrary time interval, as configured by the WINS administrator. This is called the <I>time interval</I>.</P>
<P>   Immediate replication, initiated by the WINS administrator by using the WINS Manager. </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP"><P>Push partner</P></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP"><P>A push partner is a WINS server that sends a message to its pull partners that the WINS database has changed. When the pull partners respond to the message with a replication request, the push partner sends a copy of its new WINS database entries to the pull partners. The push partner notifies pull partners of replication requirements by using any of the following:</P>
<P>   An arbitrary number of WINS updates, as configured by the WINS administrator. This is referred to as the <I>update count</I>.</P>
<P>   Immediate replication, initiated by the WINS administrator by using WINS Manager.</P></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>
<P CLASS="spacing"><BR></P><P CLASS="t">It is always a good idea for replication partners to be both push and pull partners of each other. The primary and backup WINS servers <I>must </I>be both push and pull partners with each other to ensure that the primary and backup databases are consistent. </P>
<P CLASS="t">Replication is triggered when a WINS server polls another server to get replicated information. This can begin when the WINS server is started, and is repeated based on the configured update count or time interval, or by using WINS Manager to start immediate replication.</P></BODY></HTML>
