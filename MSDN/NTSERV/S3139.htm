<H2 CLASS="h1">Name Resolution Using WINS and DNS</H2><P CLASS="t">Due to the heterogeneity of the network at Terra Flora, administrators have decided to implement two Windows&nbsp;NT Server services to manage all name resolution issues. Windows Internet Name Service (WINS) and Domain Name System (DNS). </P>
<P CLASS="t">Terra Flora is interoperating several heterogeneous networks. To communicate, each computer needs a unique computer address and name. There are two types of names and both types exist on one or more of the small Terra Flora networks being merged into one large network. Windows&nbsp;NT network applications use a naming convention known as <I>NetBIOS</I>. In general, NetBIOS computer names consist of a single part.</P>
<P CLASS="t">In contrast, TCP/IP components rely on the DNS naming convention. DNS computer names consist of two parts: a <I>computer name</I> and a <I>domain name</I>, which combine to form the <I>fully qualified domain name</I> (FQDN).</P>
<P CLASS="t">NetBIOS computer names can be made compatible with DNS computer names, making interoperation possible between the two. Windows&nbsp;NT combines the NetBIOS computer name with the DNS domain name to form the FQDN.</P>
<P CLASS="t"><B>Note</B></P>
<P>Under Windows&nbsp;NT Server, the DNS host name defaults to the same name as the NetBIOS computer name. You can change this if you need separate names.</P></BODY></HTML>
