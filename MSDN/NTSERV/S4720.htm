<H3 CLASS="h2">Cannot Connect to Foreign Systems When Using Host Name </H3><P CLASS="t"><B>To determine why only IP addresses but not host names work for connections to remote computers </B></P>
<P>    1.    Make sure that the appropriate HOSTS file and DNS setup have been configured for the computer by checking the host name resolution configuration using the <B>Network</B> icon in <B>Control Panel</B> and then choosing the <B>DNS</B> tab in the <B>Microsoft</B> <B>TCP/IP Properties</B> dialog box.</P>
<P>    2.    If you are using a HOSTS file, make sure that the name of the remote computer is spelled the same and capitalized the same in the file and by the application using it. </P>
<P>    3.    If you are using DNS, be sure that the IP addresses of the DNS servers are correct and in the proper order. Use <B>ping</B> with the remote computer by typing both the host name and IP address to determine whether the host name is being resolved properly.</P></BODY></HTML>
