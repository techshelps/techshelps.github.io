<H2 CLASS="h1">Overview of Data Link Control</H2><P CLASS="t">The Data Link Control (DLC) protocol is a special purpose, non-routable protocol provided with Windows&nbsp;NT. Windows&nbsp;NT –based DLC provides applications only with direct access to the data link layer. </P>
<P CLASS="t">Windows&nbsp;NT–based DLC does not support the TDI interface as do other Windows&nbsp;NT–based transport protocols. Because DLC does not support the TDI, it cannot be used for communication with TDI client applications, such as the Windows&nbsp;NT redirector and server. Because the redirector cannot use DLC, this protocol is not used for normal session communication between Windows&nbsp;NT–based computers. </P>
<P CLASS="t">The DLC protocol driver provided with Windows&nbsp;NT enables the computer to communicate with other computers running the DLC protocol stack (for example, an IBM mainframe) and other network peripherals (for example, print devices such as a Hewlett-Packard HP 4Si that use a network adapter card (NIC) to connect directly to the network.) </P>
<P CLASS="t">The DLC protocol driver provides access to IEEE 802.2 class I and class II services.  It also provides the direct interface to send and to receive raw 802.5, 802.3, and Ethernet type network frames. The interface consists of a dynamic-link library and a device driver.</P>
<P CLASS="t">Windows&nbsp;NT DLC contains an 802.2 Logical Link Control (LLC) Finite State Machine, which is used when transmitting and receiving type 2 connection-oriented frames. DLC can also transmit and receive type 1 connectionless frames, such as Unnumbered Information (UI) frames. Type 1 and 2 frames can be transmitted and received simultaneously.</P>
<P CLASS="t">Windows&nbsp;NT–based DLC works with either token ring or Ethernet Media Access Control (MAC) drivers and can transmit and receive Digital.Intel.Xerox (DIX) format frames when bound to an Ethernet MAC.</P>
<P CLASS="t">The DLC interface can be accessed from 32-bit Windows&nbsp;NT–based programs and from 16-bit MS-DOS-based and 16-bit Windows–based programs. The 32-bit interface conforms largely to the CCB2 interface, the segmented 16-bit pointers being replaced with flat 32-bit pointers. The 16-bit interface conforms to the CCB1 interface. </P>
