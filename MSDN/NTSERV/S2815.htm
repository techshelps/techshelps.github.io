<H3>Access to Performance Monitor Files on Disk</H3><P CLASS="t">To monitor a computer remotely by using Performance Monitor, you must have access to Perfc*.dat and Perfh*.dat files, as described previously. By default, these files are installed in <I>Systemroot</I>\System32. If these files are stored on a Windows NT file system (NTFS) partition on the computer being monitored, make certain that the user who is monitoring the remote computer has at least read access to both of the files.</P>
<P CLASS="t">You can use Windows Explorer to view or change the ACL for the Perfc*.dat and Perfh*.dat files. The ACL controls security for these files.</P></BODY></HTML>
