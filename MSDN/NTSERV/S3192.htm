<H3 CLASS="h2">Windows&nbsp;NT Connectivity and Administration</H3><P CLASS="t">Computers running Windows&nbsp;NT Workstation or Windows&nbsp;NT Server can be administered from any other computer running Windows&nbsp;NT Server or Workstation. Additionally, most computers operating in a heterogeneous network can be used to connect and in some cases administer computers running Windows&nbsp;NT Workstation or Windows&nbsp;NT Server. </P>
<UL><LI>By installing and configuring Intergraph DiskShare on the computers running Windows&nbsp;NT Server, UNIX clients can connect to connect to computers running Windows&nbsp;NT Server for access to file services. </LI><LI>By installing and configuring File and Print Services for NetWare on the computer running Windows&nbsp;NT Server, NetWare clients can be used to connect to computers running Windows&nbsp;NT Server.</LI><LI>By installing and configuring network software such as LAN Manager or Microsoft Works, Windows 3.1 clients and DOS clients can be used to connect to and administer Windows&nbsp;NT servers.</LI><LI>By installing and configuring Services for Macintosh, Macintosh clients can be used to connect to computers running Windows&nbsp;NT Server.</LI><LI>Computers running Windows for Workgroups and Windows&nbsp;95 can be configured to authenticate automatically to the Windows&nbsp;NT network and can be used to administer the Windows&nbsp;NT servers.</LI></UL><P CLASS="t">For complete instructions on how to install and configure the software required for interoperating the different operating systems referenced above, see "Network Logon Services," earlier in this chapter.</P>
<H4 CLASS="h3"><A NAME="sec0"></A>User Manager for Domains</H4><P CLASS="t">User Manager for Domains is used to administer user and group accounts which allow users to participate in a Windows&nbsp;NT domain and access the domain's resources. Additionally with User Manager for Domains, rights and permissions can be granted to the user and group accounts providing the appropriate amount of access and restrictions to network resources in the Windows&nbsp;NT domain. </P>
<P CLASS="t">Once a client computer accesses the Windows&nbsp;NT Server with the proper permissions, the client can administer the server. For complete instructions on how to install and configure the software required for interoperating the different operating systems referenced above, see "Network Logon Services," earlier in this chapter.</P>

See Chapter 3, "Manager User Work Environments," for complete instructions on managing User Profiles and System Policies.</P>
<H4 CLASS="h3"><A NAME="sec1"></A>Server Manager</H4><P CLASS="t">Client computers connected to the computer running Windows&nbsp;NT Server can be used to administer the computers running Windows&nbsp;NT Server by connecting to the servers.

<P CLASS="t">Server Manager is the tool used to manage domains and computers. With Server Manager you can:</P>
<UL><LI>Select a Windows&nbsp;NT domain, workgroup or computer for administration. </LI><LI>Manage a computer including viewing a list of connected users, viewing shared and open resources, managing services and shared directories and sending messages to connected users.</LI><LI>Manage a domain including promoting a backup domain controller to the primary domain controller (PDC), synchronizing servers with primary domain controllers and adding computers to and removing computers from the domain. </LI></UL><P CLASS="t">Once a client computer accesses the Windows&nbsp;NT Server, the client can administer the server.

<H4 CLASS="h3"><A NAME="sec2"></A>Internet Service</H4><P CLASS="t">At Terra Flora, a server has been installed to provide a proxy agent to the Internet and prevent unauthorized access to or from the network. What happens is that network users communicate with the proxy agent server that acts as a fire wall to the network and the proxy agent server then communicates with the Internet. By the same token, users accessing the Terra Flora network from the Internet communicate with the proxy agent server acting as a fire wall and protecting the network from unauthorized access. There is no actual access to the Internet from the network and there is no access from the Internet to the network except through the proxy fire wall server, which will authenticate requested user access. </P>
<P CLASS="t">Additionally, the Internet server provides a central access point to the Internet. All users either exiting the network to the Internet or entering the network from the Internet will pass through this central server. </P>
