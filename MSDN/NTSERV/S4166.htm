<H1 CLASS="title">Chapter 2 - Network Security and Domain Planning</H1><P CLASS="t">Network security refers to the protection of all components — hardware, software, and stored data — of a computer network from damage, theft, and unauthorized use. A computer security plan that is well thought out, implemented, and monitored makes authorized use of network computers easy and unauthorized use or accidental damage difficult or impossible.</P>
<P CLASS="t">Microsoft included security as part of the initial design specifications for Windows&nbsp;NT, and it is pervasive in the operating system. The security model includes components to control who accesses which objects (such as files and shared printers), which action an individual user can take on an object (such as write access to a file), and which events are audited.</P>
<P CLASS="t">Security over a Windows&nbsp;NT network incorporates domains and trust relationships to provide the most secure networking operating system available. </P>
<P CLASS="t">This chapter provides:</P>
<UL><LI>An overview of the Windows&nbsp;NT security model and architecture.</LI><LI>A description of how the features of the security model control access to resources.</LI><LI>An overview of auditing security events.</LI><LI>A description of how domains work to implement security over the network.</LI><LI>Considerations for planning your domain structure, including a description of the Microsoft domain model.</LI><LI>Troubleshooting.</LI></UL><P CLASS="t">This chapter presumes a good understanding of Windows&nbsp;NT domains. For background information about domains, see "Managing Windows&nbsp;NT Server Domains" in the <I>Microsoft Windows&nbsp;NT Server 4.0 Concepts and Planning Guide.</I></P></BODY></HTML>
