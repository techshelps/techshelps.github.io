<H2 CLASS="h1">Controlling Access</H2><P CLASS="t">Windows&nbsp;NT Server provides control of what network computer users can and cannot do, while still giving them access to the resources they need. You can allow some users to connect to a resource (such as a printer) or perform an action (such as changing a file) while preventing others from doing so. You can even control access to system functions, such as setting a computer's system clock. This can be done for users working at the computer in which the resource is located and for users connecting to the resource over the network.</P>
<P CLASS="t">The following features allow and restrict access:</P>
<UL><LI>User accounts</LI><LI>User rights</LI><LI>User groups</LI><LI>Subjects and impersonations</LI><LI>Security information about objects (permissions)</LI></UL><P CLASS="t">Implementing security over a network also involves the use of domains and domain controllers, which are presented in the section "Windows&nbsp;NT Server Domains" later in this chapter.</P></BODY></HTML>
