<P CLASS="t">Upon becoming a master browser, each master browser in each workgroup and domain will broadcast a DomainAnnouncement datagram every minute for the first five minutes. After the first five minutes, the master browser will broadcast a DomainAnnouncement datagram once every 15 minutes. If a workgroup or domain has not announced itself for three announcement periods, the workgroup or domain will be removed from the list of workgroups and domains. Therefore, it is possible that a workgroup or domain will appear in the browse list 45 minutes after the workgroup or domain has failed or been shut down. </P>
<P CLASS="t">A DomainAnnouncement datagram contains the following information.</P>
<UL><LI>The name of the domain</LI><LI>The name of the master browser for that domain</LI><LI>Whether the browser computer is running Windows&nbsp;NT Workstation or Windows&nbsp;NT Server</LI></UL><P CLASS="t">If the browser computer is running Windows&nbsp;NT Server, the DomainAnnouncement datagram will also specify whether or not the browser computer is the domain PDC.</P></BODY></HTML>
