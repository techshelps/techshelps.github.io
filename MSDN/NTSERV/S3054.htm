<H1 CLASS="title">Chapter 1 - Windows&nbsp;NT Networking Architecture</H1><P CLASS="t">The Microsoft Windows&nbsp;NT operating system was designed and built with fully integrated networking capabilities. These networking capabilities differentiate Windows&nbsp;NT from other operating systems, such as MS-DOS, OS/2, and UNIX, in which network capabilities are installed separately from the core operating system. </P>
<P CLASS="t">This chapter introduces the Windows&nbsp;NT networking architecture. It provides you with descriptions of the following topics.</P>
<UL><LI>The design goals and rationale for the Windows&nbsp;NT operating system.</LI><LI>The basic components of the Windows&nbsp;NT operating system architecture.</LI><LI>The basics of networking architecture in general. This includes a detailed description of the model on which Windows&nbsp;NT was designed, as well as the industry standards and specifications.</LI><LI>The Windows&nbsp;NT vertical layers and the interfaces for communication between layers.</LI><LI>The Windows&nbsp;NT network protocols, which enable layers on two different computers to communicate with each other.</LI><LI>Distributed processing of applications across the network and the mechanisms Windows&nbsp;NT uses to create connections between servers and workstations. </LI><LI>The mechanisms for sharing resources across the network, including Multiple Universal Naming Convention Provider (MUP) and Multi-Provider Router (MPR).</LI><LI>The workstation and server services.</LI><LI>How binding options work, enabling communications between network layers.</LI><LI>How Remote Access Service (RAS) works to connect remote or mobile clients to corporate networks.</LI><LI>How Services for Macintosh are built into Windows&nbsp;NT, allowing Apple Macintosh clients to connect to a Windows&nbsp;NT Server as if it were any other AppleShare server. </LI></UL></BODY></HTML>
