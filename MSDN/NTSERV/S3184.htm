<H2 CLASS="h1">Centralized Services </H2><P CLASS="t">At Terra Flora, the goal of centralizing administrative services was achieved with the installation of Windows&nbsp;NT Server as the common platform from which to interoperate their heterogeneous networks. Use of the Windows&nbsp;NT network operating system has provided Terra Flora with the ability to administer all clients and servers running operating systems other than Windows&nbsp;NT from one client computer. Several sessions can be started on any computer running Windows&nbsp;NT Server or Workstation so the administrator can view and monitor all network computers.</P>
<P CLASS="t">Though there are some limitations to the extent of administrative functionality, Windows&nbsp;NT Server was the most flexible and functional solution to the challenges presented to Terra Flora's plan to centrally administer the different network operating systems. </P></BODY></HTML>
