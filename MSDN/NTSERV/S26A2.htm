<H1 CLASS="h1">Monitoring Server Processors</H1><P CLASS="t">The processors in a server running Internet Information Server must support the operating system and processes unrelated to Internet services, as well as IIS processes. The processors must also support applications related to Internet services, such as those that assemble data from SQL Server databases or generate dynamic Web pages.</P>
<P CLASS="t">You have a choice of several tools you can use to monitor processor performance. Task Manager, Microsoft Web Capacity Analysis Tool (WCAT), PerfLog, and Performance Monitor are commonly used to monitor processors on Windows&nbsp;NT servers. Also, Pentium counters, extensible counters that monitor the inner workings of Intel Pentium (P5) and Pentium Pro (P6) processors, are available on the <I>Windows&nbsp;NT Workstation Resource Kit</I> and <I>Windows&nbsp;NT Server Resource Kit</I> CDs. Remember that all tools use system resources. Monitor the processor use of the process in which the tool runs. Then, before you analyze your data, subtract the processor time of the tool process from the data.</P></BODY></HTML>
