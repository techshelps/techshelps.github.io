<H3 CLASS="h2">Using a RAM Drive on the Client</H3><P CLASS="t">You can optimize post-boot performance on your remoteboot clients by using a RAM drive. Use of a virtual disk, such as the Ramdrive.sys provided with most MS-DOS versions, can reduce network traffic by storing commonly used files and utilities locally. (If, however, the client does not have RAM to spare, using a virtual disk could increase swapping.)</P>
<P CLASS="t">The RAM drive should be placed first in the PATH environmental variable. Giving memory to file caches may also help performance, especially on the remoteboot server. For more information about memory management, see the documentation for the MS-DOS operating system and for the network client software.</P></BODY></HTML>
