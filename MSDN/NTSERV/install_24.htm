<h2>Creating the Phonebook Entry to Dial a PPTP Server</h2>
<p>
You must create a phonebook entry to connect to your PPTP server by using a VPN device.</p>
<p>
<b>Note</b>  You do not need to create a phonebook entry for your PPTP server if your computer is not PPTP-enabled and you are using a PPTP service provided by your ISP.</p>
<p>
Before starting the following procedures you must have:</p>
<p>
<font face="Symbol">&#183;</font> Installed all network protocols (IP, IPX, NetBEUI) used on the private network to which you want to connect.</p>
<p>
<font face="Symbol">&#183;</font> Configured RAS to dial out using the network protocols (IP, IPX, NetBEUI) used on the private network.</p>
<p>
<b>To create an phonebook entry to dial-up a PPTP server by using a VPN device</b></p>
<p>
1. Click <b>Start</b>, point to <b>Programs</b>, point to <b>Accessories</b>, and then click <b>Dial-Up Networking</b>. (If this is the first phonebook entry, a <b>Dial-Up Networking</b> dialog box appears. Click <b>OK</b>.)</p>
<p>
2. Type the name of your PPTP server in <b>Name the new phonebook entry</b>, and click <b>Next</b>.</p>
<p>
3. Click <b>I am calling the Internet</b> and click <b>Next</b>. This configures the phonebook entry to use TCP/IP and PPP as the Dial-Up Networking protocols.</p>
<p>
4. Select RASPPTPM(VPN1) in the Select the modem or adapter this entry will use box, and then click Next.</p>
<p>
5. Type the IP address of the adapter on the PPTP server that is connected to the Internet in the <b>Phone Number</b> box.</p>
<p>
<b>Note</b>  If your PPTP server has an Internet registered DNS name, you could alternatively enter its DNS name in this field.</p>
<p>
1. Click <b>Next</b>, and then click <b>Finish</b>.</p>
<p>
2. Verify the phonebook entry by using the following procedure.</p>
<p>
<b>Note</b>  If you are configuring the VPN device on an ISP server running Windows NT Server version 4.0 that is configured with multiple VPN devices, repeat this procedure for each VPN device.</p>
<p>
<b>To verify or edit your phonebook entry for the PPTP server</b></p>
<p>
1. Click <b>More</b> in <b>Dial-Up Networking,</b> and then click <b>Edit entry and modem properties</b> to verify that your PPTP server phonebook entry is correctly configured. The <b>Edit Phonebook Entry</b> dialog box appears, as illustrated in the following figure.</p>

<p>
2. Review the information on the <b>Basic</b> tab to ensure that the phone number is correct and that the <b>RASPPTPM(VPN1) </b>device is selected. Make any necessary changes.</p>
<p>
3. Click the <b>Server</b> tab.</p>

<p>
4. Review the information on the <b>Server</b> tab to ensure that the <b>Dial-up server type</b> displays &ldquo;PPP: Windows NT, Windows 95 Plus, Internet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
5. In the <b>Network protocols</b> box, ensure that the network protocols used on your private network are selected. Any selected protocol (TCP/IP, IPX/SPX, NetBEUI) must already be installed on the PPTP client you are configuring. In addition, RAS must be configured to use that protocol to dial out. Note that TCP/IP does not need to be selected unless it is the protocol used on your private network. </p>
<p>
6. If you use TCP/IP on your private network, click <b>TCP/IP Settings</b> to display the <b>PPP TCP/IP Settings</b> dialog box. Ensure that the TCP/IP settings conform to the settings required by the RAS configuration on the PPTP server. This includes the <b>Enable software compression</b> and<b> Enable PPP LCP extensions</b> settings</p>
<p>
7. Click the <b>Script</b> tab, and then select <b>None</b>. The PPP protocol used in RAS is designed to automate remote logon. If your ISP requires a manual logon, consult your ISP for the correct configuration. </p>
<p>
8. Click the <b>Security</b> tab. Click <b>Accept only Microsoft encrypted authentication</b>. The PPP protocol encrypts the user name and password for remote logon. The user name and password used to log on to the current session can be used by selecting <b>Use current username and password</b>. You are prompted by the PPTP server if this box is not selected. Both methods are encrypted and are therefore secure.</p>
<p>
<b>Note</b>  If you are configuring the VPN device on an ISP server running Windows NT Server version 4.0 that is configured with multiple VPN devices, repeat this procedure for each VPN device.</p>
