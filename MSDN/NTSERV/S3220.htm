<H1 CLASS="title">Chapter 14 - Using DLC with Windows&nbsp;NT</H1><P CLASS="t">A Data Link Control (DLC) protocol interface device driver is included in Windows&nbsp;NT Workstation and Windows&nbsp;NT Server version 4.0. The DLC protocol is traditionally used to provide connectivity to IBM mainframes. It is also used to provide connectivity to local area network print devices that are directly attached to the network instead of to a specific computer. The DLC protocol is not designed to be a primary protocol for use between personal computers, and it needs to be installed only on computers performing the above-mentioned tasks and not on other computers on the network.</P>
<P CLASS="t">This chapter provides information for the network administrator and support personnel who need information about using the DLC protocol device driver for Windows&nbsp;NT to connect to IBM mainframes or to use print devices that are directly attached to the network. The following topics are discussed in this chapter:</P>
