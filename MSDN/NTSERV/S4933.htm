<H3 CLASS="h2">How many printers can be supported by a Windows&nbsp;NT print server?</H3><P CLASS="t">The limitation on the number of printers that can be attached to Windows&nbsp;NT print server is dependent on whether the print server is a Windows&nbsp;NT Workstation computer or a Windows&nbsp;NT Server computer. Windows&nbsp;NT Workstation and Windows&nbsp;NT Server have been optimized for different roles in the network:</P>
<UL><LI>Windows&nbsp;NT Workstation is limited to 10 connections from other computers and should be used as a print server in small-network situations.</LI><LI>Windows&nbsp;NT Server has been optimized as a print, file, and application server.</LI><LI>Windows&nbsp;NT versions 3.5 and 3.51 are capable of supporting more printers than Windows&nbsp;NT version 3.1.</LI></UL><P CLASS="t">The limitation on total printers attached to a Windows&nbsp;NT Server print server should be determined by daily requirements for print throughput. Print throughput is determined by the processor capabilities. For example, a print server with approximately 64 meg RAM and a 486/66 or higher processor with a high throughput network card can support 25 to 30 DLC printers or 40 TCP/IP printers.</P></BODY></HTML>
