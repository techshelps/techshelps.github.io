<H3 CLASS="h2">Managers</H3><P CLASS="t">SNMP management programs are referred to as <I>managers</I>. Managers obtain data about network devices and make this information available to a network administrator through textual, graphical, or object-oriented user interfaces. The manager program sends SNMP messages to network hosts. These messages are received by the agent on the host, and initiate the <B>get</B>, <B>get-next</B>, and <B>set</B> operations. The manager program waits (listens) for the SNMP messages from the agent that contain the results of the operation, and displays the information on the SNMP-management console or saves the data in a specified file or database.</P>
<P CLASS="t">As noted earlier, the SNMP service running under Windows&nbsp;NT is an SNMP agent, which is the necessary framework needed for network management. However a separate SNMP manager program is needed to perform management operations. </P>
<P CLASS="t">There are several SNMP manager utilities provided with the Windows&nbsp;NT Server Resource Kit compact disc. Other network management software can be obtained from Microsoft or from third-party vendors. </P></BODY></HTML>
