<H1 CLASS="title">Chapter 6 - Troubleshooting Startup and Disk Problems</H1><P CLASS="t">This chapter discusses what you can do to find the cause of problems when your computer fails to complete startup. Failure to complete startup means that the computer stops or displays an error message before you can log on to Windows&nbsp;NT. This chapter also discusses causes of and recovery from disk problems.</P>
<P CLASS="t">There are several utilities that you can use to troubleshoot these kinds of problems. The <I>Windows&nbsp;NT Server Resource Kit </I>CD contains a Windows&nbsp;NT-based utility, DiskProbe, that you can use to examine and change information on individual disk sectors. Chapter 7, "Disk, File System, and Backup Utilities," contains more information about DiskProbe and the MS-DOS-based utilities that you can use to read, write, and change information on disk sectors.</P></BODY></HTML>
