<h3>After Connecting to a PPTP Server</h3>
<p>
After you successfully connect to a PPTP server, all traffic from your computer is first routed to your PPTP server, which then forwards your data across the LAN to the remote computer. Your PC will behave is if it were physically connected to the remote network. While the tunnel is open, you will continue to see computers and servers on your immediate LAN subnet. However, you may not be able to see hosts and servers on other subnets on your LAN. Contact your network administrator for more information.</p>
