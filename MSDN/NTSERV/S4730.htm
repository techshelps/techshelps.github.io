<H2 CLASS="h1">Using DLC to Connect to Print Devices</H2><P CLASS="t">You can also use DLC to provide connectivity to Hewlett-Packard local area network print devices that are directly attached to the network, not to a specific computer. The DLC protocol must be installed on the Windows&nbsp;NT-based print server that is used to configure and administer the network-attached print device.</P>
<P CLASS="t">To connect to and configure the Hewlett-Packard print device, you must install the DLC protocol and the Hewlett-Packard Network Port monitor on the Windows&nbsp;NT-based print server. Install the DLC protocol before using the Add Printer<B> </B>Wizard. Use the Add Printer Wizard to install the Hewlett-Packard Network Port and configure the print device.</P>
<P CLASS="t">Before starting the Add Printer Wizard:</P>
<UL><LI>Run self-test on the Hewlett-Packard print device to obtain the network adapter card address. The card address is a unique 12-byte number that is supplied by the card manufacturer.</LI><LI>Choose a logical name for the printer. This logical name will be used to identify the printer and will be associated to the card address.</LI></UL><P CLASS="t"><B>To configure a Hewlett-Packard print device that is directly connected to the network</B></P>
<P>    1.    Click <B>Start</B>, point to <B>Settings</B>, and click <B>Printers</B>.</P>
<P>    2.    Double-click <B>Add Printer</B>.</P>
<P>    3.    Select <B>My Computer</B>, and click <B>Next</B>.</P>
<P>    4.    Click <B>Add Port</B>.<B> </B></P>
<P>    5.    Select the Hewlett-Packard Network Port and click <B>OK</B>.</P>
<P>    6.    In <B>Name</B>, type the printer name.</P>
<P>    7.    If the print device is already attached to the network, select the appropriate card address in <B>Card Address</B>.</P>
<P>If the Hewlett-Packard print device is already attached to the network, the number you obtained from the print device self-test appears in the <B>Address</B> list box. If it does not appear, make sure that the print device is correctly attached and is connected on the same subnet as the Windows&nbsp;NT-based print server. DLC cannot be used to connect to printers on the far side of a router.</P>
<P>    8.    If the print device is not attached, or you are working off-line, type the card address number in <B>Card Address</B>.</P>
<P>    9.    Click <B>OK</B>.</P>
<P>The Add Printer Wizard will complete the configuration of the print device. </P>
