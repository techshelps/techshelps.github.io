<H3 CLASS="h2">Using the Windows&nbsp;NT Hardware Detection Tool (NTHQ)</H3><P CLASS="t">NTHQ is an MS-DOS-based program. The next procedure describes how to run the program. </P>
<H4 CLASS="h4"><A NAME="sec0"></A>To run NTHQ</H4><P>    1.    When running Windows&nbsp;NT, insert a blank 3.5-inch floppy disk in the drive.</P>
<P>    2.    Run Makedisk.bat from the \Support\Hqtool directory on the Windows NT Server product CD. </P>
<P>    3.    Leave the floppy disk inserted, and shutdown your computer.</P>
<P>    4.    When your computer restarts, you are running NTHQ. </P>
<P CLASS="t">The file Readme.txt on the floppy disk contains details about NTHQ. You can see the same information by clicking the Help button on the NTHQ screen.</P>
<P CLASS="t">These are the three ways that NTHQ is most often used:</P>
<UL><LI>Print hardware information, save it to a file, and keep the report and file with the other configuration information for your computer. This report can be used when planning to change the configuration.</LI><LI>If you are having problems installing Windows&nbsp;NT, you can start NTHQ from the floppy disk and use it for troubleshooting, The Readme.txt file contains troubleshooting tips for installation problems.</LI><LI>If you cannot start Windows&nbsp;NT, or have installed new hardware and cannot access it, NTHQ might help you troubleshoot the problem. Because NTHQ enables you to view the hardware that it detects, you can find out if any devices are not being detected. For example, if you have not changed your configuration since the last time you produced an NTHQ report, run a new one and compare the results. If you find a difference, you might have a hardware problem.</LI></UL></BODY></HTML>
