<H2 CLASS="h2">The Decision to Use Web Administration </H2><P CLASS="t">Web Administration for Microsoft Windows NT Server was chosen by Terra Flora because it is a centralized administration tool that enables remote administration of Windows NT servers from any computer that has a Web browser installed.</P>
<P CLASS="t">Most Terra Flora administrators work primarily at corporate headquarters in Sacramento, California. They travel to various locations within corporate headquarters to perform their work. When administrators are away from their computers, they also need to be able to administer the company's computers that run Windows NT Server. </P>
<P CLASS="t">For example, Terra Flora administrator AshleyM has an office and desktop client computer in the administrator's bull pen, which is located in the area of Building 1 that houses all the main Enterprise servers. On Tuesday, one of the payroll department servers in Building 4 failed. AshleyM went to Building 4 to reload and configure the payroll server. </P>
<P CLASS="t">While in Building 4, AshleyM received a call from a retail store manager stating that a recently hired employee did not have access to the retail store's software. </P>
<P></P>
<P CLASS="t">To better understand this scenario, refer to the Terra Flora network diagram inside the back cover of this supplement. The new employee would authenticate to the network through the server named NENTS40ENT01. AshleyM needs the ability to log on to the Web and set up the user account in the northeast domain from the client she was using in the Building 4 site. Without the Web Administration tool, AshleyM needs to contact another administrator to perform the task. </P></BODY></HTML>
