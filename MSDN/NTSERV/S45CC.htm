<H2 CLASS="h1">Microsoft Telnet Server (Beta)</H2><P CLASS="t">The Telnet Server tool in the Microsoft Windows&nbsp;NT Server Resource Kit version 4.0 provides basic TCP/IP Telnet Server functionality. A computer running the Telnet Server tool under Windows&nbsp;NT Server can support connections from various TCP/IP Telnet clients, including UNIX-based and Windows&nbsp;NT–based computers. </P>
<P CLASS="t">The Telnet Server tool supports command-line execution of commands that normally can be run in the command window—for example, TCP/IP tool or MS-DOS commands. A command you enter at the remote Telnet client console (computer) runs on the Windows&nbsp;NT– based Telnet Server computer. The Telnet Server then sends the results of the command back to the remote Telnet client computer.</P>
<P CLASS="t">When you install Windows&nbsp;NT Server or Windows&nbsp;NT Workstation, a Telnet client is automatically installed in the <B>Accessories</B> folder. You use the Telnet client to connect to another computer running a TCP/IP– based Telnet server—for example, the Windows&nbsp;NT– based Telnet server, or a UNIX-based Telnet server. </P>
<P CLASS="t">Each Telnet client session started on the Windows&nbsp;NT–based Telnet server is allocated a console session that runs in the remote user's desktop context and that does not interfere with any local user sessions on the computer running Telnet Server under Windows&nbsp;NT. At the start of a Telnet session, the remote Telnet client must provide a user name and password to log on to the Windows&nbsp;NT– based Telnet Server. This information is used to create a console session with the security attributes of the user. For example, an administrator can log on to a computer running Windows&nbsp;NT Workstation, start the Windows&nbsp;NT– based Telnet client, connect to the computer running Windows&nbsp;NT Server with the Telnet Server tool, and run command-line scripts to add users, services, and so on.</P>

<P>The Telnet Server tool provided with the Microsoft Windows&nbsp;NT Server Resource Kit version 4.0 is beta software. It does not support terminal types and provides only basic TTY functionality. To ask questions about the Telnet Server tool, contact rkinput@microsoft.com.</P>
