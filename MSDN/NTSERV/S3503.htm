<H2 CLASS="h1">Using an Uninterruptable Power Supply</H2><P CLASS="t">An Uninterruptable Power Supply (UPS) supplies power to a computer system in the event of a power fluctuation or complete power loss. The UPS has electronics built in that constantly monitor line voltages. If the line voltage fluctuates above or below predefined limits, or fails entirely, the UPS supplies power to the computer system from built-in batteries. The UPS converts the Direct Current (DC) battery voltage into the Alternating Current (AC) voltage required by the computer system. The changeover to batteries must take place very rapidly or the computer can lose data.</P>
<P CLASS="t">Most UPS devices are one of the following types:</P>
<UL><LI>Online UPS. You connect an online<I> </I>UPS between the main power and the computer to constantly supply your computer system with power. Connecting it to the main power keeps its battery charged. This method provides power conditioning, which means that it removes spikes, surges, sags, and noise.</LI><LI>Standby UPS. This device is configured to provide either the main power or its own power source and to switch from one to the other as necessary. When the main power is available, the UPS device connects the main power directly to the computer and monitors the main power voltage level. When the main power fails or the voltage falls below an acceptable level, the UPS device switches the power fed to the computer from the main power to its own power.</LI></UL><P CLASS="t">UPS systems provide a hardware interface that can be connected to the computer. Using appropriate software, this interface enables an orderly handling of the power failure, including performing a system shutdown before the UPS batteries are depleted. Without such software, an orderly shutdown of the system is not possible without human intervention.</P>
<P CLASS="t">The most important consideration in selecting a UPS product is to use only hardware that is listed on the Windows&nbsp;NT 4.0 Hardware Compatibility List (HCL). Other items to consider are:</P>
<UL><LI>Whether to use a UPS per computer or have larger capacity, centralized UPSs that protect multiple computers.</LI><LI>What type of UPS you want (standby and online are the most common). </LI><LI>The sizing for the UPS (how big the UPS needs to be to protect the load).</LI><LI>How long it needs to keep running before automatic shutdown.</LI><LI>Which features you want to have in your UPS, such as:

<UL><LI>Continuous conditioning of the incoming power to provide clean, steady power. </LI><LI>A Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) card that you can plug into the UPS and use network management software to remotely monitor the UPS. </LI><LI>Software that logs UPS information to the event log, or produces statistics. </LI><LI>Software for testing the integrity and reliability of the UPS battery.</LI></UL></LI></UL><P CLASS="t">Windows&nbsp;NT has built-in UPS functionality that takes advantage of the special features that many UPS systems provide. These features ensure the integrity of data on the system and provide for an orderly shutdown of both the computer system and the UPS should a power failure last long enough that the UPS batteries become depleted. In addition, users connected to a computer running Windows NT Server can be notified that a shutdown will occur and new users are prevented from connecting to the computer. Finally, damage to the hardware from a sudden, uncontrolled shutdown can be prevented.</P>
<P CLASS="t">Some vendors also provide a user interface for configuring the UPS, which you can use instead of the one provided in Windows&nbsp;NT.</P>
<P CLASS="t">This section contains a general overview of the Windows&nbsp;NT UPS service and discusses configuring and using the UPS on a computer running Windows&nbsp;NT. To fully protect your network, you should also install UPSs on network devices such as routers, hubs, and bridges. For the best protection, install UPSs on the cables that connect your computer and modem, telephone, printer, and network equipment.</P>
