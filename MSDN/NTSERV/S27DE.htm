<P CLASS="t">If your Internet Information Server is used infrequently by a small number of users, dial-up line connectivity that provides limited connection and access to the Internet may be appropriate. However, if your Internet Information Server is accessed by a large number of simultaneous users or provides 24-hour continuous availability, you should choose a dedicated connection and line technology that provides adequate bandwidth and availability.</P>
<P CLASS="t">Dial-up telephone lines, even with a fast modem and data compression, can create a large telephone bill for even a temporary connection. Leased lines, which offer more continuous connections, are in the long run more economical for companies that want to provide continuous availability to remote users.</P></BODY></HTML>
