<H3 CLASS="h2">Gopher Ports and Connections</H3><P CLASS="t">The Gopher protocol consists of a client and a server communicating through a TCP connection. The server waits at port 70 for a client request. The client, after initiating the connection, sends a <I>selector</I> to the server. A selector is a line of text that can consist of a series of characters or a null string. The server responds with a block of text terminated with a period on a line by itself. After receiving an acknowledgment from the client, the server closes the connection.</P>
<P CLASS="t">Similar to FTP, the Gopher client always communicates on a port whose number is greater than 1023. This port number changes each time a new transaction begins between the client and the server.</P></BODY></HTML>
