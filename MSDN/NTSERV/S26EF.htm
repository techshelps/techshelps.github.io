<H2 CLASS="h2">Analyzing the Working Set Data</H2><P CLASS="t">The working set of Inetinfo should be large enough to contain the Internet Information Server code and the data IIS references. The Inetinfo working set includes its code, objects in the IIS Object Cache, data structures for tracking connections, buffers for holding IIS Log data, and other data it uses. If the Inetinfo working set is not large enough to contain its code and data, the system must read and write the code and data from disk. Increased disk activity can seriously degrade server performance, particularly if code must be read from disk.</P>
<P CLASS="t">The following sections describe how to use data about the Inetinfo working set to determine if the server has enough memory to support Internet Information Server efficiently. </P></BODY></HTML>
