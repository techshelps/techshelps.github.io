<H2 CLASS="h1">Setting Up and Configuring Network Client</H2><P CLASS="t">The Setup program for Network Client identifies the computer's hardware and software, configures Network Client to run on the computer, and copies necessary files to the computer's hard disk.</P>
<P CLASS="t">Before you set up Network Client, you need to determine the following:</P>
<UL><LI>The user name to be used</LI></UL><P>The user name identifies a member of the workgroup or domain. Choose a unique name in the workgroup or domain.</P>
<UL><LI>The name to be assigned to the computer</LI></UL><P>This unique name identifies the computer within the network. Often this name is a variation of the user name.</P>
<UL><LI>The name of the user's workgroup and/or domain</LI></UL><P>This name determines how your computer fits in with other computers that are already organized into groups on the network. These are not names that you make up; they already exist on the network. Ask the network administrator if you don't know what names to use.</P>
<UL><LI>Full redirector or basic redirector</LI></UL><P>Full redirector means that you have all Network Client functions available, including logging on to domains and using advanced network applications. You can choose the basic redirector instead, which uses less memory and disk space, if you need only standard workgroup functions like connecting to shared files and printers.</P>
<P>To use Microsoft Windows with Network Client, you must install the full redirector, and you must start it with the <B>net start full</B> command before starting Windows. Windows for Workgroups, Windows&nbsp;95, and the Windows&nbsp;NT platform include their own network client capabilities, so you should not run Network Client with them.</P>
<P>If you will also use the Remote Access Service (RAS) to connect to a network over a phone line, you must install the full redirector.</P>
<UL><LI>The manufacturer and model of the network adapter</LI></UL><P>The Setup program attempts to determine the model of network adapter in the computer. Some network adapters have additional configuration options; see the network administrator or the network adapter documentation if you need to change configuration options.</P>
<UL><LI>The network protocol used on this network</LI></UL><P>Your computer must use the same protocol as the computers to which it connects. If you don't know what protocol the computers on your network use, ask the network administrator.</P>
<P CLASS="t">There are other options that you can change with the Setup program, but these are the most important options.</P>
<P CLASS="t"><B>To set up Network Client</B></P>
<P>    1.    Depending on the type of installation disk you have:</P>
<UL><LI>For an installation disk set (all Network Client software is on the disk), put the disk in a floppy disk drive. If you put the disk in drive A, type  <B>a:\setup</B> at the MS-DOS command prompt, and then press ENTER. If the floppy disk drive is a different letter, use that letter instead of <B>a</B>.</LI></UL><P>If the computer displays an error message about lack of memory, you may need to stop other programs that take up memory, by stopping the programs or by altering the Autoexec.bat file and restarting the computer.</P>
<UL><LI>For a network installation startup disk, put the disk in drive A and restart the computer. When the computer restarts, it will automatically run the Network Client installation program.</LI></UL><P>A prompt appears asking you for a username and password. Supply a username and password for an account with permission to connect to the directory on the computer running Windows&nbsp;NT Server where Network Client files are stored. When the computer displays a message about creating a password-list file, type <B>n</B> and then press ENTER.</P>
<P>The client must make a connection to the shared directory on the computer running Windows&nbsp;NT Server. If the computer displays an error message saying that "the specified shared directory cannot be found," check that the computer running Windows&nbsp;NT Server is indeed sharing the directory.</P>
<P>If the computer displays an error message about lack of memory, modify the Config.sys file on the network installation startup disk to use extended memory. For example, Emm386.exe and Himem.sys provide extended memory for MS-DOS 5.0 and later. If you do not have extended memory, use the NetBEUI or IPX protocols because they use less memory.</P>
<P>The network installation startup disk was configured using default settings for the network adapter. Please verify that the default settings are correct for your network adapter and modify them if necessary. (The settings are in the A:\Net\protocol.ini file.)</P>
<P>    2.    Follow the instructions of the Setup program.</P>
<P>If your network adapter does not appear in the list of supported network adapters, you may be able to use one of the following instead:</P>
<UL><LI>ArcNet-compatible for an ArcNet network adapter</LI><LI>NE1000-compatible for an 8-bit Ethernet network adapter that is not on the list</LI><LI>NE2000-compatible for a 16-bit Ethernet network adapter that is not on the list</LI></UL><P>If this still doesn't work, contact the network adapter manufacturer to obtain a device driver disk compatible with Microsoft Network Client. When you receive the driver disk, run <B>Setup</B> and choose <B>Network Adapter Not Shown On List Below</B>, and then follow the instructions.</P>
<P>If you need more information about any Setup dialog box, press F1 for Help.</P>
<P CLASS="t">The Network Client Setup program identifies the hardware on the computer, copies the Network Client files to the hard disk, and creates and modifies network configuration files. The Setup program creates System.ini and Protocol.ini files in the directory that contains the Network Client files. These files contain information about the computer's Network Client configuration.</P>
<P CLASS="t">Setup adds a <B>device</B> command to the Config.sys file to install the Ifshlp.sys device driver.</P>
<P CLASS="t">In the Autoexec.bat file, Setup adds to the <B>path</B> command the directory that contains the Network Client files. Also, if you specify that you want Network Client to start each time the computer is started, Setup adds the <B>net start</B> command. When <B>net start </B>runs, it examines the System.ini file, which contains information about the startup options you specified during Setup. Setup may add additional lines to the Autoexec.bat file to start programs needed for specific network protocols.</P>
<P CLASS="t">The changes Setup makes to the configuration files take effect when you restart the computer after the Setup program is finished.</P>
<P CLASS="t">If your startup information changes, you can update your configuration information by running Setup again. For example, you might change your workgroup name or network card.</P>
<P CLASS="t"><B>To update a setting after you install Network Client</B></P>
<P>    1.    Change to the directory that contains your installed Network Client files, and then type <B>setup</B> at the command prompt.</P>
<P>Do not run the Setup.exe program that is on the installation disk.</P>
<P>If the computer displays an error message about lack of memory, use the  <B>net stop rdr</B> command to stop the Network Client software before running Setup. You may need to stop other programs that take up memory by stopping the programs or by altering the Autoexec.bat file and restarting the computer. After running Setup, either restart the computer or, if you didn't change any settings, restart Network Client by typing <B>net start rdr</B>.</P>
<P>    2.    Examine the list that the Network Client Setup program displays to find the entries that you want to change. If a setting needs to be updated, press the up arrow key until you select that setting, and then press Enter.</P>
<P>    3.    Follow the instructions on your screen. If you need help at any time, press F1.</P></BODY></HTML>
