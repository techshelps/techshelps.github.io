<H3 CLASS="h2">Deleting a Client</H3><P CLASS="t">When you no longer want to boot a workstation remotely, you can remove it from the list of workstations in the Remoteboot service.</P>
<P CLASS="t"><B>To remove a client from the Remoteboot service</B></P>
<P>    1.    Start Remoteboot Manager on the server.</P>
<P>Remember to log on to a user account that belongs to the Administrators local group.</P>
<P>    2.    Select the workstation record for the client.</P>
<P>Or, select more than one record (hold down CTRL while clicking) to delete a group of workstation records at once.</P>
<P>    3.    On the <B>Remoteboot</B> menu, click <B>Delete</B>.</P>
<P>    4.    Verify that you want to delete this workstation record.</P>
<P CLASS="t">If Remoteboot Manager originally created an account while creating a workstation record, removing the workstation record also removes the account associated with that client. If the account existed before the workstation record, then the account will remain after removing the workstation record.</P>
<P CLASS="t">If the client was a Windows&nbsp;95 client, you may want to delete the client's machine directory.</P>
<P CLASS="t">If the client has a bootable hard drive, you need to disable the remoteboot process and allow the client to use the hard drive again.</P>
<P CLASS="t"><B>To disable the Remoteboot process</B></P>
<P>    1.    Start the client, booting MS-DOS remotely or from a floppy disk.</P>
<P>    2.    Put the disk with the Rpldsabl.exe program in the client's floppy disk drive and type:</P>
<P><I>a:</I><B>rpldsabl</B></P>
<P>where <I>a:  </I>is the client's floppy disk drive.</P>
<P>(If you don't have the disk anymore, see the section "Enabling Remoteboot on a Client's Hard Disk," earlier in this chapter, for instructions on making this disk.)</P>
<P>    3.    Remove the disk and press CTRL+ALT+DEL.</P></BODY></HTML>
