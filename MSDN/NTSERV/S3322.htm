<P CLASS="t">Use WINS Manager to view and change parameters for WINS servers on the network for which you have administrator privileges. WINS Manager Help is organized to provide information for each of the specific administration and configuration tasks that you need to perform to manage WINS servers. See WINS Manager Help for specific task lists and instructions.</P>
<P CLASS="t"><B>Note</B></P>
<P>Other tools you can use to manage WINS servers include the Performance Monitor and SNMP agent service. Use Performance Monitor to monitor WINS server performance. Use the SNMP service to monitor and configure WINS servers by using third-party SNMP manager tools. Note that when using a third-party SNMP manager tool, some WINS queries may time out; if so, you should increase the time-out on the SNMP tool you are using.</P></BODY></HTML>
