<H3 CLASS="h2">Planning for Replication Partners and Proxies</H3><P CLASS="t">Choosing whether to configure another WINS server as a push partner or pull partner depends on several considerations, including the specific configuration of servers at your site, whether the partner is across a wide area network (WAN), and how important it is to distribute changes throughout the network. Only one computer configured as a WINS proxy should be installed on each subnet. (Configuring more than one WINS proxy per subnet can overload the WINS servers on the same subnet.)</P>
<P CLASS="t">In one possible configuration, one WINS server can be designated as the central server, and all other WINS servers can be configured as both push partner and pull partner of this central server. Such a configuration ensures that the WINS database on each server contains addresses for every node on the WAN.</P>

<P CLASS="t">Another option is to set up a chain of WINS servers, where each server is both the push partner and pull partner with a nearby WINS server. In such a configuration, the two servers at the ends of the chain would also be push and pull partners with each other.</P>

<P CLASS="t">Other replication partner configurations can be established for your site's needs. For example, in the following illustration, Server1 has only Server2 as a partner, but Server2 has three partners. So, for example, Server1 gets all replicated information from Server2, but Server2 gets information from Server1, Server3, and Server4.</P>
