<h3>Verifying Connections</h3>
<p>
Before beginning a WCAT test, you need to verify the WCAT server, controller, and client computers can communicate with each other. Also, you need to verify the computer names and IP addresses have been entered correctly.</p>
<p>
To do so, perform the following two procedures:</p>
<p>
<font face="Symbol">&#183;</font> Verify the client computers can communicate with the server computer and the controller computer.</p>
<p>
<font face="Symbol">&#183;</font> Verify the controller computer can communicate with the server computer and the client computers.</p>
<h4>Verifying Connections to the Client Computers</h4>
<p>
Use the TCP/IP ping utility included in Windows&nbsp;NT Workstation, Windows NT Server, and Windows&nbsp;95 to test the connection between the client computers and the server and controller computers. For information on how to use ping, see &ldquo;TCP/IP Procedures&rdquo; in Control Panel Help.</p>
<p>
<b>To test the connection between the clients and the server </b></p>
<p>
1.On a client computer, click <b>Start</b>, select <b>Programs</b>, and click <b>Command Prompt</b>. </p>
<p>
2.At the command prompt, type <b>ping </b><i>server </i>where <i>server</i> is the<i> </i>computer name or IP address of the server computer. </p>
<p>
If the ping command successfully connects to the server, the client-server connection is working. If the ping command cannot successfully connect to the controller, an error message appears at the command prompt. Perform the preceding procedure for each client computer.</p>
<p>
<b>To test the connection between the clients and the controller </b></p>
<p>
1.On a client computer, click <b>Start</b>, select <b>Programs</b>, and click <b>Command Prompt</b>.</p>
<p>
2.At the command prompt, type <b>ping</b><i> controller</i> where <i>controller </i>is the computer name or IP address of the controller computer.</p>
<p>
If the ping command cannot successfully connect to the controller, an error message appears at the command prompt.</p>
<p>
3.If ping cannot successfully connect to the controller, start Notepad and open the file Stctrler.cmd. Verify the computer name that appears in Stctrler.cmd after the line <b>set WC_CTRLERNAME=</b> is the same as the computer name of the controller.</p>
<p>
If the computer name is not the same, repeat step 6 of the procedure &ldquo;To install WCAT on the client computer,&rdquo; earlier in this guide.</p>
<p>
4.From the client computer, ping the controller computer using the controller&rsquo;s IP address. Make a note of the correct IP address of the controller.</p>
<p>
5.View Stctrler.cmd using Notepad, and verify the IP address that appears in Stctrler.cmd after <b>set WC_CTRLER=</b> is the same as the IP address of the controller computer. </p>
<p>
If the computer IP address is not the same, repeat step 6 of the procedure &ldquo;To install WCAT on the client computer,&rdquo; earlier in this guide.</p>
<p>
Perform the preceding procedure for each client computer.</p>
<h4>Verifying Connections to the Controller Computer</h4>
<p>
You also use the ping utility to test the connection between the controller computer and the server and client computers.</p>
<p>
<b>To test the connection between the controller and the clients</b></p>
<p>
<font face="Symbol">&#183;</font> From the controller computer, ping each client computer using the computer name or IP address of the client computer. </p>
<p>
<b>To test the connection between the controller and the server </b></p>
<p>
1.From the controller computer, ping the server computer using the computer name of the server computer. Make a note of the correct computer name of the server. </p>
<p>
2.Start Notepad, and open the file Srvname.cmd. Verify the computer name that appears in Svrname.cmd after the line <b>set webserver=</b> is the same as the computer name of the server computer. </p>
<p>
If the computer name is not the same, repeat step 6 of the procedure &ldquo;To install WCAT on the controller computer,&rdquo; earlier in this guide.</p>
<p>
3.From the controller computer, ping the server computer using the IP address  of the server computer. Make a note of the correct IP address of the server computer.</p>
