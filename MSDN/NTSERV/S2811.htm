<H2 CLASS="h2">Remote Access to the Registry</H2><P CLASS="t">Windows NT includes a number of security features that protect the Registry from inadvertent or unwarranted access. Windows&nbsp;NT&nbsp;establishes an access control list (ACL) for each Registry subtree, key, and subkey that determines who has access to a Registry element and what a user is permitted to do to that element.</P>
<P CLASS="t">In addition, Windows NT version 4.0 includes an optional security check that controls remote access to the Registry. This check determines which users can connect to the Registry from another computer. After a user is connected, the ACLs for each Registry element govern the user's access to the Registry.</P>
<P CLASS="t">This section explains how Windows NT controls who can connect to the Registry of a remote computer, and it describes:</P>
<P>     How the system determines who can connect to the Registry.</P>
<P>     The <B>winreg </B>subkey, whose ACL determines who can connect to the Registry.</P>
<P>     The default values for the <B>winreg</B> ACL and how to change them.</P>
<P>     The <B>AllowedPaths</B> subkey of <B>winreg</B>, which stores a list of commonly used Registry paths. Users who are not included in the <B>winreg</B> ACL can connect to the Registry by using access keys listed in these exception paths.</P>
<P></P>
<P CLASS="t">This material is intended for users who are familiar with both the basic structure of the Windows NT Registry and the basic security features of Windows NT. It is a supplement to <I>Windows NT Workstation Resource Guide,</I> Part V, "Windows NT Registry," and it corrects an error in <I>Windows NT Workstation Resource Guide</I> Chapter 6, "Windows NT Security."</P>
<P CLASS="t">This material also contains a related topic, "Remote Performance Monitoring," which explains the <B>winreg</B> permissions that must be granted to anyone who uses Performance Monitor to monitor Windows&nbsp;NT computers remotely.</P>
<P></P>
<P>Warning</P>
<P>To add or modify a Registry value entry, use admininstrative tools such as Control Panel or System Policy Editor whenever possible. Using a Registry editor (Regedit or Regedt32) to change a value can have unforeseen effects, including changes that can prevent you from starting your system.</P>
