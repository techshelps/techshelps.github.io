<H3 CLASS="h2">Installing and Configuring TCP/IP</H3><P CLASS="t">Protocols are selected during the installation of a Windows&nbsp;NT operating system. The TCP/IP protocol must be configured differently for the various clients and client services.</P>
<P CLASS="t">The Terra Flora plan is to reduce network administration and improve performance by installing DHCP, WINS, and DNS to dynamically address computers, resolve names, and easily integrate with the existing UNIX environment. The installation of DHCP for dynamic addressing will decrease administration by lowering the number of entries necessary when the computers are moved from one physical location to another. The installation of WINS and DNS to resolve names will decrease the network traffic caused by computers announcing their presence to the network.</P>
<H4 CLASS="h3"><A NAME="sec0"></A>Configuring TCP/IP Clients</H4><P CLASS="t">Only clients running an operating system software from the list below can be configured to act as a DHCP and WINS clients. </P>

Configured clients can register their NetBIOS names with computers running Windows&nbsp;NT Server WINS service. The names and IP addresses will be passed to other computers to permit communications between the computers on the network. The configured clients can be located by computers running Windows&nbsp;NT Server DNS service and, therefore, communicate with other computers on the network. </P>
