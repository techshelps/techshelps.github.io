<H3 CLASS="h2">The Decision to Centralize Administrative Tasks</H3><P CLASS="t">To Terra Flora, one of the major benefits of installing and configuring Windows&nbsp;NT Server services is the ability to administer all clients and servers on the network from a central point, regardless of the geographic location of the computer or which operating system is running. </P>
<P CLASS="t">Additionally, all the servers can be administrated on one client running Windows&nbsp;NT Workstation or Server because the computer will support the running of multiple sessions.</P>
<P CLASS="t">Most of the administration of all network servers will be performed by the network administration staff located in Sacramento, California. The administration may not be performed on a single computer, but the ability to do so provides greater flexibility to the network administrators. Occasionally, the administrators will want to sign onto machines while visiting remote sites and administer computers located at corporate headquarters or at the remote sites. At some remote sites administration may be localized to reduce excessive wide area network (WAN) traffic. </P>
<P CLASS="t">The administrative tasks necessary to manage the clients and servers are the same regardless of the operating system that is being run on the computer. For example, administrators set up and maintain user accounts and grant permissions to users or groups of users on Windows&nbsp;NT Servers as well as on UNIX and NetWare servers. Administrative tools are supplied with each operating system and the idea of interoperability includes the ability to sign onto any computer in the network and run any administrative tools on any network computer. Windows&nbsp;NT provides this capability.</P>
<P CLASS="t">This ability will reduce the administrative costs associated with managing a network the size of Terra Flora's. This eliminates the need for administrators to be located at remote sites, the need for administrators to travel to remote sites to perform routine administrative tasks and eliminates some of the wide area network (WAN) traffic that would occur administering files remotely.</P>
<P CLASS="t">The following table provides examples of which administrative tools are provided by which operating systems to remotely administer the servers at Terra Flora. This section will focus on the ability to connect to the administrative tool from Windows&nbsp;NT. The details of how to use each of the administrative tools is provided in the documentation accompanying the operating system.</P>
