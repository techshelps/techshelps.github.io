<H3 CLASS="h2">Installing the Remoteboot Service on the Remoteboot Server</H3><P CLASS="t">Have on hand the Windows&nbsp;NT&nbsp;Server compact disc. You will also need original product disks for any operating system that you want the remoteboot clients to run, such as MS-DOS or Windows&nbsp;95 disks.</P>
<P CLASS="t">The installation procedure differs depending on whether you are installing a new remoteboot directory or converting an existing LAN Manager for OS/2 remoteboot directory. Use one of the two following procedures.</P>
<P CLASS="t"><B>To install the Remoteboot service (with a new remoteboot directory)</B></P>
<P>    1.    If they are not already installed, install the DLC and NetBEUI protocols on the server. The Remoteboot service requires DLC and NetBEUI. </P>
<P>    2.    Click <B>Start</B>, point to <B>Settings</B>, and click <B>Control Panel</B>. </P>
<P>    3.    Double-click <B>Network</B>.</P>
<P>    4.    In the <B>Network Settings</B> dialog box, click <B>Add Software</B>.</P>
<P>    5.    In the <B>Add Network Software</B> dialog box, select the <B>Remoteboot Service</B>.</P>
<P>    6.    In the<B> Remoteboot Setup</B> dialog box, type the full path and directory name where you want to install the remoteboot directory.</P>
<P><img src="XNG_S06.gif"></P>
<P>The default value is <I>&lt;systemroot&gt;</I>\Rpl. This is the directory shown in descriptions and examples.</P>
<P>    7.    Click <B>OK</B>.</P>
<P>    8.    Complete the dialog boxes that appear.</P>
<P>For help with any dialog box, press F1.</P>
<P CLASS="t">See the post-installation information after the next procedure.</P>
<P CLASS="t"><B>To install the Remoteboot service (converting a LAN Manager for OS/2 remoteboot directory)</B></P>
<P>    1.    Use the Windows&nbsp;NT&nbsp;Server Upgrade for LAN Manager tools to convert the LAN&nbsp;Manager server's user accounts and file permissions. Then the remoteboot conversion can properly assign permissions and user account properties.</P>
<P>    2.    On the Windows&nbsp;NT Server computer, delete the RPLUSER global group (it is created by the Upgrade for LAN Manager tools). The <B>Fix Security</B> command of Remoteboot Manager will create an RPLUSER local group.</P>
<P>Note that users who administer the Windows&nbsp;NT Remoteboot service must be members of the Administrators local group. The Upgrade for LAN&nbsp;Manager tools convert the LAN&nbsp;Manager RPLADMIN group to a Windows&nbsp;NT RPLADMIN global group, but it has no function under Windows&nbsp;NT.</P>
<P>    3.    Copy the entire remoteboot directory from the OS/2 server to the Windows&nbsp;NT&nbsp;Server computer.</P>
<P>For example, if the LAN&nbsp;Manager remoteboot directory is \\SERVER3\C$\LANMAN\RPL and the Windows&nbsp;NT remoteboot directory is C:\Winnt\Rpl, type the following command at the Windows&nbsp;NT Server computer:</P>
<P><B>xcopy  /e  \\server3\c$\lanman\rpl  c:\winnt\rpl</B></P>
<P>Keep a copy of the Rpl directory for later reference. Be especially sure to keep backup copies of any .ini, .cnf, and .fit files that were modified from their default state.</P>
<P>    4.    If they are not already installed, install the DLC and NetBEUI protocols on the server.</P>
<P>The Remoteboot service requires DLC and NetBEUI. </P>
<P>    5.    In <B>Control Panel</B>, double-click <B>Network</B>.</P>
<P>    6.    In the <B>Network Settings</B> dialog box, click <B>Add Software</B>.</P>
<P>    7.    In the <B>Add Network Software</B> dialog box, click the <B>Remoteboot Service</B>.</P>
<P>    8.    In <B>Remoteboot Setup</B>, make the following choices:</P>
<UL><LI>In the <B>Remoteboot Directory</B> box, type the full path and directory name of the remoteboot directory on the Windows&nbsp;NT&nbsp;Server (for example, C:\Winnt\Rpl).</LI><LI>Select the <B>Migrate Remoteboot Directory From LAN Manager 2.2</B> check box.</LI></UL><P>    9.    Click <B>OK</B>.</P>
<P>    10.    Complete the dialog boxes that appear.</P>
<P>For help with any dialog box, press F1.</P>
<P>    11.    Copy the new LAN&nbsp;Manager client software to locations in the Windows&nbsp;NT&nbsp;Server computer's Rpl directory, using the following commands:</P>
<P><B>xcopy  /e  </B><I>d:</I><B>\clients\rpl\bblock  c:\</B><I>systemroot</I><B>\rpl\bblock<BR>xcopy  /e  </B><I>d:</I><B>\clients\rpl\fits  c:\</B><I>systemroot</I><B>\rpl\fits<BR>xcopy  /e  </B><I>d:</I><B>\clients\rpl\rplfiles  c:\</B><I>systemroot</I><B>\rpl\rplfiles</B></P>
<P>where <I>d:</I>  is the computer's compact disc drive.</P>
<P>    12.    Run the <B>rplcnv</B> conversion program after remoteboot installation.</P>
<P>The <B>rplcnv</B> program converts the RPL.MAP and RPLMGR.INI files used by the LAN&nbsp;Manager Remoteboot service into the System.mdb and Rplsvc.mdb files used by the Windows&nbsp;NT Remoteboot service database. </P>
<P>This is the syntax for <B>rplcnv</B>:</P>
<P><B>rplcnv  </B><I>[path]</I></P>
<P>where <I>path</I> specifies an absolute path to the directory containing the RPL.MAP and RPLMGR.INI files. If this parameter is omitted, it is assumed that the files are in the current directory or in <I>&lt;systemroot&gt;</I>\Rpl.</P>
<P>    13.    Compare the new .ini, .cnf, and .fit files in the remoteboot directory to the backup copies you made before conversion.</P>
<P>If you had modified the OS/2 versions of these files, you may want to transfer those modifications to the Windows&nbsp;NT versions. Do not simply copy the OS/2 versions over the Windows&nbsp;NT versions, because you might overwrite new data.</P>
<P>    14.    In Step 11 you installed new configurations. If you have profiles that you want to preserve from the LAN&nbsp;Manager installation, modify the profiles' Autoexec.bat and Config.sys files as follows:</P>
<UL><LI>Autoexec.bat:  @Rpllink is no longer needed; this file has been replaced with Rpllnk.sys, which is loaded from Config.sys.</LI><LI>Config.sys:  Add the following line as the first line in the file:
<P CLASS="spacing"><BR></P>
DEVICE=C:\BINR\RPLLNK.SYS
</LI></UL><P CLASS="t">Whether you install a new Rpl directory or migrate from OS/2, the installation process creates the following major directories:</P>
<UL><LI>Rpl (at the location you specify during installation and with a different name if you want). This is the remoteboot directory.</LI><LI>Rpl\Bblock. This directory contains boot blocks for each client configuration.</LI><LI>Rpl\Fits. This directory contains <I>file index table</I> (FIT) files that translate references to a file on the client to a true path to the file on the server. For example, for a client using a profile shared with other clients, the FIT file would map C:\Config.sys to \\<I>server</I>\Rplfiles\Profiles\<I>profile</I>\Config.sys, where <I>server</I> is the server's name and <I>profile</I> is the profile for this client.</LI><LI>Rpl\Rplfiles. This directory contains files specific to each client as well as shared files such as profiles and operating system files. This directory is shared with the name Rplfiles.</LI><LI>Rpl\Rplfiles\Binfiles\Dos<I>xxx</I>. These directories contain shared MS-DOS system files.</LI><LI>Rpl\Rplfiles\Binfiles\Lanman.dos. This directory contains Microsoft Network Client version 2.2 for MS-DOS, the network software used by all remoteboot clients.</LI><LI>Rpl\Rplfiles\Binfiles\Win95. This directory contains shared Windows&nbsp;95 real-mode (also identified as MS-DOS 7.0) system files.</LI></UL><P CLASS="t">The first time you run Remoteboot Manager and choose the <B>Fix Security</B> command, it creates the RPLUSER local group and assigns permissions as appropriate throughout the Rpl directory.</P>
