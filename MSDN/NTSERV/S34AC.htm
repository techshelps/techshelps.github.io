If your print device is bi-directional, make sure that the cable has "1284" printed on it. The cable should be six to 15 feet (maximum).</LI><LI>If your print device is bi-directional, make sure that the parallel port is set correctly. Some are set to AT-compatible mode by default, which is not bi-directional. Set the port to PS/2 mode in the BIOS to get bi-directional functionality.</LI></UL></BODY></HTML>
