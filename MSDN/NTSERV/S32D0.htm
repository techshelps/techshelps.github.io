<P>Network Driver Interface Specification (NDIS) 4.0-compliant peripheral devices attached to a Windows&nbsp;NT-based computer are also manageable by using the Windows&nbsp;NT-based SNMP service. If the device is to be managed by using SNMP, the device vendor must provide a device .inf file that can be registered in the Windows&nbsp;NT-based Registry.</P>
<P CLASS="t">The Windows&nbsp;NT-based SNMP agent is implemented as a service and can be installed on Windows&nbsp;NT-based computers that use the TCP/IP and IPX protocols. The TCP/IP protocol must be installed before installing SNMP. For more information about installing SNMP, see TCP/IP Help.</P>
<P CLASS="t"><B>Note</B></P>
<P>You must install TCP/IP to be able to install the SNMP service, even if IPX is installed as the main network protocol. </P>
<P CLASS="t">The SNMP service is implemented as a Windows 32-bit service by using Windows Sockets over both TCP/IP and IPX/SPX. The additional Microsoft MIBs for DHCP, WINS, and the Internet Information Server, extend SNMP management to these Windows&nbsp;NT-based services. The agent programs that implement these additional MIBs are referred to as <I>extension-agents</I>. The extension-agent programs work with the master Windows&nbsp;NT-based agent program. These Windows&nbsp;NT-based extension-agents are implemented as Windows 32-bit dynamic-link libraries (DLLs).</P>
<P CLASS="t">The following diagram shows a simple interaction between an SNMP manager computer and a Windows&nbsp;NT-based computer with an SNMP agent program.</P>
