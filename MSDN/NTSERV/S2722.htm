<P>A</P>
<P><b>access control entry (ACE)</b></P>
<P>An entry in an access control list (ACL). Each access control entry defines the protection or auditing to be applied to a file or other object for a specific user or group of users. <I>See also </I>access control list (ACL).</P>
<P><b>access control list (ACL)</b></P>
<P>The part of a security descriptor that enumerates both the protections to accessing and the auditing of that accessing that are applied to an object. The owner of an object has discretionary access control of the object and can change the object's ACL to allow or disallow others access to the object. Access control lists are ordered lists of access control entries (ACEs). There are two types of ACLs: discretionary (DACL) and system (SACL). <I>See also </I>access control entry (ACE); discretionary access control list (DACL); system access control list (SACL).</P>
<P><b>access permission</b></P>
<P>A rule associated with an object (usually a directory, file, or printer) to regulate which users can have access to the object and in what manner. <I>See also</I> user rights.</P>
<P><b>access privileges</b></P>
<P>Permissions set by Macintosh users that allow them to view and make changes to folders on a server. By setting access privileges (called <I>permissions</I> when set on the computer running Windows&nbsp;NT Server), you control which Macintosh can use folders in a volume. Services for Macintosh (SFM) translates access privileges set by Macintosh users to the equivalent Windows&nbsp;NT permissions.</P>
<P CLASS="t"></P>
<P><b>access token (or security token)</b></P>
<P>An object that uniquely identifies a user who has logged on. An access token is attached to all the user's processes and contains the user's security ID (SID), the SIDs of any groups to which the user belongs, any permissions that the user owns, the default owner of any objects that the user's processes create, and the default access control list (ACL) to be applied to any objects that the user's processes create. <I>See also</I> permissions. </P>
<P><b>access violation</b></P>
<P>An attempt to carry out a memory operation that is not allowed by Windows&nbsp;NT memory management. This can include an invalid operation (such as writing to a read-only buffer); accessing memory beyond the limit of the current program's address space (a "length violation"); accessing a page to which the system forbids access; or accessing a page that is currently resident but dedicated to the use of an Executive component.</P>
<P><b>account</b></P>
<P><I>See</I> group account; user account.</P>
<P><b>account lockout</b></P>
<P>A Windows&nbsp;NT Server security feature that locks a user account if a number of failed logon attempts occur within a specified amount of time, based on account policy lockout settings. (Locked accounts cannot log on.) </P>
<P><b>account policy</b></P>
<P>Controls the way passwords must be used by all user accounts of a domain or of an individual computer. Specifics include minimum password length, how often a user must change his or her password, and how often users can reuse old passwords. Account policy can be set for all user accounts in a domain when administering a domain, and for all user accounts of a single workstation or member server when administering a computer.</P>
<P><b>ACK</b></P>
<P>Short for acknowledgment. The transmission control protocol (TCP) requires that the recipient of data packets acknowledge successful receipt of data.  Such acknowledgments (ACKs) generate additional network traffic, diminishing the rate at which data passes in favor of reliability.  To reduce the impact on performance, most hosts send an acknowledgment for every other segment or when a specified time interval has passed.</P>
<P><b>acknowledgment</b> </P>
<P><I>See</I> ACK.</P>
<P><b>active</b></P>
<P>Refers to the window or icon that you are currently using or that is currently selected. Windows&nbsp;NT always applies the next keystroke or command you choose to the active window. If a window is active, its title bar changes color to differentiate it from other windows. If an icon is active, its label changes color. Windows or icons on the desktop that are not selected are inactive. </P>

<P>Within Network Monitor, an address refers to a hexadecimal number that identifies a computer uniquely on the network.</P>
<P><b>address classes</b></P>
<P>Predefined groupings of Internet addresses, with each class defining networks of a certain size. The range of numbers that can be assigned for the first octet in the IP address is based on the address class. Class A networks (values 1 – 126) are the largest, with over 16 million hosts per network. Class B networks (128 – 191) have up to 65,534 hosts per network, and Class C networks (192 – 223) can have up to 254 hosts per network. <I>See also</I> octet.</P>

<P><b>ARP</b></P>
<P><I>See</I> Address Resolution Protocol.</P>
<P><b>ARP reply packet</b></P>
<P>All ARP-enabled systems on the local IP network detect ARP request packets, and the system that owns the IP address in question replies by sending its physical address to the requester in an ARP reply packet.  The physical/IP address is then stored in the ARP cache of the requesting system for subsequent use. <I>See also</I> Address Resolution Protocol (ARP); ARP request packet; Internet Protocol (IP); MAC address.</P>
<P><b>ARP request packet</b></P>
<P>If two systems are to communicate across a TCP/IP network, the system sending the packet must map the IP address of the final destination to the physical address of the final destination. This physical address is also referred to as a MAC address, a unique 48-bit number assigned to the network interface card by the manufacturer. IP acquires this physical address by broadcasting a special inquiry packet (an ARP request packet) containing the IP address of the destination system. <I>See also</I> Address Resolution Protocol (ARP); Internet Protocol (IP); MAC address; media access control (MAC).</P>

<P>For the servers of a domain or for an individual computer, defines the type of security events that will be logged.</P>
<P><b>authentication</b></P>
<P>Validation of a user's logon information. When a user logs on to an account on a computer running Windows&nbsp;NT Workstation, the authentication is performed by that workstation. When a user logs on to an account on a Windows&nbsp;NT Server domain, authentication may be performed by any server of that domain. <I>See also</I> Basic (clear-text) authentication; challenge/response authentication; server; trust relationship.</P>
<P><b>B</b></P>
<P><b>backup domain controller (BDC)</b></P>
<P>In a Windows&nbsp;NT Server domain, a computer running Windows&nbsp;NT Server that receives a copy of the domain's directory database, which contains all account and security policy information for the domain. The copy is synchronized periodically and automatically with the master copy on the primary domain controller (PDC). BDCs also authenticate user logons and can be promoted to function as PDCs as needed. Multiple BDCs can exist on a domain. <I>See also</I> member server; primary domain controller (PDC). </P>
<P><b>backup set</b></P>
<P>A collection of files from one drive that is backed up during a single backup operation.</P>
<P><b>backup set catalog</b></P>
<P>At the end of each backup set, Windows&nbsp;NT Backup stores a summary of file and/or directory information in a backup set catalog. Catalog information includes the number of tapes in a set of tapes as well as the date they were created and the dates of each file in the catalog. Catalogs are created for each backup set and are stored on the last tape in the set. <I>See also</I> backup set.</P>
<P><b>backup set map</b></P>
<P>At the end of each tape used for backup, a backup set map maintains the exact tape location of the backup set's data and catalog.</P>
<P><b>backup types:</b></P>
<P><b>copy backup</b></P>
<P>Copies all selected files, but does not mark each file as having been backed up.  Copying is useful if you want to back up files between normal and incremental backups, because copying will not invalidate these other backup operations.</P>
<P><b>daily backup</b></P>
<P>Copies all selected files that have been modified the day the daily backup is performed.</P>
<P><b>differential backup</b></P>
<P>Copies those files created or changed since the last normal (or incremental) backup. It does not mark files as having been backed up.</P>
<P><b>incremental backup</b></P>
<P>Backs up only those files created or changed since the last normal (or incremental) backup. It marks files as having been backed up.</P>
<P><b>normal backup</b></P>
<P>Copies all selected files and marks each as having been backed up. Normal backups give you the ability to restore files quickly because files on the last tape are the most current.</P>
<P><b>bandwidth</b></P>
<P>In communications, the difference between the highest and lowest frequencies in a given range. For example, a telephone line accommodates a bandwidth of 3000 Hz, the difference between the lowest (300 Hz) and highest (3300 Hz) frequencies it can carry. In computer networks, greater bandwidth indicates faster data-transfer capability and is expressed in bits per second (bps). Also known as "throughput."</P>
<P><b>Bandwidth Throttler</b></P>
<P>A feature of the IIS services that enforces a limit on the amount of bandwidth available to the IIS services. This limit applies to the sum of bandwidth used by all three IIS services. Administrators can enable the Bandwidth Throttler and set a bandwidth limit by using the Microsoft Internet Service Manager. </P>
<P><b>Basic (clear-text) authentication</b></P>
<P>A method of authentication that encodes user name and password data transmissions. Basic authentication is called "clear text" because the base-64 encoding can be decoded by anyone with a freely available decoding utility. Note that encoding is not the same as encryption. <I>See also</I> challenge/response authentication; encryption.</P>
<P><b>batch program</b></P>
<P>An ASCII file (unformatted text file) that contains one or more Windows&nbsp;NT commands. A batch program's filename has a .cmd or .bat extension. When you type the filename at the command prompt, the commands are processed sequentially. </P>

<P>The screen displayed when Windows&nbsp;NT encounters a serious error.</P>
<P><b>bookmarks</b></P>
<P>A Windows&nbsp;NT feature that enables you to highlight major points of interest at various points in a Performance Monitor log file and then return to them easily when you work with that log file later on during performance monitoring. Bookmarks are also used in other applications, such as Microsoft Word.</P>
<P><b>boot loader</b></P>
<P>Defines the information needed for system startup, such as the location for the operating system's files. Windows&nbsp;NT automatically creates the correct configuration and checks this information whenever you start your system.</P>
<P><b>BOOTP</b></P>
<P><I>See</I> Bootstrap protocol.</P>
<P><b>boot partition</b></P>
<P>The volume, formatted for either an NTFS or FAT file system, that contains the Windows&nbsp;NT operating system and its support files. The boot partition can be (but does not have to be) the same as the system partition. <I>See also</I> file allocation table (FAT); partition; Windows NT file system (NTFS).</P>
<P><b>Bootstrap protocol (BOOTP)</b></P>
<P>A TCP/IP network protocol, defined by RFC 951 and RFC 1542, used to configure systems. DHCP is an extension of BOOTP. <I>See also</I> Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP).</P>

<P><I>See</I> bits per second.</P>
<P><b>branch</b></P>
<P>A segment of the directory tree, representing a directory (or folder) and any subdirectories (or folders within folders) it contains. </P>
<P><b>bridge</b></P>
<P>Connects multiple networks, subnets, or rings into one large logical network. A bridge maintains a table of node addresses and, based on this, forwards packets to a specific subnet, reducing traffic on other subnets. In a bridged network, there can be only one path to any destination (otherwise packets would circle the network, causing network storms). A bridge is more sophisticated than a repeater, but not as sophisticated as a router. <I>See also</I> packet; repeaters; router; subnet.</P>
<P><b>broadcast datagram</b></P>
<P>An IP datagram sent to all hosts on the subnet. <I>See also</I> datagram; Internet Protocol (IP); subnet.</P>
<P><b>broadcast message</b></P>
<P>A network message sent from a single computer that is distributed to all other devices on the same segment of the network as the sending computer.</P>
<P><b>broadcast name resolution</b></P>
<P>A mechanism defined in RFC 1001/1002 that uses broadcasts to resolve names to IP addresses through a process of registration, resolution, and name release. <I>See also</I> broadcast datagram; IP address.</P>
<P><b>brouter</b></P>
<P>Combines elements of the bridge and the router. Usually, a brouter acts as a router for one transport protocol (such as TCP/IP), sending packets of that format along detailed routes to their destinations. The brouter also acts as a bridge for all other types of packets (such as IPX), just passing them on, as long as they are not local to the LAN segment from which they originated. <I>See also</I> bridge; packet; router.</P>
<P><b>browse</b></P>
<P>To view available network resources by looking through lists of folders, files, user accounts, groups, domains, or computers. Browsing allows users on a Windows&nbsp;NT network to see what domains and computers are accessible from their local computer. <I>See also</I> Windows&nbsp;NT browser system.</P>
<P><b>browse list</b></P>

<P><b>buffer</b></P>
<P>A reserved portion of memory in which data is temporarily held pending an opportunity to complete its transfer to or from a storage device or another location in memory. Some devices, such as printers or the adapters supporting them, commonly have their own buffers. <I>See also</I> memory. </P>
<P><b>built-in groups</b></P>
<P>Default groups, provided with Windows&nbsp;NT Workstation and Windows&nbsp;NT Server, that have been granted useful collections of rights and built-in abilities. In most cases, a built-in group provides all the capabilities needed by a particular user. For example, if a domain user account belongs to the built-in Administrators group, logging on with that account gives a user administrative capabilities over the domain and the servers of the domain. To provide a needed set of capabilities to a user account, assign it to the appropriate built-in group. <I>See also</I> group; User Manager; User Manager for Domains.</P>

<P></P>
<P><b>caching</b></P>
<P>In DNS name resolution, caching refers to a local cache where information about the DNS domain name space is kept. Whenever a resolver request arrives, the local name server checks both its static information and the cache for the name to IP address mapping. <I>See also</I> Domain Name System (DNS); IP address; mapping.</P>
<P><b>Callback Control Protocol (CBCP)</b></P>
<P>A protocol that negotiates callback information with a remote client.</P>

<P><b>challenge/response authentication</b></P>
<P>A method of authentication in which a server uses challenge/response algorithms and Windows&nbsp;NT security to control access to resources. <I>See also</I> Basic (clear-text) authentication; encryption.</P>
<P><b>change log</b></P>
<P>An inventory of the most recent changes made to the directory database such as new or changed passwords, new or changed user and group accounts, and any changes to associated group memberships and user rights. Change logs provide fault tolerance, so if your system crashes before a write completes, Windows&nbsp;NT can complete the write the next time you boot. This log holds only a certain number of changes, however, so when a new change is added, the oldest change is deleted. <I>See also</I> directory database; fault tolerance.</P>
