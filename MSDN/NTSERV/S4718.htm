<H2 CLASS="h1">Examine the Route Table by Using Route</H2><P CLASS="t"><B>Route</B> is used to view or modify the route table. <B>Route print</B> displays a list of current routes known by IP for the host, including routes that Windows&nbsp;NT creates by default and routes learned by running RIP. Sample output is shown in the IP section of this chapter. <B>Route add</B> is used to add routes to the table, and <B>route delete</B> is used to delete routes from the table. Note that routes added to the table are not made permanent unless the <B><I>-p</I></B> switch is specified. Non-persistent routes last only until the computer is restarted.</P>
<P CLASS="t">In order for two hosts to exchange IP datagrams, they must both have a route to each other, or use default gateways that know of a route. Normally, routers exchange information with each other using a protocol such as RIP. </P></BODY></HTML>
