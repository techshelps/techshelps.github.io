<H3 CLASS="h2">Security in Mixed Operating System Environments</H3><P CLASS="t">Windows&nbsp;NT Server has an open networking architecture that allows flexibility in communicating with other network products. Client computers running operating systems other than Windows&nbsp;NT Workstation or Windows&nbsp;NT Server can interact with computers in a Windows&nbsp;NT Server domain. However, they do not have domain computer accounts and, therefore, do not have Windows&nbsp;NT Workstation logon security. Users running other operating systems can have user accounts stored in the directory database, but the computer itself does not have logon security to restrict access to its own resources.</P>
<P CLASS="t">Computers running Windows&nbsp;NT Workstation or Windows&nbsp;NT Server can also interact with servers and clients running other operating systems. Various protocols and other software that allows interoperability are either included with Windows&nbsp;NT Server or are available separately.</P>
<H4 CLASS="h3"><A NAME="sec0"></A>Workgroup Clients</H4><P CLASS="t">A <I>workgroup</I> is a collection of computers (not users) that form an administrative unit and do not belong to a domain. In a workgroup, each computer tracks its own user- and group-account information and — in contrast to domain controllers — does not share this information with other workgroup computers. </P>
<P CLASS="t">Workgroup members log on only to workstation accounts and can view directories of other workgroup members over the network.</P>
<P CLASS="t">Computers running Windows&nbsp;NT Workstation, Windows&nbsp;NT Server, Windows for Workgroups, or Windows&nbsp;95 can be configured to participate in either a domain or a workgroup. When setting up one of these computers for networking, you specify a computer name and a workgroup name. If the workgroup name matches a domain name, the computer name appears in the browse list for that domain. The computer can browse computers running Windows&nbsp;NT Server and Windows&nbsp;NT Workstation that participate in either a domain or a workgroup. You can  specify whether the computer will log on to a Windows&nbsp;NT Server domain or a workgroup when you set up Windows&nbsp;NT.</P>
<H4 CLASS="h3"><A NAME="sec1"></A>Windows&nbsp;95 Clients</H4><P CLASS="t">Access to Windows&nbsp;NT Server networking is built in to Windows&nbsp;95. Users with domain accounts who run Windows&nbsp;95 can log on to their accounts the same way users running Windows&nbsp;NT Workstation do. Windows&nbsp;95 user-account logons can be validated by both Windows&nbsp;NT Server domain controllers and LAN Manager 2<I>.x</I> domain controllers.</P>
<H4 CLASS="h3"><A NAME="sec2"></A>MS-DOS Clients</H4><P CLASS="t">MS-DOS client computers running one of the following components can use shared network resources on the respective servers:</P>
<UL><LI>Microsoft Network Client for MS-DOS version 3.0 enables computers running MS-DOS to interact with domain controllers running Windows&nbsp;NT Server and with computers running Windows&nbsp;NT Workstation or LAN Manager 2.<I>x</I> servers. </LI><LI>Microsoft LAN Manager for MS-DOS version 2.2 enables computers running MS-DOS to interact with LAN Manager 2.<I>x</I> servers and Windows&nbsp;NT Server domain controllers.</LI></UL><P CLASS="t">Because computers running MS-DOS cannot store user accounts, they don't participate in domains the way Windows&nbsp;NT computers do. Each computer running MS-DOS usually has a default domain for browsing. An MS-DOS user with a domain account can be set up to browse any domain, not merely the domain containing the user's account.</P>
<H4 CLASS="h3"><A NAME="sec3"></A>LAN Manager 2.<I>x</I> Servers and Clients</H4><P CLASS="t">Windows&nbsp;NT Server interoperates with Microsoft LAN Manager 2.<I>x</I> systems. Computers running LAN Manager workstation software on MS-DOS, Windows&nbsp;3.1, or OS/2 can connect to servers running Windows&nbsp;NT Server. LAN Manager 2.<I>x</I> servers (on computers running either OS/2 or UNIX) can also work with servers running Windows&nbsp;NT Server — even in the same domain.</P>
<P CLASS="t">Microsoft LAN Manager for OS/2 version 2.2 is a component of Windows&nbsp;NT Server that enables computers running OS/2 version 1.3<I>x </I>to interact with LAN Manager 2.<I>x</I> servers and computers running Windows&nbsp;NT Workstation and Windows&nbsp;NT Server. If an OS/2 version 1.3<I>x </I>system is running these components, it can share network resources with the respective servers.</P>
<H4 CLASS="h3"><A NAME="sec4"></A>Novell NetWare Clients</H4><P CLASS="t">You can connect computers running Windows&nbsp;NT Server to NetWare file and print resources by using NWLink protocol software and Gateway Service for NetWare. You can also enable a gateway to share NetWare file and print resources with Microsoft networking clients without NetWare client software.</P>
<P CLASS="t">NetWare client computers can also connect to file and print resources and server applications on computers running Windows&nbsp;NT Server. </P>
<H4 CLASS="h3"><A NAME="sec5"></A>Macintosh Clients</H4><P CLASS="t">Microsoft Windows&nbsp;NT Server Services for Macintosh is a component of Windows&nbsp;NT Server that enables Windows clients and Apple Macintosh clients to share files and printers. With Services for Macintosh, one computer running Windows&nbsp;NT Server can act as a server for both types of computer, and Macintosh computers can share resources with any client supported by Windows&nbsp;NT Server, including MS-DOS and LAN Manager client computers. </P></BODY></HTML>
