<H3 CLASS="h2">Anonymous Access</H3><P CLASS="t">Internet Information Server permits anonymous access in the WWW, FTP, and Gopher services by default. There are no differences between an anonymous intranet site and an anonymous Internet site.</P>
<P CLASS="t">But even when you use anonymous access, all activity on a system running Internet Information Server determines permissions by user name. Associating a user name with every action is fundamental to Windows&nbsp;NT security. </P>
<P CLASS="t">During installation, Internet Information Server creates IUSR_<I>computername</I>, a standard user account, as the user name for all anonymous access. A random password is generated for IUSR_<I>computername</I>. The account is added to the local directory services database on stand-alone systems or to the domain directory services database on primary or backup domain controllers. You modify this account by using User Manager. </P>
<P CLASS="t">Internet Explorer and most other Web browsers do not provide a user name and password when connecting to a Web server, so Internet Information Server uses the IUSR_<I>computername</I> account, as shown in Figure 3.1.</P>

<P CLASS="t">Anonymous access is enabled by default. You set anonymous access by using the <B>Service</B> property sheet for each service. The account information for the IUSR_<I>computername</I> or other account specified in the <B>Service</B> property sheet must also agree with the settings in User Manager for the same account, as shown in Figure 3.2. Users are denied access if the user name and password do not match. </P>

<P CLASS="t">To provide <I>only </I>anonymous access—which is preferable for most installations—you clear the <B>Basic (clear text)</B> and <B>Windows&nbsp;NT Challenge/Response</B> boxes. If you provide anonymous access only, no one can use a Windows&nbsp;NT account maliciously. For example, anonymous-only settings prevent anyone from gaining access by using the Administrator account or any other account with sufficient permissions to alter your computer.</P></BODY></HTML>
