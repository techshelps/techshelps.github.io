<H3 CLASS="h2">How to Make Unsupported Modems Work <BR>in pre-Windows&nbsp;NT 3.5 RAS Versions</H3><P CLASS="t">You may be able to make RAS 1.1a, RAS for Windows for Workgroups 3.11, and RAS for Windows&nbsp;NT version 3.1 work with an unsupported modem (for example, a V.fc,V.fast, or V.34 modem, which is unsupported in these versions). If you want to use a V.fc, V.fast, or V.34 modem, it is recommended that you use a RAS client computer that has a 486 processor or later, and a serial port that has a 16550 UART chip or later. If problems occur, configure your modem to use V.32<I> bis</I>.</P>
<P CLASS="t">The easiest way to get an unsupported modem supported under RAS for Windows for Workgroups 3.11 or RAS for Windows&nbsp;NT 3.1 is to obtain a modem that is supported in RAS for Windows&nbsp;NT 3.5 or 3.51. The following procedure assumes that you have a modem that is supported in Windows&nbsp;NT 3.5 or 3.51. If your modem is not supported in Windows&nbsp;NT 3.5 or 3.51 or you have RAS 1.1a, skip the following procedure, but read the rest of this chapter, and then follow the instructions in the Help topic "Modifying MODEM.INF."</P>
<H4 CLASS="h4"><A NAME="sec0"></A>To make an unsupported modem work</H4><P>    1.    From the RAS for Windows&nbsp;NT 3.5 or 3.51 MODEM.INF file, copy the section that applies to your modem. </P>
<P>    2.    Load MODEM.INF into a text editor and append the copied section to the RAS for Windows for Workgroups 3.11 or Windows&nbsp;NT 3.1 MODEM.INF file.</P>
<P>    3.    Remove the lines that start with the following words from the section you appended:</P>
<P>DETECT_STRING=</P>
<P>DETECT_RESPONSE=</P>
<P></P>
<P CLASS="t"><B>Note</B></P>
<P>RAS modem autodetection is not supported in RAS for Windows for Workgroups 3.11 and RAS for Windows&nbsp;NT 3.1.</P>
<P></P>
<P>    4.    Save MODEM.INF, and then quit the text editor.</P>
<P>    5.     Restart your computer.</P>
<P>    6.    Depending on whether you have Windows&nbsp;NT 3.1 or Windows for Workgroups 3.11, continue with the following corresponding section.</P>
<P></P>
<P></P>
<H4 CLASS="h4"><A NAME="sec1"></A>To make an unsupported modem work in Windows for Workgroups 3.11</H4><P>    1.    Restart the RAS client software, and then choose <B>Configure</B> from the <B>Setup</B> menu. </P>

<H4 CLASS="h4"><A NAME="sec2"></A>To make an unsupported modem work in Windows&nbsp;NT 3.1</H4><P>    1.    Start Control Panel, and then choose the <B>Network </B>icon.</P>

<P>RAS is now ready to use your modem.</P>
