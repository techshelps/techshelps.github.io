<H1 CLASS="title">Chapter 5 - Network Services: Enterprise Level </H1><P CLASS="t"><I>The following chapter is a tested but largely unedited draft of material that will appear in expanded form in the next update of the </I>Windows&nbsp;NT Server Resource Kit<I>. At that time, the case study will be further revised and expanded to include details about the Divisional, Department, and Desktop server services and other helpful information</I>. </P>
<P CLASS="t">Chapter 4 introduced Terra Flora, a hypothetical case study of a fictitious company and of the challenges that company faces in bringing together its diverse, previously independent networks. The purpose of the case study is to show in real-world terms how network administrators and information officers can utilize Windows&nbsp;NT to integrate new and legacy hardware and software in a cost-effective way. The chapter further analyzed the Terra Flora case and developed a plan for interoperability. The next step for Terra Flora is to make choices about the Windows&nbsp;NT Server services and to configure those services. </P>
<P CLASS="t">Services will ultimately be configured on four defined levels of usage, depending on the scope of those services within the organization. These levels are, in order of increasingly narrow scope: Enterprise, Division, Department (or Branch Office), and Desktop. This chapter will deal with server services, but only on the Enterprise level. Detailed discussions of service configurations for the other three levels are not included in this edition of the Microsoft Windows&nbsp;NT 4.0 <I>Networking Guide.</I></P>
<P CLASS="t">Enterprise-level server services are the those provided on a large scale to the entire network. These services primarily support the network itself; they are services that support other servers and keep the corporation-wide information synchronized on all areas of the network. These services include the following:</P>
<UL><LI>Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)</LI><LI>Windows Internet Name Service (WINS)</LI><LI>Domain Name System (DNS)</LI><LI>Network Logon Services</LI><LI>Centralized Services</LI><LI>Replication</LI><LI>Backup</LI><LI>Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol</LI></UL><P CLASS="t">This chapter will make repeated references to the Terra Flora Network Diagram, printed on the inside back cover of this book. For convenience, open the diagram now so that you can easily refer to it as you read these discussions. </P>
<P CLASS="t">Terra Flora is a totally fictitious company whose business operations and networking environment are being examined and used to demonstrate the functionality of Windows&nbsp;NT Server products throughout this Interoperability section. The names of companies, products, people, characters, and data mentioned herein are fictitious and are in no way intended to represent any real individual, company, product, or event, unless otherwise noted. </P></BODY></HTML>
