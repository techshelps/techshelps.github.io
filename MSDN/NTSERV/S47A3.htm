All but a few of the WINS configuration parameters that can be set by editing the Registry can also be set by using SNMP. For information about which WINS parameters can be set by using SNMP, refer to the description of the WINS MIB in Appendix C, "MIB Object Types for Windows NT."<B> </B>WINS objects that are defined with <I>Access read-write</I> can be configured by using SNMP.</P></BODY></HTML>
