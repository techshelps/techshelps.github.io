<H3 CLASS="h2">Management Information Base</H3><P CLASS="t">A management information base (MIB) is a data file containing the managed-object descriptions and object values. Each host that is to be managed by SNMP must have a MIB that describes the manageable objects on that host.</P>
<P CLASS="t">Basically, a MIB will define the following for every object contained within that MIB:</P>
<UL><LI>the association between (1) the host hardware or software component (object) and (2) an object name and an object identifier.</LI><LI>A definition of the data type used to define the object.</LI><LI>A textual description of the object.</LI><LI>An index method used for objects that are a complex data type.</LI><LI>The read or write access that is allowed on the object.</LI></UL><P CLASS="t">RFC 1213 defines an industry-standard SNMP MIB referred to as MIB-II. Industry vendors, such as Microsoft, can define additional MIBs that allow unique hardware or software services developed by the vendor to be monitored and managed by SNMP management consoles. </P>
<P CLASS="t"><B>Note</B></P>
<P>Additional MIBs that are supported by Windows&nbsp;NT Server are described in Appendix C, "MIB Object Types for Windows&nbsp;NT."</P></BODY></HTML>
