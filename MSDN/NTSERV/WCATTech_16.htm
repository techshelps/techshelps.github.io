At the outset, we wanted to find a high throughput mark for any given hardware and software platform. In addition, we wanted to look at price/performance measure of various servers. The Web Capacity Analysis Tool reports data related to configuration, page downloads, bytes received (sent by server), connection throughput, average and maximum connect times, average and maximum response times. In addition to reporting results based on log files, you should note the configuration of the system, such as the processors, hard disk, network adapter, software tuning, and any additional uses besides running the server.</code>
