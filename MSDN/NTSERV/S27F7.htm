<H2 CLASS="h2">Configuring Dial-up Networking for ISP DNS </H2><P CLASS="t">Dial-up networking enables you to connect to remote networks by using a modem or adapter such as an ISDN adapter. If you connect to an ISP by using dial-up networking and do not correctly configure TCP/IP or DNS name server information in dial-up networking, you can experience connectivity or name resolution errors.</P>
<P CLASS="t">To configure a computer with a dial-up network connection to an ISP, use the configuration procedure described in this section. Before you start, you must have completed the following:</P>
<P>     You must have installed and configured your modem or adapter.</P>
<P>     You must have installed TCP/IP on your computer.</P>
<P>     You must have installed and configured Windows NT Server Remote Access Service (RAS), which provides the dial-up networking feature.</P>
<P></P>
<P CLASS="t">You will also need the following information before you start: </P>
<P>     Your user name.</P>
<P>     Your password.</P>
<P>     Your ISP domain name.</P>
<P>     Telephone number to dial up the ISP network.</P>
<P>     Your default gateway address — the IP address of the ISP computer to which you connect.</P>
<P>     The IP addresses of your DNS name server and the DNS name server used by your ISP. The installation by default configures dial-up networking to use the ISP DNS name server. However, if your ISP does not provide a DNS name server or if you to want to specify a combination of your intranet and the ISP DNS name servers, you must configure the IP addresses.</P>
<P>     Any telephony options you must use, for example PBX or long-distance dialing.</P>
<P>     Your logon procedure. Providing this information is necessary only if your ISP uses a special logon procedure.</P>
