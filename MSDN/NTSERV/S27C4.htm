<H2 CLASS="h2">Using Network Monitor to Monitor Bandwidth</H2><P CLASS="t">Network Monitor is a tool that lets you monitor the data sent and received by the local computer. It provides many capabilities, including enabling users to:</P>
<P>     Capture or trace data and filter it based on different attributes. </P>
<P>     Monitor throughput based on bytes or frames.</P>
<P>     Monitor bandwidth based on the percentage of the network used.</P>
<P>     Monitor errors, a possible consequence of an overloaded network.</P>
<P></P>
<P CLASS="t">The Windows&nbsp;NT Server CD includes Network Monitor as an optional Windows NT tool. </P>
<P> <FONT FACE="Symbol">Û</FONT>    To install Network Monitor</P>
<P>    1.    Double-click the Network icon in Control Panel. </P>
<P>    2.    Click the <B>Services</B> tab, and then click <B>Add</B>.</P>
<P>    3.    In the <B>Network Service </B>box, double-click <B>Network Monitor Tools and Agent</B>.</P>
<P></P>
<P CLASS="t">Network Monitor comes with a Help file (Netmon.hlp) and a glossary (Nmgloss.hlp). It is also documented in detail in Chapter 10, "Monitoring Your Network," in <I>Microsoft Windows NT Server Concepts and Planning</I>.</P>
<P CLASS="t">For an overall view of bandwidth, use the <B>Network Monitor Frames Per Second </B>and <B>Bytes Per Second </B>status bars. Use the <B>%&nbsp;Network Utilization </B>status bar to view monitor network capacity used. The <B>#&nbsp;Frames Dropped </B>field indicates the number of frames that are not processed because the buffers on the network adapters are full. Frame-dropping occurs when the processor cannot handle the traffic generated by the network.</P></BODY></HTML>
