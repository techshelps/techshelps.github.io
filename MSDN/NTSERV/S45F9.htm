<H3 CLASS="h2">Distributed Processing</H3><P CLASS="t">A powerful computer can share its processing power, executing tasks on behalf of other computers. Applications that split processing between networked computers are called <I>distributed applications</I>. A<B> </B>client/server application is a distributed application in which processing is divided between a workstation (the client) and a more powerful server. The client portion is sometimes referred to as the front end and the server portion is sometimes referred to as the back end.</P>
<P CLASS="t">The client portion of a client/server application usually consists of just the user interface to the application. It runs on the client workstation and takes a low-to- average amount of processing power. Typically, processing done by the client portion requires a large network bandwidth. For example, the client portion would handle screen graphics, mouse movements, and keystrokes.</P>
<P CLASS="t">The server portion of a client/server application often requires large amounts of data storage, computing power, and specialized hardware. It performs operations that include database lookups, updates, and mainframe data access.</P>
<P CLASS="t">The goal of distributed processing is to move the actual application processing from the client system to a server system with the power to run large applications. During execution, the client portion formats requests and sends them to the server for processing. The server executes the request.</P></BODY></HTML>
