<H2 CLASS="h1">Resource Kit Compact Disc</H2><P CLASS="t">The <I>Windows&nbsp;NT Server Resource Kit</I> CD includes a wide variety of tools and programs to help you work more efficiently with both Windows&nbsp;NT Workstation and Windows&nbsp;NT Server. You can read about some of the enhancements made to the existing tools and programs as well as new ones that have been added for this version 4.0 release in the Introduction to the <I>Windows NT Server Resource Guide</I>.</P>
<P CLASS="t">The CD that accompanies the<I> Windows&nbsp;NT Server Resource Kit</I> contains programs that apply to information in the<I> Windows&nbsp;NT Workstation Resource Guide, </I>the<I> Windows&nbsp;NT Server Resource Guide,</I> the <I>Windows&nbsp;NT Server Networking Guide</I>, and the<I> Windows&nbsp;NT Server Internet Guide</I>.<I> </I>This new CD replaces all previous ones. It includes a collection of information resources, tools, and programs that can make networking and working with the Windows<I>&nbsp;</I>NT platform even easier. </P>
<P CLASS="t"><B>Note</B></P>
<P>The programs on this CD are designed and tested for the U.S. version of Windows<I>&nbsp;</I>NT version 4.0. Use of these programs on any other version of Windows<I>&nbsp;</I>NT can cause unpredictable results.</P>
<P CLASS="t">A large Help file with explanations of and user actions for the majority of the messages included in Windows<I>&nbsp;</I>NT version 4.0, and a large Help file of Performance Counter Definitions are just two of the major items included on the <I>Windows&nbsp;NT Server Resource Kit</I> CD. Updates to these files and others will be provided, when available, on the Microsoft Internet web site for the Windows NT Resource Kits. See the Rktools.hlp file for the exact site address, as well as the addresses of other Microsoft information sites.</P>
