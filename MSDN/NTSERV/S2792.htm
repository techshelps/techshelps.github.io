<H3>DSMN Provides Benefits to Network Users</H3><P CLASS="t">In addition to simplifying administrative tasks, DSMN provides the following benefits to network users:</P>
<P>     New users are added to the network quickly. The administrator adds the user to the Windows NT Server Directory Services, and the user account is automatically propagated back to all authorized NetWare servers.</P>
<P>     Each user's account name and password are identical on all NetWare and Windows NT servers, so the same name and password are used regardless of where a user logs on.</P>
<P>     Users who use Windows NT Server Remote Access Service (RAS) can log on through RAS by using the same user account and password.</P>
<P>     Windows NT Directory Services can authenticate users to business applications that are running on the Windows NT and NetWare servers. </P>
