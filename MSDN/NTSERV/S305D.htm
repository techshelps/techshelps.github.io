<H2 CLASS="h1">Basic Concepts of Network Architecture</H2><P CLASS="t">Networking software must perform a wide range of functions to enable communications among computers. Some of these functions are listed below.</P>
<UL><LI>Device and I/O redirection</LI><LI>Process address registration</LI><LI>Interprocess connection</LI><LI>Password encryption and decryption</LI><LI>Message segmentation and desegmentation</LI><LI>Frame routing between networks</LI><LI>Frame delimiting and media-access arbitration</LI><LI>Pulse encoding of bits</LI></UL><P CLASS="t">To reduce the design complexity of a network, these functions are organized into groups, which are then allocated to a series of layers. The purpose of each layer is to offer services to the other layers, shielding the layers from the details of how the offered services are actually implemented. The services provided by a particular layer are a product of the network functions allocated to that layer and are usually built upon services offered by other layers. The design of the set of layers and of how they function with each other constitutes a <I>network architecture.</I></P>
