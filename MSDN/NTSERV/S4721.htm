<P> <FONT FACE="symbol">·</FONT>    Use the <B>netstat -a </B>command to show the status of all activity on TCP and UDP ports on the local computer. </P>
<P>The state of a good TCP connection is usually established with 0 bytes in the send and receive queues. If data is blocked in either queue or if the state is irregular, there is probably a problem with the connection. If not, you are probably experiencing network or application delay.</P></BODY></HTML>
