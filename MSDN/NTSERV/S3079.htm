<H2 CLASS="h1">The Windows&nbsp;NT Layered Network Architecture</H2><P CLASS="t">A significant difference between the Windows&nbsp;NT operating system and other operating systems is that the networking capabilities were built into the system from the ground up. With MS-DOS, Windows 3<I>.x</I>, and OS/2, networking was added to the operating system.</P>
<P CLASS="t">By providing both client and server capabilities, a computer running Windows&nbsp;NT Server or Windows&nbsp;NT Workstation can be either a client or server in either a distributed-application environment or a peer-to-peer networking environment. </P>
<P CLASS="t">The following illustration shows the specific way Windows&nbsp;NT implements the OSI model.</P>

<P CLASS="t">To understand the Windows&nbsp;NT operating system capabilities, it is important to understand the network architecture. The networking architecture with its layered organization provides expandability by allowing other functions and services to be added.</P>
<P CLASS="t">The rest of the chapter is devoted to an explanation of the concepts and features of the Windows&nbsp;NT layered networking architecture, including the following topics.</P>
