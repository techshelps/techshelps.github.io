<h3>Verifying Your Configuration</h3>
<p>
If you are having problems connecting to a PPTP server, make sure you have correctly configured your PPTP client. This section provides a list of steps you should take to make sure you have correctly configured your PPTP client. If you still cannot connect to a PPTP server, see the section &ldquo;Troubleshooting Your PPTP Connection.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
Verify the following:</p>
<p>
<font face="Symbol">&#183;</font> Make sure that your workstation and its applications support the protocols native to the target network (the network you will be tunneling to).</p>
<p>
<font face="Symbol">&#183;</font> If you are tunneling through the Internet, make sure your Internet connection is working properly.</p>
<p>
<font face="Symbol">&#183;</font> In Network in Control Panel, make sure that you have added the PPTP protocol.</p>
<p>
<font face="Symbol">&#183;</font> In Network in Control Panel, make sure that you have configured at least one VPN port.</p>
<p>
<font face="Symbol">&#183;</font> Check the phone book entry for the PPTP server to make sure it is for a VPN device, not a modem.</p>
<p>
<font face="Symbol">&#183;</font> Make sure you have a valid account on the PPTP server.</p>
<p>
<font face="Symbol">&#183;</font> Check the phone book entry for the PPTP server to make sure it includes the IP address or host name of the PPTP server.</p>
<p>
<font face="Symbol">&#183;</font> Check the phone book entry for the PPTP server to make sure it includes all the protocols used on the target network.</p>
<p>
<font face="Symbol">&#183;</font> If the target network uses TCP/IP, check the phone book entry for the PPTP server to make sure the TCP/IP settings are correctly configured for the target network.</p>
<p>
<font face="Symbol">&#183;</font> If you are making two connections, make sure that the second connection is a VPN connection.</p>
