<H1 CLASS="title">Chapter 6 - TCP/IP Implementation Details</H1><P CLASS="t">The Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) suite is a set of networking transports that govern how data passes between networked computers. Microsoft has adopted TCP/IP as the strategic enterprise network transport for its platforms. Microsoft 32-bit TCP/IP for Windows NT is a high-performance, portable, 32-bit implementation of the industry-standard TCP/IP protocol.</P>
<P CLASS="t">This chapter is intended for network engineers and support professionals who are already familiar with TCP/IP or who have read the TCP/IP chapters in the <I>Networking Supplement</I> for Windows NT Server version 4.0. This chapter provides additional technical detail about Microsoft 32-bit TCP/IP as implemented in Windows NT.</P>
<P CLASS="t">This chapter discusses the following topics:</P>
<UL><LI>Microsoft TCP/IP architectural model</LI><LI>Microsoft Network Driver Interface Specification (NDIS) </LI><LI>Core TCP/IP protocol stack components </LI><LI>Transport driver interface (TDI)</LI><LI>Network application interfaces and Microsoft TCP/IP</LI><LI>Windows NT client/server programs that use TCP/IP</LI></UL><P CLASS="t">This chapter concludes with a summary of TCP/IP changes in Windows&nbsp;NT Server version 4.0.</P>
<P CLASS="t">Network traces are used throughout this chapter to help illustrate concepts. These traces were gathered and formatted using Microsoft Network Monitor, a software-based protocol tracing and analysis tool included in the Microsoft Systems Management Server product. All the IP addresses in these traces have been replaced with the IP addresses for the fictitious company Terra Flora.</P>
<P CLASS="t"><B>Note</B></P>
<P>The base code described in this chapter is shared by all Microsoft 32-bit TCP/IP protocol stacks, including TCP/IP for Windows NT Server, Windows NT Workstation, and Windows 95. However, there are small differences in implementation, configuration methods, and available services. This chapter describes the implementation, configuration, and available services for Microsoft 32-bit TCP/IP for Windows NT. </P></BODY></HTML>
