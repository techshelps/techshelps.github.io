<H3 CLASS="h2"> Planning for WINS Server Performance</H3><P CLASS="t">A WINS server can typically service:</P>
<UL><LI>1,500 name registrations per minute. </LI><LI>4,500 queries per minute.</LI></UL><P CLASS="t">A conservative recommendation is that you plan to install one WINS server and a backup server for every 10,000 computers on the network, based on these numbers and the possibility for large-scale power outages that would cause many computers to re-start simultaneously.</P>
<P CLASS="t">Two factors enhance WINS server performance. WINS server performance can be increased almost 25 percent on a computer with two processors. WINS server name replication response time can be measurably improved by using a dedicated disk.</P>
<P CLASS="t">After you establish WINS servers on the intranet, you can adjust the time between a WINS client name registration and name renewal. This is referred to as the <I>Renewal Interval</I>. Setting this interval to reduce the numbers of registrations can help tune server response time. (The Renewal Interval is specified when configuring the WINS server.)</P></BODY></HTML>
