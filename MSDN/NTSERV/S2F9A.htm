<H1 CLASS="title">Chapter 5 - Enterprise Scenarios</H1><P CLASS="t">An enterprise network is a network for an organization that has several thousand employees and that operates at multiple sites. Typically, large networks have several different standards in use across the network. Interoperability and communication are constant challenges for the information staffs of enterprise networks.</P>
<P CLASS="t">The diagram inside the back cover of this book illustrates the enterprise network for Terra Flora, a fictitious international floral company.</P>
<P CLASS="t">The Terra Flora enterprise network was created in Microsoft laboratories to demonstrate Windows&nbsp;NT interoperability features for an enterprise network. <I>The Windows&nbsp;NT Server</I> <I>Resource Kit: Windows&nbsp;NT Server Networking Guide</I> contains chapters that show you how Windows&nbsp;NT Server solved the interoperability challenges posed by the Terra Flora enterprise network. </P>
<P CLASS="t">Chapters 4 and 5 in this book show you how to use Windows&nbsp;NT Server Internet Information Server (IIS) to meet business communication needs—from team communication to mission-critical applications. The chapters use scenarios that are presented as if an administrator were implementing a staged rollout of Internet Information Server to the company. See Chapter 4, "Desktop Scenarios," for a complete description of the Terra Flora company and its network.</P>
<P CLASS="t">The scenarios in this chapter use or simulate multiple servers. The scenarios covered are:</P>
<UL><LI>A single production server using virtual servers to host "multiple" web sites on a single computer. </LI><LI>Database access for a mission-critical application.</LI><LI>File Transfer Protocol (FTP) and Gopher servers for access to the same set of Human Resources information. </LI><LI>Multiple computers running Windows&nbsp;NT Server and Internet Information Server demonstrates a large-scale Internet implementation of IIS.</LI></UL><P></P></BODY></HTML>
