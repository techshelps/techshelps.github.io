<H2 CLASS="h1">Connection-oriented and Connectionless Data Transfer</H2><P CLASS="t">NBF supports both unreliable connectionless and reliable connection-oriented data transfer. Unreliable connectionless data transfer is also called <I>datagram</I>, or <I>Type&nbsp;1</I>, operation.</P>
<P CLASS="t">Unreliable connectionless communication is similar to sending a letter in the mail. No response is generated by the receiver of the letter to tell the sender that the letter made it to its destination. </P>
<P CLASS="t"><B>Note</B></P>
<P>Connectionless communications can be either <I>unreliable</I> or<I> reliable</I>. NBF provides only unreliable connectionless communications. Reliable connectionless communications is like a registered letter whose sender is notified that the letter arrived.</P>
<P CLASS="t">In unreliable connectionless communicaton, the transport protocol driver transmits the message once or a specified number of times, ensuring only that the message was properly transmitted to the network medium. The message can only be a single frame. Acknowledgment from the destination computer is not required.</P>
<P CLASS="t"><B>Note</B></P>
<P>If reliable connectionless communication is required, NBF can be configured for certain communication commands to send a number of frames that will allow time for the destination computer to respond to the message. The number is based on <I>retry</I> Registry value entries, such as <B>NameQueryRetries</B>. The time between sending each frame is determined by <I>timeout</I> Registry entries, such as <B>NameQueryTimeout</B>.</P>
<P CLASS="t">Reliable connection-oriented communication is also called <I>session</I>, or <I>Type&nbsp;2</I>, operation. Reliable connection-oriented communication provides reliable communications between two computers in a way that is analogous to a phone call where two callers connect, a conversation occurs, and then the connection is dropped when the conversation ends. A reliable connection requires more overhead than connectionless communications do. </P>
<P CLASS="t">In reliable connection – oriented communications, the transport protocol driver assumes responsibility for transferring the entire message from source to destination, and within an acceptable time period. Sequencing is provided; a message that is larger than the maximum transmit frame size can be broken down into multiple frames, sent across the network, and properly reassembled at the receiving computer.</P></BODY></HTML>
