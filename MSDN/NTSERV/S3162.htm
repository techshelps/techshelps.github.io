<H3 CLASS="h2">Windows&nbsp;NT Clients Authenticating to NetWare Servers</H3><P CLASS="t">On Terra Flora's network, there are existing installations of Novell NetWare, which are primarily used for file and print services. User accounts and privileges are stored in the NetWare <I>Bindery</I>, which is Novell's equivalent of the Windows&nbsp;NT directory. Access is validated based on user accounts and passwords in a Windows&nbsp;NT domain via the directory database, or on a Novell NetWare server via the bindery. </P>
<P CLASS="t">Novell uses the IPX/SPX protocol as their primary network protocol. In order for Windows&nbsp;NT Workstations or Windows&nbsp;NT Servers to communicate with the NetWare services, Microsoft developed NWLINK, an IPX/SPX-compatible protocol. NWLINK is the fundamental building block for the NetWare-compatible services on the Windows&nbsp;NT platform, and by itself, NWLINK does provide connectivity for database access to databases running as NetWare Loadable Modules on NetWare servers. So, for example, a Visual Basic application running on Windows&nbsp;NT Workstation can access an Oracle database running on a NetWare server, through ODBC and the NWLINK components.</P>
<H4 CLASS="h3"><A NAME="sec0"></A>Client Service for NetWare (CSNW)</H4><P CLASS="t">The Client Service for NetWare installed on a computer running Windows&nbsp;NT Workstation provides basic file and print connectivity for that client to a NetWare 3.<I>x</I> server, or a NetWare 4.<I>x</I> server which includes the functionality of CSNW on the server platform. A different service, Gateway Service for NetWare (GSNW), provides access for computers running Windows&nbsp;NT Server to NetWare Servers.</P>
<P CLASS="t"><B>To add CSNW</B></P>
<P>    1.    Click <B>Start</B>, point to <B>Settings</B>, and click <B>Control Panel</B>.</P>
<P>    2.    Double-click <B>Network</B>.</P>
<P>    3.    Click the <B>Services</B> tab.</P>
<P>    4.    Click <B>Add</B>.</P>
<P>    5.    Click Client Services for NetWare, and click OK.</P>
<P>    6.    Type the path to the CSNW files, and click <B>Continue</B>.</P>
<P>    7.    In the <B>Client Services for NetWare Dialog</B> box, type the name of the NetWare Server<B> </B>that will be used for authentication, click <B>OK</B>, and then click <B>Close</B>. </P>
<P CLASS="t">You must restart the computer to complete the installation. Click Yes and the computer will restart to complete the process.</P>
<P CLASS="t">Configuration of CSNW is necessary for the Windows&nbsp;NT Client to be able to connect to the NetWare server. A preferred server is selected when the CSNW service is added to the computer running Windows&nbsp;NT Workstation. In addition, as a result of adding CSNW, a CSNW icon is added to the Control Panel.  </P>
<P CLASS="t"><B>To activate and configure CSNW</B></P>
<P>    1.    Click <B>Start</B>, point to <B>Settings</B>,<B> </B>and<B> </B>click <B>Control Panel</B>.</P>
<P>    2.    Double-click <B>CSNW</B>. </P>
<P>    3.    In the <B>Current Preferred Server</B> dialog box, select a server, if necessary, and then click <B>OK</B>. </P>
<P><img src="XNG_F11.gif"></P>
<P>The Preferred Server setting performs the Attach command to the NetWare server and thus provides authentication to the NetWare server providing that the user and privileges have been added to the NetWare Bindery on the server that the user is trying to access. </P>
<H4 CLASS="h3"><A NAME="sec1"></A>Gateway Service for NetWare (GSNW)</H4><P CLASS="t">The Gateway Service for NetWare (GSNW) provides computers running Windows&nbsp;NT Server all support necessary to connect to NetWare servers, plus the additional capability to re-share the network connections from a NetWare server. The service allows the computers running Windows&nbsp;NT Server to access the NetWare servers as if they were just another client and, in addition, allows the network clients to access files on a NetWare server without having to have a NetWare client redirector on an IPX/SPX protocol stack loaded. </P>
<P CLASS="t">Gateway Service for NetWare depends on and works with two other NetWare compatibility features of Windows&nbsp;NT Server; the NWLink protocol, and NWLink NetBIOS. NWLink is an implementation of the internetworking packet exchange (IPX) and sequenced packet exchange (SPX) transport protocols used by the NetWare network. NWLink NetBIOS is a Microsoft-enhanced implementation of Novell NetBIOS, and transmits Novell NetBIOS packets between a NetWare server running Novell NetBIOS and a Windows&nbsp;NT computer, or between two Windows&nbsp;NT computers. The Microsoft implementations of the IPX, SPX, and Novell NetBIOS compatible protocols can seamlessly coexist with other protocols on the same network adapter card.</P>
<P CLASS="t">The computer running Windows&nbsp;NT Server establishes a network connection to the NetWare server, similar to any network client connection. </P>
<P CLASS="t">Gateway Service for NetWare is installed from the Windows&nbsp;NT Server CD-ROM. </P>
<P CLASS="t"><B>Note</B></P>
<P>Before you install the Gateway Service, you must remove any existing NetWare redirectors, such as NetWare Services for Windows&nbsp;NT from Novell, and then restart your computer.</P>
<P CLASS="t"><B>To remove existing NetWare redirector installations</B></P>
<P>    1.    Click <B>Start</B>, point to <B>Settings</B>,<B> </B>and<B> </B>click <B>Control Panel</B>.</P>
<P>    2.    Double-click <B>Network</B>.</P>
<P>    3.    Click the <B>Services</B> Tab.</P>
<P>    4.    Click the existing NetWare redirector software, and click <B>Remove</B>.</P>
<P>    5.    When prompted to confirm your choice, click <B>Yes</B>.</P>
<P CLASS="t">You must restart your computer to complete the removal process.</P>
<P CLASS="t">You are now ready to install the Gateway Service on a computer running Windows&nbsp;NT Server. You must be logged on as a member of the Administrators group for the local computer to install and configure the Gateway Service for your Windows&nbsp;NT computer. When you install the Gateway Service on a computer running Windows&nbsp;NT Server, the NWLink transport protocol is also installed if it is not already on your computer. </P>
<H5 CLASS="h4"><A NAME="sec2"></A>Activating a Gateway</H5><P CLASS="t">Before enabling a gateway on a computer running Windows&nbsp;NT Server:</P>
<UL><LI>A user account must be set up on the NetWare network with the necessary rights for the resources you want to access.</LI><LI>The NetWare server must have a group named NTGATEWAY with the necessary rights for the resources you want to access.</LI><LI>The NetWare user account you use must be a member of the NTGATEWAY group. </LI></UL><P CLASS="t">By controlling membership in the NTGATEWAY group, the administrator can control which Windows&nbsp;NT Server computers can be gateways to the NetWare server, and what kind of access to what files each user account has. </P>
<P CLASS="t">The administrator has total control over whether the gateway allows access to files and print queues on the NetWare server. With a gateway, the network administrator can control access to NetWare network resources either over the gateway or directly on the NetWare network: </P>
<UL><LI>On the Windows&nbsp;NT Server computer acting as a gateway, the administrator can restrict access by limiting which network users or groups have access to gateway shares. Using multiple share restrictions through a gateway, the Windows&nbsp;NT administrator can control which network users and groups can access files through the gateway. </LI><LI>Using NTGATEWAY special gateway group created on the NetWare file, the administrator can set trustee rights on the directories and files to which users and groups are allowed access through the gateway. There is no auditing of gateway access.</LI></UL><P CLASS="t"><B>To make a NetWare server available to a gateway account</B></P>
<P>    1.    Use the NetWare <B>syscon</B> utility to create the NTGATEWAY group account on the NetWare file server.</P>
<P>    2.    Use <B>syscon </B>to create a NetWare user account with the same name and password the user will use to log on from the Windows&nbsp;NT Server computer. </P>
<P>    3.    Add the gateway account to the NTGATEWAY group. </P>
<P>    4.    Establish trustee rights for the NTGATEWAY group. </P>
<P CLASS="t">For detailed information on the <B>syscon </B>utility and NetWare user accounts and trustee rights, see your NetWare documentation. </P>
<P CLASS="t">If you want to control user access, you can set permissions for the share when you create it, or later if your needs change. </P>
