<b><u>Moving Files</u></b></p>
<p>
Rather than copying files, it is often desirable to move them instead, especially if disk space is at a premium on your network. Robocopy's <b>/MOVE</b> switch provides this facility. It causes source files to be deleted from the source directory tree after they have been successfully copied to the destination.</p>
<p>
Note that even with <b>/MOVE</b> specified, Robocopy will only delete those source files that it successfully copies to the destination. This applies even to skipped <b><i>Same</i></b> files as there is no absolute guarantee that a skipped source file is identical to its corresponding destination file, even if the file times and sizes are identical, until immediately following a successful copy.</p>
<p>
Therefore it is perfectly normal for files and directories to remain in the source tree even after a Robocopy has walked the tree with <b>/MOVE</b> specified. The user must decide whether or not it is safe to delete the remaining entries, and, if so, delete them manually.</p>
<p>
<b><u>True Replication</u></b></p>
<p>
If you require the destination directory tree to be maintained as an <b><i>exact</i></b> mirror of the source directory tree, and have files and directories deleted from the destination whenever they disappear from the source, you can use the <b>/PURGE</b> switch <b><i>(at your own risk)</i></b>. </p>
<p>
<b>/PURGE</b> causes Robocopy to delete <b>ALL</b> <b><i>Extra</i></b> and <b><i>Mismatched</i></b> destination files and directories. After a <b><i>Mismatched</i></b> destination entry has been deleted, the corresponding source entry is then treated as a <b><i>Lonely</i></b> file or directory, and processed accordingly.</p>
<p>
Where /<b>PURGE</b> results in the deletion of an <b><i>Extra</i></b> or <b><i>Mismatched</i></b>  destination directory, <b>the entire directory tree, including all subordinate files and subdirectories, will be deleted.</b></p>
<p>
<b><i>You should use /PURGE with extreme caution. </i></b>If you specify <b>/PURGE</b> along with an incorrect (but existing) destination directory, Robocopy <b><i>WILL</i></b> <b><i>DELETE</i></b> lots of data from the destination very quickly.  <b><i><u>You use the /PURGE option at your own risk.</u></i></b></p>
<p>
Note that the <b>/XX</b> switch excludes <b><i>Extra</i></b> files from further processing, so <b>/PURGE</b> will have no effect if <b>/XX</b> is also used.</p>
