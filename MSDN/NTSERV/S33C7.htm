<H2 CLASS="h1">Backup Utilities</H2><H3 CLASS="h3"><A NAME="sec0"></A>AT: Enables You to Schedule Windows&nbsp;NT Backup </H3><P CLASS="t">The Windows&nbsp;NT Backup utility, Ntbackup, does not include functionality for scheduling unattended backups. However, by using the Schedule service with the command line capabilities of the Ntbackup utility, you can set up unattended backups.</P>
<P CLASS="t">The following procedure shows how to use the Schedule service and the Ntbackup utility to schedule an unattended backup of the entire C drive of a computer with an installed tape device. With minor modifications, these steps could also allow for scheduling unattended backups from a computer on a network to a computer with an installed tape device or other configurations.</P>
<H4 CLASS="h4"><A NAME="sec1"></A>To schedule unattended backup</H4><P>    1.    Start the Schedule service on the computer with the tape device already installed. This can be done by using the Services option in Control Panel, clicking <B>Schedule</B>, and clicking <B>Start</B>. Alternatively, you can configure the Schedule service to start every time Windows&nbsp;NT starts by clicking <B>Startup</B> and setting the <B>Startup Type</B> to <B>Automatic</B>. </P>
<P>    2.    Using any text editor, such as Notepad, create a command file, such as, Mybackup.cmd to perform the commands to backup the files.</P>
<P>This example</P>
<P CLASS="spacing"><BR></P>
ntbackup backup c: /D "My Backup Files" /B /L "c:\backup.log"
<P>does the following:</P>
<UL><LI>Backs up all files on the C drive.</LI><LI>Replaces any files currently on the tape.</LI><LI>Labels the backup set "My Backup Files." </LI><LI>Backs up the local registry.</LI><LI>Logs all backup information to C:\Backup.log.</LI></UL><P>    3.    Using the AT command, schedule the command file (Mybackup.cmd) to run when desired. The following AT command schedules Mybackup.cmd to execute at 11:00 P.M. every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday:</P>
<P CLASS="spacing"><BR></P>
AT 23:00 /every:M,W,F MYBACKUP.CMD
<P CLASS="t">When there is no tape in the drive and you use the AT command without the interactive switch to run Windows&nbsp;NT Backup, the backup encounters an error or is unable to accept the command line. As a result, Windows&nbsp;NT Backup stops responding. You cannot run Windows&nbsp;NT Backup again until you restart Windows&nbsp;NT.</P>
<P CLASS="t">Use the /INTERACTIVE switch with the AT command to open the interactive desktop. This way, if any errors occur, you will be able to correct them and continue, or quit Windows&nbsp;NT Backup.</P>
<P CLASS="t">For information about AT options, type AT /? at a command prompt or search the online Command Reference for AT. For additional information on available Ntbackup options, use the Help menu when running Ntbackup.exe. </P></BODY></HTML>
