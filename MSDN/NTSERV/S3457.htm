<H1 CLASS="title">Chapter 2 - Printing</H1><P CLASS="t">By using Windows&nbsp;NT Server as your network print server, you have a seamless way to print, no matter what operating systems your networked computers use. If your workstation computers are running Windows&nbsp;NT 4.0, network printing is as easy as "point and print." For Windows&nbsp;NT and Windows 95 workstation computers, you don't need to install a printer driver manually on the workstation computer before printing with Windows&nbsp;NT. Print resources seem to be provided automatically from each application.</P>
<P CLASS="nt"><B>Note</B>  Although you can certainly print locally from a Windows&nbsp;NT Server print server, this chapter concerns itself primarily with remote printing and regards the Windows&nbsp;NT Server as a dedicated print server. For information about printing locally from a print server, see the <I>Windows&nbsp;NT 4.0 Workstation Online Resource Guide</I>. </P>
<P CLASS="t">This chapter begins with a glossary of terms used throughout the rest of the chapter. The glossary is followed by an overview of the Windows&nbsp;NT printing process and the flow of control. After you have a clear picture of the printing process and are comfortable with the terms, you can move on to read in-depth descriptions of each component of the printing architecture based on the network protocols and operating systems of your networked computers. The chapter concludes with sections on print security, troubleshooting, and some common questions and answers.</P>
