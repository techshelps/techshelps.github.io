<H3 CLASS="h2">Internet Information Server Configuration to Create Virtual Servers</H3><P CLASS="t">You use Internet Service Manager to create virtual servers. You will not see virtual server names in the main Internet Service Manager window. Virtual servers are created on the <B>Directories</B> tab of the <B>WWW Service Properties</B> dialog box, as shown in Figure 5.7.</P>

<P>Figure 5.7    Virtual server directories listed</P>
<P CLASS="t">To create a virtual server, click <B>Add</B> and, in the <B>Directory Properties</B> dialog box, specify a directory for each IP address configured on your server. (See Figure 5.8.) A virtual server is not "created" until a directory is created that uses the IP address of that virtual server.</P>

<P>Figure 5.8    Specifying the IP address for a virtual server directory</P>
<P CLASS="t">If a single IP address is used on a computer running Internet Information Server, all directories created apply to that IP address. If two or more IP addresses are added to a computer running Internet Information Server, you must then select the <B>Virtual Server</B> check box and type an IP address in the <B>Virtual Server IP Address</B> box for each IIS directory you create. If you fail to select the <B>Virtual Server</B> check box and to specify an IP address, that directory will be available through all IP addresses assigned to the computer.</P>
<P CLASS="t">The default home directory (wwwroot) and the /Scripts directory created during installation are not assigned to a specific IP address. Because no IP address is assigned to the directories, the default home directory becomes the default home directory for all TCP/IP addresses assigned to that server.</P>
<P CLASS="t">The /Scripts directory is a good example of a case that calls for using a common directory between virtual servers by not specifying an IP address. You can locate the scripts for all virtual servers on the computer in the same common directory. For example, <B>http://retail/scripts/order.dll</B> and <B>http://supply/scripts/update.exe</B> both use files in the same physical directory. </P></BODY></HTML>
