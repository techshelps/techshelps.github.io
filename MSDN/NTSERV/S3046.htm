An online version of the new, comprehensive <I>Windows NT Workstation Resource Guide</I> is also available on the CD. Update books for the <I>Windows NT Server Resource Kit</I> will be released on a semi-annual basis. They will contain new information and major revisions of existing topics. </P>

Update books will contain more extensive Internet-related information. Some of the scenarios provided here use a fictitious company, Terra Flora, as an example to demonstrate challenges and solutions. The Terra Flora network is based on a real network that has been created at Microsoft in the Windows NT Server Resource Kit Interoperability Lab. The networking model that Terra Flora will implement is shown in the network diagram on the inside back cover of this book.</P>
