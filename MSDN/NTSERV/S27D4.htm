<P CLASS="t">The anonymous and non-anonymous user counters display the number of anonymous and non-anonymous connections to the IIS service when the values were last observed. They do not report averages or rates. These counters might exaggerate the number of connections because closed connections might not yet be deleted when the counter is displayed.</P>
<P CLASS="t">The Current Anonymous Users and Current Non-anonymous Users counters operate based on the following definitions:</P>
<P>     The <I>anonymous</I> <I>user</I> counters display the number of connections whose requests either did not contain a user name and password or whose user name and password were ignored because authentication is not permitted on the server. If anonymous connections are not permitted on the server, the value of all <I>anonymous user</I> counters is always zero.</P>
<P>     The <I>non-anonymous user</I> counters display the number of connections whose requests contained a valid user name and password, or whatever authentication is required by a custom authentication scheme. If authentication is not enabled on the server, and none of the applications that run on the server request or require authentication, then the value of all <I>non-anonymous user</I> counters is always zero.</P>
<P></P>
<P CLASS="t">The <I>anonymous user</I> and <I>non-anonymous user</I> counters count successful connections only. If a client request for an anonymous connection is rejected and the client responds with valid authenticating data, the connection is counted as non-anonymous.</P></BODY></HTML>
