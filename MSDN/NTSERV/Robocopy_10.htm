<b><u>THE OUTPUT LOG</u></b></p>
<p>
Robocopy outputs a log of files and directories processed to its console window. This output can be redirected to a disk file if required.</p>
<p>
Each log line starts with a brief text tag, which is formatted according to the following rules :</p>
<p>
<b>*CAPITALS</b>indicate an anomaly that should be investigated.</p>
<p>
    <b>Leading Caps</b>indicate a file that was selected for copying.</p>
<p>
         <b>lowercase</b>indicates a file that was skipped.</p>
<p>
(lowercase tags will only be seen if <b>/V</b> is used).</p>
<p>
Tags that indicate copying are left-aligned, tags that indicate skipping are right-aligned, tags that indicate anomalies are placed further to the left than other tags, and error messages always start in column 1. This arrangement simplifies the task of scanning through even a verbose listing, and makes it easier to spot new downloads, anomalies, and network errors. </p>
<p>
If few files are copied, the left margin of the output log will be mostly blank. Copied files and anomalies are easily-spotted non-blank entries in the left margin of the output log. </p>
<p>
Disregarding error reporting and retries, at most one line of output is produced per source file or directory. Lines for directories show the number of files matching the <b><i>Include Filespecs</i></b> in the directory (where known), and the full pathname of the directory. Lines for files indicate what was done with the file, the size of the file, and its name.</p>
<p>
One line is also output for each <b><i>Mismatched</i></b> file and directory, and also for each <b><i>Extra</i></b> file and directory in the destination. These resemble lines for normal directories and file, except that lines for <b><i>Extra</i></b> files include the file's full pathname, as an aid to rapid housekeeping. </p>
<p>
By default, only <b><i>Extra</i></b> files that match the <b><i>Include</i></b> <b><i>Filespecs</i></b> on the command line will be reported. The rationale for this is that you are probably not interested in spurious <b><code>*.TXT</code></b> files in the destination when you are refreshing <b><code>*.CPP</code></b> files. However, if you really do need a list of <b>all</b> extra files in the destination, irrespective of their type, you can obtain one by using <b>/X</b>. </p>
<p>
By default, no output is produced for skipped files. To obtain a verbose listing which shows <b>all</b> source files matching the <b><i>Include Filespecs</i></b>, including skipped files, use the <b>/V</b> switch.</p>
<p>
By default, Robocopy will output copy progress information, in the form of a display of the percentage of the file copied so far (% copied). You can use the <b>/NP</b> switch to suppress the display of %copied  progress information - useful when output is redirected to a disk file. </p>
<p>
To see the start time of each file copy, and the estimated time that the copy should complete (based on the observed throughput of previous copies), use the <b>/ETA</b> switch. These times are displayed after the file name in the format "hh:mm -&gt; hh:mm" (start time -&gt; ETA).</p>
<p>
Finally, to obtain a list the files that <b><i>would</i></b> be copied, without committing to the overhead of actually doing the copying, you can use the <b>/L</b> switch.</p>
