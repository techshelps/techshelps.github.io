<H3 CLASS="h2">Using MailSrv with Microsoft Exchange </H3><P CLASS="t">Microsoft Exchange Server integrates mail, group scheduling, electronic forms, and groupware applications on a single platform. It can also extend those capabilities to encompass Internet and X.400 systems, to provide access to the most widely used messaging standards.</P>
<P CLASS="t">Microsoft Exchange Server version 4.0 supports messaging between intranet and Internet locations and between different electronic mail systems, including SMTP/POP3 services such as <B>MailSrv</B>. <B>MailSrv</B> running with Windows&nbsp;NT Server can function as a dedicated SMTP host for Microsoft Exchange Server by using the Microsoft Exchange–based Internet Mail Connector (IMC). The IMC service converts messages from Microsoft Exchange format to the format required by the SMTP messaging system and vice versa.</P>
<P CLASS="t">Microsoft Exchange Server is not included with the Windows&nbsp;NT product. For information about installing and configuring Microsoft Exchange Server and client software with the Internet Mail Connector option, see the Microsoft Exchange Server product documentation.</P></BODY></HTML>
