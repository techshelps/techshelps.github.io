<H3 CLASS="h2">Configuring WINS Server and WINS Client Behavior </H3><P CLASS="t">Use WINS Manager to configure WINS server management of WINS client mappings by using the configuration options in the <B>WINS Server Configuration - (Local) </B>dialog box. The configuration options allow you to specify time intervals that govern WINS client behavior as described in the following table.</P>

Maximum allowable value is six days.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP"><P>Extinction Timeout</P></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP"><P>Specifies the interval between when an entry is marked <I>extinct</I> and when the entry is finally scavenged from the database.

The default is six days.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP"><P>Verify Interval</P></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP"><P>Specifies the interval after which the WINS server must verify that old names it does not own are still active.

<P CLASS="spacing"><BR></P><P CLASS="t">The extinction interval, extinction timeout, and verify interval are derived from the renewal interval and the partner replication interval. The WINS server adjusts the values specified by the administrator to keep the inconsistency between a WINS server and its partners as small as possible.</P>
<P CLASS="t">You can run the Registry Editor program at the command prompt to configure a WINS server by changing the values of the Registry parameters listed in the following table.</P>

If this option is not checked, an administrator can ask a WINS server to pull or push from or to a non-listed WINS server partner. By default, this option is checked.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP"><P>Backup On <BR>Termination</P></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP"><P>Specifies that the database is backed up automatically when WINS Manager is stopped, except when the computer is stopped.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP"><P>Migrate On/Off</P></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP"><P>Specifies that static unique and multihomed records in the database are treated as dynamic when they conflict with a new registration or replica. This means that if they are no longer valid, they are overwritten by the new registration or replica. Check this option if you are upgrading non-Windows&nbsp;NT-based computers to Windows&nbsp;NT. By default, this option is not checked.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP"><P>Starting Version <BR>Count</P></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP"><P>Specifies the highest version ID number for the database. Usually, you do not need to change this value unless the database becomes corrupted and needs to start fresh. In such a case, set this value to a number higher than appears as the version number counter for this WINS server on all the remote partners that earlier replicated the local WINS server's records. WINS may adjust the value you specify to a higher one to ensure that database records are quickly replicated to other WINS servers. The maximum allowable value is 231 - 1. This value can be seen in the <B>View</B> <B>Database</B> dialog box in WINS Manager.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP"><P>Database Backup <BR>Path</P></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP"><P>Specifies the directory where the WINS database backup is stored. If you specify a backup path, WINS automatically performs a full backup of its database to this directory every 24 hours. WINS uses this directory to perform an automatic restoration of the database in the event that the database is found to be corrupted when WINS is started. Do not specify a network directory.</P></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>
