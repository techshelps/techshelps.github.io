<H3 CLASS="h2">File Index Tables</H3><P CLASS="t">File index tables (or FIT files) are ASCII files containing filename lookup tables that enable file translation. Remoteboot client software translates a directory name or filename typed by the client user into the true directory name or filename on the server. In general, the client translates references of the form C:\... to \\<I>servername</I>\Rplfiles\... (that is, to locations in the <I>&lt;systemroot&gt;</I>\Rpl\Rplfiles directory on the server).</P>
<P CLASS="t">Windows&nbsp;95 clients use a .fit file only in the early stages of their boot process. Once the client is running Windows&nbsp;95, it uses storage defined by the SBS server and machine directory server.</P>
<P CLASS="t">File translation pairs consist of a prototype filename or prefix, followed by a space, and an actual filename or prefix, relative to the directory named on the first line [usually (Rplfiles)]. If the prototype matches a proper prefix of the name to be matched, the matched portion is replaced by the actual prefix. If there is an exact match (not just a prefix), the actual filename is substituted. If several prefixes match, the longest one is selected for substitution. A network path of the form \\<I>any_servername</I>\<I>sharename</I> may be included in the actual filename or prefix, in which case it overrides the directory listed on line one.</P>
<P CLASS="t">Examples:</P>
<UL><LI>If the client requests access to C:\Win386.swp (for example, to open it for writing), the client software will use the .fit file to translate it into:
<P CLASS="spacing"><BR></P>
\\<I>servername</I>\RPLFILES\TMPFILES\(CNAME)\SWAPFILE.DAT</LI></UL><P>where (CNAME) is the client name.</P>
<UL><LI>If C:\Config.sys is requested, the following will be used because it has the longest matching prefix (C:\):
<P CLASS="spacing"><BR></P>
\\<I>servername</I>\RPLFILES\PROFILES\(PROFILE)\CONFIG.SYS</LI></UL><P>where (PROFILE) is the profile name. The line near the top of each .fit file that starts with C:\ sends all C:\ references that aren't at least partially matched by other lines to the directory \\<I>servername</I>\Rplfiles\Profiles\(Profile).</P>
<P CLASS="t">Note that the "machine writeable files" section of each .fit file lists the files and directories to which the user has write access.</P>
<P CLASS="t">By convention there are usually two .fit files for each profile: one to be used when sharing the profile and one to be used with personal copies of the profile. For example, Dos622.fit is for clients that share the Dos622 profile, and Dos622p.fit is for personal copies of the Dos622 profile. The file format is the same, but the personal profile .fit translates most references to directories specific to the client rather than to directories shared with other clients. The .fit file used for Windows&nbsp;95 clients has no differences between the shared and personal versions.</P>
<P CLASS="t">Fields in .fit files are separated with white space. The maximum line length is 512 characters. A comment line has a semicolon (;) as the first non-space character.</P>
<P CLASS="t">The following keywords have special meaning in a .fit file:</P>
<UL><LI><B> (PROFILE)</B> is the name of the profile assigned to this client.</LI><LI><B> (CNAME)</B> is the name of the client.</LI><LI><B> (RPLFILES)</B> is the <I>&lt;systemroot&gt;</I>\Rpl\Rplfiles directory, shared by the server with the sharename Rplfiiles.</LI><LI><B> (BINFILES)</B> is a directory for executable files. It is assumed to be relative to Rplfiles (\systemroot\Rpl\Rplfiles\Binfiles).</LI><LI><B> (TMPFILES)</B> is a directory for temporary and swap files. It is assumed to be relative to Rplfiles (<I>&lt;systemroot&gt;</I>\Rpl\Rplfiles\Tmpfiles).</LI></UL></BODY></HTML>
