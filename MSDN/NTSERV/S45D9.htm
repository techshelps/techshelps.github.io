<H3 CLASS="h2">Multitasking and Multiprocessing</H3><P CLASS="t">Multitasking and multiprocessing are closely related terms that are easily confused. <I>Multitasking</I> is an operating-system technique for sharing a single processor among multiple threads of execution. <I>Multiprocessing</I> refers to computers with more than one processor. A multiprocessing computer can execute multiple threads simultaneously, one thread for each processor in the computer. A multitasking operating system only appears to execute multiple threads at the same time; a multiprocessing operating system actually does so.</P>
<P CLASS="t">Multiprocessing operating systems can be either asymmetric or symmetric. The main difference is in how the processors operate. In asymmetric multiprocessing (ASMP), the operating system typically sets aside one or more processors for its exclusive use. The remainder of the processors run user applications. In symmetric multiprocessing (SMP), any processor can run any type of thread. The processors communicate with each other through shared memory. The Windows&nbsp;NT operating system is an SMP system.</P>
<P CLASS="t">SMP systems provide better load-balancing and fault tolerance. Because the operating system threads can run on any processor, the chance of hitting a CPU bottleneck is greatly reduced. A processor failure in the SMP model will only reduce the computing capacity of the system. In the ASMP model, if the processor that fails is an operating system processor, the whole computer can go down.</P>
<P CLASS="t">SMP systems are inherently more complex than ASMP systems. A tremendous amount of coordination must take place within the operating system to keep everything synchronized. For this reason, SMP systems are usually designed and written from the ground up. </P></BODY></HTML>
