<H2 CLASS="h1">Understanding ARC Pathnames</H2><P CLASS="t">Advanced RISC Computing (ARC) naming conventions are a standard for identifying the location of a file or a program on a device such as a hard disk or a floppy disk. You must understand the ARC pathname conventions to be able to create paths to use to start the computer from the Windows&nbsp;NT startup floppy disk.</P>
<P CLASS="t">On x86-based computers, you use ARC pathnames to describe the location of the boot partition for each instance of Windows&nbsp;NT installed on the computer. If you configure your boot partition as a mirror set, you need to include a path to the shadow boot partition in the Boot.ini file. Creating the path is described in "Creating Alternate Boot Selections for an x86-based Computer," presented later in this chapter.</P>
<P CLASS="t">On x86-based computers, the ARC path to the boot partition has one of the following forms:</P>
<UL><LI>multi(W)disk(X)rdisk(Y)partition(Z)\%<I>systemroot</I>% </LI><LI>scsi(W)disk(X)rdisk(Y)partition(Z)\%<I>systemroot</I>%</LI></UL><P CLASS="t">On RISC-based computers, you use ARC pathnames in the NVRAM to describe the location of:</P>
<UL><LI>The folder containing Osloader.exe and Hal.dll.</LI><LI>The full path to Osloader.exe. </LI><LI>The path to the boot partition.</LI><LI>Devices detected by the firmware, such as disks, keyboard, and video.</LI></UL><P CLASS="t">When you create a Windows&nbsp;NT startup floppy disk to use on a RISC-based computer, you need to modify the NVRAM to include the ARC path to the floppy disk. If you configure your boot partition as a mirror set, you also need to include an ARC path to the shadow boot partition in your NVRAM. Creating boot selections for both the Windows&nbsp;NT startup floppy disk and the shadow boot partition is described in the section titled "Creating Alternate Boot Selections for a RISC-based Computer," presented later in this chapter.</P>
<P CLASS="t">On a RISC-based computer, only the scsi() syntax is used for hard disks. The boot selection has the following parts:</P>
<UL><LI>LOADIDENTIFIER is the name that appears on the <B>Boot</B> menu for this boot selection.</LI><LI>SYSTEMPARTITION is the FAT partition that contains Osloader.exe and Hal.dll. </LI><LI>OSLOADER is the path to the OSLOADER file itself.</LI><LI>OSLOADPARTITION is the boot partition that contains the Windows NT system files.</LI><LI>OSLOADFILENAME is the name of the Windows NT folder in the boot partition, with no drive letter.</LI><LI>OSLOADOPTIONS indicates any debugging options that should be set up when loading Windows&nbsp;NT.</LI></UL><P CLASS="t">This is an example of a boot selection for a RISC-based computer:</P>
<UL><LI>LOADIDENTIFIER=Windows&nbsp;NT Server 4.0</LI><LI>SYSTEMPARTITION=scsi(0)disk(0)rdisk(0)partition(1)</LI><LI>OSLOADER=scsi(0)disk(0)rdisk(0)partition(1)\Os\Nt40\Osloader.exe</LI><LI>OSLOADPARTITION=scsi(0)disk(0)rdisk(0)partition(2)</LI><LI>OSLOADFILENAME=\Winnt</LI><LI>OSLOADOPTIONS=nodebug</LI></UL></BODY></HTML>
