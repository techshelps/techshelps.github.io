<H3>Deciding Which NetWare Servers to Add to the Domain</H3><P CLASS="t">CANW312DPT01 is a NetWare server that houses front-end applications to the Oracle databases running on the DEC UNIX server in the Nursery division. The Nursery division users require access to the business applications housed on the DEC UNIX server through the NetWare servers. The users also need access to the Enterprise services on the Windows NT servers. For this reason, Terra Flora will add CANW312DPT01 to the Windows NT California domain.</P>
<P CLASS="t">The NetWare server CANW410DIV01 runs NetWare 4.10. This server is set up exclusively to pilot the Network Directory Services (NDS) product in the NetWare operating system. DSMN does not function on NetWare 4.10 servers unless they are operating bindery emulation. Because this NetWare server is using NDS and not bindery emulation, this server will not be added to the Windows NT California domain. </P>
<P CLASS="t">Terra Flora wants to add all of its NetWare servers running version 3.<I>x </I>and 2.<I>x</I> to the Windows NT California domain. A NetWare server in the California domain that runs version 3.12 is not represented on the network diagram. CANW312DPT02 is a department-level server that runs customized business applications for the sales department. </P>
<P CLASS="t">After adding the DSMN software, the administrators will use DSMN to select CANW312DPT01 and CANW312DPT02 as the two NetWare servers to be added to the Windows NT California domain. After they are added, the NetWare servers will be administered in the same way as any other server in the domain. </P></BODY></HTML>
