<H1 CLASS="title">Chapter 12 - Troubleshooting Tools and Strategies</H1><P CLASS="t">Many excellent network troubleshooting tools are available for Windows&nbsp;NT Server and Windows NT Workstation. Most are included with the product or in the Windows&nbsp;NT Server and Windows NT Workstation Resource Kits. Microsoft Network Monitor is an excellent network tracing tool that is included in the Microsoft Systems Management Server product.</P>
<P CLASS="t">When troubleshooting any problem, it is helpful to use a logical approach. Some questions to ask are:</P>
<UL><LI>What does work?</LI><LI>What doesn't work?</LI><LI>How are the things that do and don't work related?</LI><LI>Have the things that don't work ever worked on this computer and network?</LI><LI>If so, what has changed since they last worked?</LI></UL><P CLASS="t">Troubleshooting a problem "from the bottom up" is often a good way to quickly isolate it. The troubleshooting tasks discussed in this chapter are organized using this "bottom up" approach.</P>
<P CLASS="t">The first section of this chapter gives an overview of TCP/IP troubleshooting tools. The next section discusses various TCP/IP troubleshooting tasks, followed by a section on using Performance Monitor and Network Monitor to analyze network behavior. The final section of this chapter provides information about common TCP/IP networking problems.</P></BODY></HTML>
