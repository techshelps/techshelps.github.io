<H2 CLASS="h1">Starting Network Client and Logging On</H2><P CLASS="t">During Setup, you specify whether you want Network Client to start automatically every time the computer is started. You also specify whether a prompt appears to log on to the workgroup and/or to a domain at startup time. The default settings are to automatically start Network Client and prompt for logon each time the computer is started.</P>
<P CLASS="t">If you specify in Setup that Network Client should not start automatically, the user must start it.</P>
<P CLASS="t"><B>To start Network Client and log on to the workgroup</B></P>
<P>    1.    At the MS-DOS command prompt, type <B>net logon</B> and press Enter.</P>
<P>    2.    If Network Client hasn't started, a prompt asks whether to start the workstation service. Type <B>y</B> and then press Enter.</P>
<P>    3.    If the prompt displaying the user name is correct, press Enter.</P>
<P>If you are logging on at someone else's computer, type your user name, and then press Enter.</P>
<P>    4.    At the prompt for a password, type your password, and then press Enter.</P>
<P>If you are logging on for the first time, you can specify any password up to 14 characters long. A prompt asks you to type your password again to confirm that it is correct. This is your workgroup password.</P>
<P>    5.    If you are logging on for the first time, and the computer is in a Windows&nbsp;NT Server domain, a prompt for the domain password appears. Type your domain password and press Enter.</P>
<P CLASS="t">After you type your password(s), Network Client reestablishes your  <I>persistent connections</I>, if you have any. These are connections that you made before and specified that you want to have reestablished every time you log on to your workgroup. For more information, see the Help for <B>net use</B>. </P>
<P CLASS="t">Your workgroup password authorizes access to your password list file, which is a list of the passwords for connections made that are password-protected. If you do maintain a password list file, and you do log on to a domain, the password list file will also hold your domain password. For more information about the password list file and how to change your password, see the Help for <B>net password</B>.</P>
<P CLASS="t">If you have trouble starting or using Network Client, see the "Troubleshooting" section later in this chapter.</P></BODY></HTML>
