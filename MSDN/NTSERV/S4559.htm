<H3 CLASS="h2">Information Distribution</H3><P CLASS="t">This section shows how to handle typical content on a division server and presents useful strategies for your business.</P>
<P CLASS="t">The division servers provide all employees access to process documents (how-to documents), current project plans, employee home pages, and links to related pages on other division servers, as shown in Figure 5.13. </P>

<P CLASS="t">Only employees in the division have access to that division's project templates, plans in development, and budgets. The Retail Division home page (Figure 5.14) shows what the employees in that division have access to.</P>

<P CLASS="t">Retail employees collaborate on files in the \Division\Plans directory to create final project plans. When the plans are complete and approved, the webmaster copies the plan files to the root directory and creates links on the appropriate Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) pages so that all Terra Flora employees can read the plans. </P>
<P CLASS="t">Parallel directory structures enable you to copy entire directory structures to other servers without changing hard-coded relative links within the files. Parallel directory structures also simplify navigation, as shown in Figure 5.15.</P>
