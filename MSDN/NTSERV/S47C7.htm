<H3 CLASS="h2">Microsoft WINS Servers</H3><P CLASS="t">WINS servers are designed to prevent the administrative difficulties that are inherent in the use of both IP broadcasts and static mapping files such as LMHOSTS files. Microsoft WINS is designed to eliminate the need for IP broadcasts (which use valuable network bandwidth and cannot be used in routed networks), while providing a dynamic, distributed database that maintains computer name-to-IP-address mappings. </P>
<P CLASS="t">WINS servers use a replicated database that contains NetBIOS computer names and IP address mappings (database records). When Windows-based computers log on to the network, their computer name and IP addressing mapping are added (registered) to the WINS server database, providing support for dynamic updates. The WINS server database is replicated among multiple WINS servers in a LAN or WAN. One of the benefits of this database design is that it prevents different users from registering duplicate NetBIOS computer names on the network. </P>
<P CLASS="t">WINS servers provide the following benefits:</P>
<UL><LI>Dynamic database that supports NetBIOS computer name registration and name resolution in an environment where the dynamic TCP/IP configuration of DHCP-enabled clients is dynamically configured for TCP/IP.</LI><LI>Centralized management of the NetBIOS computer name database and its replication to other WINS servers.</LI><LI>Reduction of NetBIOS name query IP broadcast traffic. </LI><LI>Support for Windows-based clients (including Windows&nbsp;NT Server, Windows&nbsp;NT Workstation, Windows 95, Windows for Workgroups, and LAN Manager 2.<I>x</I>). </LI><LI>Support for transparent browsing across routers for Windows&nbsp;NT Server, Windows&nbsp;NT Workstation, Windows 95, and Windows for Workgroups clients. </LI></UL><P CLASS="t">The following figure illustrates an intranet with multiple WINS servers in a routed network. The components of a WINS system are shown in the illustration and are discussed in the following sections:</P>
<UL><LI>Microsoft WINS server push and pull partners</LI><LI>WINS clients, referred to as WINS-enabled computers</LI><LI>WINS proxy and non-WINS enabled computers</LI></UL><P><img src="XNG_M01.gif"></P>
