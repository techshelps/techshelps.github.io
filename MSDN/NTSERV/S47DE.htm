<P> <FONT FACE="symbol">·</FONT>    Check the WINS database for the name. If the name is not present in the database, check whether the destination or target computer uses b-node name resolution. If so, add a static mapping for it in the WINS database.</P>
<P>If the computer is configured as p-node, m-node, or h-node, and if its IP address is different from the one in the WINS database, then it may be that its address changed recently and the new address has not yet replicated to the local WINS server. To get the latest records, ask the WINS server that registered the address to perform a push replication with propagation to the local WINS server.</P>

<P>    1.    Use the <B>ping</B> utility to verify that each WINS server is running and can be connected to.</P>
<P>    2.    Ensure that each server is correctly configured as both a pull and push partner.</P>
