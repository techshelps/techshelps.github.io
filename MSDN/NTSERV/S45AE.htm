<H3 CLASS="h2">Auditing System Activity</H3><P CLASS="t">You can use auditing to track selected activities of users and the system. Windows&nbsp;NT can record a range of event types—from a systemwide event, such as a user logging on, to an attempt by a particular user to read a specific file on an NTFS drive. Both successful and unsuccessful attempts to perform an action can be recorded.</P>
<P CLASS="t">To open the <B>Audit Policy</B> dialog box, click <B>Audit</B> on the <B>Policies</B> menu in User Manager for Domains. The audit policy determines the amount and type of security logging that Windows&nbsp;NT performs. When an audited event occurs, an entry is added to the Windows&nbsp;NT security log. The security log is viewed by using Event Viewer. Use the settings shown in Table 3.3 to specify what events will be audited.</P>

<P CLASS="t">Before auditing can be established on objects, auditing for the events shown in Table 3.3 must be enabled through User Manager for Domains by a user with Administrator permissions. When auditing files, you must also use Windows&nbsp;NT Explorer to specify which files to audit and which type of file access events to audit. To do this, right-click a file or directory to display its properties, then click <B>Security</B> and click <B>Auditing</B> to specify auditing attributes.</P>
<P CLASS="t">You view audited events in Event Viewer. Internet Information Server generates entries in all three Event Viewer logs (System, Security, and Application). You can use Event Viewer entries to identify attempts to break into your intranet through your gateway or to detect attempted tampering with your Internet Information Server system.</P>
