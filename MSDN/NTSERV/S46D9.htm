<H3 CLASS="h2">Using Shared Printers</H3><P CLASS="t">You can print files with Network Client by sending them from your computer to printers that are shared by members of your workgroup. Connecting to a shared printer allows you to use it as if it were physically connected to your computer. You connect your computer to a shared printer by assigning a parallel port (LPT) to it. You can use port LPT1, LPT2, or LPT3.</P>
<P CLASS="t"><B>To connect your computer to a shared printer</B></P>
<P>    1.    Display the pop-up interface, as described earlier in this chapter.</P>
<P>    2.    Choose the <B>Show Printers</B> button by pressing ALT+S.</P>
<P>    3.    In the Port field of the <B>Printer Connection</B> dialog box, type two backslashes and the number of the parallel port (LPT) that you want to assign to the shared printer, and then press TAB.</P>
<P>    4.    In the Path field, type the name of the computer and shared printer that you want to connect to. For example, to connect to a printer named Laser that is physically connected to a computer named Clive, type <B>\\clive\laser</B> in the Path field.</P>
<P>    5.    If you want to connect your computer to this printer every time you log on to your workgroup, make sure an X appears in the <B>Reconnect At Startup</B> check box.</P>
<P>To select or clear the <B>Reconnect At Startup</B> check box, press ALT+R.</P>
<P>    6.    To connect to the shared printer specified in the Path field, choose the <B>Connect</B> button by pressing ALT+C.</P>
<P CLASS="t">You can also issue the <B>net use </B>command at the MS-DOS command prompt to connect to a shared printer. For information on the <B>net use </B>command and its syntax, see the Help for <B>net use</B>.</P>
<P CLASS="t">For information about browsing for shared printers and disconnecting from a shared printer, press F1 in the pop-up interface, or see the Help for the <B>net view</B> and <B>net use</B> commands.</P>
<P CLASS="t"><B>Note</B></P>
<P>Your workgroup may include computers that share printers but do not appear in the <B>Browse</B> dialog box. You can try connecting to these computers, even though you cannot browse for their names.</P>
<P CLASS="t">After you connect your computer to a shared printer, you can print formatted files from the application you used to create them. You can also print unformatted text files from MS-DOS with the <B>print</B> command. For more information, see the Help for the <B>print</B> command.</P>
<P CLASS="t">You can also display the pop-up interface to pause, resume, or delete a print job, and to view the print queue, which is the list of files that are waiting to print on a particular printer. For information, see the Help for the pop-up interface or for the <B>net print</B> command.</P></BODY></HTML>
