<H3 CLASS="h2">How SNMP Uses the Registry </H3><P CLASS="t">The Registry, the operating system database on each Windows&nbsp;NT-based computer, contains information that is needed for network management. The SNMP service accesses the Registry and converts the information into a format that can be used by third-party SNMP network management programs. </P>

<P CLASS="t">The following sections — "Management Information Base,"  "Agents," and "Managers" — provide a high-level overview of the major software components of SNMP. Windows&nbsp;NT implements SNMP-based MIBs and an SNMP agent component to provide the necessary framework for SNMP network management. </P>
<P CLASS="t">SNMP uses a glossary of network management terms that may be unfamiliar to some readers. The following SNMP network management terminology is used in this chapter.</P>
<UL><LI>A <I>host</I> is any network device, including workstation and server computers.</LI><LI><I>Managed-objects</I> are host hardware and software resources, such as  a computer disk partition, that can be monitored (managed) by a network administrator at another computer on the network.</LI><LI>Each SNMP host (computer) has one or many <I>management information bases</I> (MIBs) that contain information about the managed-objects on that computer.</LI><LI>A <I>manager</I> is a software program that sends requests for data to other computers on the network. Typically, the manager includes a user interface (UI) for displaying status and data retrieved from the network computers and devices.</LI><LI>An <I>SNMP management console</I> is any computer running SNMP manager software.</LI><LI>An <I>agent</I> is a software program that processes manager requests for data by retrieving data from managed-objects on the computer. The agent program is part of the SNMP service running under Windows&nbsp;NT.</LI></UL></BODY></HTML>
