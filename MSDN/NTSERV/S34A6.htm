<H3 CLASS="h2">Client Sends Job to Spooler</H3><P CLASS="t">The user on the client system sends the job over the network to the print server. The client system's application software or operating system sends the job to the client's transport protocol, to the network adapter, over the network hardware, to the transport software on the print server, and finally to the appropriate print server service on the print server. The print server service (Windows&nbsp;NT Server, Services for Macintosh, or TCP/IP Print) assigns a data type to the print job and submits the print job to the spooler, or leaves it blank.</P>
