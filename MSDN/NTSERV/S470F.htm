<H2 CLASS="h1">Test IP-address-to-MAC-address Resolution<BR>by Using ARP</H2><P CLASS="t">TCP\IP under Windows&nbsp;NT allows a computer to communicate over a network with another computer by using either an IP address, a host name, or a NetBIOS name. However, when one computer attempts to communicate with another computer using one of these three naming conventions, that name must ultimately be resolved to a hardware address, the medium access control (MAC) address.</P>
<P CLASS="t">The Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) allows a host to find the MAC address of a destination host on the same physical network, given the destination host's IP address. To make ARP efficient, each computer caches IP-to-MAC address mappings to eliminate repetitive ARP broadcast requests.</P>
<P CLASS="t">The <B>arp</B> command allows a user to view and modify the ARP table entries on the local computer. The <B>arp</B> command is useful for viewing the ARP cache and resolving address resolution problems. </P></BODY></HTML>
