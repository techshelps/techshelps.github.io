<H2 CLASS="h2">Using Remote Access Service with ISDN </H2><P CLASS="t">A computer running Windows NT Server with RAS can be used to connect an intranet and remote users to the Internet. The connection to the RAS server computer over the telephone line provides a virtual WAN. Using this connection, local and remote users can access network resources, such as a computer running Internet Information Server. </P>
<P CLASS="t">Because Windows NT Server supports ISDN, you can configure RAS with ISDN connections to the Internet and to remote users. You can optimize the ISDN configuration to allow the RAS server to support the maximum number of remote client connections (256) or to provide the best possible bandwidth for a smaller number of connections.</P>
<P CLASS="t">By using multiple B channels for each Internet or remote client connection, you can maximize the available bandwidth for the connections. However, maximizing the bandwidth by this method reduces the total number of connections that can be supported. You can maximize bandwidth by using PPP Multilink, described in the following section.</P>
