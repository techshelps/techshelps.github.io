<H3 CLASS="h2">Adding and Modifying DNS Resource Records</H3><P CLASS="t">DNS Manager makes it easy to add data to both local and remote Microsoft DNS servers because you can create and edit all DNS resource records by using DNS Manager. After you create a zone, you can select and right-click the zone to display a menu of actions that you can perform on the zone. The following figure illustrates this menu.</P>

<P CLASS="cap"><B>Figure 9.7    Zone menu</B></P>
<P CLASS="t">The two menu choices that you use to add information about the computers in the zone are <B>New Host</B> and <B>New Record</B>.</P>
<P CLASS="t">You will want to use the <B>New Host</B> option to add the A and PTR records for the computers in the zone that are not DHCP- or WINS-enabled. The following figure illustrates the <B>Add New Host</B> dialog box.</P>
<P><img src="XNGAA09.gif"></P>
<P CLASS="cap"><B>Figure 9.8    New Host dialog box</B></P>
<P CLASS="t">Additionally you will want to use <B>New Resource Record</B> to add other DNS information about a computer, such as alias (Cname), mail server, and so on. (Refer back to Table 9.2 for descriptions of the different types of resource records you can create.)</P>
<P CLASS="t">The following figure illustrates the <B>New Resource Record</B> dialog box.</P>

<P CLASS="cap"><B>Figure 9.9    New Resource Record dialog box</B></P>
<P CLASS="t"><B>Note</B></P>
<P>You can use existing resource records in the DNS database files from other DNS servers. For more information about this topic, see "Porting Data Files from Other DNS Servers" in the section "Troubleshooting DNS Server" later in this chapter.</P></BODY></HTML>
