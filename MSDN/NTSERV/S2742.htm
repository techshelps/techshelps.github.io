<H2 CLASS="h2">Using DNS Manager to Configure Zones and Create DNS Resource Records</H2><P CLASS="t">DNS Manager is automatically added to <B>Administrative Tools</B> on the <B>Program</B> menu when you install Microsoft DNS server on a computer running Windows&nbsp;NT Server 4.0. You use DNS Manager to administer local and remote Microsoft DNS servers and to create the resource records that provide name resolution information and support connectivity for remote users on the Internet and TCP/IP intranets.</P>
<P> <FONT FACE="Symbol">Û</FONT>    To start DNS Manager</P>

<P CLASS="t">The tasks you can perform using DNS Manager include the following:</P>
<P>     Adding DNS servers for local server, remote server, and virtual server management.</P>
<P>     Configuring server properties.</P>
<P>     Configuring primary and secondary zones. </P>
<P>     Configuring transfer of data between primary and secondary zones. Such transfer of data is referred to as a <I>zone transfer.</I></P>
<P>     Adding A (address) records with host name-to-IP address mappings for computers in the zone that are assigned static IP addresses. For more information on different resource record types, see Table 2.1, "DNS Resource Record Types," later in this chapter.</P>
<P>     Adding PTR (pointer) records with IP address - to - host name mappings. (Each PTR record must have a corresponding A record and vice versa.) </P>
<P>     Adding CNAME (alias), MX (mail exchange), and other resource records as needed.</P>
<P>     Monitoring usage of DNS servers by using DNS Manager statistics.</P>
