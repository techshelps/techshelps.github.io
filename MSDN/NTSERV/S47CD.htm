<H3 CLASS="h2">Microsoft WINS Proxy</H3><P CLASS="t">A WINS proxy is a WINS-enabled computer that helps resolve name queries for non-WINS enabled computers in routed TCP/IP intranets. By default, non-WINS enabled computers are configured as b-node which use IP broadcasts for name queries. The WINS proxy computer listens on the local subnet for IP broadcast name queries.</P>
<P CLASS="t">When a non-WINS enabled computer sends an IP name query broadcast, the WINS proxy accepts the broadcast and checks its cache for the appropriate NetBIOS computer name-to-IP-address mapping. If the WINS proxy has the correct mapping in its cache, the WINS proxy sends this information to the non-WINS computer. If the name-to-IP-address mapping is not in cache, the WINS proxy queries a WINS server for the name-to-IP-address mapping. </P>
<P CLASS="t">If a WINS server is not available on the local subnet, the WINS proxy can query a WINS server across a router. The WINS proxy caches (stores in memory) computer name-to-IP-address mappings it receives from the WINS server. These mappings are used to respond to subsequent IP broadcast name queries from b-node computers on the local subnet. </P>
<P CLASS="t">The name-to-IP-address mappings that the WINS proxy receives from the WINS server are stored in the WINS proxy cache for a limited time. (By installation default this value is 6 minutes. The minimum value is 1 minute.)</P>
<P CLASS="t">When the WINS proxy receives a response from the WINS server, it stores the mapping in its cache and responds to any subsequent name query broadcasts with the mapping received from the WINS server.</P>
<P CLASS="t">The role of the WINS proxy is similar to that of the DHCP/BOOTP relay agent which forwards DHCP client requests across routers. Because the WINS server does not respond to broadcasts, a computer configured as a WINS proxy should be installed on subnets which contain computers that use broadcasts for name resolution. </P>
<P CLASS="t"><B>Note</B></P>
<P>To configure a computer as a WINS proxy, you must manually edit that computer's registry. The registry parameter <B>EnableProxy</B> must be set to 1 (REG_DWORD). This parameter is located in the following Registry key: </P>
