<H3 CLASS="h2">Loading and Displaying the Pop-up Interface</H3><P CLASS="t">You can load and display the pop-up interface simultaneously or as two separate operations. Loading and displaying the pop-up interface simultaneously is easier than performing the operations separately, and it makes more efficient use of memory. You load and display the interface by typing a single command. When you finish using the interface, Network Client unloads it from memory, freeing about 29K of memory for programs. The disadvantage is that you cannot use the interface while using another program.</P>
<P CLASS="t"><B>To load and display the pop-up interface simultaneously</B></P>
<P>    1.    At the MS-DOS command prompt, type <B>net</B> and press Enter.</P>
<P>The pop-up interface appears.</P>
<P>    2.    When you finish using the interface, press Esc. Network Client unloads the interface from memory.</P>
<P CLASS="t">The advantage of loading and displaying the pop-up interface separately is that you can display it at any time, either from the MS-DOS command prompt or while you are using another program. One disadvantage is that you need to use separate commands to load, display, and unload the interface. Also, the pop-up interface occupies about 29K of memory, whether you are using it or not, until you explicitly unload it from memory.</P>
<P CLASS="t"><B>To load and display the pop-up interface separately</B></P>
<P>    1.    At the MS-DOS command prompt, type <B>net start popup</B> and press Enter.</P>
<P CLASS="t"><B>Note</B></P>
<P>If the pop-up interface is loaded into memory automatically when you start the computer, skip this step.</P>
<P>    2.    When you want to display the pop-up interface, press ctrl+ALT+N.</P>
<P>If, during Setup, you chose a key other than N to display the pop-up interface, press CTRL+ALT plus the key you specified.</P>
<P CLASS="t">When you finish using the pop-up interface, you can unload it from memory.</P>
<P CLASS="t"><B>To unload the pop-up interface from memory</B></P>
<P>    At the MS-DOS command prompt, type <B>net stop popup</B> and press Enter.</P></BODY></HTML>
