<H2 CLASS="h2">Authentication Options</H2><P CLASS="t">For the WWW service, you can choose any or all of these Internet Service Manager authentication options in the <B>Service Properties</B> dialog box:</P>
<P>     <B>Allow Anonymous</B></P>
<P>When you select this box, the WWW service processes anonymous connections and uses the anonymous logon user name and password for these connections. When you clear this box, the WWW service rejects all anonymous connections. In this case, the WWW service uses the basic or Windows&nbsp;NT challenge/response authentication protocol to access the resource.</P>
<P>     <B>Basic (clear text)</B> </P>
<P>When you select this box, the WWW service processes requests by using basic authentication. </P>
<P></P>
<P>Warning</P>
<P>This check box is cleared by default for security reasons. Basic authentication sends Windows&nbsp;NT Server user names and passwords across the network without encryption. </P>
<P></P>
<P></P>
<P>     <B>Windows&nbsp;NT Challenge/Response</B></P>
<P>This box is selected by default. It sets the WWW service to use the Windows&nbsp;NT challenge/response protocol to honor requests by clients to send user account information. This protocol uses encrypted passwords for secure transmission. Windows&nbsp;NT challenge/response authentication works only with version 2.0 and later of Internet Explorer for Windows&nbsp;NT and Windows&nbsp;95. For more details on when the server automatically uses challenge/response, see the "WWW Service Security" section earlier in this chapter. </P>
<P></P>
<P CLASS="t">The FTP service options include:</P>
<P>     <B>Allow Anonymous Connections</B></P>
<P>When you select this box, the user enters the user name "Anonymous." The FTP service processes these connections for the Windows&nbsp;NT user account specified in the FTP <B>Service Properties</B> dialog box. When you clear this box, users must enter valid Windows&nbsp;NT user names and passwords to log on to the FTP service.</P>
<P>     <B>Allow only anonymous connections</B> </P>
<P>When you select this box, the FTP service rejects user logons with a user name other than Anonymous. </P>
<P></P>
<P></P>
<P>Warning</P>
<P> The FTP service sends Windows&nbsp;NT Server user names and passwords across the network without encryption. For security, this box is cleared by default.</P>
<P>Gopher services </P>
<P CLASS="t">The Gopher service allows only anonymous connections.</P></BODY></HTML>
