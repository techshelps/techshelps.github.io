<H2 CLASS="h1">Planning for Microsoft WINS Server Implementation</H2><P CLASS="t">The number of Windows&nbsp;NT-based WINS servers that an enterprise requires is based on the number of WINS client connections per server and the network topology. The number of users that can be supported per server varies according to usage patterns, data storage, and processing capabilities of the WINS server computer. </P>
<P CLASS="t">Planning for WINS server implementation on the network typically requires consideration of the issues presented in the following table.</P>
