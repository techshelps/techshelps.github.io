<H3 CLASS="h2">Example ARC Pathnames</H3><P CLASS="t">This section contains examples that you can use as models. The first two examples are for ARC pathnames on x86-based computers. The last example is a boot selection on a DEC Alpha AXP 150 computer, and should be good for all RISC-based computers with similar disk configurations.</P>
<H4 CLASS="h3"><A NAME="sec0"></A>More Than One SCSI Controller on an x86-based Computer </H4><P CLASS="t">This example for an x86-based computer has the following disks and controllers:</P>
<UL><LI>Two Adaptec 2940s, each with two 1&nbsp;GB hard disks at ID 0 and ID 1.</LI><LI>One Adaptec 1542, with two 1&nbsp;GB hard disks at ID 0 and ID 4.</LI></UL><P CLASS="t">Each hard disk has a single, 1&nbsp;GB primary partition. Partitions 1 and 2 are on the first 2940, partitions 3 and 4 are on the second 2940, and partitions 5 and 6 are on the 1542. These are the ARC pathnames that you would have in the Boot.ini file if each partition had a copy of Windows NT installed in a folder named Winnt:</P>
<UL><LI>Partition 1: multi(0)disk(0)rdisk(0)partition(1)\Winnt </LI><LI>Partition 2: multi(0)disk(0)rdisk(1)partition(1)\Winnt</LI><LI>Partition 3: scsi(1)disk(0)rdisk(0)partition(1)\Winnt</LI><LI>Partition 4: scsi(1)disk(1)rdisk(0)partition(1)\Winnt</LI><LI>Partition 5: scsi(0)disk(0)rdisk(0)partition(1)\Winnt</LI><LI>Partition 6: scsi(0)disk(4)rdisk(0)partition(1)\Winnt</LI></UL><P CLASS="t">For partitions 3 and 4, Ntbootdd.sys is a copy of Aic78xx.sys. For partitions 5 and 6, Ntbootdd.sys is a copy of Aha154x.sys. For partitions 1 and 2, you could also use the following pathnames:</P>
<UL><LI>Partition 1: scsi(0)disk(0)rdisk(0)partition(1)\Winnt </LI><LI>Partition 2: scsi(0)disk(1)rdisk(0)partition(1)\Winnt </LI></UL><P CLASS="t">provided that you had an Ntbootdd.sys file that was a copy of Aic78xx.sys. However, Windows NT Setup always use the multi() syntax for the first two SCSI disks. </P>
<H4 CLASS="h3"><A NAME="sec1"></A>Both EIDE and SCSI Controllers on an x86-based Computer</H4><P CLASS="t">This example is for an x86-based computer with the following disks and controllers:</P>
<UL><LI>A dual-channel EIDE controller with three 1&nbsp;GB disks, two on the primary channel and one on the secondary channel.</LI><LI>An Adaptec 2940 controller with a single 4 GB hard disk at ID 3.</LI></UL><P CLASS="t">The three EIDE disks each have a single 1 GB partition. Partitions 1 and 2 are on the primary channel of the EIDE controller, and partition 3 is on the secondary channel. </P>
<P CLASS="t">The SCSI disk has four 1&nbsp;GB partitions. Partitions 4, 5, 6 and 7 are on the SCSI disk. Each partition would have the following ARC pathnames in the Boot.ini file, assuming that each partition has Windows NT installed in the Winnt folder:</P>
<UL><LI>Partition 1: multi(0)disk(0)rdisk(0)partition(1)\Winnt </LI><LI>Partition 2: multi(0)disk(0)rdisk(1)partition(1)\Winnt </LI><LI>Partition 3: multi(0)disk(0)rdisk(2)partition(1)\Winnt </LI><LI>Partition 4: scsi(0)disk(3)rdisk(0)partition(1)\Winnt </LI><LI>Partition 5: scsi(0)disk(3)rdisk(0)partition(2)\Winnt </LI><LI>Partition 6: scsi(0)disk(3)rdisk(0)partition(3)\Winnt </LI><LI>Partition 7: scsi(0)disk(3)rdisk(0)partition(4)\Winnt </LI></UL><P CLASS="t">Loading Windows NT from partitions 4 through 7 requires that the Ntbootdd.sys file be a copy of Aic78xx.sys.</P>
<H4 CLASS="h3"><A NAME="sec2"></A>Boot Selection on a DEC Alpha AXP 150</H4><P CLASS="t">On a RISC-based computer, all boot paths are defined in the NVRAM. When creating a new boot selection for a RISC-based computer, the firmware menus prompt you for the information to enter. There are examples for defining boot selections in the section titled "Creating Alternate Boot Selections for a RISC-based Computer," presented later in this chapter.</P>
<P CLASS="t">The following example is a boot selection on a DEC Alpha AXP 150. The computer has a single hard disk at ID 0, which has a 4 MB system partition and a 396 MB boot partition. Windows NT is installed on the boot partition in a folder named Winnt and the OSLOADER folder is also named Winnt, although it is on the system partition. The boot selection has the following values:</P>
<UL><LI>LOADIDENTIFIER=Windows&nbsp;NT Server 4.0</LI><LI>SYSTEMPARTITION=scsi(0)disk(0)rdisk(0)partition(1)</LI><LI>OSLOADER=scsi(0)disk(0)rdisk(0)partition(1)\Os\Winnt\Osloader.exe</LI><LI>OSLOADPARTITION=scsi(0)disk(0)rdisk(0)partition(2)</LI><LI>OSLOADFILENAME =\Winnt</LI><LI>OSLOADOPTIONS=nodebug</LI></UL></BODY></HTML>
