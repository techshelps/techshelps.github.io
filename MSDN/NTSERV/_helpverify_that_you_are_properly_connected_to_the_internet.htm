<h4>Cannot Connect to a PPTP Server</h4>
<p>
If you cannot connect to a PPTP server, verify the following items.</p>
<h4><a name="_helpverify_that_you_are_properly_connected_to_the_internet"></a>  Verify That You Are Properly Connected To The Internet</h4>
<p>
To check that your connection to the Internet is working properly:</p>
<p>
1.Ping www.microsoft.com.</p>
<p>
2.If <b>ping</b> does not reach www.microsoft.com, type:</p>
<b>ping</b> 207.68.156.16
</code>
<p>
1.If <b>ping</b> succeeds, you are properly connected to the Internet but you are not properly connected to your DNS server.</p>
<p>
2.If <b>ping</b> fails, you might not be connected to the Internet. Contact your ISP.</p>
<h4><a name="_helpping_the_pptp_server"></a>  Ping the PPTP Server</h4>
<p>
Ping the IP address of the PPTP server.</p>
<p>
If you receive a response, you are properly connected to the PPTP server, and you might have entered an incorrect user name or password.</p>
<p>
If you do not receive a response, the administrator of the PPTP server might have turned on PPTP filtering. This prevents you from pinging the PPTP server. Contact the administrator of the PPTP server.</p>
<h4><a name="_helpcheck_for_a_firewall"></a>  Check for a Firewall</h4>
<p>
Firewalls sometimes filter out PPTP packets. Contact your ISP and the administrator of your corporate server and ask if they are using a firewall. If so, ask them to pass TCP port 1723 and IP protocol 47.</p>
<p>
<b>Note</b>  IP protocol 47 is the Generic Routing Encapsulation (GRE) protocol.</p>
<h4><a name="_helpmake_sure_your_isp_isn.92.t_filtering_out_pptp"></a>  Make Sure Your ISP Isn&rsquo;t Filtering Out PPTP</h4>
<p>
Contact your ISP and ask if it filters out GRE packets. If so, request that it pass IP protocol 47.</p>
<h4><a name="_helpcheck_for_a_proxy_server"></a>  Check for a Proxy Server</h4>
<p>
It is not possible to create a PPTP tunnel that passes through a proxy server such as a computer running Microsoft Proxy Server. Therefore, if your internal network&rsquo;s proxy server handles all Internet traffic, including PPTP traffic, you will not be able to create a PPTP tunnel to access resources on the internal network.</p>
<p>
However, it is possible to configure a proxy server as a PPTP server in order to securely access resources on the proxy server. It is also possible to set up a secure PPTP connection on a separate computer instead of sending your packets through a proxy server. For more information, contact the administrator of the PPTP server.</p>
<h4><a name="_helpincrease_the_number_of_retransmissions"></a>  Increase the Number of Retransmissions</h4>
<p>
If you receive an error message stating that the server has not responded, you might want to increase the number of attempts PPTP makes to transmit data. You can do so by changing the <b>PPTPTcpMaxDataRetransmissions</b> Registry entry, in the following Registry path:</p>
<p>
<b>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\Tcpip\Parameters</b></p>
<p>
By default, this value is 9h. You can increase the value to 18h. You should not increase it beyond 25h.</p>
