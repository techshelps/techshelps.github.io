<b><i>Web Capacity Analysis Tool Controller</i></b></p>
The controller is the central component of the Web Capacity Analysis Tool. It initiates and monitors the tests. At the end of a test it collects data from clients, summarizes them in a standard form and stores them in log files. 
The controller is responsible for monitoring the evaluation system. The user initiates a test by running the Web Capacity Analysis Tool controller program. The controller sends the workload and other configuration data to clients and asks them to execute. The controller summarizes the data to log files which can be post processed. The controller and clients communicate over sockets using TCP, with the controller listening at a well-advertised port (currently it is 7232). 
The controller gets input from the command line that specifies names of input files and other parameters. The input files include: 
<ul>
<li>
Configuration file (extension: .cfg),which specifies the configuration to use for a given run.<br><br></li>
<li>
Script file (.scr), which defines the pages to be downloaded.<br><br></li>
<li>
Distribution file (.dst), which specifies the weighted distribution of the script pages (split between various classes). The sum of the weighted distributions must be 100%.<br><br></li>
<li>
Performance counter file (.pfc), an optional input file. The performance counter file specifies which performance counters to monitor while the server is running. This feature lets you examine the dynamic behavior of the server by using the performance counters that are visible over RPC.Figure 2, below, depicts the inputs to and outputs from the Web Capacity Analysis Tool controller program.<P>
