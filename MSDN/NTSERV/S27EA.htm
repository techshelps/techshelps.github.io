<H2 CLASS="h2">IP Addresses</H2><P CLASS="t">To participate on the Internet, every workstation and server computer must have a unique FQDN, and this FQDN must be mapped to a unique IP address. If a computer is <I>multihomed, </I>meaning that it is associated with more one IP address, each of the computer's IP addresses also must be unique.</P>
<P CLASS="t">TCP/IP, the protocol used throughout the Internet, is a <I>routeable </I>protocol, meaning that data can be passed, or routed, from one TCP/IP network to another. The intermediary devices that connect networks, referred to as<I> routers</I>, use IP addresses, rather than friendly names such as www.microsoft.com. The IP addresses provide routers an efficient method for locating computers and for addressing messages (in the<I> </I>form of IP packets) between computers. Therefore every device attached to a TCP/IP network must be identified by a unique IP address.</P>
<P CLASS="t">An IP address is a structured 32-bit number divided into four numeric fields separated by the . character (the period, also referred to as a dot), for example 172.46.8.34. Each of the four numeric fields is a byte (8 bits) in length. Each field can represent some number between 0 and 255; 255 is the maximum value that can be expressed by using 8 bits.</P>
<P CLASS="t">The four fields of an IP address represent two pieces of information, the network ID and the host ID of a computer. The <I>network ID</I> identifies a physical network. All computers on the same physical network must have the same network ID, and the network ID must be unique throughout the Internet. The <I>host ID</I> identifies a workstation, server, router, or other TCP/IP device. Each computer connected to a TCP/IP network must have a host ID. </P>
<P CLASS="t">Your intranet network administrator or Internet service provider (ISP) must provide a host ID and network ID for each computer that connects to the network. This IP address can either be<I> </I>manually configured or dynamically assigned by using Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) servers.</P>
<P CLASS="t">To connect your intranet to the Internet, you can obtain an allocation of network IDs for your enterprise computers by contacting either your ISP or the following regional Internet Registries:</P>
<P>     InterNIC, the regional Internet Registry for the United States. Contact InterNIC at <B>http://www.internic.net/</B>.</P>
<P>     Reseaux IP Europeene (RIPE) NCC, the regional Internet Registry for Europe. Contact RIPE NCC at <B>http://www.ripe.net/</B>.</P>
<P>     Asia-Pacific Network Information Center (AP-NIC), the regional Internet Registry for Asia-Pacific. Contact AP-NIC at<B> http://www.apnic.net/</B>.</P>
