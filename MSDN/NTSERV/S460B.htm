<H3 CLASS="h2">Binding Options</H3><P CLASS="t">Earlier in this chapter, we discussed how the Windows&nbsp;NT network architecture consists of a series of layers and how components in each layer perform specific functions for the layers above and below it. The bottom of the network architecture ends at the network adapter card, which moves information between computers that are part of the network. </P>

<P CLASS="t">The linking of network components on different levels to enable communication between those components is called <I>binding</I>. A network component can be bound to one or more network components above or below it. The services that each component provides can be shared by all the components bound to it.</P>
<P CLASS="t">When adding network software, Windows&nbsp;NT automatically binds all dependent components accordingly.</P>
<P CLASS="t">In the Network window, the <B>Bindings</B> tab displays the bindings of the installed network components, from the upper-layer services and protocols to the lowest layer of network adapter drivers. Bindings can be enabled and disabled, based on the use of the network components installed on the system.</P>

<P CLASS="cap"><B>Figure 1.24    The Settings tab of the Network window</B></P>
<P CLASS="t">Bindings can be ordered or sequenced to optimize the system's use of the network. For example, if NetBEUI and TCP/IP are installed on a computer, and if most of servers that the computer connects to are running only TCP/IP, the Workstation bindings should be examined. The administrator of this computer would want to make sure that the Workstation is bound to TCP/IP first and that NetBEUI is at the bottom of the list.</P>
<P CLASS="t">In Windows&nbsp;NT 3.1, the redirector uses the following method to establish a connection.</P>
<UL><LI>First, the redirector submits the connect request to the first protocol driver in the bindings order and waits for that protocol driver to complete the request and return. </LI><LI>If the first protocol driver's return indicates that it could not connect to the specified server, then the redirector submits the connect request to the second protocol driver in the bindings order. </LI><LI>This continues down the bindings order until a protocol-driver return indicates that the connection was successful or until all protocol drivers have been tried and have failed.</LI></UL><P CLASS="t">In Windows&nbsp;NT 3.5 and later, the redirector uses the following method to establish a connection.</P>
<UL><LI>The redirector simultaneously submits the connect request to all protocol drivers.</LI><LI>When one of the protocol drivers successfully completes the request, the redirector waits until all higher-priority protocol drivers, if there are any, have been returned. (The priority is based on the bindings order.)</LI><LI>The redirector then proceeds to use the highest-priority protocol driver that returned with success status, and it disconnects all connections that may have been established through lower-priority protocol drivers.</LI></UL></BODY></HTML>
