<H3 CLASS="h2">Windows For Workgroups Clients Authenticating to Windows&nbsp;NT Servers </H3><P CLASS="t">At Terra Flora, the clients running Windows for Workgroups are already configured and working together in workgroups. The workgroups are defined by task. For example, one of the payroll workgroups consists of all those responsible for entering hours worked into the payroll system. Since all the computers running Windows for Workgroups are already connected as workgroups, it is a simple configuration task to the computers to access other network computers running Windows&nbsp;NT Server.</P>
<P CLASS="t">Before the users of the computer running Windows for Workgroups can logon to the computer running Windows&nbsp;NT Server, the user's accounts and passwords must be set up and proper permissions assigned to the user on the Windows&nbsp;NT Server. For details, see Microsoft Windows&nbsp;NT Concepts and Planning, Chapter 1, "Managing Windows&nbsp;NT Server Domains," Chapter 2, "Working with User and Group Accounts," and Chapter 3, "Managing User Work Environments."</P>

<P CLASS="t">At Terra Flora, the Windows for Workgroups client will log on onto the computer running Windows&nbsp;NT Server. In order to accomplish this task, the computer running Windows for Workgroups needs to be properly configured. </P>
<P CLASS="t"><B>To configure the computer running Windows for Workgroups to join the Windows&nbsp;NT domain</B></P>
<P>    1.    On the <B>Program Manager</B>, double-click <B>Main</B>.</P>
<P>    2.    Double-click <B>Control Panel</B>. </P>

<P>    6.    In <B>Default Logon Name</B>, type the user account, as set up on the Computer running Windows&nbsp;NT Server.</P>
<P><img src="XNG_F29.gif"></P>
<P>    7.    Click <B>Startup</B>, and then specify settings in the <B>Startup Settings</B> dialog box for how logon will occur when you start the computer running Windows for Workgroups.</P>
<P>    8.    Under <B>Options for Enterprise Networking</B>, select <B>Log On to Windows&nbsp;NT or LAN Manager Domain</B>.</P>
<P>    9.    Make sure the setting for <B>Domain Name</B> is correct, and then click <B>Set Password</B>.</P>

<P>    10.    In the <B>Change Domain Password</B> dialog box, make sure the information displayed is correct, or change the password, and then click <B>OK</B>. </P>
<P>The password must match the user account information set up on the computer running Windows&nbsp;NT Server.</P>
<P><img src="XNG_F31.gif"></P>
<P CLASS="t">When the user starts up the computer, the <B>Welcome to Windows for Workgroups</B> dialog box appears. </P>
<P><img src="XNG_F32.gif"></P>
<P CLASS="t">If the Logon Name is correct, the user types the password, clicks OK, and is authenticated to the Windows&nbsp;NT Network. The information can be changed. </P></BODY></HTML>
