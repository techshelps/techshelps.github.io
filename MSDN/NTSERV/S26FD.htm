<H2 CLASS="h2">Analyzing the File System Cache Data</H2><P CLASS="t">You can use the data you collect in Performance Monitor to evaluate whether your server has enough memory to support an effective file system cache. This evaluation consists of the following three steps:</P>
<P>     Determine how the size of your server's file system cache varies over time.</P>
<P>     Determine the extent to which the performance of your server's cache varies with the size of the cache.</P>
<P>     Verify that the server has enough memory to support an effective cache even when the server is most active.</P>
<P></P>
<P>The following sections provide information to help you with this evaluation.</P></BODY></HTML>
