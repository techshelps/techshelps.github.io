<P CLASS="t"><B>Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN)</B></P>
<P>A type of phone line used to enhance WAN speeds, an ISDN line can transmit at speeds of 64 or 128 kilobits per second, as opposed to standard phone lines, which typically transmit at only 9600 bits per second (bps). An ISDN line must be installed by the phone company at both the server site and the remote site. See also <I>bits per second</I>.</P>

<P CLASS="t"><B>Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA)</B></P>
<P>The central coordinator for the assignment of unique parameter values for Internet protocols. IANA is chartered by the Internet Society (ISOC) and the Federal Network Council (FNC) to act as the clearinghouse to assign and coordinate the use of numerous Internet protocol parameters. Contact IANA at <B>http://www.iana.org/iana/</B>.</P>
<P CLASS="t"><B>Internet Assistant</B></P>
<P>Several Internet Assistant add-on software components are available for Microsoft Office products. Each Internet Assistant adds functionality that is relevant to creating content for the Internet. For example, Internet Assistant for Microsoft Word enables Word to create HTML documents from within Microsoft Word.</P>
<P CLASS="t"><B>Internet Database Connector (IDC)</B></P>
<P>Provides access to databases for Internet Information Server by using ODBC. The Internet Database Connector is contained in Httpodbc.dll, which is an Internet Server API DLL.</P>
<P CLASS="t"><B>Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)</B></P>

<P CLASS="t"><B>Internet Protocol (IP)</B></P>
<P>The part of TCP/IP that routes messages from one Internet location to another. IP is responsible for addressing and sending TCP packets over the network. IP provides a best-effort, connectionless delivery system that does not guarantee that packets arrive at their destination or that they are received in the sequence in which they were sent. See also <I>packet</I>.</P>
<P CLASS="t"><B>Internet Relay Chat (IRC)</B></P>
<P>A protocol that enables two or more people, each in remote locations, who are connected to an IRC server to hold real-time conversations. IRC is defined in RFC 1459.</P>

<P>See <I>Internet Protocol</I>.</P>
<P CLASS="t"><B>IP address</B></P>
<P>Used to identify a node on a network and to specify routing information. Each node on the network must be assigned a unique IP address, which is made up of the network ID, plus a unique host ID assigned by the network administrator. This address is typically represented in dotted-decimal notation, of four period-delimited octets (eight bits, or one byte) consisting of up to 12 numerals (for example, 138.57.7.27). See also <I>Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol; node</I>.</P>
<P CLASS="t"><B>IPX</B></P>
<P>Transport protocol used in Novell NetWare networks. Also referred to as IPX/SPX. Windows&nbsp;NT implements IPX through NWLink. </P>
<P CLASS="t"><B>ISDN interface card</B></P>
