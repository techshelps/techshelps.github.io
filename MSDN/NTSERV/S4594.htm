<H3 CLASS="h2">Simple Internet Router Using PPP</H3><P CLASS="t">On small intranets (an intranet with less than 20 computers), a computer running Windows&nbsp;NT Server can use Dial-Up Networking, simple TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol) routing, and a PPP connection to an Internet service provider to create an Internet gateway for the computers on the small intranet. This configuration enables you to connect intranet clients to the Internet, as shown in Figure 6.1. </P>

<P>Figure 6.1    Windows&nbsp;NT Server as a static Internet router with PPP</P>
<P CLASS="t">In this scenario, the computer running Windows&nbsp;NT Server has a Dial-Up Networking connection to an Internet service provider (ISP). Static TCP/IP routing is enabled, and a static routing table is created for the computers on the private network. Routing information must also be provided to the Internet service provider because simple TCP/IP routing does not use the routing information protocol (RIP) to communicate with the ISP's router. The routing information enables the routers to route traffic to and from the Internet to computers on the private network. </P>
<P CLASS="t">This configuration can also support a very light-duty server running Internet Information Server.</P>
<P CLASS="t">For this scenario, you need to install and configure the following hardware or services: </P>
