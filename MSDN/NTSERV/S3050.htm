<H3 CLASS="h2">Backbone Link Node </H3><P CLASS="t">Backbone Link Node (BLN) is the Bay Networks multiprotocol router/bridge. The symmetric multiprocessor architecture of BLN satisfies the high-performance and availability requirements of backbone internetworks using, for example, 100BASE-T, FDDI, HSSI, ATM, and SNA. Its symmetric multiprocessor architecture uses multiple MC68060-  and MC68040-based Fast Routing Engines (FRE), multiple dual PowerPC microprocessor-based ATM Routing Engine (ARE) processor modules, and Bay Networks 1-Gbps Parallel Packet Express (PPX). The BLN provides 300,000 pps forwarding performance when equipped with the MC68060-based FRE. The dual PowerPC-based ARE supports 155 Mbps full-duplex virtual network routing to provide connectivity between multiple virtual LANs over a single ATM interface. </P>
<P CLASS="t">The BLN supports 4 FRE/ARE processor modules, 16 LAN interfaces, and 32 serial interfaces. A BLN configured with symmetric multiprocessors, redundant LAN interfaces, processor interconnects, power supplies, and software image storage is completely fault resilient. A redundant router capability also provides another level of network fault tolerance.</P>
<H4 CLASS="h3"><A NAME="sec0"></A>28000 Series Ethernet/Fast Ethernet Switches </H4><P CLASS="t">For bandwidth-intensive applications, the Bay Networks 28000 series of switches enhance existing Ethernet LANs and provide 2 gigabits per second (Gbps) of internal switching and scalable 10/100 megabits-per-second (Mbps) dedicated bandwidth to support high-demand networks. These features enable the switch to provide scalable, dedicated bandwidth to attached end users, shared-media segments, servers, and high-end workstations.</P>
<P CLASS="t">All 28000 series switches include two high-speed, front-panel expansion ports for supporting direct 200 Mbps, full-duplex connection to other switches. Up to seven 28000 switches can be linked in a single stack, providing a scalable solution. The 28000 switches support redundant links between devices, in which one link automatically assumes standby status to provide a backup data path in the event of a primary-link failure.</P>
