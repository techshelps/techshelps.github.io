<H2 CLASS="h1">About Disks and Disk Organization</H2><P CLASS="t">This section describes the physical structure of hard disks and floppy disks, and presents an overview of ways to logically organize areas on your disks. </P>
<P CLASS="t">Both hard disks and floppy disks work similar to an old-fashioned record player, with the record turning on the turntable and a needle playing the music. They are also similar to VCRs and stereo cassettes in that disks, cassette players, and VCRs all use a read/write head to access the information that is stored on the magnetic media.</P>
<P CLASS="t">Hard or fixed disks store information on a revolving platter of metal or glass coated with a magnetic material. The disk typically consists of several physical platters on a common spindle. This platter is similar to the record on a record player, except information is usually stored on both sides of a disk platter.</P>
<P CLASS="t">As the disk rotates, a transducer element called the head reads or writes binary data on the magnetic media. There are many methods for encoding data on the disk, such as modified frequency modulation (MFM) and run length limited (RLL). The disk controller logic determines the method used and the density of data on the disk.</P>
<P CLASS="t"><B>Note</B></P>
<P>There are some state-of-the-art disks and disk controllers that have different hardware and logic than are described in this chapter. </P></BODY></HTML>
