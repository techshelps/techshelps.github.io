<P CLASS="t"><B>Notes</B></P>
<UL><LI>You are not required to use <B>Log In Search</B>, but if the groups are set up on the Banyan server, you can use this feature. The groups specified in the Search List will be searched to see if the user that is attempting to log in is a member of that group and what the permissions are associated with the user. You can specify up to three groups. When the user attempts to log on, the first group is checked, if no information about the user is located, the second group is checked. If no information about the user is found, the third group is checked. If no user information is found, the log in attempt fails.</LI><LI>The <B>Load Banyan VINES Workstation during system start </B>check box must be selected if the computer running Windows&nbsp;NT is to authenticate to the Banyan server automatically during logon. </LI><LI>The <B>Use Windows&nbsp;NT Logon for VINES</B> (common login) option creates a common login for both Windows&nbsp;NT and Banyan VINES. This requires that the user account and password on both machines be the same. </LI><LI>You can specify the log in attempt seconds before the result is a time out failure. </LI><LI>Step 10, above, allows MS-DOS applications to recognize the Banyan connections. This is required since most administrative applications running on the Banyan server are MS-DOS based.</LI><LI>In step 11, above, the Name must be included in a group in Street Talk on the Banyan server. You can indicate any name that is included in the group but the default will be the name of computer on which you are installing the product.</LI></UL><P CLASS="t">If the Banyan Enterprise Client for Windows&nbsp;NT is configured as described, login will take place when the Windows&nbsp;NT client starts up. When the user logs into the Windows&nbsp;NT network, authentication to the Banyan server also occurs. </P>
<P CLASS="t">If you elect not to configure automatic log in to the Banyan server because use is infrequent, the users can sign onto the Banyan server from the Windows&nbsp;NT Start menu.</P>
<P CLASS="t"><B>To log into the Banyan server</B></P>
<P>    1.    Click <B>Start</B>, point to <B>Programs</B>, and click VINES (the program group name will appear as entered in the Vines Workstation Configuration dialog box).</P>
<P>    2.    Double-click Login. </P>
<P>    3.    In the VINES Login dialog box, type the user's account name and password that is configured on the Banyan server, and then click OK.</P>
<P><img src="XNG_F25.gif"></P>
<P CLASS="t">The <B>VINES Login Status</B> dialog box appears. Once this dialog box is closed, the Windows&nbsp;NT <B>Start</B> menu dialog box appears. </P></BODY></HTML>
