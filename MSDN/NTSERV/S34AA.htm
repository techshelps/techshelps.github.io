<H3 CLASS="h2">Print Server Spooler Processes Print Job</H3><P CLASS="t">The spooler receives the job from the print server service. If the printer was established by selecting the <B>Network Printer</B> option in the Add printer wizard, the remote print provider sends the job to the print server. Otherwise, the job goes to the local print provider.</P>
<P CLASS="t">Unless otherwise configured, the local print provider spools the job to disk and checks the data type assigned by the print server service. The data type (for example, RAW or PSCRIPT1) determines which print processor receives the job. The data type also effects whether the print processor alters the job or not, and if so, how it alters the job. If the spooler is configured to append a separator file, it does so before sending the job to the print monitor for delivery to the print device.</P>
