<H2 CLASS="h2">Using Performance Monitor to Monitor Transmission Rates</H2><P CLASS="t">The following tables list and describe some of the Performance Monitor counters that can be used for measuring transmission rates. The counters in this table display the transmission rate observed during the last sample interval. They do not display a rolling or cumulative average of the rate. Also, the counters that represent sums of other counters, such as IP: Datagrams/sec, are simple sums of the other counters' values. They are not weighted sums.</P>
<P></P>
<P CLASS="t">For more information about how counter values are calculated, check the counter type of the counter. A counter type determines how Performance Monitor calculates and displays that particular counter. Counters.hlp, a Help file for the Performance Monitor counters, lists and describes the counter type of each counter. Counters.hlp is included on the <I>Microsoft Windows&nbsp;NT Server Resource Kit Supplement 1 </I>CD.</P>
<P></P>
<P>Note</P>
<P>You must install Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) to activate the counters on the TCP, IP, and Network Interface performance objects in Performance Monitor.</P>
