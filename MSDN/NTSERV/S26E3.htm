<H2 CLASS="h2">Monitoring CGI Requests</H2><P CLASS="t">CGI applications are not as difficult to monitor as ISAPI extensions. In Windows&nbsp;NT, CGI applications are stored and run as separate executables. Requests for pages generated by CGI run as separate processes. You can use most process-monitoring tools to view the processes in which the CGI requests run. However, the request processes often are so ephemeral that it is hard to track them effectively with any tool that isn't updated frequently or that requires that you choose the process before monitoring it.</P>
<P CLASS="t">Process Monitor and Task Manager provide a continually updated running list of processes. You can use Process Monitor and Task Manager to monitor the processes in which CGI requests run.</P></BODY></HTML>
