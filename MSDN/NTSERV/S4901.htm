<H3 CLASS="h2">Windows&nbsp;NT Network Clients</H3><P CLASS="t">Windows&nbsp;NT network clients can use any of the following network protocols to send print jobs to a Windows&nbsp;NT Server print server:</P>
<UL><LI>NetBEUI</LI><LI>NWLink</LI><LI>TCP/IP</LI><LI>AppleTalk</LI></UL><P CLASS="t">If the Windows&nbsp;NT client computer connects to a printer, it sends print jobs to the server by making remote procedure calls from the client's print router to the server's print router. If the client created the printer, the print server service handles delivery of the print job.</P>
<P CLASS="t">Windows&nbsp;NT print clients now use enhanced metafile (EMF) data type instead of RAW. EMF allows the print job to be spooled to the server and rendered at the server into the appropriate print format. Remote rendering significantly speeds up the client computer's return to task.</P>
<P CLASS="t">Windows&nbsp;NT network clients need not worry about printer drivers, because if the client doesn't have a needed driver, it is automatically installed on the client's hard disk from the Windows&nbsp;NT server when the client begins its print operation. If, however, the client computer is running Windows&nbsp;NT 4.0 and the server is running an earlier version, the printer drivers won't work. A Windows&nbsp;NT 4.0 print server can supply earlier version of printer drivers where necessary, but a Windows&nbsp;NT 4.0 client cannot use earlier versions of printer driver.</P></BODY></HTML>
