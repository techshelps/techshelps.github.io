<H3 CLASS="h2">Windows 3.1 Clients Authenticating to Windows&nbsp;NT Servers </H3><P CLASS="t">In order for a Windows 3.1 client to connect to a network, network software such as LAN Manager or Microsoft Networking Clients must be installed and configured. See the user documentation accompanying the LAN Manager or Microsoft Networks product for installation instructions. At Terra Flora, LAN Manager 2.2c is the product that will be installed to allow the Windows 3.1 clients to access the network. </P>
<P CLASS="t">Once LAN Manager is installed, the Config.sys and Windows\system.ini files will be updated and the network will start up automatically when the client running Windows 3.1 is started. </P>
<P CLASS="t">In addition, for a user to log onto a computer running Windows&nbsp;NT Server the user's account with necessary permissions must exist on the computer running Windows&nbsp;NT Server. For information on creating the user account and assigning permissions to access resources, see Microsoft Windows&nbsp;NT Server 4.0 <I>Concepts and Planning</I>, Chapter 1, "Managing Windows&nbsp;NT Server Domains," Chapter 2, "Working with User and Group Accounts," and Chapter 3, "Managing User Work Environments."</P>
<P CLASS="t">Once LAN Manager is installed, the LAN Manager Logon will display every time the Windows 3.1 client starts up.</P>
