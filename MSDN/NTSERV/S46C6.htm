<H3 CLASS="h2">Terra Flora's Decisions About Replication </H3><P CLASS="t">On servers running Windows&nbsp;NT Server, replication of the Enterprise databases are configured at the time that the Enterprise level service is installed. For example the WINS and DNS databases were configured to replicate on backup servers during configuration. Additionally, the primary domain controller (PDC) will replicate the directory services to the backup domain controller (BDC), ensuring fault tolerance and providing another server which can authenticate users of the Windows&nbsp;NT services. </P>
<P CLASS="t">DHCP is a database that is not automatically replicated. For this reason, Terra Flora will use the Replicator service, which is a service that is part of Windows&nbsp;NT Workstation and Server, to backup the DHCP database and files to another server, ensuring that should the primary server fail, DHCP information can be recovered and dynamic network addressing of clients and servers continue.</P></BODY></HTML>
