<H2 CLASS="h1">Resource Kit Compact Disc</H2><P CLASS="t">The <I>Windows&nbsp;NT Server Resource Kit</I> CD includes a wide variety of tools and utilities to help you work more efficiently with both Windows NT Workstation and Windows NT Server. Notes describing some of the enhancements made to the existing tools and utilities and introducing new ones that have been added for this version 4.0 release are provided in the Introduction to the <I>Windows NT Server Resource Guide</I>.</P>
<P CLASS="t">The CD that accompanies the<I> Windows&nbsp;NT Server Resource Kit</I> contains utilities that apply to information in the<I> Windows&nbsp;NT Workstation Resource Guide, </I>the<I> Windows&nbsp;NT Server Resource Guide,</I> the <I>Windows&nbsp;NT Server Networking Guide</I>, and the<I> Windows&nbsp;NT Server Internet Guide</I>.<I> </I>This new CD replaces all previous ones. It includes a collection of information resources, tools, and utilities that can make networking and working with the Windows<I>&nbsp;</I>NT platform even easier. </P>
<P CLASS="t"><B>Note</B></P>
<P>The utilities on this CD are designed and tested for the U.S. version of Windows<I>&nbsp;</I>NT version 4.0. Use of these utilities on any other version of Windows<I>&nbsp;</I>NT may cause unpredictable results.</P>
<P CLASS="t">A large Help file with explanations and user actions for the majority of the messages included in Windows<I>&nbsp;</I>NT version 4.0, and a large Help file of Performance Counter Definitions are just two of the major items included on the <I>Windows&nbsp;NT Server Resource Kit</I> CD. Updates to these files and others will be provided, when available, on the Microsoft Internet web site for the Windows NT Resource Kits. See the Rktools.hlp file for the exact site address, as well as the addresses of other Microsoft information sites.</P>
