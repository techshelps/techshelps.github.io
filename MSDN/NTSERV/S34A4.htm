<H3 CLASS="h2">Client Application Creates a Print Job</H3><P CLASS="t">A user on a client system runs an application that composes text and/or graphics to create a print job. The application may interact with a printer driver to create output in a printer language such as PCL, PostScript, or HP-GL/2.</P>
