<H3 CLASS="h2">Windows&nbsp;NT Clients Authenticating to UNIX Servers</H3><P CLASS="t">At Terra Flora, a third party product called Intergraph PC-NFS for Windows&nbsp;NT will be installed on all computers running Windows&nbsp;NT Workstations and client computers running Windows&nbsp;NT that need access to UNIX servers. When the Windows&nbsp;NT client computer starts, a login screen will display. The user logs into the NFS authenticating server and can access the resources for which permissions have been granted.</P>
<P CLASS="t">A new product called Intergraph DiskAccess will replace the product Intergraph PC-NFS for Windows&nbsp;NT. It is scheduled to ship 30 days after the Windows&nbsp;NT Server 4.0 product ships. The current product of Intergraph PC-NFS for Windows&nbsp;NT can be used with server versions of the Windows&nbsp;NT product which proceeded the 4.0 version, and operates fine with version 4.0. The major difference between Intergraph's DiskAccess and PC-NFS will be changes to the graphical interface. </P>
<P CLASS="t">The users at Terra Flora have been granted permissions and the user accounts and passwords have been entered in the /etc/Passwd file of the authenticating UNIX server. </P>
<H4 CLASS="h3"><A NAME="sec0"></A>Installing Intergraph PC-NFS for Windows&nbsp;NT</H4><P CLASS="t">Intergraph PC-NFS for Windows&nbsp;NT is to be installed on the computers running Windows&nbsp;NT Workstation and Windows&nbsp;NT Server, which will require client access to UNIX servers. For instructions on installing Intergraph PC-NFS for Windows&nbsp;NT, see the documentation provided with the product titled<I> PC-NFS for Windows&nbsp;NT Quick Start Guide</I>. Once installed, the product provides File Manager functions, a Control Panel-based configuration program and various utility programs. </P>
<H4 CLASS="h3"><A NAME="sec1"></A>Configuring PC-NFS</H4><P CLASS="t">Configuration of the product can be performed to customize PC-NFS to fit your network environment. </P>
<P CLASS="t"><B>To start PC-NFS Config</B></P>
<P>    1.    Click <B>Start</B>, point to <B>Settings </B>and click <B>Control Panel</B>.</P>
<P>    2.    Double-click <B>PC-NFS Config</B>.</P>

<P CLASS="t">See online Help for details about using PC-FNS Config.</P>
<H4 CLASS="h3"><A NAME="sec2"></A>Logging onto a UNIX Server Using PC-NFS</H4><P CLASS="t">Once the above steps are complete, computers running Windows&nbsp;NT Workstation and Server that will require client access to UNIX servers can logon to Windows&nbsp;NT and be authenticated to the UNIX servers in the same step. When a user logs into the system and starts a Windows&nbsp;NT session, by default the PC-NFS Login dialog box appears to indicate that PC-NFS software is running. </P>
<P CLASS="t">Authentication establishes UNIX-style user and group permissions for UNIX clients on the network and is necessary if the NFS server restricts entry by user name. You do not have to use the PC-NFS Login dialog box to log in to the server before connecting to network-based NFS resources. However, if you do not do so, you may find that an NFS server restricts or denies access to some or all of its resources.</P>
<P CLASS="t"><B>To log on as a Windows&nbsp;NT client to a UNIX server</B></P>
<P>    1.    Click <B>Start</B>, point to <B>Programs</B>, point to <B>PC-NFS for Windows&nbsp;NT</B>, and then click <B>PC-NFS Login</B>.</P>

<P>    2.    In <B>PCNFSD</B>, type the name of the NFS authenticating server. </P>
<P>This can be any computer running NFS, such as a UNIX server for which the user has permissions.</P>
<P>    3.    In <B>Username</B>, type your user name for login purposes.</P>
<P>    4.    In <B>Password</B>, type your password. </P>

<H4 CLASS="h3"><A NAME="sec3"></A>Mounting Remote Resources</H4><P CLASS="t">To mount or connect to a resource, use the Windows&nbsp;NT Explorer. Remote NFS resources mounted through PC-NFS software appear as virtual disk drives on your computer and display as network drives in Windows&nbsp;NT Explorer. </P>
<P CLASS="t"><B>To Mount Remote Resources</B></P>
<P>    1.    Click <B>Start</B>, point to <B>Programs</B>, and then click <B>Windows&nbsp;NT Explorer</B>.</P>
