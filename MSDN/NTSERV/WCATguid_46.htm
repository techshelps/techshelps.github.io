<h3>Changing Client Workloads </h3>
<p>
A client workload consists of a set of pages, also referred to as a transaction. Each page consists of a set of HTTP requests. In a minimal case, the workload might consist of one transaction containing just one request.</p>
<p>
The sample files included with WCAT test different client workloads by varying the number of clients and their queries. You can create custom workload simulations by editing a prepared configuration file or by creating a new configuration file. The data that you change in the configuration is described in &ldquo;Modifying the Configuration File,&rdquo; earlier in this guide.</p>
<p>
Note that you can also use the <b>-m </b>option with the <b>run </b>command at run time to change the number of clients that connect to the controller and send transactions to the server. For information about this option, see &ldquo;Using Command Line Options,&rdquo; earlier in this guide.</p>
<p>
The prepared test Clntload, provided with WCAT, shows an example of how you might vary the client workload. Clntload specifies a variable client workload by running its test multiple times. The controller starts the first test with 4 client computers. Each time the test is run, the number of clients is incremented by 4, up to a maximum of 24. A log file is produced for each test. The log files are named in the format <i>logFilePrefix</i><b>.</b><i>numberOfMachines</i><b>.log </b></p>
