<H2 CLASS="h2">WAN Connections to the Internet</H2><P CLASS="t">The number of options that can be used to connect to the Internet is rapidly changing. Satellite connections are a reality for some enterprises, although a large number of WANs still use public common-carrier telephone lines to provide connectivity to remote users. Because of their established availability for many users, WAN connections to the Internet over public common-carrier telephone lines are the focus of this chapter. </P>
<P CLASS="t">These public common-carrier telephone lines used by remote users for connection are also referred to as <I>public switched telephone networks (PSTNs). </I>PSTNs route users' connection requests to the desired Internet or private intranet server. </P>
<P CLASS="t">To provide access to your Internet Information Server (IIS), you need to provide a link to these telephone networks, by which remote users connect to your Internet Information Server site. This telephone link can terminate at a computer running Internet Information Server, at a computer configured with Windows NT Server and Remote Access Service (RAS) that routes remote clients to an Internet Information Server, or at some other network computer. A typical setup might include a firewall computer, a RAS server, and an Internet Information Server.</P>
