<H3>Changes at Terra Flora</H3><P CLASS="t">Terra Flora was introduced as a fictitious corporation to provide a case study in interoperating heterogeneous networks. Chapter 4, "Terra Flora: A Fictitious Case Study," provided the history of the corporation and presented the plan for interoperability. Chapter 5, "Network Services: Enterprise Level," provided the business justification for selecting Windows NT Server services to interoperate the heterogeneous networks. It also presented specific information on the installation and configuration of Enterprise level services that support the network itself and keep the corporation-wide information synchronized.</P>
<P CLASS="t">Once the networks were interoperating, the network administrators began evaluating the potential for network failure. That evaluation process produced changes to the Terra Flora network diagram. The changes to the network diagram are as follows: </P>
<P></P>
<P>     Chapter 5, "Network Services: Enterprise Level," in the figure, remove all the Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) communication connections except the ISDN link from server EUNTS40DPT01. Replace the T1 communication line going into and out of the server NENTS40ENT02 with two fractional T1 communication lines. Replace the T1 communication line going into and out of server EUNTS40ENT01 with two fractional T1 communication lines. Replace the communication line going into server NENTS40DPT01 with two switched 56 communication lines. </P>
<P>     Appendix F, "Routers and Switches," in Figure F.3, remove all the ISDN communications connections. Add a backup router to network router CABNR10ENT02. Replace the T1 communication line, 1.54 megabits per second (Mbps), connecting the Enterprise router to Boston and on to New York with two fractional T1 communication lines, 128 kilobits per second (Kbps). Replace the switched 56 communications line, 56 Kbps, connecting the NENTS40DIV01 server to the Department with two switched 56 communication lines, 56 Kbps. Replace the T1 communication line, 1.54 Kbps, connecting the Enterprise router to Amsterdam and on to London with two fractional T1 communication lines, 64 Kbps. </P>

<P>     Back cover, "Terra Flora Network Diagram"</P>
<P>     Remove the ISDN connections to the servers NENTS40ENT01, EUNTS40ENT01, and NENTS40DPT02. Remove the ISDN connection to the network routers CABNR10ENT01 and CABNR10ENT02. </P>
<P>     Replace the ISDN communication line from the network router CABNR10ENT01 to the Disaster Recovery Site with Backup Network Link, T1.</P>
<P>     Add a backup router to the network router CABNR10ENT02.</P>
<P>     Replace the T3 communication line, 45 Mbps, between the routers CABNR10ENT01 and CABNR10ENT02 with two T1 communication lines, 1.45 Mbps. </P>
<P>     Replace the T1 communication line, 1.54 Mbps, connecting the Enterprise router CABNR10ENT02 to Boston and on to New York with two fractional T1 communication lines, 128 Kbps. Replace the New York leased line, 128 Kbps, with two fractional T1 communication lines, 128 Kbps.</P>
<P>     Replace the switched 56 communications line, 56 Kbps, connecting the NENTS40DIV01 server to the NENTS40DPT01 server with two switched 56 communication lines, 56 Kbps. </P>
<P>     Replace the T1 communication line, 1.54 Kbps, connecting the Enterprise router CABNR10ENT02 to Amsterdam and on to London with two fractional T1 communication lines, 64 Kbps.</P></BODY></HTML>
