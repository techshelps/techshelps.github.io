<h3>Network Protocols on the Private Enterprise Network</h3>
<p>
PPTP enables you to use virtual private networking over public TCP/IP networks and retain existing network protocols, network node addresses, and naming schemes on the private enterprise network. Thus, no changes to existing network configurations and to network-based applications are required when using PPTP to tunnel across the Internet or other TCP/IP-based public networks. For example, IPX or NetBEUI clients can continue to run applications on the private network that require these protocols.</p>
<p>
Name resolution methods used on the private network&mdash;such as Windows Internet Naming Service (WINS) for NetBIOS computers, Domain Name System (DNS) for TCP/IP host names, and Service Advertisement Protocol (SAP) for IPX networking&mdash;do not need to be changed. In addition, IP addresses that are not valid on the Internet can be used on the private network. </p>
<p>
Note, however, that the address and name resolution schemes on the private enterprise network must be correctly configured. If they are not, PPTP clients are unable to communicate with computers on the private network.</p>
