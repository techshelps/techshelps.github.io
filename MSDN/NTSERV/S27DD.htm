<H2 CLASS="h2">Do You Need Additional Bandwidth?</H2><P CLASS="t">Bandwidth requirements can change monthly, weekly, daily, and even hourly. Use the estimation methods described in the preceding section whether you are planning a future Internet Information Server site or evaluating the bandwidth requirements of an existing site. You can tune and adjust your bandwidth estimates if the number of remote users connecting to your site exceeds your estimates, if connection response time increases, or if the number of rejected connections increases.</P>
<P></P>
<P CLASS="t">If your bandwidth estimates exceed the bandwidth provided by your connection to the Internet, you can do any of the following: </P>
<P>     Increase the connection bandwidth with improved line services from your ISP or telephone company. </P>
<P>     Reduce the services provided by the Internet Information Server.</P>
<P>     Reduce the number of remote clients that simultaneously connect to the Internet Information Server services, by modifying the value of the <B>MaxConnections</B> parameter as described in "Troubleshooting Bandwidth for Internet Connections," later in this chapter.</P>
<P>     Reduce the amount of network bandwidth that the Internet Information Server can use, by modifying the value of the <B>BandwidthLevel</B> parameter as described in "Troubleshooting Bandwidth for Internet Connections," later in this chapter.</P>
<P></P>
<P CLASS="t">If your bandwidth estimates indicate that you have adequate bandwidth on your Internet connection, but remote users are experiencing connectivity problems, examine the configuration of your Internet Information Server. Connectivity problems can be caused by computer configuration problems including inadequate processor or memory capacity. </P>
<P CLASS="t">If you are experiencing connectivity problems, use Performance Monitor to identify the cause of the symptoms. For information about using Performance Monitor with Internet Information Server, see Chapter 7, "Monitoring Bandwidth and Network Capacity." See also "Troubleshooting Bandwidth for Internet Connections," later in this chapter.</P></BODY></HTML>
