<H2 CLASS="h1">Interoperability Using NBF</H2><P CLASS="t">NBF provides compatibility with computers running under the earlier operating systems of Microsoft LAN Manager and MS-Net, and IBM LAN Server. NBF can be used to connect LAN workstation and server computers, and to connect remote and dial-up clients, including laptop computers, to computers running the Windows&nbsp;NT-based RAS.</P>
<P CLASS="t">NBF can be used with programs that implement a variety of services based on the following application programming interfaces (APIs): </P>
<UL><LI>NetBIOS</LI><LI>Named Pipes</LI><LI>Mailslot</LI><LI>Network DDE (dynamic data exchange)</LI><LI>Remote Procedure Call (RPC) over NetBIOS</LI><LI>RPC over Named Pipes</LI></UL><P CLASS="t">NBF is most efficient when used for computers connecting to small to medium-sized, single-location networks. NBF is not a routable protocol like TCP/IP or IPX, although NBF does support a form of routing known as Token Ring routing, available only on IBM Token Ring networks. Additionally, NBF uses a single part naming scheme that does not support network segmentation used in most large networks.</P></BODY></HTML>
