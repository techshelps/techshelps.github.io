<H2 CLASS="h1">Browser System Components</H2><P CLASS="t">The Browser<B> </B>system consists of two components, the Browser service and the datagram receiver.</P>
<P CLASS="t">The Browser service is the user-mode portion of the Browser system and is responsible for maintaining the browse list, sending the API requests, and managing the various browser roles that a computer can have. </P>
<P CLASS="t">The Browser service actually resides within the Service Controller process (Lmsvcs.exe) and can be found under \&lt;<I>winnt_root</I>&gt;\system32. The Browser service is located in the registry path under the following key.</P>
<P CLASS="t"><B>\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\Browser</B></P>
<P CLASS="t">The datagram receiver is the kernel-mode portion of the Browser system and is simply a datagram and mailslot receiver. It receives directed and broadcast datagrams that are of interest to the Windows&nbsp;NT Workstation and Windows&nbsp;NT Server services. The datagram receiver also provides kernel-level support for the <B>NetServerEnum</B> API, support for remote mailslot reception (second-class, datagram-based, mailslot messages), and the request-announcement services.</P>
<P CLASS="t">In Windows&nbsp;NT 3.5 and later, the datagram receiver is implemented in the Windows&nbsp;NT redirector (Rdr.sys). In Windows&nbsp;NT 3.1, there is a separate driver, Browser.sys, for the datagram receiver.</P></BODY></HTML>
