<H3 CLASS="h2">Adding Multihomed Devices by Using #MH</H3><P CLASS="t">A multihomed device is a computer with multiple network interface cards (NICs). A multihomed device can be defined by a single, unique name with which multiple IP addresses are associated.</P>
<P CLASS="t">You can provide multihomed name-to-IP-address mappings in the LMHOSTS file by creating entries that are specified by using the keyword #MH. An #MH entry associates a single, unique NetBIOS computer name to an IP address. You can create multiple entries for the same NetBIOS computer name for each NIC in the multihomed device, up to a maximum of 25 different IP addresses for the same name. </P>
<P CLASS="t">The format of the LMHOSTS entry that is used to specify name-to-IP-address mappings for multihomed devices is the same as the other keyword entries. For example, the entries required to map name to IP address for a multihomed device with two NICs are:</P>
