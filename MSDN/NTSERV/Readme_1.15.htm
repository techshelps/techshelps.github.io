<P>1.15  POSIX Source Code</P>
</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2><P>The \SOURCE\POSIX directory contains the C language source code to the POSIX utilities that are shipped with the <I>Windows NT Resource Kit</I>. This source code and the POSIX utility binaries are not supported by Microsoft and have not undergone formal testing. If they do not work correctly and you are a proficient C programmer, you may be able to fix any bugs yourself. Consult the <I>Win32 Software Development Kit for Windows NT</I> for background information on building POSIX programs. </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<B><P>To install the POSIX source code:</P>
<P>·</B>  At the command prompt, type the following lines:</P>
<P>&#9;<B>xcopy</B> <I>cd_driveletter:</I><B>\source\posix c:\posix /s /e /i</P>
<P>&#9;c:</P>
</B><P>&#9;<B>cd \posix</P>
<P>&#9;longname</P>
</B><P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Notice that the partition to which you copy the source code must have the NTFS file system. Also, from the directory to which you copied all the source code, you must run the LONGNAME.BAT file before attempting to compile any of the utilities. This batch file renames many of the files to their correct name, which is often longer than the standard 8.3 filename. If you do not run this batch file, the utilities will not compile correctly.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The following utilities may require code changes to make them work on RISC-based computers: AR.EXE, CC.EXE, DEVSRV.EXE, LD.EXE, MAKE.EXE. For example, CC.EXE invokes "CL386" to compile other programs; on RISC-based computers, you must change the code to invoke the proper compiler.</P>
