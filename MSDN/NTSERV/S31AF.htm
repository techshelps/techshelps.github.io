<H2 CLASS="h1">Using Network Client</H2><P CLASS="t">MS-DOS users can issue Network Client commands by using the pop-up interface or by typing commands at the MS-DOS command prompt.</P>
<P CLASS="t">If you use the pop-up interface, you don't have to remember the syntax for the equivalent Network Client command at the MS-DOS command prompt. The pop-up interface also allows you to view your current connections, browse for shared resources, and make new connections in an easy-to-use environment. It is a character-based utility; you must use the keyboard rather than a mouse.</P>
<P CLASS="t">Experienced MS-DOS users who are familiar with Network Client commands may prefer to type commands at the MS-DOS command prompt rather than using the pop-up interface.</P></BODY></HTML>
