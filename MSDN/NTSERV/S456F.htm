<H3 CLASS="h2">Internet Service and Providers</H3><P CLASS="t">You establish a connection to the Internet by leasing a line from an Internet service provider (ISP) or a telephone company. Your provider installs a cable at your site that is plugged into the network interface card (NIC) in your computer. Usually, a router is also installed between your computer and the ISP. </P>
<P CLASS="t">The services available on the Internet vary widely. The basic services required by Internet clients and servers are:</P>
<UL><LI>An Internet gateway (default gateway).</LI><LI>IP addresses and subnet mask.</LI></UL><P CLASS="t">An Internet service provider must provide the required services and often provides optional Internet services, such as DNS name resolution, domain name registration, electronic mail, and Internet news. </P>
<P CLASS="t">It is important to note that not all ISPs are alike; you need to find out their capabilities. Some questions to ask an ISP can include:</P>
<UL><LI>How are you connected to the Internet (backbone)? (For example, a T1, multiple T1s, or a T3 connection.)</LI><LI>What type of dedicated access do you offer? (For example, Frame Relay or shared T1.) Do you guarantee a minimum bandwidth?</LI><LI>Do you offer dial-up access to allow connections through telephone modems?</LI><LI>Do you offer Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) access?</LI><LI>What type of security do you offer?</LI><LI>What are your installation costs for each type of connection?</LI><LI>What are your monthly costs for each type of connection?</LI></UL><P CLASS="t">Internet service providers are local, regional, or national providers. Local ISPs are connected to the Internet through larger ISPs or through a regional network. Local ISPs usually have only one location. The larger regional and national ISPs have multiple locations. If your site has enough traffic to require a high-speed T3 line (45 megabits per second) to your ISP, consider connecting directly to a regional network.</P>
<P CLASS="t">Regional networks are sites selected by the National Science Foundation (NSF) to provide a common connection point to the Internet. Regional networks connect to other regional networks at 155&nbsp;megabits per second through a backbone carrier—such as US Sprint, MCI MAIL, or AT&amp;T.</P>
<P CLASS="t">Companies that require a large bandwidth for their Internet sites can connect directly to a regional network. Requirements vary by regional network provider, but usually a T3 line is the minimum bandwidth of a connection. For more details, contact the vendor who operates your local regional network.</P>
<P CLASS="t">The Microsoft Network (MSN&trade;) is an Internet service provider. You can find other Internet service providers listed in your local phone book (usually under "computer network services"). Internet service providers also frequently advertise in local newspapers or computer magazines.</P></BODY></HTML>
