<h3>HTTP Keep-Alive Tests</h3>
<p>
HTTP keep-alive tests are modified versions of the basic, CGI, and ISAPI WCAT tests. During HTTP keep-alive tests, clients request the same files at the same rates as in the standard versions of the tests but request their connections be maintained by using the HTTP keep-alive feature. HTTP keep-alive tests are used to measure the effect of HTTP keep-alives. </p>
<p>
HTTP keep-alives are enabled by default in HTTP version 1.1. HTTP implements keep-alives to avoid the substantial cost of establishing and terminating connections. Both the WCAT client and server must support HTTP keep-alives. </p>
<p>
The HTTP keep-alive versions of the WCAT tests are named Ka.<i>testname</i>, where <i>testname</i> represents the name of the standard version of the test. For example, the HTTP keep-alive version of the CGI25 test is called Ka.CGI25. HTTP keep-alive versions are provided for all WCAT tests except for 1K, 1ktest01.50m, and 1ktest01.200m.</p>
<h3>SSL Tests</h3>
<p>
SSL tests are modified versions of the basic, CGI, and ISAPI WCAT tests. During SSL tests, clients request the same files at the same rates as in the standard versions of the tests but use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption protocol. SSL tests are provided to help you measure the effect of SSL encryption on server performance. </p>
<p>
SSL versions of the WCAT tests are named Ssl.<i>testname</i>, where <i>testname</i> represents the name of the standard version of the test. For example, the SSL version of the Cgi25 test is called Ssl.cgi25. SSL versions are provided for all WCAT tests except for 1K, 1ktest01.50m, and 1ktest01.200m.</p>
