<H2 CLASS="h1">Replication and Backup Services</H2><P CLASS="t">At Terra Flora, the Windows&nbsp;NT Replication service will be used to ensure that all crucial Enterprise level databases are replicated to other computers running Windows&nbsp;NT Server. These include WINS and DNS. </P>
<P CLASS="t">Terra Flora has elected to use a flexible back up strategy for the data that exists on their servers, at all levels. Third party software will be incorporated for online backups and to protect master copies of distributed databases and other software. </P>
<P CLASS="t">The business reasons for replicating and backing up the business applications and databases are fairly obvious, to protect the business critical applications and ensure that should servers fail, recovery is quick and accurate.</P></BODY></HTML>
