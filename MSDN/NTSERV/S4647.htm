<H3 CLASS="h2">Administration </H3><P CLASS="t">ITG has sole authority to establish a trust relationship between the master domains and another domain on the Microsoft corporate network. ITG can administer all servers running Windows&nbsp;NT Server in a trust relationship within the Microsoft domains structure. Microsoft ITG uses the following criteria to establish a trust relationship with a second-tier domain.</P>
<UL><LI>Any product-development group is eligible to create one second-tier domain with trust relationships to the master account domains until every defined development business unit has a second-tier domain. </LI></UL><P>For example, Apps-Word, Apps-Excel, Sys-WFW, or Sys-WinNT are second-tier domains.</P>
<UL><LI>Every site outside the Redmond campus is eligible to create one resource domain with trust relationships with the master account domains. </LI></UL><P>For example, USA-Atlanta, USA-Chicago, FRA-Paris, and GER-Munich are resources domains.</P>
<UL><LI>ITG uses a standard administrative account that is part of the second-tier Domain Administrators group. </LI></UL><P>This enables ITG to perform administrative duties and assist the domain administrator when needed. It also enables ITG to perform backups of domain servers.</P></BODY></HTML>
