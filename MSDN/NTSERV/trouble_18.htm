<h3>Verifying Your Configuration</h3>
<p>
If you have problems connecting to a PPTP server, make sure that you have correctly configured your PPTP client. </p>
<p>
This section provides a list of steps you should take to make sure you have correctly configured your PPTP client. If you still cannot connect to a PPTP server, see the section &ldquo;Troubleshooting Your PPTP Connection.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
Verify the following:</p>
<p>
<font face="Symbol">&#183;</font> Make sure your workstation and its applications support the protocols native to the target network (the network you will be tunneling to).</p>
<p>
<font face="Symbol">&#183;</font> If you are tunneling through the Internet, make sure your Internet connection is working properly.</p>
<p>
<font face="Symbol">&#183;</font> In Dial-Up Networking, make sure that you have configured at least one VPN connection to a PPTP server.</p>
<p>
<font face="Symbol">&#183;</font> In Dial-Up Networking, check your VPN connection to make sure that you have selected <b>Microsoft VPN Adapter</b>.</p>
<p>
<font face="Symbol">&#183;</font> Make sure you have a valid account on the PPTP server.</p>
<p>
<font face="Symbol">&#183;</font> In Dial-Up Networking, check your VPN connection to make sure that you have entered either the host name or IP address of your PPTP server.</p>
<p>
<font face="Symbol">&#183;</font> In Dial-Up Networking, check your VPN connection to make sure it includes all the protocols used on the target network.</p>
<p>
<font face="Symbol">&#183;</font> If the target network uses TCP/IP, check your VPN connection to make sure the TCP/IP settings are correctly configured for the target network.</p>
<p>
<font face="Symbol">&#183;</font> If you are making two connections, make sure the second connection is a VPN connection.</p>
