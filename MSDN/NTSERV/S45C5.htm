<H3 CLASS="h2">Security Considerations When Using SMTP/POP3 </H3><P CLASS="t">Windows&nbsp;NT provides built-in security that controls:</P>
<UL><LI>User account access based on user names and passwords.</LI><LI>File and directory access, permissions, and operations.</LI><LI>User operations based on user and group policies.</LI></UL><P></P>
<P CLASS="t">Windows&nbsp;NT security provides a high level of security both for stand-alone computers and for Windows&nbsp;NT–based networks. However, the <B>MailSrv</B> tool uses only the clear-text password authentication of POP3. Passwords are sent over the network in readable (clear) format and are not encrypted. Administrators must plan for security on networks that use the <B>MailSrv</B> tool. They must consider the potential for unauthorized users acquiring passwords and subsequent malicious tampering with Internet communications. </P>
<P CLASS="t">You can use the classification of Internet communications in Table 7.2 to identify your enterprise security requirements when using SMTP/POP3. For additional information on security, see Chapter 3, "Server Security on the Internet." </P>
