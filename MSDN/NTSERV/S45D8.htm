<H3 CLASS="h2">Object-Based Computing</H3><P CLASS="t">Software<I> objects</I> are a combination of computer instructions and data that models the behavior of things, real or imagined, in the world. Objects are composed of the following elements.</P>
<UL><LI>Attributes, in the form of program variables, which collectively define the object's state</LI><LI>Behavior, in the form of code modules or methods that can modify those attributes</LI><LI>An identity that distinguishes one object from all others</LI></UL><P CLASS="t">Objects interact with each other by passing messages back and forth. The sending object is known as the <I>client</I> and the receiving object is known as the <I>server</I>. The client requests, and the server responds. In the course of conversation, the client and server roles often alternate between objects. Windows&nbsp;NT is not an object-oriented system in the strictest sense, but it does use objects to represent internal system resources.</P>
<P CLASS="t">Windows&nbsp;NT uses an object metaphor that is pervasive throughout the architecture of the system. When viewed using Windows&nbsp;NT, all of the following appear as ordinary objects.</P>
<UL><LI>Devices, such as printers, tape drives, keyboards, and terminal screens</LI><LI>Processes and threads</LI><LI>Shared memory segments</LI><LI>Access rights</LI></UL></BODY></HTML>
