<H2 CLASS="h1">Network Logon Services</H2><P CLASS="t">At Terra Flora, the logon services provided by the Windows&nbsp;NT operating system were selected to provide centralized network logon. This decision was made because Windows&nbsp;NT Server is the only product that provides the capability to log onto all the heterogeneous networks at Terra Flora. The Windows&nbsp;NT Server product provides users with the capability to sign onto all appropriate network resources using a single user account and password. </P>

<P>Password synchronization between network operating system platforms is not automatic for all platforms, but is a future technology for Windows&nbsp;NT Server (ODSI). </P></BODY></HTML>
