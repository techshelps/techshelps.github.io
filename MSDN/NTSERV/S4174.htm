<H2 CLASS="h1">Windows&nbsp;NT Server Domains</H2><P CLASS="t">A <I>domain</I> is a logical grouping of network servers and other computers that share common security and user-account information. Within domains, administrators create one user account for each user. Users then log on to the domain, not to individual servers in the domain.</P>
<P CLASS="t">The term <I>domain</I> does not refer to a single location or specific type of network configuration. Computers in a single domain can share physical proximity on a small LAN or can be located in different parts of the world. They communicate over any of various physical connections, such as dial-up lines, ISDN, fiber, Ethernet, token ring, frame relay, satellite, and leased lines.</P>
<P CLASS="t">The domain structure provides the following advantages for maintaining a secure network:</P>
<UL><LI>Single Logon Procedure</LI></UL><P>Network users can connect to multiple servers by logging on to a single network.</P>
<UL><LI>Universal Resource Access</LI></UL><P>The user needs only one domain user account and password to use network resources. </P>
<UL><LI>Centralized Network Administration</LI></UL><P>A centralized view of the entire network from any workstation on the network provides the ability to track and manage information on users, groups, and resources in a distributed network. This single point of administration for multiple servers simplifies the management of a Windows&nbsp;NT Server – based network.</P>
