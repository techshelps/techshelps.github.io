<H2 CLASS="h2">Monitoring the IIS Object Cache</H2><P CLASS="t">The IIS service maintains the IIS Object Cache, a cache of objects that the HTTP, FTP, and Gopher services use frequently. The Object Cache is also used for objects that are hard to retrieve. The IIS Object Cache is designed to improve the performance of Internet Information Server by keeping these objects readily available to the process. The primary components of the IIS Object Cache are open file object handles and directory listings, but the cache also stores parsed Internet Database Connector queries and their responses, as well as other service-specific objects. </P>
<P CLASS="t">This section describes the IIS Object Cache and suggest methods of monitoring its size and efficiency.</P></BODY></HTML>
