<UL><LI>Suppose another employee, JeffH, wants to access a shared directory on \\Products but has no account on that domain. He is allowed access to this resource through the Guest account for \\Products and receives the associated permissions.</LI><LI>Suppose AnnM is logged on to a Windows&nbsp;NT domain with the password <B>Yippee.</B> She wants to connect to the shared directory on \\Products, where her password is <B>Hooray</B>. Because there is an account for AnnM, she is not allowed to gain access by using the Guest account. Instead, Windows&nbsp;NT prompts AnnM for the valid password on \\Products.</LI></UL></BODY></HTML>
