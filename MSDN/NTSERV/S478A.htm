<H3 CLASS="h2">Using Multiple Network Adapters and Protocols with Windows&nbsp;95</H3><P CLASS="t">If the client has multiple network adapters, only one should have a RPL ROM. When you configure the client's workstation record in Remoteboot Manager, specify a profile corresponding to the network adapter with the RPL ROM.</P>
<P CLASS="t">You need NetBEUI and DLC connectivity to the remoteboot server in order to set up and boot a Windows&nbsp;95 client. The network adapters and protocols defined in Windows&nbsp;95 Setup become active once the Windows&nbsp;95 real-mode client is booted. You no longer need NetBEUI or DLC at this phase, as long as you can access the SBS server and the shared directory containing your machine directory.</P></BODY></HTML>
