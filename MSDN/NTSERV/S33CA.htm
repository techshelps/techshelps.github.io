<H1 CLASS="title">Chapter 1 - Deploying Windows&nbsp;NT Server </H1><P CLASS="t">Windows&nbsp;NT Server can be deployed to a large number of computers in the same way that Windows&nbsp;NT Workstation is deployed. The tools and techniques for doing so are described in Part 1, "About Windows&nbsp;NT Server" and Appendix A, "Answer Files and UDFs" of the <I>Windows&nbsp;NT Workstation 4.0 Resource Guide</I>.</P>
<P CLASS="t">There are some issues to be considered when deploying Windows&nbsp;NT Server that are not a factor in deploying Windows&nbsp;NT Workstation. These include which licensing mode to use, whether the server is to be a domain controller, and server-specific services that you might want to install.</P>
<P CLASS="t">Answer files and Uniqueness Database Files (UDFs) provide most of the tools you need for specifying options while deploying Windows&nbsp;NT Server. These are described in Chapter 2, "Customizing Setup" and Appendix A, "Answer Files and UDFs" of the <I>Windows&nbsp;NT Workstation 4.0 Resource Guide</I>. In particular, see the end of Appendix A for answer file entries that apply only to Windows&nbsp;NT Server.</P></BODY></HTML>
