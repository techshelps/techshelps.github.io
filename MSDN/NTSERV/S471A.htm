<H2 CLASS="h1">Using Performance Monitor</H2><P CLASS="t">The Windows&nbsp;NT Server and Windows&nbsp;NT Workstation Performance Monitor can be used to view many different TCP/IP-related counters. Because it accesses statistics that have been gathered by the SNMP service, the SNMP service must be installed on Windows&nbsp;NT-based computers where TCP/IP statistics are to be monitored. Performance Monitor counters are available for NIC, IP, ICMP, UDP, TCP, and NetBT. </P>
<P CLASS="t">One of the features of Performance Monitor is that it allows counters from various systems to be monitored from a single management window. It also supports setting alert levels for the counters being monitored. </P></BODY></HTML>
