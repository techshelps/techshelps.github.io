<h2>PPTP and Virtual Private Networking</h2>
<p>
The PPTP protocol is included with the Windows NT® Server version 4.0 and Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 operating systems, and a beta version is available as an add-on for the Windows® 95 operating system. Computers running these operating systems can use the PPTP protocol to securely connect to a private network as a remote access client by using a public data network such as the Internet. In other words, PPTP enables on-demand, virtual private networks over the Internet or other public TCP/IP-based data networks. PPTP can also be used by computers connected to a LAN to create a virtual private network across the LAN. </p>
<p>
An important feature in the use of PPTP is its support for virtual private networking through public-switched telephone networks (PSTNs). PPTP simplifies and reduces the cost of deploying an enterprise-wide, remote access solution for remote or mobile users because it provides secure and encrypted communications over public telephone lines and the Internet. PPTP eliminates the need for expensive, leased-line or private enterprise-dedicated communication servers because you can use PPTP over PSTN lines. </p>
<p>
Generally, there are three computers involved in every PPTP deployment:</p>
<p>
<font face="Symbol">&#183;</font>a PPTP client </p>
<p>
<font face="Symbol">&#183;</font>a network access server </p>
<p>
<font face="Symbol">&#183;</font>a PPTP server</p>
<p>
However, if you are creating a PPTP tunnel between a PPTP client and a PPTP server that are both connected to the same LAN, you do not need a network access server.</p>
<p>
The following section describes a typical PPTP scenario using these computers and explains how they relate to each other, It also fully defines each of these components.</p>
