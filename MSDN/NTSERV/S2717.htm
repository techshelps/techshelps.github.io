<H2 CLASS="h2">Windows NT Server Networking Guide</H2><P CLASS="t">The following changes were made to the <I>Windows NT Server Networking Guide</I>:</P>
<P>     Chapter 1, "Windows NT Networking Architecture"</P>
<P>     Figure 1.1 has been changed to clarify that the Microkernel and HAL are not Windows NT Executive Services.</P>
<P>     Replace the second paragraph under the heading "Remote Access Service" with the information following:</P>
<P>The distinctions between RAS and remote control solutions (such as Cubix and pcANYWHERE) are important:</P>
<P>     RAS is a software-based multi-protocol router; remote control solutions work by sharing screen, keyboard, and mouse over the remote link.</P>
<P>     In a remote control solution, users share a CPU or multiple CPUs on the server. The RAS server's CPU is dedicated to communications, not to running applications.</P>
<P>     Replace the entire section under the heading "Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol" with the information following:</P>
<P>A RAS server is usually connected to a PSTN, ISDN, or X.25 network, allowing remote users to access a server through these networks. RAS now allows remote users access through the Internet by using the new Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol (PPTP).</P>
<P>PPTP is a new networking technology that supports multiprotocol virtual private networks (VPNs), enabling remote users to access corporate networks securely across the Internet by dialing into an Internet Service Provider (ISP) or by connecting directly to the Internet. For more information, see the<I> Microsoft Windows NT Server Networking Supplement</I>, Chapter 11, "Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol (PPTP)."</P>
<P>     Chapter 2, "Network Security and Domain Planning," In the first sentence under the heading "Using a RAS-connected BDC as a PDC," replace the words "dial-out-only RAS client" with the words "dial-up networking client." In the next sentence, replace the words "RAS-connected client" with the words "dial-up networking client." </P>
<P>     Chapter 5, "Network Services: Enterprise Level"</P>
<P>    Replace the heading in the middle of the page, "Windows 95 Clients to Windows NT servers," with the heading "Windows 95 Clients Authenticating to Windows NT Servers."</P>
<P>    In the next to last paragraph, change the reference "<I>Windows NT Server Services for Macintosh"</I> to "<I>Windows NT Server Networking Supplement."</I></P>
<P>    In the first paragraph under the heading "Secure Access to Corporate Networks over the Internet," in the first line, delete the word "a" that precedes "PPTP" and the word "driver" that follows "PPTP." Also, in the first line, change the word "driver" that follows the word "WAN" to "protocol." The amended first line reads "A RAS client that has PPTP as its WAN protocol can access resources on a remote LAN by connecting to a Windows NT RAS server through the Internet." In the second line of the second paragraph, delete the word "The" that precedes the word "PPTP" and the word "driver" that follows "PPTP." </P>
<P></P>
<P>    Under the heading "Installing PPTP," replace the first sentence with "You must have the PPTP protocol installed on the RAS servers and on the client or communications servers." Change Step 4 of the procedure "To Install PPTP" to "Select Point-to-Point Protocol, and then click <B>Add</B>." Change Step 8 to "RAS setup will start and add the PPTP protocol to RAS." Also, delete "DNS" from the sentence following the procedure. </P>
<P>     Chapter 6, "TCP/IP Implementation Details"</P>
<P>    Delete the second bulleted item "Point-Point Tunneling Protocol (PPTP)."</P>
<P>    In the first paragraph, second line, replace "RAS clients" with "dial-up networking clients." In the second paragraph, fifth line, replace "RAS client" with "dial-up networking client." Replace the heading "RAS Clients" with "Dial-Up Clients." In the paragraph before the paragraph introducing the route table, last sentence, change "Windows NT workstation" to "computer running Windows NT Workstation or Windows NT Server." </P>
<P>     Chapter 8, "Managing Microsoft WINS Servers," remove the two paragraphs following Table 8.10. </P>
<P>     Chapter 9, "Managing Microsoft DNS Servers" </P>
<P>    Change the World Wide Web address for the Internet Network Information Center (InterNIC) from (<B>http://www.internic.com</B>) to (<B>http://www.internic.net</B>).</P>
<P>    Add the following line to the end of the first Note: "This is done to support BIND versions earlier than BIND version 4.94."</P>
<P>    Change the heading "Cache Files" to "Cache File."</P>
<P>    Fifth paragraph, replace "DSN" in the next to the last line of the paragraph with "DNS." </P>
<P>    First paragraph, last sentence, delete the word "Microsoft" preceding DHCP. In Step 5 of the procedure on that page, delete the sentence "Unresolved host name queries will then be passed to a DNS server." </P>
<P></P>
<P>    In the procedure "To clear the Microsoft DNS server statistics by using the dnsstat command," in Step 2, change "<B>dnstat</B>" to "<B>dnsstat</B>"</P>
<P>    Change the heading near the bottom of the page from "Zone Wizard Did Not Correctly Autocreate SOA, NS or a Record" to "Zone Wizard Did Not Correctly Autocreate SOA, NS, or A Record."</P>
<P>    </P></BODY></HTML>
