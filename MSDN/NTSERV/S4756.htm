<H3 CLASS="h2">NBF Dynamically Allocates Memory </H3><P CLASS="t">A Windows&nbsp;NT-based computer running NBF automatically allocates the memory necessary to process the requests made by session clients. This means that NBF uses memory only when needed. For example, on a Windows&nbsp;NT-based computer that does not have an active network connection, very little memory will be used by the NBF protocol stack.</P>
<P CLASS="t">Because of this dynamic memory management, installing NBF on a Windows&nbsp;NT-based computer is easily done. It does not require additional configuration for number of sessions, packets, or buffers. </P></BODY></HTML>
