<H1 CLASS="title">Appendix A - TCP/IP Utilities Reference</H1><P CLASS="t">This appendix is a reference for using Microsoft TCP/IP utilities, which are diagnostic and connectivity utilities for network and connectivity administration. These client utilities are provided for file transfer, terminal emulation, and network diagnostics. </P>
<P CLASS="t"><I>Diagnostic commands</I> help you detect TCP/IP networking problems. <I>Connectivity commands</I> enable users to interact with and use resources on Microsoft hosts and non-Microsoft hosts such as UNIX workstations. The following commands are included:</P>
<UL><LI>Diagnostic commands: <B>arp</B>,<B> hostname</B>,<B> ipconfig</B>,<B> lpq</B>,<B> nbtstat</B>, <B>netstat</B>,<B> ping</B>,<B> route</B>,<B> </B>and <B>tracert</B></LI></UL><UL><LI>Connectivity commands: <B>finger</B>,<B> ftp</B>,<B> lpr</B>,<B> rcp</B>,<B> rexec</B>,<B> rsh</B>,<B> telnet</B>,<B> </B>and <B>tftp</B></LI></UL><P></P>
<P></P>
<P CLASS="t"><B>Important</B></P>
<P>All passwords used by Windows networking services are encrypted. However, the <B>ftp</B>, <B>ftpsvc</B>, <B>rexec</B>, and <B>telnet</B> connectivity utilities all rely on clear-text password authentication by the remote computer. Clear-text passwords are not encrypted before being sent over the network. This enables another user equipped with a network analyzer on the same network to steal a user's remote account password. For this reason, it is strongly recommended that users of these utilities choose different passwords than their Windows&nbsp;NT-based workgroup, workstation, or domain for the passwords used on non-Microsoft remote computers to which they connect by using the <B>ftp</B>, <B>ftpsvc</B>, <B>rexec</B>, and <B>telnet</B> utilities. </P>

<P CLASS="t"><B>Note</B></P>
<P>Switches used in the syntax for TCP/IP commands are case-sensitive. For example, for <B>nbtstat</B>, the switch <B>-R</B> has a different effect from the <B>-r </B>switch.</P>
