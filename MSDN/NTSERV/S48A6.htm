This menu allows you to select a hardware profile

<P CLASS="t">You can also select between the Last Known Good Configuration and the Default Configuration. Windows&nbsp;NT automatically uses the Default Configuration if you do not select the Last Known Good Configuration. When you use the Default Configuration, the boot loader uses the Registry information that Windows&nbsp;NT saved at the last shutdown.</P>
<P CLASS="t">If you switch to the Last Known Good Configuration by pressing L and ENTER, the boot loader uses the Registry information that it saved at the completion of the last successful startup to configure this startup.</P>
