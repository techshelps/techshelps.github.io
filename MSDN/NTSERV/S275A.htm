<H2 CLASS="h2">Remote Performance Monitoring</H2><P CLASS="t">Windows&nbsp;NT&nbsp;4.0 includes increased security features to protect the Registry from unwarranted remote access. These new features can prevent users who are not administrators from using Performance Monitor to monitor a Windows&nbsp;NT 4.0 Server from another computer.</P>
<P CLASS="t">This section includes recommended changes to your configuration to allow remote performance monitoring without compromising the security of Registry data. It assumes that you are familiar with the Windows NT Registry structure and with the basic security features of Windows NT.</P>
<P CLASS="t">For general information about security for remote Registry access, see "Remote Access to the Registry," earlier in this appendix.</P>
