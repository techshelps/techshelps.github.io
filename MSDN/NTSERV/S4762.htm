<H3 CLASS="h2">Using Windows NT NetBEUI in IBM LAN Server Networks</H3><P CLASS="t">In general, NBF has no receive window, unless it detects that the remote sending computer is running a version of IBM NetBEUI which does not use network polling—for example, IBM LAN Server. NBF initiates a link with a remote computer in the same manner as IBM NetBEUI; however, NBF looks for a <I>poll</I> bit in received frames. If a frame is received that does not have the poll bit set, the Windows&nbsp;NT-based computer will wait until T2 expires before sending a frame ACK.</P>
<P CLASS="t"><B>Note</B></P>
<P>When the poll bit is set in a received frame, NBF ignores the receive window and immediately sends an ACK.</P>
<P CLASS="t">For example, an IBM LAN Server computer is a non-polling system that may have a send window set to 1. If this the case, the registry parameter <B>MaxIncomingFrames</B> should be decreased from its default of 2 to 1. If not, the non-Windows&nbsp;NT-based computer will wait for an ACK from the Windows&nbsp;NT-based computer, which in this case will be sent only when the T2 time limit expires.</P>
<P CLASS="t">NBF uses a receive window based on the value of <B>MaximumIncomingFrames </B>in the Registry. The default value for <B>MaximumIncomingFrames</B> is 2, and this value does<I> not</I> dynamically change. It must be manually changed by changing the parameter default value in the Registry.</P>
<P CLASS="t"><B>Note</B></P>
<P>When a Windows&nbsp;NT-based computer is using the <B>MaxIncomingFrames</B> receive window, it may not always send an acknowledgment frame after receiving exactly <B>MaxIncomingFrames</B> packets. This is because NBF will also wait until it receives an NDIS <B>ProtocolReceiveComplete</B> before sending the ACK. However, when the Windows&nbsp;NT-based computer receives POLL frames, it will ACK immediately (typically on return from <B>NdisTransferData</B> (synchronous communications) or within <B>ProtocolTransferDataComplete</B> (asynchronous communications).</P></BODY></HTML>
