<H3 CLASS="h2">Network Client Will Not Start After a Successful Setup</H3><P CLASS="t">If Network Client won't start after you complete Setup, try the following steps to solve the problem: </P>
<UL><LI>Make sure that all cables and connectors are securely fastened and that the network adapter is securely in its slot. </LI><LI>If the network adapter came with a diagnostics program, try running the program. For more information, see the documentation that came with the network adapter. </LI><LI>Run the <B>net diag</B> command. You can use <B>net diag</B> to test a specific connection with another computer or you can use <B>net diag /status</B> to see the status of your own network adapter. For information, type <B>net help diag</B> at the MS-DOS command prompt.</LI><LI>If you are using an external transceiver, specify the correct setting. For more information, see the following section, "Specifying an External Transceiver."</LI><LI>Make sure the correct base memory address and interrupt request (IRQ) settings are specified for the network adapter. For more information, see "Checking and Changing Network-Adapter Settings," later in this chapter.</LI><LI>Make sure the <B>device</B> command for EMM386 in your Config.sys file excludes the memory address used by your network adapter. For more information, see "Making Sure EMM386 Doesn't Conflict with the Network Adapter," later in this chapter. </LI><LI>Make sure the network adapter is on the list provided in Setup. If your network adapter is not on this list, you might be able to get it to work by using a generic setting. For more information, see the Setup instructions earlier in this chapter. </LI><LI>Make sure the network adapter is using a different interrupt (IRQ) than the mouse. For more information about determining what interrupt to assign to the network adapter, see the documentation that came with the network adapter. </LI><LI>If you are using the NWLink (IPX/SPX-compatible) protocol, make sure the network adapter is set for the proper network topology type. NWLink supports Ethernet network adapters only on 802.2 topology and token ring and FDDI network adapters only on 802.3 topology.</LI><LI>You might need to change the network adapter's configuration settings. If you have an ISA adapter that is configured by using jumpers and switches, you might need to change their positions or settings. If you have a software-configured adapter, use the configuration program that came with the network adapter to change your settings. For more information, see the documentation that came with the network adapter. </LI></UL></BODY></HTML>
