<H3 CLASS="h2">Host Name Resolution </H3><P CLASS="t">A DNS server or the HOSTS file is used when you use the TCP/IP utilities, such as <B>ping</B>. You can find the HOSTS file in the winnt\system32\drivers\etc directory. This file is <I>not</I> dynamic; entries are made manually. The format of the file is the following:</P>
<P CLASS="t">IP Address         Friendly Name</P>
<P CLASS="spacing"><BR></P>

<H4 CLASS="h3"><A NAME="sec0"></A>Host Name Resolution Using a HOSTS File</H4><P CLASS="t">The general process that occurs when using the HOSTS file for name resolution is summarized in the following steps.</P>
<P>    1.    Computer A enters a command using the host name of Computer B.</P>
<P>    2.    The HOSTS file on Computer A (in the \Systemroot\System32\Drivers\Etc directory) is parsed. When the host name of Computer B is found, it is resolved to an IP address.</P>
<P>    3.    The Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) is then used to resolve the IP address of Computer B to its hardware address. If Computer B is on the local network, its hardware address will be obtained by using the ARP cache or by sending a local broadcast asking for a reply from Computer B with its hardware address. If Computer B is on a remote network, ARP will determine the hardware address of the default gateway for routing to Computer B.</P>
<P CLASS="t"><B>Note</B></P>
<P>Host name resolution using a Domain Name System (DNS) server is similar to the preceding steps. Instead of parsing the HOSTS file in Step 2, the DNS server looks up the host name of Computer B in its database and resolves it to an IP address.</P>
<P CLASS="t">The following types of problems can occur because of errors related to the HOSTS file:</P>
<UL><LI>The HOSTS file or the DNS server does not contain the particular host name.</LI><LI>The host name in the HOSTS file or in the command is misspelled or uses different capitalization. (Host names are case-sensitive.)</LI><LI>An invalid IP address is entered for the host name in the HOSTS file.</LI><LI>The HOSTS file contains multiple entries for the same host on separate lines; if so, the first entry is the one that is used.</LI><LI>A mapping for a computer name-to-IP-address was mistakenly added to the HOSTS file (rather than LMHOSTS).</LI></UL></BODY></HTML>
