<H2 CLASS="h1">Peer Web Services on an Intranet Desktop</H2><P CLASS="t">Maria Gonzales needs to communicate with her staff and with network users.</P>
<P CLASS="t">The recent interconnection of three networks has given the Terra Flora information services department the ability to reach any computer in the company, but no tool exists on all the platforms to allow easy communication with every client. The lack of communication is hampering the adoption and use of the newly interconnected networks. </P>
<P CLASS="t">To provide a central communication center, Maria Gonzales announces in e-mail the address of a network directory from which network users can install Internet Explorer, and the address for her computer running Peer Web Services, <B>http://mariag</B>.</P></BODY></HTML>
