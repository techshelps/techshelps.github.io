<H3 CLASS="h2">Overview</H3><P CLASS="t">A mirror set creates an identical twin for the selected partition. Creating a mirror set is similar to making a copy of a document by using a copy machine. The original partition is like the original of the document, and the shadow partition is the copy. Unlike a copy machine, however, Windows&nbsp;NT continually updates the shadow partition when any changes are made to the original. </P>
<P CLASS="t"><B>Note</B></P>
<P>In this chapter and other chapters in the "Reliability and Recoverability" part of this book, the terms original disk and original partition refers to the original partition, and shadow disk and shadow partition refers to the disk or partition that contains the copy. </P>
<P CLASS="t">A stripe set with parity is composed of strips of equal size on each disk in the volume. One of the strips in each stripe is used for parity information. </P>
<P CLASS="t">For a more complete description of mirror sets and stripe sets with parity, including the parity information, see the section titled "Planning a Fault-Tolerant Disk Configuration," in Chapter 4, "Planning a Reliable Configuration."</P>
<P CLASS="t">Because a mirror set or stripe set with parity requires more than one disk, you might have to buy and install additional disks. To increase the redundancy, you might want to buy more disk controllers. It is a good idea to have a spare disk and controller of the same type available. If you are using RAID hardware, follow the manufacturer's installation instructions. When using software fault tolerance, using SCSI controllers is more efficient and provides an additional recovery mechanism of sector sparing. For more information, see "Processing of Disk Errors" in Chapter 3, "Disk Management Basics."</P>
<P CLASS="t">You use Disk Administrator to create and recover mirror sets and stripe sets with parity. When you select one of the partitions of a mirror set or stripe set with parity, Disk Administrator displays information about the volume in the lower left corner of the window. The information looks like:</P>
<P CLASS="spacing"><BR></P>
&lt;Volume&gt; #N [status]
<P CLASS="t">where </P>
<UL><LI>&lt;Volume&gt; is stripe set, mirror set, or stripe set with parity.</LI><LI>N is the number of the volume. </LI></UL><P CLASS="t">The following table shows the possible status values.</P>
