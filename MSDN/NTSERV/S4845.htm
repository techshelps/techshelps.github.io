<H3 CLASS="h2">How to Read the Diagrams</H3><P CLASS="t">Specifically, these diagrams show how a call flows from a RAS client over different media (telephone lines, an ISDN line, or an X.25 network) through third-party security (or other) devices into the RAS server's port (serial or ISDN) and through the RAS server's architectural software layers to the RAS server service and, eventually, the RAS server. For a specific RAS client, you can also see whether it supports modem pools and other third-party pre- or post-connect devices (via pre- and post-connect scripts in the Switch.inf file or RAS Terminal pop-up screens), whether it supports Pad.inf scripts for X.25 communication, and at what point during a call these scripts or Terminal screens execute.</P>
<P CLASS="t">The tables include the full path of all possible, but not necessary, events that can happen during a RAS call. To see the possible flow of events when a RAS client initiates a call to a Windows&nbsp;NT RAS server, first determine what type of communication medium you will be using: telephone lines, an ISDN line, an X.25 dial-up, or an X.25 with an Eicon card. Then, using the table specific to your situation, follow the path from the RAS client to the RAS server.</P>
