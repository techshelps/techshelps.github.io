<H1 CLASS="title">Chapter 11 - Using SNMP for Network Management</H1><P CLASS="t">Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) is a network management standard widely used in TCP/IP networks and, more recently, with Internet Package Exchange (IPX) networks. Windows&nbsp;NT Server and Windows&nbsp;NT Workstation 4.0 include an SNMP service that allows Windows&nbsp;NT– based computers to be managed by using SNMP network management programs.</P>
<P CLASS="t">The information in this chapter is for the administrator who needs to understand SNMP and the SNMP-based service running under Windows&nbsp;NT 4.0. </P>
<P CLASS="t">This chapter begins with a review of basic SNMP concepts, and provides a glossary of the network management terms that are used throughout this chapter. The next two sections describe the SNMP network management standard and the Windows&nbsp;NT implementation of SNMP. The remaining sections in the chapter provide information about using and troubleshooting the SNMP service running under Windows&nbsp;NT. At the end of the chapter there is a list of reference materials that provide detailed information about SNMP, TCP/IP, and IPX.</P></BODY></HTML>
