<H3 CLASS="h2">Managing Profiles</H3><P CLASS="t">When you use Remoteboot Manager for the first time, you must decide which profiles you need. A <I>profile</I> is the working environment shared by one or more clients. It consists of the operating system, the client computer and architecture type, the network adapter type, and all the other information needed to boot a client.</P>
<P CLASS="t"><B>Note</B></P>
<P>Remoteboot profiles are completely different from user profiles, which are used elsewhere in Windows&nbsp;NT Server.</P>
<P CLASS="t">To establish and name profiles, you choose from a list of configurations. A <I>configuration</I> is actually a template profile; a profile is created as a copy of one of the base configurations. Generally, you can find a configuration for any profile you want to create. Once the profiles are defined, it's easy to add clients.</P>
<P CLASS="t">Clients use profiles in either of two ways:  sharing a profile or using a personal copy of a profile. The profile is the same in either case; the difference is in how the client uses it.</P>
<P CLASS="t">A profile can be shared by a group of similar client computers that use the same startup information. (All of the clients have the same Config.sys, Lanman.ini, and other configuration files, and those files are read-only.) For example, you may want to have a common profile that is shared by accounting, and another profile for sales and marketing. Or, you may want to create a profile shared by all Windows&nbsp;3.1 users. Keep in mind, however, that the client computer architecture must be similar enough that the clients can share startup files. Clients that share profiles get their environment from a <I>&lt;systemroot&gt;</I>\Rpl\Rplfiles\Profiles\<I>profile</I> directory (where <I>profile</I> is the name of the profile).</P>
<P CLASS="t">Sharing profiles is not practical in all cases. For example, a client may need customized system configuration files (like Config.sys). In this case, the client should use a personal copy of a profile. Changes to the startup information affect only the single client. Clients that have a personal copy of a profile get their environment from a <I>&lt;systemroot&gt;</I>\Rpl\Rplfiles\Machines\<I>cname</I>\<I>profile</I>\Pro directory (where <I>cname</I> is the computer name and <I>profile</I> is the name of the profile). Users can edit any of the files in that directory, such as Config.sys.</P>
<P CLASS="t">When you upgrade operating systems and make software changes, you need to install them separately to each profile and copy of a profile.</P>
<P CLASS="t"><B>To create a profile</B></P>
<P>    1.    On<B> </B>the<B> </B>Remoteboot Manager<B> Remoteboot </B>menu, click <B>New Profile</B>.</P>
<P><img src="XNG_S09.gif"></P>
<P>    2.    In <B>Profile Name</B>, type a name for this profile [no more than 16 characters, with no spaces or backslashes(\)].</P>
<P>    3.    In <B>Configuration</B>, enter a configuration.</P>
<P>If the configuration you want is not present, you must install the appropriate operating system (see "Installing MS-DOS Files on the Remoteboot Server" earlier in this chapter) and check the configuration (on the <B>Configure</B> menu, click <B>Check Configurations</B>).</P>
<P>    4.    In <B>Description</B>, type a comment for the profile.</P>
<P>The description should summarize the profile for easy recognition, such as <B>MS-DOS 6.22 VGA &amp; 3Com 503 EtherLink II adapter</B>.</P>
<P>    5.    Click <B>OK</B>.</P>
<P CLASS="t"><B>To change a profile</B></P>
<P>    1.    Select an existing profile in <B>Remoteboot Manager</B>.</P>
<P>    2.    On the <B>Remoteboot</B> menu, click <B>Properties</B>.</P>
<P>    3.    Change the description of the profile, and then click <B>OK</B>.</P>
<P>You can change only the description. To change any other settings, you must create a new profile.</P>
<P CLASS="t"><B>To delete a profile</B></P>
<P>    1.    Select an existing profile in Remoteboot Manager.</P>
<P>    2.    On the <B>Remoteboot</B> menu, click <B>Delete</B>.</P>
<P>    3.    If a message appears telling you that clients (workstation records) are still assigned to this profile, you can delete or reassign all of the clients at one time:</P>
<UL><LI>In the error message dialog box, click <B>OK</B>.</LI><LI>Select the profile.</LI><LI>On the <B>View</B> menu, click <B>Workstations In Profile</B>.</LI><LI>Select all of the workstation records (press CTRL and click all of the workstation records).</LI><LI>On the <B>Remoteboot</B> menu, click <B>Delete</B>.</LI></UL><P>Or, on the <B>Remoteboot</B> menu, click <B>Properties</B>. Choose a new profile for all of the clients, and then click <B>OK</B>.</P>
<P>    4.    In the <B>Confirmation</B> dialog box, click <B>OK</B>.</P>
<P CLASS="t">Once you have profiles set up, most remoteboot administration consists of managing the individual clients.</P></BODY></HTML>
