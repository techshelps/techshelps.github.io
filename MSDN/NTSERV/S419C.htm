<H3 CLASS="h2">Domain-naming Conventions</H3><P CLASS="t">When planning your domain, consideration needs to be given to the names of the domains. Once implemented, it is recommended that domain names not change. Changing domain names requires the reinstallation of every server that belongs to the renamed domain. For clarity, use domain names that reflect of the general business areas they serve.</P>
<H4 CLASS="h3"><A NAME="sec0"></A>Group-naming and Assignment Conventions</H4><P CLASS="t">A corporation could create a global group for every resource domain. That group could include all those who use that domain as their primary resource base. Other global groups could be created for all departments or locations, and the members of each department could automatically be made members of their department groups. The group name should reflect the domain and the department For example, a Microsoft department in England might be named Mic-UK. Other groups may be created for job categories, such as Mic-UK-Managers.</P>
<H4 CLASS="h3"><A NAME="sec1"></A>Username Conventions</H4><P CLASS="t">Ideally, one user ID and password would allow access to all of a user's resources. Microsoft Client Services for NetWare passes Windows&nbsp;NT usernames and passwords to NetWare. To take advantage of this, set up a user account on NetWare with the same account name and password as in Windows&nbsp;NT. Banyan VINES systems can also be configured in this way by setting the VINES username and password to match the ones in Windows&nbsp;NT and NetWare. Upon logging on, the user will also be logged on to VINES. </P>
<P CLASS="t">For details about configuring for Banyan VINES on a Windows&nbsp;NT network, see Chapter 5, "Network Services: Enterprise Level." </P>
<P CLASS="t">If the user's password cannot be sent to other systems, the next best thing is to have a consistent full-name property within each company organization.</P></BODY></HTML>
