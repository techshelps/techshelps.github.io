<H2 CLASS="h1">Windows NT File Systems</H2><P CLASS="t">This section contains information about the two file systems that Windows&nbsp;NT supports:</P>
<UL><LI>File Allocation Table (FAT). The computer can access files on a FAT volume when it is running Windows&nbsp;NT, Windows&nbsp;95, MS-DOS, or OS/2.</LI><LI>Windows&nbsp;NT File System (NTFS). The computer must be running Windows&nbsp;NT to be able to access files on an NTFS volume.</LI></UL><P CLASS="t">The FAT file system is a simple file system originally designed for small disks and simple folder structures. The FAT file system is named for its method of organization, the file allocation table, which resides at the beginning of the volume. To protect the volume, two copies of the table are kept, in case one becomes damaged. In addition, the file allocation tables and the root folder must be stored in a fixed location so that the files needed to start the system can be correctly located. </P>
<P CLASS="t">The FAT file system works the same in Windows&nbsp;NT as it does in MS-DOS, Windows 3.1x, and Windows 95. In fact, you can install Windows&nbsp;NT on your existing FAT primary partition. When running Windows&nbsp;NT, you can move or copy files between FAT and NTFS volumes.</P>
<P CLASS="t"><B>Note</B></P>
<P>You cannot use Windows&nbsp;NT with any compression or partitioning software that requires disk device drivers to be loaded by MS-DOS. Therefore, you cannot use MS-DOS 6.0 DoubleSpace<FONT FACE="Symbol">â</FONT> or MS-DOS 6.22 DiskSpace on a FAT primary partition or logical drive that you want to access when running Windows&nbsp;NT.  </P>
<P CLASS="t">The Windows&nbsp;NT file system (NTFS) provides a combination of performance, reliability, and compatibility not found in the FAT file system. It is designed to quickly perform standard file operations such as read, write, and search — and even advanced operations such as file-system recovery — on very large hard disks. </P>
<P CLASS="t">The NTFS file system includes security features required for file servers and high-end personal computers in a corporate environment. The NTFS file system supports data access control and ownership privileges that are important for the integrity of critical data. While folders shared on a Windows&nbsp;NT computer are assigned particular permissions, NTFS files and folders can have permissions assigned whether they are shared or not. NTFS is the only file system on Windows&nbsp;NT that allows you to assign permissions to individual files. However, when you move or copy a file from an NTFS to a FAT volume, permissions and other attributes unique to the NTFS file system are lost.</P>
<P CLASS="t">You can use either or both of these file systems on a computer. Which one you choose for your computer, or for an individual volume on your computer, depends on such things as:</P>
<UL><LI>How you expect to use the computer.</LI><LI>The hardware platform.</LI><LI>The size and number of hard disks.</LI><LI>Security considerations.</LI></UL><P CLASS="t">For more information about file systems, especially NTFS, see<I> Inside the Windows&nbsp;NT File System</I>, by Helen Custer (Microsoft Press 1994, ISBN 1-55615-660-X), which documents the NTFS file system design. </P></BODY></HTML>
