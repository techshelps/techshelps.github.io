<H2 CLASS="h2">Tracking CGI and ISAPI Processes</H2><P CLASS="t">The most common way to monitor the overhead of ISAPI and CGI applications is to monitor general server performance under varying levels of application activity. This technique is described in the preceding sections.</P>
<P CLASS="t">In addition to monitoring changes in overall server performance, you can also monitor the processes in which the applications run. This section suggests some tools and methods for monitoring the processes in which ISAPI extensions and CGI applications run.</P></BODY></HTML>
