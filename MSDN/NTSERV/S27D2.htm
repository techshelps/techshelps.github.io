<H2 CLASS="h2">Components of a WCAT Test</H2><P CLASS="t">A WCAT test simulates clients and servers communicating over a network. WCAT requires at least three computers for each test: </P>
<P>     One computer simulating a client which runs one or more <I>virtual clients</I> </P>
<P>     One computer simulating a <I>server</I></P>
<P>     One computer, called a <I>connector</I>, which initiates and monitors the test</P>
<P></P>
<P CLASS="t">To produce a realistic test, it is best to associate four or more client machines, each running several virtual clients, with each server. </P>
<P CLASS="t">The processors in the client computers should be at least as fast as the processors in the server computer. If the client processors are not as fast as the server processors, more client computers should be associated with each server computer. WCAT works best if the network that connects the computers has little or no traffic that is not related to the test. It is preferable to use a link dedicated only to the test. A 100MB network is recommended.</P></BODY></HTML>
