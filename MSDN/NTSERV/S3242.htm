<H1 CLASS="title">Chapter 10 - Using LMHOSTS Files </H1><P CLASS="t">Windows&nbsp;NT supports several different name resolution services to locate, communicate with, and connect to resources on the network. For example, a command to connect to an application server by using the server name must be resolved to an IP address in TCP/IP networks before the command can be successfully completed. This is referred to as <I>name resolution</I>.</P>
<P CLASS="t">If WINS servers are available on the network, the LMHOSTS file can be used to support the subnets that do not have a WINS server, and to provide a backup name resolution service in case the WINS server is not available. The LMHOSTS file provides a NetBIOS name resolution method that can be used for small networks that do not use a WINS server.</P>
