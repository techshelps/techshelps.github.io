<h2>Using PPTP Over the LAN to Connect to a PPTP Server</h2>
<p>
PPTP clients with a permanent IP connection to a PPTP tunnel server can use PPTP tunneling over that IP connection. For example, suppose that you are in a networked office environment and your network has a PPTP tunnel server. You can then use that PPTP server to tunnel to any private network that is connected to that PPTP server, such as the personnel department&rsquo;s private network. Thus, you can create a virtual private network by using your direct LAN connection. Data sent from your PPTP client to another computer on the LAN is encrypted and secure because you are using a PPTP server to connect to the remote computer.</p>
<p>
In the following scenario, the PPTP client uses Dial-Up Networking over a LAN connection instead of a telephone line. Only one connection to the PPTP server is required. </p>
