<H2 CLASS="h1">Connecting to the Internet with Windows&nbsp;NT</H2><P CLASS="t">Traditionally, connecting to the Internet has been a difficult process that is daunting for a beginner. Early tools, such as FTP (File Transfer Protocol) and Telnet, featured character-based commands suited for those who knew how to connect and maneuver through the intertwined network with 32-bit IP addresses. Today's tools, such as Internet Explorer, provide front-end viewers that enable users to scan and search for information without much knowledge of how information is stored and without having to log on to the source computer.</P>
<P CLASS="t">Windows&nbsp;NT provides and works with tools that make it easier to connect to the Internet.</P>
<UL><LI><I>Dial-Up Networking </I>is the software that enables clients to connect to remote computers, such as an Internet service provider. </LI><LI><I>Remote Access Service (RAS)</I> is the software that enables a computer running Windows&nbsp;NT to accept calls from remote computers. The remote computer can use Windows Dial-Up Networking or any other Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) dial-up client. </LI></UL><P></P>
<P CLASS="t">Both Dial-Up Networking and RAS are included in Windows&nbsp;NT Workstation and Windows&nbsp;NT Server. </P>
<P CLASS="t">This section presents four scenarios for connecting to the Internet by using Windows&nbsp;NT Dial-Up Networking and Remote Access Service.</P>
<P CLASS="t">For more information about Remote Access Service and Dial-Up Networking, see the <I>Windows&nbsp;NT Server Networking Supplement</I> and <I>Windows&nbsp;NT Server Resource Kit Networking Guide</I>.</P></BODY></HTML>
