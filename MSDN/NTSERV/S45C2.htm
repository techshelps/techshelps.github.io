<H3 CLASS="h2">Using MailSrv with the Windows&nbsp;NT Inbox</H3><P CLASS="t">New to Windows&nbsp;NT Server version 4.0 and Windows&nbsp;NT Workstation version 4.0 is a universal inbox client (also referred to as Windows Messaging client) that can send and receive electronic mail. The inbox client organizes, accesses, and stores all types of information. For example, you can open the Inbox<B> </B>on the<B> </B>Windows&nbsp;NT desktop to read, compose, forward, and delete messages, or to create automatic replies and other notification policies based on individual preferences.</P>
<P CLASS="t">The Windows&nbsp;NT Inbox<B> </B>is optimized for use with Microsoft Exchange Server and Microsoft Exchange clients. However, because it is a universal inbox client, you can use it with different mail systems and mail client software, including <B>MailSrv</B>. </P>
<P CLASS="t">Mail client software — for example, the Windows Messaging client — must be installed on each computer supported by the computer running the <B>MailSrv</B> tool under Windows&nbsp;NT Server. After the mail client software is installed, you must enable Internet mail service. For example, to enable Internet mail service by using the Windows Messaging client, follow the procedure in the Help topic "Installing an Information Service."</P></BODY></HTML>
