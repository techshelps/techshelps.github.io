<H3>Configuring Resource Records for Virtual Servers</H3><P CLASS="t">You can configure a single computer running under Windows NT Server and Internet Information Server with multiple IP addresses and FQDNs so that it appears to remote users that there are additional servers, referred to as <I>virtual servers. </I>This feature makes it possible to service Web requests for two or more domain names (for example, company1.com and company2.com) by using a single computer configured with Internet Information Server. For example, an ISP can use this feature to service multiple companies by using a single computer running Windows NT Server and Internet Information Server. However, virtual servers require a special resource record treatment. </P>
<P CLASS="t">First, configure your virtual IIS servers as described in the online <I>Windows NT Server Microsoft Internet Information Server Installation and Administration Guide</I>. After you have done so, use DNS Manager to add new primary and secondary zones for the domain represented by the virtual server. </P>
<P CLASS="t">These primary and secondary zones must be configured on the DNS name servers identified in the InterNIC domain registration. After you have created the zones, map the IP address of the virtual server to the virtual domain name by using DNS Manager to add a new host A record. Add a second new host A record that maps the virtual server IP address to the host name of the computer on which the virtual server exists. Finally, if you want to use alias names, add new CNAME records that map aliases (such as WWW and FTP) to the host name (that is, the name of the computer on which the virtual server exists) and the virtual domain name. </P>
