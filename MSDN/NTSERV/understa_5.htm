<h3>PPTP-enabled Network Access Servers at an ISP</h3>
<p>
The previous section describes how a PPTP-enabled dial-up client establishes a PPTP tunnel with a PPTP server. Dial-up clients that are not PPTP-enabled can also take advantage of PPTP by connecting to a PPTP-enabled network access server. The network access server then establishes the PPTP connection to a PPTP server.</p>
<p>
In this scenario, the dial-up client can be a Windows 95-based, Windows NT-based, Apple Macintosh, or UNIX client. The architecture described in this document is fundamentally the same; however, all PPTP communication occurs between the network access server and the PPTP server.</p>
<p>
PPTP-enabled ISP network access servers are designed and built to accommodate a high number of dial-in clients. Such network access servers are built by companies such as 3Com, Ascend Communications, ECI Telematics, and U.S. Robotics, all members of the PPTP Forum. </p>
<p>
Contact your ISP to see if they provide a PPTP service and how you need to configure PPP and Dial-Up Networking to access the ISP server that supports PPTP. </p>
