<H2 CLASS="h2">Resource Records for Web, FTP, and Gopher Services</H2><P CLASS="t">As noted in the online <I>Windows NT Server Microsoft Internet Information Server Installation and Administration Guide,</I> to allow remote Internet users to access information on a computer configured with Internet Information Server (IIS), you must use a static IP address for that computer.</P>
<P CLASS="t">After you install and configure Internet Information server, A and PTR records must be added to the DNS primary zone in which your Internet Information Server computer is located. If this primary zone is managed by Microsoft DNS server, you can use the <B>New Host</B> option to add the A and PTR resource records. For information about adding A and PTR records, see DNS Manager Help or the <I>Windows NT Server Networking Guide</I>. </P>
<P CLASS="t">The A and PTR resource records contain the name-to-IP address mappings and IP address-to-name mappings that allow users on the Internet to connect to a remote computer. However, additional types of resource records can be used to help balance the load of traffic on a computer configured with Internet Information Server or to mask the actual configuration of your Internet Information Server. The remainder of this section describes these additional types of resource records. </P></BODY></HTML>
