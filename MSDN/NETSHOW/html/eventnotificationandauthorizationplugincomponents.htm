<h3><a name="eventnotificationandauthorizationplugincomponents"></a>Event Notification and Authorization Plug-in Components</h3>
<p>
The NetShow server also supports the development of event notification and authorization plug-in components that enable auditing and billing for access to NetShow content. These plug-in components receive notification from the server before a task such as opening or playing a presentation is performed. The event notification and authorization plug-in components can block the server from performing the task associated with the event until it is authorized to do so by the authorization component.</p>
<p>
One of the events supported for authorization is whether or not to skip client authentication. This means that even if an authenticator is registered with the server and enabled, the methods of the authorization component may never be called. </p>
