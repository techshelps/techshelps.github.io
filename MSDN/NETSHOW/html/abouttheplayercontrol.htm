<h2><a name="abouttheplayercontrol"></a>About the Player Control</h2>
<p>
The Media Player control exposes methods and properties for manipulating multimedia playback from a Web page or application. Functionality exposed by the methods and properties includes:
<ul type=disc>
<li>
Building custom user interfaces on top of the control. Buttons, boxes, and menus can be incorporated into your Web page or application for administering the control.</li>
<li>
Performing VCR-like functions such as start, stop, pause, fast forward, rewind, mute, and volume adjustment.</li>
<li>
Monitoring stream and station performance.</li>
<li>
Retrieving information about the content, such as title, author, and copyright date.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Your application or Web page can also be designed to respond to event messages fired by the control. Events that trigger the control to fire an event include:
<ul type=disc>
<li>
Warnings and errors encountered by the control.</li>
<li>
Changes in the state of the stream changes, such as from a play state to a paused state.</li>
<li>
Keyboard and mouse input.</li>
<li>
The control disconnecting from a stream server.</li>
<li>
Script commands being received by the control.</li>
</ul>
<p>
The Media Player is also provided as a standalone Player application based on the same technology as the Player control. However, the control allows you to create a user interface unique to your content, process any type of script commands, and integrate multimedia presentations into larger Web applications.</p>
