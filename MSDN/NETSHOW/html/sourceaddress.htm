<h4><a name="sourceaddress"></a>SourceAddress Property</h4>
<p>
Returns the source address of the file transfer.</p>
<p class=blue>
<b>Syntax</b></p>
<p>
<i>NSFile</i>.<b>SourceAddress</b></p>
<p class=blue>
<b>Remarks</b></p>
<p>
This property can be used to determine the IP address of the sender. One of the uses of this property is to ensure that the source you received a transfer from is the correct source. This property can be useful both as a security measure to validate multicast sources, and to sort out transfers from more than one source. Note that the <a href="endpointaddress.htm">EndpointAddress</a> property in a multicast transfer indicates the multicast address that the receiver is listening to, not the sender's address.</p>
<p>
This property is available after at least one file transfer.</p>
<p>
The following example shows how to add minimal security to a multicast file transfer. The file transfer control is named <b>nsfile</b>. When the <b>Transfer Started</b> event is triggered, a check is made to see whether the source address is the one expected (239.4.7.54). If it is not, then a subroutine (<code>StopTransfer</code>) is called that cancels the transfer and notifies the user.</p>
<pre><code>Sub NSFile_FtsOnTransferStarted
 If Not (nsfile.SourceAddress = "239.4.7.54") Then StopTransfer
End Sub
...
Sub StopTransfer
 nsfile.FtsCancelFileTransferReceive()
 MsgBox "The transfer has been cancelled. Wrong source address."
End Sub
</code></pre>
