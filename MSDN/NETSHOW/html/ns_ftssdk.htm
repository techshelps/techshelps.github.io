<h4><a name="fullyreliableservice"></a>FullyReliableService Property</h4>
<p>
Returns or sets a <b>Boolean</b> value that indicates whether the user wants to receive a transfer that uses the <a href="fullyreliableservice.htm">Fully Reliable</a> service.</p>
<p class=blue>
<b>Syntax</b></p>
<p>
<i>NSFile</i>.<b>FullyReliableService</b></p>
<p class=blue>
<b>Remarks</b></p>
<p>
The <a href="fullyreliableservice.htm">Fully Reliable</a> service enables fully reliable file transfers. When packets in a file transfer sequence are missing or bad, the receiver sends requests to the sender to resend the missing or bad packets.</p>
<p>
In order to use the Fully Reliable service, forward error-correction (<u>FEC</u>) must be used. Make sure that the <b>Flags</b> parameter of the <a href="ftsstartfiletransferreceive.htm">FtsStartFileTransferReceive</a> method includes the FEC value of 1. Except for making sure that FEC is used when a receive operation is started, the Fully Reliable service is used automatically unless the <b>FullyReliableService</b> property is set to <b>False</b>.</p>
<p>
This property is set to <b>True</b> by default. However, if a transfer is received that was sent without using the <a href="fullyreliableservice.htm">Fully Reliable</a> service, the control will still receive the transfer but will not attempt to request missing packets and the <a href="fullyreliableserviceused.htm">FullyReliableServiceUsed</a> property value will not change state.</p>
<p>
This property is always available.</p>
