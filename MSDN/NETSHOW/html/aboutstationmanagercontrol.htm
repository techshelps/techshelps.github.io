<h2><a name="aboutstationmanagercontrol"></a>About the Station Manager Control</h2>
<p>
The NetShow Station Manager Control is a Microsoft ActiveX® control that allows an administrator to configure broadcast stations, and start and stop streams. This guide describes the functionality exposed by the control for creating custom administration applications and integrating NetShow into other software products.</p>
<p class=indent>
<b>Note&nbsp;&nbsp; </b>Starting with NetShow version 3.0, the term <i>station</i> is used in place of the previous term <i>channel</i> to define how a stream is to be delivered. However, the station objects managed by the Station Manager still reflect the old terminology. For example, the event fired when a station is closed is still called <b>OnChannelClose</b>. Likewise, the <b>Channels</b> collection object contains <b>Channel</b> objects, which are referred to as stations. Code written for previous versions of NetShow will still work with the current version.</p>
<p>
The Station Manager Control exposes attributes for performing the following tasks:
<ul type=disc>

Creating, deleting, and managing <a href="stationmanagerstations.htm">stations</a>.</li>
<li>
Creating, deleting, and managing <a href="streams.htm">streams</a>.</li>

</ul>
<p>
The NetShow Station Manager Control can be used directly in HTML pages (with or without Visual Basic Scripting) and in Visual Basic and Visual C++ applications. It exposes Station services administration functionality through a set of OLE automation interfaces. Those same properties and events are available in any programming environment that supports ActiveX controls. For more information on OLE automation and ActiveX controls, see any COM/OLE or ActiveX documentation. A list of additional information resources is in the More Information and Examples section of the <i>Media Player</i> section of the SDK.</p>

<p>
Support for current versions of NetShow Station Manager is limited to computers running Microsoft Windows NT® Workstation or Windows NT Server version 4.0 operating systems. However the Station Manager Control is also supported on computers running Microsoft Windows® 95 and Windows98.</p>
