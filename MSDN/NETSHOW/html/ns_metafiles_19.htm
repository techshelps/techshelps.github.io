<h5>Attributes</h5>
<p class=dt>
Version (this is a required attribute)</p>
<p class=indent>
The value of the version attribute is the a decimal indicating the version number of the syntax for the ASX file. For Microsoft® Media Player version 3.0, the syntax version number is 3.0. Microsoft® Media Player 5.2 supports all previous versions of ASX syntax. Acceptable values for the Version decimal include: “3.0,” and “3” with no decimal point.</p>
<p class=dt>
PreviewMode</p>
<p class=indent>
If the value for the PreviewMode attribute is “yes,” the player immediately enters Preview Mode when a title is opened. When the player enters Preview Mode, each clip referenced in the ASX file is previewed in the player. The duration of the preview of the piece of content is determined by the <a href="ns_metafiles_rqlo.htm">PreviewDuration</a> element. Possible values include “yes” and “no.”</p>
<p class=indent>
The default value for this attribute is “no.”</p>
<p class=dt>
BannerBar</p>
<p class=indent>
The value of the BannerBar attribute defines whether or not the player reserves space for a Banner graphic. A Banner is a graphic that is displayed in the Video area of the player while content is playing. A Banner is added to the content by using the <a href="ns_metafiles_ppgj.htm">Banner</a> element. If the value is “FIXED,” the player reserves a space 32 pixels high by 194 pixels wide for a Banner graphic in the Video area for every piece of content played. The space is reserved 6 pixels above the bottom edge of the Video area, allowing space for the 6-pixel border. The Banner is centered horizontally. If a piece of content does not have a Banner associated with it, the space reserved for one is black.</p>
<p class=indent>
If the value for this attribute is “AUTO,” the client reserves space for the Banner bar only when a piece of content includes one.</p>
<p class=indent>
The default value for this attribute is “AUTO.”</p>
