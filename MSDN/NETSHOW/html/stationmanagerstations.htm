<h3><a name="stationmanagerstations"></a>Station Manager Stations</h3>
<p>
Each station defines the delivery mechanism for a stream. For example, a station contains information about the station name, the multicast address of the destination, the station formats, and so on. A station itself does not contain media content, but rather describes how content can be delivered.</p>
<p>
Each station can have one or more station formats, which contain information such as bit rate, packet size, and stream descriptors.</p>
<p>
Each station format has at least one stream descriptor, which contains information such as the descriptor type, description, width, and type.</p>
