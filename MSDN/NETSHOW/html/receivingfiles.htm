<h3><a name="receivingfiles"></a>Receiving Files</h3>
<p>
To receive a file:
<ol>
<li>
Start the receive operation before the sender starts sending to insure that all files will be transferred. If the receiver starts after the sender has begun sending a group of files, the receiver will receive the current file and all subsequent files. If only one file is being sent and the receive operation starts in the middle of the transfer, the file will be received.<br><br></li>
<li>
Start a receive operation with the <a href="ftscancelfiletransferreceive.htm">FtsCancelFileTransferReceive</a> method on the computer on which you want to receive the file(s). This is called <i>listening</i>.<ul type=disc>
<li>
For multicast transfers, use a multicast address.</li>
<li>
For unicast transfers, specify one of the host computer's local addresses. If no local address is specified, the first local address on the host computer will be used as a default.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
Wait until the file is sent by the sender.</li>
</ol>
<p>
The receiver can cancel a file transfer with the <a href="ftscancelfiletransferreceive.htm">FtsCancelFileTransferReceive</a> method.</p>
<p>
Status and progress of the transfer can be read through events and properties during the file transfer and at the transfer completion. See <a href="notifications.htm">Notifications</a> for information about status and notifications.</p>
