<h2><a name="programmingguidetothenetshowtheaterviewcontrols"></a>Programming Guide to the NetShow Theater View Controls</h2>
<p>
The NetShow Theater Administration View controls provide an easy-to-use interface for monitoring NetShow Theater Server activity. These controls have a graphical user interface and support built in features, such as drag-and-drop functionality, for end users. They also expose methods and properties and support events for programmatically manipulating the controls. The View controls include:</p>

Expanding each top node of the tree displays a clients icon, specifying the number of clients connected to the title server, and an icon for each content server managed by the title server. Expanding each content server node displays the disks managed by that content server.</p>
