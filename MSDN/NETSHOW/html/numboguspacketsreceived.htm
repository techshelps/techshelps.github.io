<h4><a name="numboguspacketsreceived"></a>NumBogusPacketsReceived Property</h4>
<p>
Returns the number of bogus packets received. A <i>bogus packet</i> is a packet that is received on the same IP address and port the receiver is listening for, but which is not part of an expected file transfer operation. For example, this could happen if a file transfer were taking place and the receiving address started getting audio packets on the same address.</p>

<b>Syntax</b></p>
<p>
<i>NSFile</i>.<b>NumBogusPacketsReceived</b></p>
<p class=blue>
<b>Remarks</b></p>
<p>
If one protocol is expected and another is received, the packets received will be considered bogus packets. For example, if forward error-correction (FEC) is expected but only non-FEC packets are received, those packets will be tagged as bogus.</p>
<p>
This property is always available after a transfer has started.</p>
