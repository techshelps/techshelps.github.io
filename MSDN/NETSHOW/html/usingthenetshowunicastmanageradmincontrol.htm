<h2><a name="usingthenetshowunicastmanageradmincontrol"></a>Using the NetShow Unicast Manager Admin Control</h2>
<p>
The NetShow Unicast Manager SDK setup program installs and registers the NetShow Unicast Manager controls and related files. The control can be added to any Microsoft Visual Basic® or Visual C++® application like any other ActiveX control.</p>
<p>
With the Unicast Manager Admin control, you can leverage the well-tested functionality for managing NetShow unicast services, which include:
<ul type=disc>
<li>
Setting and retrieving server properties, such as the maximum aggregate bandwidth and the maximum number of clients.</li>
<li>
Monitoring client behavior, including connections, disconnections, and titles played.</li>
<li>
Monitoring overall system activity, including server status, administration functions, and server limits.</li>
<li>
Filtering the types of events received by the control.</li>
</ul>
<p>
The properties exposed by the NetShow Manager Admin control are run time properties; that is, they are not available at design time. The values of these properties can not be set or returned until the <a href="connect.htm"><b>Connect</b></a> method has completed successfully. </p>
<p>
As with any other ActiveX control, you can use the NetShow Unicast Manager Admin control directly in HTML pages (with or without Visual Basic Scripting) and in Visual Basic or Visual C++ applications. There are several convenient ways to embed ActiveX controls in HTML pages. You can use the ActiveX Control Pad, Microsoft Visual InterDev, or Microsoft FrontPage™. For more information on using ActiveX controls, see the Microsoft Web pages at <i>http://www.microsoft.com/activex</i>. You can also find additional information and resources listed in the “More Information and Examples” section of the <i>NetShow Player Software Developer's Kit</i>.</p>
