The Microsoft® Media Player control (contained in Msdxm.ocx) is a Microsoft ActiveX® control used for adding multimedia playback capabilities to OLE-enabled documents and applications, as well as Web pages. It provides a programming interface for rendering a variety of network streaming and non-streaming multimedia formats. The Player control incorporates many of the features of the ActiveMovie control and the NetShow version 2.0 Player control, as well as many new features.</p>
