<h4><a name="ftsrevokestatuscallback"></a>FtsRevokeStatusCallback Method</h4>
<p>
Revokes a registered transfer progress notification request callback. To revoke a specific status callback, you must match the pattern of parameters that was used to request the callback. For example, if a call was made with <a href="ftsregisterstatuscallback.htm">FtsRegisterStatusCallback</a>(0,10,0,0,0,0,0,0,100,0,0), which would request a notification for every 10 percent of the data bytes of the file transfer as well as for every 100 duplicate packets received, that particular notification can be revoked only by the matching call: <b>FtsRevokeStatusCallback</b>(0,10,0,0,0,0,0,0,100,0). Note that <b>FtsRegisterStatusCallback</b> has 11 parameters and <b>FtsRevokeStatusCallback</b> has only 10. The revoke does not use the <i>Param</i> parameter.</p>

<p class=blue>
<b>Parameters</b></p>
<p class=dt>
<i>Cur</i></p>
<p class=indent>
Number of file data bytes that will transfer before each notification occurs. Does not include file header bytes or other non-data file information such as redundancy bytes. For example, specifying 8192 would revoke an <a href="ftsontransferprogress.htm">FtsOnTransferProgress</a> notification for every 8K of file data bytes transferred.</p>
<p class=dt>
<i>Per</i></p>
<p class=indent>
Percent of file data bytes that will transfer before each notification occurs. Does not include file header bytes or other non-data file information such as redundancy bytes. For example, specifying 10 would revoke an <a href="ftsontransferprogress.htm">FtsOnTransferProgress</a> notification for every 10 percent of the file data bytes transferred.</p>
<p class=dt>
<i>Data</i></p>
<p class=indent>
Total data bytes (for all files requested) that will transfer before each notification occurs. Does not include file header bytes or other non-data file information such as redundancy bytes. For example, specifying 8192 would revoke an <a href="ftsontransferprogress.htm">FtsOnTransferProgress</a> notification for every 8K of file data bytes transferred, even if this included more than one file.</p>
<p class=dt>
<i>Tot</i></p>
<p class=indent>
Total bytes (for all files requested) that will transfer before each notification occurs, including file header bytes or other non-data file information such as redundancy bytes. For example, specifying 8192 would revoke an <a href="ftsontransferprogress.htm">FtsOnTransferProgress</a> notification for every 8K of file bytes transferred, even if this included more than one file.</p>
<p class=dt>
<i>Pack</i></p>
<p class=indent>
Number of packets that will transfer before each notification occurs. For example, specifying 100 would revoke an <a href="ftsontransferprogress.htm">FtsOnTransferProgress</a> notification for every 100 packets transferred.</p>
<p class=dt>
<i>Drop</i></p>
<p class=indent>
Number of packets that are dropped before each notification occurs. For example, specifying 50 would revoke an <a href="ftsontransferprogress.htm">FtsOnTransferProgress</a> notification for every 50 packets dropped.</p>
<p class=dt>
<i>Corr</i></p>
<p class=indent>
Number of packets that are corrected before each notification occurs. For example, specifying 25 would revoke an <a href="ftsontransferprogress.htm">FtsOnTransferProgress</a> notification for every 25 packets received and corrected.</p>
<p class=dt>
<i>Bogus</i></p>
<p class=indent>
Number of bogus packets that are received before each notification occurs. For example, specifying 25 would revoke an <a href="ftsontransferprogress.htm">FtsOnTransferProgress</a> notification for every 25 bogus packets received. A <i>bogus packet</i> is a packet that is received on the same IP address and port as the receiver is listening for, but is not part of an expected file transfer operation. For example, this would happen if a file transfer were taking place and the receiving address started getting audio packets on the same address.</p>
<p class=dt>
<i>Dup</i></p>
<p class=indent>
Number of duplicate packets that are received before each notification occurs. For example, specifying 5 would revoke an <a href="ftsontransferprogress.htm">FtsOnTransferProgress</a> notification for every five duplicate packets received.</p>
<p class=dt>
<i>Flags</i></p>
<p class=indent>
The following flags are used by this method to define the type of notification request you want to revoke. Multiple flags can be used on each revoke request. If 0 (zero) is specified, the <b>File Transfer</b> object would default to a "transfer completed" notification (the same value as 8).</p>

<b>Return Values</b></p>
<p>
This method does not return a value. However, this object does return a Microsoft COM <b>HRESULT</b> error code to the Visual Basic Script <b>Error</b> object.</p>
<p>
The following codes are passed to the <b>Error</b> object:</p>

<td class=blue width=80%><b>Description (HRESULT) </b></td>

<td width=80%>The action requested is already taking place. (<b>S_FALSE</b>) </td>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>

<td width=80%>The action requested could not take place for an unspecified reason. (<b>E_FAIL</b>) </td>
