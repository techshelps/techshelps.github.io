<h3><a name="ns_metafiles_tbii"></a>MoreInfo</h3>
<p>
The MoreInfo element allows the content creator to provide a URL to a Web site, link to an email address, or specify a script command to execute. The URL, link, or script command can be accessed by opening the <b>More Information </b>sub-menu of the <b>File</b> menu in the player. This sub-menu contains three commands, Show, Clip, and Banner. One or more of these commands is available in the menu depending on the element(s) the MoreInfo element is associated with. If associated (within the scope of) an ASX element, the MoreInfo element is associated with the Show in the player. Using a MoreInfo element as a child element of an Entry element associates the MoreInfo element data with the clip in the player. If you use MoreInfo within the scope of a Banner tag, the Banner graphic, as well as the <b>Banner</b> command on the <b>More Information</b> sub-menu, can be clicked on. When it is clicked on, the URL or script command is executed. If the <b>Href</b> attribute of the MoreInfo element is an URL to a Web site, the browser starts and navigates to the URL. If it is an email link, the users email application starts. If the Href value is a script command, it is executed in the browser.</p>
<p>
The URL defined in the Href attribute is displayed as a ToolTip when the mouse cursor is placed over the Banner graphic, if one is included. If there is an Abstract element within the scope of the MoreInfo element, the Abstract text is displayed as the ToolTip. </p>
