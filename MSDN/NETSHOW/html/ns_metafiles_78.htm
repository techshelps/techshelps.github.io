<li>
If multiple Event elements within an ASX element have identical values for their Name attributes, the player uses the first occurrence within the ASX element, and ignores all others.</li>
<li>
The order in which Event elements appear within an ASX element is not significant.</li>
<li>
Events received by the client during the processing of another Event are discarded. Nesting events is not supported.</li>
<li>
Event content is not constrained by the <a href="ns_metafiles_rqlo.htm">PreviewDuration</a> element when in Preview Mode. This means that the full length of Event content can be played by the client even if the PreviewDuration for the active Entry element expires prior to the end of the Event.</li>
