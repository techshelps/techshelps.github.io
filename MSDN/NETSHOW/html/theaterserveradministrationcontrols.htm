<h3><a name="theaterserveradministrationcontrols"></a>Theater Server Administration Controls</h3>
<p>
The ActiveX controls exposed in the NetShow Theater Server Administration SDK can be classified into the following two categories:
<ul type=disc>
<li>
The MediaServer control: This control supports an extensive set of properties, methods, and events for performing administrative tasks. </li>
<li>
The View controls: These controls provide a graphical user interface for monitoring and managing lists of clients, titles, and events. The View controls are:<ul type=disc>
<li>
<b>ClientView</b> control: This control dynamically lists clients connected to the server and the title they are playing.</li>
<li>
<b>ServerView</b> control: This control displays a tree view of one or more servers and their content servers and content disks.</li>
<li>
<b>TitleView</b> control: This control lists information about each of the titles available on the server.</li>
<li>
<b>TraceView</b> control: This control displays a list of notifications of state changes (<i>events</i>) occurring on the server. Events listed by this control include server, client, administration, and alert events.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Along with the Windows Media Player control, the Administration controls can be used to create client applications for creating end-to-end high bandwidth multimedia streaming solutions. For example, they can be used to obtain and display a list of titles available on a title server. The user could select a title from the list and play it using the Windows Media Player.</p>
