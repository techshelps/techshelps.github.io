<h3><a name="ns_metafiles_zkfo"></a>Understanding ASX Metafiles</h3>
<p>
An ASX file provides information that Microsoft® Media Player uses, such as the <u>Uniform Resource Locator (URL)</u>, to receive either unicast or multicast <u>streams</u> from an intranet or the Internet. You also can use ASX files to deliver the path to a stored media file on a network drive, but this can be accomplished through other means as well, and is not covered here. Both Microsoft® NetShow™ and RealNetworks® RealAudio® metafiles can be opened by Media Player. These files are loaded quickly by the client, and contain information for the following purposes:
<ul type=disc>
<li>
To transfer control from the <u>Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)</u> browser to the player control, so that streams can be directed to the player. If you do not have Microsoft® Internet Explorer, you cannot define hyperlinks in a Web page using the MMS (Microsoft Media Server) protocol because the MMS protocol is not recognized. You can link to an ASX file on a Web server that then points the client to the NetShow server via the MMS protocol.</li>

<li>
To provide references to multiple pieces of content and rules for protocol rollover that the client uses to process them.</li>
<li>
To provide a <u>playlist</u> that defines the order in which pieces of content are streamed to the player.</li>
