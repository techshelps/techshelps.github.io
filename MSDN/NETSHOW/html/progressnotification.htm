<h4><a name="progressnotification"></a>Progress Notification</h4>
<p>
To receive progress statistics about an ongoing file transfer, register the kind of transfer information you want with the <a href="ftsregisterstatuscallback.htm">FtsRegisterStatusCallback</a> method. Typical kinds of requests would be to notify the caller every 100KB of the file transfer or every 10 percent of the file transfer. Notifications can also be requested about the number of packets received, as well as the number of bogus packets (received on the same IP address and port, but not part of an expected file transfer operation), duplicate packets, dropped packets, and so on. Progress notifications are processed by the <a href="ftsontransferprogress.htm">FtsOnTransferProgress</a> event. Read the appropriate properties and take the appropriate action in an <b>FtsOnTransferProgress</b> subroutine. You can revoke a progress notification by calling the <a href="ftsrevokestatuscallback.htm">FtsRevokeStatusCallback</a> method.</p>
<p>
Note that progress notifications trigger only the <a href="ftsontransferprogress.htm">FtsOnTransferProgress</a> event. The values of transfer progress properties (such as NumPacketsDropped) are continuously available.</p>
