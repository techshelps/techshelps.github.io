<h5>Attributes</h5>
<p class=dt>
Name (This is a required attribute)</p>
<p class=indent>
A text string representing the event defined in the ASX file by the Event element. The value of the Name attribute is matched against the contents of a script command embedded in the stream that contains a double-string. The value of the Name attribute is case-sensitive, and must match exactly the contents of the double-string in the script command.</p>
<p class=dt>
WhenDone (This is a required attribute)</p>
<p class=indent>
The value for this attribute defines what the player does after playing the referenced Event content.</p>
<p class=dt>
RESUME</p>
<p class=indent>
The player resumes playing the current Entry (the Entry or clip that is interrupted by the Event) at the same point where it stopped if the content is stored content, or at the current position of the content if the content is real-time, or live.</p>
<p class=dt>
NEXT</p>
<p class=indent>
The client plays the next Entry element as if the Event had not occurred and it had reached the end of the content.</p>
<p class=dt>
BREAK</p>
<p class=indent>
The BREAK value is used to end a <a href="ns_metafiles_xwwo.htm">Repeat</a> loop as if the repeat count had been completed. This is the same as not setting the Count attribute of the Repeat element. If the current Entry is not within a Repeat element, then the BREAK value instructs the player to go to the end of a <a href="ns_metafiles_bqsr.htm">playlist</a> as if the final Entry had been completed normally.</p>
<p class=dt>
Refresh</p>
<p class=indent>
If the value of the Refresh attribute is “yes,” the client automatically refreshes the Event URL defined in the href attribute after the Event has been rendered. This allows subsequent rendering to use new content and/or meta data for the event.</p>
<p class=indent>
The default value for this attribute is “no.”</p>
