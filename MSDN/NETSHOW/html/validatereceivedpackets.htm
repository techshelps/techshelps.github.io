<h4><a name="validatereceivedpackets"></a>ValidateReceivedPackets Property</h4>
<p>
Returns or sets a <b>Boolean</b> value that indicates whether the user wants to validate incoming packets for connectionless transfers (for example, UDP or UDP with forward error-correction) to ensure that they are for the current transfer. Packets that do not pass the validation test are considered bogus packets. The number of bogus packets received can be read through the <a href="numboguspacketsreceived.htm">NumBogusPacketsReceived</a> property. For connection-oriented transfers (for example, TCP), this property is ignored and packets are never validated.</p>

<b>Syntax</b></p>
<p>
<i>NSFile</i>.<b>ValidateReceivedPackets</b></p>
<p class=blue>
<b>Remarks</b></p>
<p>
This property should be set to <b>False</b> only if the caller wants the highest level of performance and is willing to risk robustness of the transfer, or the caller has a known private multicast address and port combination that no one else could use. It is highly recommended that this property not be set to <b>False</b>.</p>
<p>
This property is set to <b>True</b> by default.</p>
<p>
This property is always available.</p>
