<h5>Important</h5>
<p>
When an ASX file is opened by the player, the entire file is parsed and all URLs resolved before any content is played. If referenced content includes associated graphics, all graphic files referenced are downloaded before the content is played. This prevents long pauses between pieces of content while a graphic is being downloaded, but also can cause a long delay before the first piece of content is played.</p>
