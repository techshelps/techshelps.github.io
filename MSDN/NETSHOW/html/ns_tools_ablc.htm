<p>
Advanced Streaming redirector files, also called ASX<u> metafiles</u> are text files which, in their simplest form, contain information about the <u>Uniform Resource Locator (URL)</u> for a piece of media content. This information is processed by the client, Microsoft® Media Player, which then opens the media defined in the ASX file.</p>
<p>
The most common use of ASX files is using a hyperlink in a Web page to an ASX file that directs the client to the streaming server. Most Web browsers do not recognize the protocols used for streaming media (MMS, NSM, PNM), which means you cannot use hyperlinks in HTML directly to a media streaming server. To work around this problem, you can create ASX files that contain the information needed by the player to connect to streaming media servers, and store them on a Web server. Once the files are stored on a Web server, you can use hyperlinks in a Web document to the stored ASX files. When a file with a filename extension of .asx is opened, control is transferred to Media Player which then processes the file and plays the media defined in it.</p>
<p>
You also can use the more sophisticated features of ASX files to deliver, among other things, branding information, advertisements, and <u>playlists</u> to users receiving your content. ASX files enhance the integration of Microsoft® NetShow™ with Web commerce applications, such as Microsoft® Site Server version 3.0, by allowing for the personalization and customization of content delivery. Using ASX metafiles, you can insert advertisements into the display area of the player, as well as graphics that direct the user to your Web site. You can even use Active Server Pages (ASP, or .asp files) to generate ASX files that link to your content. ASX metafiles allow the content creator greater control over how content is delivered to the user.</p>
