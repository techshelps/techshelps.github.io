<p>
The Microsoft Foundation Class (MFC) library for Windows CE is both a mature, comprehensive Windows CE class library and a complete object-oriented application framework designed to help you build robust, professional applications, components, and controls for Windows CE platforms. You can use MFC for Windows CE to create anything from a simple dialog box-based program to a powerful, sophisticated application that employs the MFC document/view architecture. You can also use MFC for Windows CE to create full-featured ActiveX controls and ActiveX containers. </p>
