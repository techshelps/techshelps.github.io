<h2><a name="_vcce_how_is_mfc_for_windows_ce_different_from_mfc_for_desktop_platforms"></a>How is MFC for Windows CE Different from MFC for Desktop Platforms?</h2>
<p>
Windows CE is a more compact operating system than the desktop Windows platforms, so it supports a streamlined subset of the standard MFC library. The Windows CE implementation of this subset is designed to be as compatible as possible with standard MFC but there are, inevitably, some differences in some of the classes. MFC for Windows CE also introduces several new classes to support some of the features that are unique to Windows CE.</p>
<p>
MFC for Windows CE introduces four new database classes that encapsulate the simple database functionality supported by the Windows CE object store. These classes are <a href="ccedbdb.htm"><b>CCeDBDatabase</b></a>, <a href="ccedbrec.htm"><b>CCeDBRecord</b></a>, <a href="ccedbprp.htm"><b>CCeDBProp</b></a>, and <a href="ccedbenm.htm"><b>CCeDBEnum</b></a>. <b>CCeDBEnum </b>is an enumerator for the databases in the object store.</p>
<p>
Another new class that's unique to MFC for Windows CE is <a href="ccesock.htm"><b>CCeSocket</b></a>. Windows CE doesn't inherently support asynchronous socket communication, but the <b>CCeSocket</b> class simulates asynchronous notification for certain socket events. Use this class instead of <a href="casyncso.htm"><b>CAsyncSocket</b></a> for Windows CE socket applications.</p>
<p>
One Windows CE feature that isn't supported on desktop Windows platforms is the command bar. The command bar is a common control that combines the functionality of a menu bar and a tool bar. It also includes the standard Windows Close (<b>X</b>) button and, optionally, the Help (<b>?</b>) button and the OK button. This control is very useful for devices with small displays. MFC for Windows CE supports command bars with nine new functions in the <a href="cframwnd.htm"><b>CFrameWnd</b></a> class. </p>
