<h2><a name="_vcce_mfc_for_windows_ce_reference"></a>MFC for Windows CE Reference</h2>
<p>
Windows CE supports many of the standard Microsoft Foundation Class library classes. Because Windows CE runs on platforms that are very different from the desktop Windows platforms, it has some different requirements. In order to meet these requirements, the designers of Windows CE have made changes to some of the classes in the library.</p>
<p>
For an alphabetical listing of the classes that have been modified for use under Windows CE, see <a href="mfc_37.htm">Modified MFC Classes</a>.</p>
<p>
For an alphabetical listing of all the classes that MFC for Windows CE supports exactly the same way standard MFC supports them, see <a href="mfc_38.htm">Fully Supported MFC Classes</a>.</p>
<p>
For a list of MFC classes that Windows CE does not support, see <a href="mfc_39.htm">Unsupported MFC Classes</a>.</p>
<p>
For a list of MFC global functions and messages that are specific to Windows CE, see <a href="mfc_40.htm">Windows CE-Specific MFC API Functions &amp; Messages</a>.</p>
<p>
For a list of supported and unsupported MFC global functions, see <a href="mfc_41.htm">MFC Global Functions</a>.</p>
<p>
For a list of supported and unsupported structures used in MFC, see <a href="mfc_43.htm">Structures Used in MFC</a>.</p>

For a listing of classes by category, see <a href="mfc_6.htm">Classes Derived from CObject</a> and <a href="mfc_26.htm">Classes Not Derived from CObject</a>, and the <a href="mfc_5.htm">Top Level Hierarchy Chart</a>.</p>
