<p>
Tools written to run on the worldwide web can be integrated directly into MMC, as can tools written as ActiveX™ controls. Non-MMC tools can be integrated with MMC by incorporating them into snap-ins, or they can run separately from the MMC user interface. A systems administrator can have non-MMC management programs running on the computer at the same time as one or more instances of MMC, and use the operating system to switch between them, as you would expect.</p>
<p>
Within MMC, administrators can also create shortcuts in the console to any executable program (EXE), script, or uniform resource locator (URL), including non-MMC tools. These shortcuts are persisted when the MMC tool is saved as a .msc document file. Within MMC, administrators can create shortcuts to any EXE, script, or URL.</p>
