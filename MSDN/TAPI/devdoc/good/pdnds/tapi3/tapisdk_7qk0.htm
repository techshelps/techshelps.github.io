<ul>
<li>
Component Object Model (COM) architecture. Evolving TAPI into COM allows the creation of applications that can be maintained and upgraded by function rather than as .EXE files. COM is also language-neutral, permitting developers to write TAPI enabled applications in any language, such as Java, Visual Basic®, or C/C++. Note that some interface methods may not be available to scripting languages such as VB Script.</li>
<li>
Media stream access by means of  DirectShow (formerly ActiveMovie™). Media-stream access allows applications to process a diverse range of media and to respond precisely to changes in the media stream. </li>
<li>
Integration with Windows NT® 5.0 ActiveDirectory. </li>
<li>
Supports H.323 protocols with IP Telephony Service Provider.</li>
<li>
Supports MBone protocols with IP Multicast conferencing service provider.</li>
<li>
Integrates Quality of Service (QOS).</li>
</ul>
