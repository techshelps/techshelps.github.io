<p>
The DirectShow™ Real-Time Transport Protocol (RTP) is a set of Component Object Model (COM) objects, interfaces, and methods that can handle transporting nearly any media type. These methods can be invoked by applications to expose media and controls.</p>
<p>
Methods used follow the RTP specifications in RFC 1889 and RFC 1890, as well as the various RTP payload specifications for supported payload handlers.</p>
<p>
The following material assumes familiarity with COM, DirectShow, and RTP. </p>
<p>
The filters and filter graphs were designed and developed under a joint development agreement with Intel Corporation.</p>
