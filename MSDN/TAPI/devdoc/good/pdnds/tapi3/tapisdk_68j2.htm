<p>
TAPI version 3.0 is a set of COM-based APIs providing convergence of both traditional telephony and IP (Internet Protocol) Telephony. </p>
<p>
IP Telephony enables voice, data and video collaboration over existing LANs, WANs and the Internet. TAPI 3.0 implements IP Telephony on the Windows® platforms by providing simple and generic methods for making connections between two or more machines.</p>
<p>
TAPI 3.0 supports standards-based H.323 conferencing and IP Multicast conferencing, utilizing the Windows NT® 5.0 Active Directory service to simplify deployment within an organization. Quality-of-service (QOS) support is included to improve conference quality and network manageability. Media stream access is provided through DirectShow® filters.</p>
<p>
TAPI 3.0 PSTN and IP functionality is provided by three main sections: call and media controls, media stream controls, and directory controls. The following diagram illustrates how these controls interact with the telephone and IP networks.</p>

<p>
The beta 1 release of TAPI 3.0 contains the core elements of telephony. Future releases will include interfaces and objects to expose and encapsulate additional telephony concepts, including call center-specific functionality. </p>
