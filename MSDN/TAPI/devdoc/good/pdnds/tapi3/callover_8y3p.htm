<p>
The method for setting up a conference is as follows:</p>
<p>
A call exists between two parties, as in the diagram below.</p>
<p>
<img src="images/tapi3e.gif" border=0></p>
<p>
User A decides to add another party to the conference. The application calls:</p>
<pre><code>pCallA-&gt;AddToConference(pszDestAddress,
                           TRUE,
                           &amp;pConsultCallA);
 </code></pre>
<p>
This creates a CallHub object for consultation, as shown in the following diagram:</p>
<p>
<img src="images/tapi3f.gif" border=0></p>
<p>
User A may then use the <a href="callref_4dws.htm"><b>ITConsultCall</b></a> interface to discover whether private interaction is possible with user C.</p>
<pre><code>pConsultCallA-&gt;CanIConsult( pbConsultC );
 </code></pre>
<p>
If <a href="callref_3v1w.htm"><b>CanIConsult</b></a> returns <i>pbConsultC</i> as TRUE and user A would like to consult privately with user C before user C is added to the conference, the application must set the media terminals for the two parties to converse privately. </p>
<p>
After this consultation, or if the user does not want to consult, the conference is completed:</p>
<pre><code>pConsultCall-&gt;Finish();
 </code></pre>
<p>
The result is illustrated in the following diagram. All three parties in the diagram are connected in a conference.</p>
<p>
<img src="images/tapi3g.gif" border=0></p>
<p>
These pictures are conceptual. From user C's point of view, <i>pConsultCallC</i> is the same as <i>pCallC</i>, and <i>pConsultCallHub</i> is the same as <i>pCallHub</i>. That is, C does not actually receive a new call object and a new CallHub object after A calls <a href="callref_6ug8.htm"><b>Finish</b></a>. If C has registered the <a href="callref_8dri.htm"><b>ITCallHubEventNotification</b></a> interface, C is notified that the number of calls has changed on the CallHub when A calls <b>Finish</b>. </p>
<p>
As soon as <b>Finish</b> is called, <i>pConsultCallA</i> transitions to the DISCONNECTED state . The <i>pConsultCallA</i> parameter can no longer be used for any call control, but the application may retain the call object for informational purposes.</p>
<p>
Additional parties may be added to the conference by performing Step 2 and Step 3 for each new participant.</p>
