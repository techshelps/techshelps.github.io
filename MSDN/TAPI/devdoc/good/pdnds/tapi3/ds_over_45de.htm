<p>
This filter acts as a sink for RTP packets in a DirectShow filter graph (it is a source in relation to the network) for a single stream within an RTP session. It exposes a single input pin that accepts a connection with any pin of major media type MEDIATYPE_RTP_Single_Stream. The payload type (minor type) of any suggested connection is ignored by this filter.</p>
<p>
This filter is responsible for generating RTCP Sender Reports. This filter is payload independent, with the exception of the stream clock value which is necessary for accurately generating NTP and RTP timestamp information in sender reports.</p>
<p>
This filter exposes an application interface for controlling an RTP session that is very similar to that of the RTP Source filter. This filter also uses DirectShow notifications to indicate asynchronous events such as socket errors and report reception. </p>
