<h1><a name="_win32_overview_of_tapi_client_management"></a>Overview of TAPI Client Management</h1>
<p>
TAPI versions 2.0 and earlier did not contain TAPI Client Management, and a user had access only to TAPI devices (telephone lines, modems, phones, and so on) that were physically attached to the computer. There was no easy way to let a user have access to only a single line in a private branch exchange (PBX) system.</p>
<p>
TAPI Client Management enables TAPI (versions 2.0 and later) to be a viable platform for a PBX through the following telephony client/server support and administration features:
<ul>
<li>
Remote SP, a TAPI service provider that enables users to have access to remote TAPI devices</li>
<li>
Administrative features that allow third parties to perform telephony administrative tasks on telephony client requests</li>
</ul>
