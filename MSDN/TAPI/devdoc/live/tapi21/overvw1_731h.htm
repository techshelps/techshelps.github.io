<h3><a name="_win32_changes_in_the_status_of_a_line_device"></a>Changes in the Status of a Line Device</h3>
<p>
The status of a line device can change for many reasons, some as a result of requests submitted by the local application, and some as a result of actions performed by the switch or by the application (or person) at the other end of the connection. </p>
<p>
In either case, an application is notified about these changes with the <a href="msgs_7het.htm">LINE_LINEDEVSTATE</a> message, which indicates the status item (the attribute of the line device) that has changed. The application can choose the line status items for which it wants to be notified using the <a href="func2_0o1f.htm"><b>lineSetStatusMessages</b></a> function. The messages controlled by invoking <b>lineSetStatusMessages</b> are LINE_LINEDEVSTATE and <a href="msgs_7ch1.htm">LINE_ADDRESSSTATE</a>. </p>
<p>
In addition, an application can determine the current status of an address by calling <a href="func1_4shf.htm"><b>lineGetAddressStatus</b></a>, which returns its information in a structure of the type <a href="struc1_4xki.htm"><b>LINEADDRESSSTATUS</b></a>. It can also see the complete status of the specified open line device by calling <a href="func1_3kj7.htm"><b>lineGetLineDevStatus</b></a>, which returns its information in a structure of the type <a href="struc2_7i0i.htm"><b>LINEDEVSTATUS</b></a>. </p>
