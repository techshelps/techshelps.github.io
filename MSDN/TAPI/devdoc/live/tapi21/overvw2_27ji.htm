<h3><a name="_win32_call_completion"></a>Call Completion</h3>
<p>
When making an outbound call, the unavailability of certain resources can prevent the call from reaching the <i>connected</i> state, as when the destination party is busy or doesn't answer. Unavailable resources include trunk circuits as well as the destination party's station. The <a href="func1_9ffw.htm"><b>lineCompleteCall</b></a> function lets the application specify how it wants to complete a call that cannot be completed normally—this is called "placing a call-completion request." The application has the following options: 
<ul>
<li>
<b>Camp on</b> queues the call until the call can be completed. </li>
<li>
<b>Call back</b> requests the called station to return the call when the station returns to idle. Answering the call-back can automatically reinitiate (redial) the connection request. </li>
<li>
<b>Intrude</b> allows the application to barge in to the existing call. </li>
<li>
<b>Message</b> (also known as "leave word calling") allows the application to send one of a small number of predefined messages to the destination. These messages can be text shown on the phone's display, a voice message left for the user, and so forth. </li>
</ul>
<p>
A call completion request can be canceled with <a href="func2_7y7g.htm"><b>lineUncompleteCall</b></a>. Multiple call completion requests can potentially be outstanding for a given address at any one time. To identify individual requests, the implementation returns a completion identifier. When a call completion request completes and results in a new call, the call completion identifier is available in the <a href="struc1_0twy.htm"><b>LINECALLINFO</b></a> data structure returned by <a href="func1_5zov.htm"><b>lineGetCallInfo</b></a>. Canceling a call completion request in progress also uses this call completion identifier. </p>
<p>
In TAPI version 2.0 and later, the LINECALLREASON_CAMPEDON bit allows a service provider to indicate when a new call was camped on to an address. </p>
