<h3><a name="_win32_the_call_is_answered_elsewhere"></a>The Call is Answered Elsewhere</h3>
<p>
This scenario is similar to a call without an owner, but the user answers the phone elsewhere on the line, and this answer is detected by the provider through the hardware. The call is reported as being in the <i>connected</i> state, though it is not connected to any application on the local computer. The call eventually goes <i>idle</i>, at which point each application (monitoring as well as all owner applications) must deallocate its handle. </p>
<p>
The following steps describe what occurs in a scenario in which a line has only monitoring applications, the service provider is configured to not answer new calls by itself, and a call comes in: 
<ul>
<li>
The service provider passes the call handle to TAPI. </li>
<li>
TAPI passes monitor handles to the monitoring applications. </li>
<li>
TAPI determines that the call is in the <i>offering</i> (not <i>connected</i>) state and lets the call "sit." </li>
<li>
The user picks up a ringing downline phone, and the call becomes <i>connected</i>. </li>
<li>
All monitoring applications are sent a corresponding <a href="msgs_1eud.htm">LINE_CALLSTATE</a> message. </li>
<li>
The user eventually hangs up the downline phone, and the call reverts to the <i>idle</i> state. </li>
<li>
The monitor applications are notified the call is <i>idle</i> and deallocate their handles, if they have not already done so. </li>
<li>
The last deallocation causes a <b>TSPI_lineCloseCall</b>. </li>
</ul>
