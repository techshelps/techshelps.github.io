<h1><a name="_win32_linedevstate__constants"></a>LINEDEVSTATE_ Constants</h1>
<p>
The LINEDEVSTATE_ bit-flag constants describe various line status events. 
<dl>
<dt>
LINEDEVSTATE_OTHER </dt>
<dd>
Device-status items other than those listed below have changed. The application should check the current device status to determine which items have changed. </dd>
<dt>
LINEDEVSTATE_RINGING </dt>
<dd>
The switch tells the line to alert the user. Service providers notify applications on each ring cycle by sending <a href="msgs_7het.htm">LINE_LINEDEVSTATE</a> messages containing this constant. For example, in the United States, service providers send a message with this constant every six seconds. </dd>
<dt>
LINEDEVSTATE_CONNECTED </dt>
<dd>
The line was previously disconnected and is now connected to TAPI. </dd>
<dt>
LINEDEVSTATE_DISCONNECTED </dt>
<dd>
This line was previously connected and is now disconnected from TAPI. </dd>
<dt>
LINEDEVSTATE_MSGWAITON </dt>
<dd>
The message waiting indicator is turned on. </dd>
<dt>
LINEDEVSTATE_MSGWAITOFF </dt>
<dd>
The message waiting indicator is turned off. </dd>
<dt>
LINEDEVSTATE_INSERVICE </dt>
<dd>
The line is connected to TAPI. This happens when TAPI is first activated or when the line wire is physically plugged in and in-service at the switch while TAPI is active. </dd>
<dt>
LINEDEVSTATE_OUTOFSERVICE </dt>
<dd>
The line is out of service at the switch or physically disconnected. TAPI cannot be used to operate on the line device. </dd>
<dt>
LINEDEVSTATE_MAINTENANCE </dt>
<dd>
Maintenance is being performed on the line at the switch. TAPI cannot be used to operate on the line device. </dd>
<dt>
LINEDEVSTATE_OPEN </dt>
<dd>
The line has been opened by another application. </dd>
<dt>
LINEDEVSTATE_CLOSE </dt>
<dd>
The line has been closed by another application. </dd>
<dt>
LINEDEVSTATE_NUMCALLS </dt>
<dd>
The number of calls on the line device has changed. </dd>
<dt>
LINEDEVSTATE_NUMCOMPLETIONS </dt>
<dd>
The number of outstanding call completions on the line device has changed. </dd>
<dt>
LINEDEVSTATE_TERMINALS </dt>
<dd>
The terminal settings have changed. This can happen, for example, if multiple line devices share terminals among them (for example, two lines sharing a phone terminal). </dd>
<dt>
LINEDEVSTATE_ROAMMODE </dt>
<dd>
The roam mode of the line device has changed. </dd>
<dt>
LINEDEVSTATE_BATTERY </dt>
<dd>
The battery level has changed significantly (cellular). </dd>
<dt>
LINEDEVSTATE_SIGNAL </dt>
<dd>
The signal level has changed significantly (cellular). </dd>
<dt>
LINEDEVSTATE_DEVSPECIFIC </dt>
<dd>
The line's device-specific information has changed. </dd>
<dt>
LINEDEVSTATE_REINIT </dt>
<dd>
Items have changed in the configuration of line devices. To become aware of these changes (as for the appearance of new line devices) the application should reinitialize its use of TAPI. </dd>
<dt>
LINEDEVSTATE_LOCK </dt>
<dd>
The locked status of the line device has changed. (For more information, see LINEDEVSTATUSFLAGS_LOCKED in <a href="constnts_7ylv.htm">LINEDEVSTATUSFLAGS_ Constants</a>.) </dd>
<dt>
LINEDEVSTATE_CAPSCHANGE </dt>
<dd>
Indicates that, due to configuration changes made by the user or other circumstances, one or more of the members in the <a href="struc2_30mq.htm"><b>LINEDEVCAPS</b></a> structure for the address have changed. The application should use <a href="func1_22nn.htm"><b>lineGetDevCaps</b></a> to read the updated structure. If a service provider sends a <a href="msgs_7het.htm">LINE_LINEDEVSTATE</a> message containing this value to TAPI, TAPI will pass it along to applications that have negotiated TAPI version 1.4 or later; applications negotiating a previous API version will receive LINE_LINEDEVSTATE messages specifying LINEDEVSTATE_REINIT, requiring them to shutdown and reinitialize their connection to TAPI to obtain the updated information. </dd>
<dt>
LINEDEVSTATE_CONFIGCHANGE </dt>
<dd>
Indicates that configuration changes have been made to one or more of the media devices associated with the line device. The application, if it desires, can use <a href="func1_6ckn.htm"><b>lineGetDevConfig</b></a> to read the updated information. If a service provider sends a LINE_LINEDEVSTATE message containing this value to TAPI, TAPI will pass it along to applications that have negotiated TAPI version 1.4 or later; applications negotiating a previous API version will not receive any notification. </dd>
<dt>
LINEDEVSTATE_TRANSLATECHANGE </dt>
<dd>
Indicates that, due to configuration changes made by the user or other circumstances, one or more of the members in the <a href="struc2_1pf6.htm"><b>LINETRANSLATECAPS</b></a> structure have changed. The application should use <a href="func1_09o3.htm"><b>lineGetTranslateCaps</b></a> to read the updated structure. If a service provider sends a <a href="msgs_7het.htm">LINE_LINEDEVSTATE</a> message containing this value to TAPI, TAPI will pass it along to applications that have negotiated TAPI version 1.4 or later; applications negotiating a previous API version will receive LINE_LINEDEVSTATE messages specifying LINEDEVSTATE_REINIT, requiring them to shutdown and reinitialize their connection to TAPI to obtain the updated information. </dd>
<dt>
LINEDEVSTATE_COMPLCANCEL </dt>
<dd>
Indicates that the call completion identified by the completion identifier contained in the <i>dwParam2</i> parameter of the LINE_LINEDEVSTATE message has been externally canceled and is no longer considered valid (if that value were to be passed in a subsequent call to <a href="func2_7y7g.htm"><b>lineUncompleteCall</b></a>, the function would fail with LINEERR_INVALCOMPLETIONID). If a service provider sends a <a href="msgs_7het.htm">LINE_LINEDEVSTATE</a> message containing this value to TAPI, TAPI will pass it along to applications which have negotiated TAPI version 1.4 or later; applications negotiating a previous API version will not receive any notification. </dd>
<dt>
LINEDEVSTATE_REMOVED </dt>
<dd>
Indicates that the device is being removed from the system by the service provider (most likely through user action, through a control panel or similar utility). A LINE_LINEDEVSTATE message with this value will normally be immediately followed by a <a href="msgs_7nad.htm">LINE_CLOSE</a> message on the device. Subsequent attempts to access the device prior to TAPI being reinitialized will result in LINEERR_NODEVICE being returned to the application. If a service provider sends a <a href="msgs_7het.htm">LINE_LINEDEVSTATE</a> message containing this value to TAPI, TAPI will pass it along to applications that have negotiated TAPI version 1.4 or later; applications negotiating a previous API version will not receive any notification.
