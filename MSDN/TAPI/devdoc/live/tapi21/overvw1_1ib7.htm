<h2><a name="_win32_communication_between_applications"></a>Communication Between Applications</h2>
<p>
Applications can communicate with each other by writing to and reading from a field in a specified call's information record, the <a href="struc1_0twy.htm"><b>LINECALLINFO</b></a> data structure. With <a href="func2_5kmb.htm"><b>lineSetAppSpecific</b></a>, any owner application can write to the application-specific member called <b>dwAppSpecific</b>. It is uninterpreted by the Telephony API or any of its service providers. This member's usage is entirely controlled by applications. </p>
<p>
The member can be read from the <b>LINECALLINFO</b> record returned by <a href="func1_5zov.htm"><b>lineGetCallInfo</b></a>. However, <b>lineSetAppSpecific</b> must be used to set the member so that changes become visible to other applications. When this member is changed, all other applications with call handles are sent a <a href="msgs_22cv.htm">LINE_CALLINFO</a> message with an indication that the <b>dwAppSpecific</b> member has changed. </p>
