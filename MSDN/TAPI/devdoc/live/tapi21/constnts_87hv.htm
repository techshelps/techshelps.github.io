<h1><a name="_win32_linebusymode__constants"></a>LINEBUSYMODE_ Constants</h1>
<p>
The LINEBUSYMODE_ bit-flag constants describe different busy signals that the switch or network can generate. These busy signals typically indicate that a different resource that is required to make a call is currently in use. 
<dl>
<dt>
LINEBUSYMODE_STATION </dt>
<dd>
The busy signal indicates that the called party's station is busy. This is usually signaled with a <i>normal</i> busy tone. </dd>
<dt>
LINEBUSYMODE_TRUNK </dt>
<dd>
The busy signal indicates that a trunk or circuit is busy. This is usually signaled with a <i>fast</i> busy tone. </dd>
<dt>
LINEBUSYMODE_UNKNOWN </dt>
<dd>
The busy signal's specific mode is currently unknown but may become known later. </dd>
<dt>
LINEBUSYMODE_UNAVAIL </dt>
<dd>
The busy signal's specific mode is unavailable and will not become known. 
</dd>
</dl>
<p>
The high-order 16 bits can be assigned for device-specific extensions. The low-order 16 bits are reserved. </p>
<p>
<b>Note</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;Busy signals can be sent as inband tones or out-of-band messages. TAPI makes no assumption about the specific signaling mechanism. </p>
