<h3><a name="_win32_call_pickup"></a>Call Pickup</h3>
<p>
Call pickup allows an application to answer a call that is alerting at another address. The application invokes <a href="func2_2j00.htm"><b>linePickup</b></a> by identifying the target of the pickup and is returned a call handle for the picked-up call. There are several ways to specify the target of the pickup request. First, specify the address (extension) of the alerting party. Second, if no extension is specified and the switch allows it, the application can pick up any ringing phone in its pickup group. Third, some switches require a group identifier to identify the group to which the ringing extensions belongs. </p>
<p>
After the call has been picked up, it is diverted to the application and the application is sent appropriate <a href="msgs_1eud.htm">LINE_CALLSTATE</a> messages for the call. An application can invoke <a href="func1_5zov.htm"><b>lineGetCallInfo</b></a> for information about the picked-up call, if provided by the switch. </p>
<p>
Some key telephone systems support a <i>transfer through hold </i>capability on bridged-exclusive call appearances. In this scheme, a call is owned exclusively by a particular phone when it is active, but when the call is on hold it can be picked up on any phone that has an appearance of the line. In TAPI version 2.0 and later, an application can use the <b>linePickup</b> function with a NULL target address for this purpose, similar to how the function is used to pick up a call waiting call on an analog line. LINEADDRFEATURE_PICKUPHELD indicates the existence of the capability (in <a href="struc1_606q.htm"><b>LINEADDRESSCAPS</b></a>) and when it can be invoked (in <a href="struc1_4xki.htm"><b>LINEADDRESSSTATUS</b></a>). </p>
