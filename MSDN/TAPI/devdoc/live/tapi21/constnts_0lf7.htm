<h1><a name="_win32_phonestate__constants"></a>PHONESTATE_ Constants</h1>
<p>
The PHONESTATE_ bit-flag constants describe various status items for a phone device. 
<dl>
<dt>
PHONESTATE_OTHER </dt>
<dd>
Phone-status items other than those listed below have changed. The application should check the current phone status to determine which items have changed. </dd>
<dt>
PHONESTATE_CONNECTED </dt>
<dd>
The connection between the phone device and TAPI was just made. This happens when TAPI is first invoked or when the wire connecting the phone to the PC is plugged in with TAPI active. </dd>
<dt>
PHONESTATE_DISCONNECTED </dt>
<dd>
The connection between the phone device and TAPI was just broken. This happens when the wire connecting the phone set to the PC is unplugged while TAPI is active. </dd>
<dt>
PHONESTATE_OWNER </dt>
<dd>
The number of owners for the phone device. </dd>
<dt>
PHONESTATE_MONITORS </dt>
<dd>
The number of monitors for the phone device. </dd>
<dt>
PHONESTATE_DISPLAY </dt>
<dd>
The display of the phone has changed. </dd>
<dt>
PHONESTATE_LAMP </dt>
<dd>
A lamp of the phone has changed. </dd>
<dt>
PHONESTATE_RINGMODE </dt>
<dd>
The ring mode of the phone has changed. </dd>
<dt>
PHONESTATE_RINGVOLUME </dt>
<dd>
The ring volume of the phone has changed. </dd>
<dt>
PHONESTATE_HANDSETHOOKSWITCH </dt>
<dd>
The handset hookswitch state has changed. </dd>
<dt>
PHONESTATE_HANDSETVOLUME </dt>
<dd>
The handset's speaker volume setting has changed. </dd>
<dt>
PHONESTATE_HANDSETGAIN </dt>
<dd>
The handset's microphone gain setting has changed. </dd>
<dt>
PHONESTATE_SPEAKERHOOKSWITCH </dt>
<dd>
The speakerphone's hookswitch state has changed. </dd>
<dt>
PHONESTATE_SPEAKERVOLUME </dt>
<dd>
The speakerphone's speaker volume setting has changed. </dd>
<dt>
PHONESTATE_SPEAKERGAIN </dt>
<dd>
The speakerphone's microphone gain setting state has changed. </dd>
<dt>
PHONESTATE_HEADSETHOOKSWITCH </dt>
<dd>
The headset's hookswitch state has changed. </dd>
<dt>
PHONESTATE_HEADSETVOLUME </dt>
<dd>
The headset's speaker volume setting has changed. </dd>
<dt>
PHONESTATE_HEADSETGAIN </dt>
<dd>
The headset's microphone gain setting has changed. </dd>
<dt>
PHONESTATE_SUSPEND </dt>
<dd>
The application's use of the phone is temporarily suspended. </dd>
<dt>
PHONESTATE_RESUME </dt>
<dd>
The application's use of the phone device is resumed after having been suspended for some time. </dd>
<dt>
PHONESTATE_DEVSPECIFIC </dt>
<dd>
The phone's device-specific information has changed. </dd>
<dt>
PHONESTATE_REINIT </dt>
<dd>
Items have changed in the configuration of phone devices. To become aware of these changes (as for the appearance of new phone devices), the application should reinitialize its use of TAPI. </dd>
<dt>
PHONESTATE_CAPSCHANGE </dt>
<dd>
Indicates that, due to configuration changes made by the user or other circumstances, one or more of the members in the <a href="struc2_8x6a.htm"><b>PHONECAPS</b></a> structure have changed. The application should use <a href="func2_0eib.htm"><b>phoneGetDevCaps</b></a> to read the updated structure. If a service provider sends a <a href="msgs_6wkl.htm">PHONE_STATE</a> message containing this value to TAPI, TAPI will pass it along to applications that have negotiated TAPI version 1.4 or later; applications negotiating a previous API version will receive PHONE_STATE messages specifying PHONESTATE_REINIT, requiring them to shutdown and reinitialize their connection to TAPI to obtain the updated information. </dd>
<dt>
PHONESTATE_REMOVED </dt>
<dd>
Indicates that the device is being removed from the system by the service provider (most likely through user action, through a control panel or similar utility). A <a href="msgs_6wkl.htm">PHONE_STATE</a> message with this value will normally be immediately followed by a <a href="msgs_9oh1.htm">PHONE_CLOSE</a> message on the device. Subsequent attempts to access the device prior to TAPI being reinitialized will result in PHONEERR_NODEVICE being returned to the application. If a service provider sends a PHONE_STATE message containing this value to TAPI, TAPI will pass it along to applications that have negotiated TAPI version 1.4 or later; applications negotiating a previous API version will not receive any notification.
