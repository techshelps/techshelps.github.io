<h2><a name="_win32_generating_inband_digits_and_tones"></a>Generating Inband Digits and Tones</h2>
<p>
After a call is in the <i>connected</i> state, information can be transmitted over it. Two functions are provided that allow end-to-end inband signaling between the application and remote station equipment such as an answering machine. One function is <a href="func1_1c37.htm"><b>lineGenerateDigits</b></a>, which generates inband digits on a call, signaling them over the voice channel. Digits can be signaled as either rotary/pulse sequences or as DTMF tones. The other function is <a href="func1_899h.htm"><b>lineGenerateTone</b></a>, which enables the application to generate one of a variety of multifrequency tones inband (over the media stream). This generates telephony tones, such as ringback, beep, and busy, as well as arbitrary multifrequency, multicadenced tones. </p>
<p>
Only one digit or tone generation can be in progress on a call at any one time. When digit or tone generation completes, a <a href="msgs_0mzp.htm">LINE_GENERATE</a> message is sent to the application that requested the generation. In the case where multiple digits are generated, only a single message is sent back after all digits have been generated. Calling <b>lineGenerateDigits</b> or <b>lineGenerateTone</b> while digit or tone generation is in progress will abort the generation currently in progress and send the LINE_GENERATE message to the application whose generation was aborted with a <i>cancel</i> indication. </p>
