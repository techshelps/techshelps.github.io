<h1><a name="_win32_line_monitormedia"></a>LINE_MONITORMEDIA</h1>
<p>
The LINE_MONITORMEDIA message is sent when a change in the call's media mode is detected. The sending of this message is controlled with the <a href="func2_94wx.htm"><b>lineMonitorMedia</b></a> function. </p>
<pre><code>LINE_MONITORMEDIA
dwDevice = (DWORD) hCall;
dwCallbackInstance = (DWORD) hCallback;
dwParam1 = (DWORD) MediaMode;
dwParam2 = (DWORD) 0;
dwParam3 = (DWORD) 0;
 </code></pre>
<h4>Parameters</h4>
<dl>
<dt>
<i>dwDevice</i> </dt>
<dd>
A handle to the call. </dd>
<dt>
<i>dwCallbackInstance</i> </dt>
<dd>
The callback instance supplied when opening the line. </dd>
<dt>
<i>dwParam1</i> </dt>
<dd>
The new media mode. This parameter must be one and only one of the following LINEMEDIAMODE_ constants: 
<dl>
<dt>
LINEMEDIAMODE_INTERACTIVEVOICE </dt>
<dd>
The presence of voice energy has been detected and the call is treated as an interactive call with humans on both ends. </dd>
<dt>
LINEMEDIAMODE_AUTOMATEDVOICE </dt>
<dd>
The presence of voice energy has been detected and the call is locally handled by an automated application. </dd>
<dt>
LINEMEDIAMODE_DATAMODEM </dt>
<dd>
A data modem session has been detected. </dd>
<dt>
LINEMEDIAMODE_G3FAX </dt>
<dd>
A group 3 fax has been detected. </dd>
<dt>
LINEMEDIAMODE_G4FAX </dt>
<dd>
A group 4 fax has been detected. </dd>
<dt>
LINEMEDIAMODE_TDD </dt>
<dd>
A TDD (Telephony Devices for the Deaf) session has been detected. </dd>
<dt>
LINEMEDIAMODE_DIGITALDATA </dt>
<dd>
Digital data has been detected. </dd>
<dt>
LINEMEDIAMODE_TELETEX </dt>
<dd>
A teletex session has been detected. Teletex is one of the telematic services. </dd>
<dt>
LINEMEDIAMODE_VIDEOTEX </dt>
<dd>
A videotex session has been detected. Videotex is one the telematic services. </dd>
<dt>
LINEMEDIAMODE_TELEX </dt>
<dd>
A telex session has been detected. Telex is one the telematic services. </dd>
<dt>
LINEMEDIAMODE_MIXED </dt>
<dd>
A mixed session has been detected. Mixed is one the telematic services. </dd>
<dt>
LINEMEDIAMODE_ADSI </dt>
<dd>
An ADSI (Analog Display Services Interface) session has been detected. </dd>
<dt>
LINEMEDIAMODE_VOICEVIEW </dt>
<dd>
The media mode of the call is VoiceView. </dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dt>
<i>dwParam2</i> </dt>
<dd>
Unused. </dd>
<dt>
<i>dwParam3</i> </dt>
<dd>
The "tick count" (number of milliseconds since Windows started) at which the specified media was detected. For API versions earlier than 2.0, this parameter is unused. 
</dd>
</dl>
<h4>Return Values</h4>
<p>
No return value. </p>
<h4>Remarks</h4>
<p>
The LINE_MONITORMEDIA message is sent to the application that has enabled media monitoring for the media mode detected. </p>
<p>
Because this timestamp may have been generated on a computer other than the one on which the application is executing, it is useful only for comparison to other similarly timestamped messages generated on the same line device (LINE_GATHERDIGITS, LINE_GENERATE, LINE_MONITORDIGITS, LINE_MONITORTONE), in order to determine their <i>relative</i> timing (separation between events). The tick count can "wrap around" after approximately 49.7 days; applications must take this into account when performing calculations. </p>
<p>
If the service provider does not generate the timestamp (for example, if it was created using an earlier version of TAPI), then TAPI provides a timestamp at the point closest to the service provider generating the event so that the synthesized timestamp is as accurate as possible. </p>
<h4>QuickInfo</h4>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Version:</b> Use TAPI version 1.4 and later.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Header:</b> Declared in tapi.h.</p>
