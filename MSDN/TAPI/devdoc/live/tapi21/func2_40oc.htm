<h1><a name="_win32_tapirequestmakecall"></a>tapiRequestMakeCall</h1>
<p>
The <b>tapiRequestMakeCall</b> function requests the establishment of a voice call. A call-manager application is responsible for establishing the call on behalf of the requesting application, which is then controlled by the user's call-manager application. </p>
<pre><code><b>LONG tapiRequestMakeCall(
  LPCSTR</b><i> lpszDestAddress</i><b>,  </b>
<b>  LPCSTR</b><i> lpszAppName</i><b>,  </b>
<b>  LPCSTR</b><i> lpszCalledParty</i><b>,  </b>
<b>  LPCSTR</b><i> lpszComment   </i>
<b>);</b>
 </code></pre>
<h4>Parameters</h4>
<dl>
<dt>
<i>lpszDestAddress</i> </dt>
<dd>
A pointer to a memory location where the NULL-terminated destination address of the call request is located. The address can use the canonical address format (address formats are discussed in <a href="overvw2_19h3.htm">Line Devices Overview</a>) or the dialable address format. Validity of the specified address is not checked by this operation. The maximum length of the address is TAPIMAXDESTADDRESSSIZE characters, which includes the NULL terminator. </dd>
<dt>
<i>lpszAppName</i> </dt>
<dd>
A pointer to a memory location where the ASCII NULL-terminated user-friendly application name of the call request is located. This pointer can be left NULL if the application does not supply an application name. The maximum length of the address is TAPIMAXAPPNAMESIZE characters, which includes the NULL terminator. Longer strings are truncated. </dd>
<dt>
<i>lpszCalledParty</i> </dt>
<dd>
A pointer to a memory location where the ASCII NULL-terminated called party name for the called party of the call is located. This pointer can be left NULL if the application does not wish to supply this information. The maximum length of the string is TAPIMAXCALLEDPARTYSIZE characters, which includes the NULL terminator. Longer strings are truncated. </dd>
<dt>
<i>lpszComment</i> </dt>
<dd>
A pointer to a memory location where the ASCII NULL-terminated comment about the call is located. This pointer can be left NULL if the application does not supply a comment. The maximum length of the address is TAPIMAXCOMMENTSIZE characters, which includes the NULL terminator. Longer strings are truncated. 
</dd>
</dl>
<h4>Return Values</h4>
<p>
Returns zero if the request succeeds or a negative error number if an error occurs. Possible error return value are: </p>
<p>
TAPIERR_NOREQUESTRECIPIENT, TAPIERR_INVALDESTADDRESS, TAPIERR_REQUESTQUEUEFULL, TAPIERR_INVALPOINTER.</p>
<h4>Remarks</h4>
<p>
A telephony-enabled application can request that a call be placed on its behalf by invoking <b>tapiRequestMakeCall</b>, providing only the destination address for the call. This request is forwarded to the user's call-control application, which places the call on behalf of the original application. A default call-control application is provided as part of Win32 Telephony. Users can replace this with a call-control application of their choice. </p>
<p>
Invoking <b>tapiRequestMakeCall</b> when no call control application is running returns the TAPIERR_NOREQUESTRECIPIENT error indication. If the call control application is not running, TAPI attempts to launch the highest-priority call control application (which is listed for <b>RequestMakeCall</b> in the registry). Invoking this function when the Assisted TAPI request queue is full returns the TAPIERR_REQUESTQUEUEFULL error. </p>
