<h2><a name="_win32_tapi_version_2.1"></a>TAPI Version 2.1</h2>
<p>
TAPI version 2.1 made no changes to the previous TAPI 2.0 specification except for one major addition: Client-server functionality. Now telephony hardware can be installed on a telephony server that can be accessed from any computer on a network. A new set of functions were added to allow administration DLLs to be written to control who has access to remote resources.</p>
<p>
TAPI 2.1 system components are redistributable to both Windows NT 4.0 and Windows 95. Future versions of both operating systems will come with TAPI 2.1 (or a later version) already installed. For Windows 95, this has further implications—it allows Windows 95 to support 32-bit TSPs. TSPs can be developed to run on both Windows 95 and Windows NT 4.0.</p>
<p>
The TAPI 2.1 system binaries, when installed on Windows NT, support exactly the same applications and TSPs as TAPI 2.0, with the addition of TAPI 2.1 support.</p>
<p>
The TAPI 2.1 system binaries, when installed on Windows 95, support:
<ul>
<li>
Win16 TAPI 1.3 and TAPI 1.4 applications</li>
<li>
Win32 TAPI 1.3, TAPI 1.4 and TAPI 2.0 applications</li>
<li>
Win16 TAPI 1.3 and TAPI 1.4 TSPs</li>
<li>
Win32 TAPI 2.0 TSPs</li>
</ul>
