<h1><a name="_win32_linedisconnectmode__constants"></a>LINEDISCONNECTMODE_ Constants</h1>
<p>
The LINEDISCONNECTMODE_ bit-flag constants describe different reasons for a remote disconnect request. A disconnect mode is available as call status to the application after the call state transitions to <i>disconnected</i>. 
<dl>
<dt>
LINEDISCONNECTMODE_NORMAL </dt>
<dd>
This is a normal disconnect request by the remote party. The call was terminated normally. </dd>
<dt>
LINEDISCONNECTMODE_UNKNOWN </dt>
<dd>
The reason for the disconnect request is unknown but may become known later. </dd>
<dt>
LINEDISCONNECTMODE_REJECT </dt>
<dd>
The remote user has rejected the call. </dd>
<dt>
LINEDISCONNECTMODE_PICKUP </dt>
<dd>
The call was picked up from elsewhere. </dd>
<dt>
LINEDISCONNECTMODE_FORWARDED </dt>
<dd>
The call was forwarded by the switch. </dd>
<dt>
LINEDISCONNECTMODE_BUSY </dt>
<dd>
The remote user's station is busy. </dd>
<dt>
LINEDISCONNECTMODE_NOANSWER </dt>
<dd>
The remote user's station does not answer. </dd>
<dt>
LINEDISCONNECTMODE_BADADDRESS </dt>
<dd>
The destination address is invalid. </dd>
<dt>
LINEDISCONNECTMODE_UNREACHABLE </dt>
<dd>
The remote user could not be reached. </dd>
<dt>
LINEDISCONNECTMODE_CONGESTION </dt>
<dd>
The network is congested. </dd>
<dt>
LINEDISCONNECTMODE_INCOMPATIBLE </dt>
<dd>
The remote user's station equipment is incompatible with the type of call requested. </dd>
<dt>
LINEDISCONNECTMODE_UNAVAIL </dt>
<dd>
The reason for the disconnect is unavailable and will not become known later. </dd>
<dt>
LINEDISCONNECTMODE_NODIALTONE </dt>
<dd>
A dial tone was not detected within a service-provider defined timeout, at a point during dialing when one was expected (such as at a "W" in the dialable string). This can also occur without a service-provider-defined timeout period or without a value specified in the <b>dwWaitForDialTone</b> member of the <a href="struc2_5u9e.htm"><b>LINEDIALPARAMS</b></a> structure. </dd>
<dt>
LINEDISCONNECTMODE_NUMBERCHANGED </dt>
<dd>
The call could not be connected because the destination number has been changed, but automatic redirection to the new number is not provided. </dd>
<dt>
LINEDISCONNECTMODE_OUTOFORDER </dt>
<dd>
The call could not be connected or was disconnected because the destination device is out of order (hardware failure). </dd>
<dt>
LINEDISCONNECTMODE_TEMPFAILURE </dt>
<dd>
The call could not be connected or was disconnected because of a temporary failure in the network; the call can be reattempted later and will eventually complete. 
<p>
LINEDISCONNECTMODE_TEMPFAILURE is appropriate as a <i>delayed</i> response. For example, a modem getting a busy signal or equivalent too many times in a particular time period concludes that the number should not be called again until a defined time has elapsed and issues a 'delayed' response.
</dd>
<dt>
LINEDISCONNECTMODE_QOSUNAVAIL </dt>
<dd>
The call could not be connected or was disconnected because the minimum quality of service could not be obtained or sustained. This differs from LINEDISCONNECTMODE_INCOMPATIBLE in that the lack of resources may be a temporary condition at the destination. </dd>
<dt>
LINEDISCONNECTMODE_BLOCKED </dt>
<dd>
The call could not be connected because calls from the origination address are not being accepted at the destination address. This differs from LINEDISCONNECTMODE_REJECT in that blocking is implemented in the network (a passive reject) while a rejection is implemented in the destination equipment (an active reject). The blocking can be due to a specific exclusion of the origination address, or because the destination accepts calls from only a selected set of origination address (closed user group). 
<p>
LINEDISCONNECTMODE_BLOCKED is appropriate as a <i>blacklisted</i> response. For example, a modem has received an answer, gone more than six seconds without detecting Ringback, failed to connect a defined number of times, determines that the phone number is not valid to call, and issues a 'blacklisted' response.
</dd>
<dt>
LINEDISCONNECTMODE_DONOTDISTURB </dt>
<dd>
The call could not be connected because the destination has invoked the Do Not Disturb feature. 
</dd>
</dl>
<p>
The high-order 16 bits can be assigned for device-specific extensions. The low-order 16 bits are reserved. </p>
<p>
A remote disconnect request for a given call results in the call state transitioning to the <i>disconnected</i> state and a <a href="msgs_1eud.htm">LINE_CALLSTATE</a> message is sent to the application. The LINEDISCONNECTMODE_ information provides details about the remote disconnect request. It is available in the call's <a href="struc1_0p9u.htm"><b>LINECALLSTATUS</b></a> structure when the call is in the <i>disconnected</i> state. While a call is in this state, the application is still allowed to query the call's information and status. For example, user-user information that is received as part of the remote disconnect is available then. The application can clear a <i>disconnected</i> call by dropping the call. </p>
<p>
For backward compatibility, it is the responsibility of the service provider to examine the negotiated API version on the line, and to not use this LINEDISCONNECTMODE_ value if it is not supported on the negotiated version (LINEDISCONNECTMODE_NORMAL or _UNKNOWN could be used instead). </p>
