<dd>
An address with private sharing mode is only assigned to a single line or station. </dd>
<dt>
LINEADDRESSSHARING_BRIDGEDEXCL </dt>
<dd>
An address with a bridged-exclusive sharing mode is assigned to one or more other lines or stations. The exclusive portion refers to the fact that only one of the bridged parties can be connected with a remote party at any given time. </dd>
<dt>
LINEADDRESSSHARING_BRIDGEDNEW </dt>
<dd>
An address with a bridged-new sharing mode is assigned to one or more other lines or stations. The new portion refers to the fact that activities by the different bridged parties result in the creation of new calls on the address. </dd>
<dt>
LINEADDRESSSHARING_BRIDGEDSHARED </dt>
<dd>
An address with a bridged-shared sharing mode is also assigned to one or more other lines or stations. The shared portion refers to the fact that if one of the bridged parties is connected with a remote party, the remaining bridged parties can share in the conversation (as in a conference) by activating that call appearance. </dd>
<dt>
LINEADDRESSSHARING_MONITORED </dt>
<dd>
An address with a monitored address mode simply monitors the status of that address. The status is either idle or in use. The message <a href="msgs_7ch1.htm">LINE_ADDRESSSTATE</a> notifies the application about these changes. </dd>
</dl>
</dd>

<dt>
LINEADDRESSSTATE_CAPSCHANGE </dt>
<dd>
Indicates that due to configuration changes made by the user or other circumstances, one or more of the members in the <b>LINEADDRESSCAPS</b> structure for the address have changed.

<b>dwCallFeatures</b> </dt>
<dd>
Specifies the switching capabilities or features available for all calls on this address using the LINECALLFEATURE_ constants.

A one indicates that the corresponding feature may be available if the application has the right privileges to the call and the call is in the appropriate state for the operation to be meaningful.

<h4>Remarks</h4>
<p>
Device-specific extensions should use the <b>DevSpecific</b> (<b>dwDevSpecificSize</b> and <b>dwDevSpecificOffset</b>) variably sized area of this data structure. </p>
<p>
Older applications are compiled without this member in the <b>LINEADDRESSCAPS</b> structure, and using a <b>SIZEOF</b> <b>LINEADDRESSCAPS</b> smaller than the new size. The application passes in a <i>dwAPIVersion</i> parameter with the <a href="func1_7wfn.htm"><b>lineGetAddressCaps</b></a> function, which can be used for guidance by TAPI in handling this situation. If the application passes in a <b>dwTotalSize</b> member less than the size of the fixed portion of the structure as defined in the <b>dwAPIVersion</b> member specified, LINEERR_STRUCTURETOOSMALL is returned. If sufficient memory has been allocated by the application, before calling <b>TSPI_lineGetAddressCaps</b>, TAPI sets the <b>dwNeededSize</b> and <b>dwUsedSize</b> members to the fixed size of the structure as it existed in the specified API version. </p>
<p>
New service providers (that support the new API version) must examine the API version passed in. If the API version is less than the highest version supported by the provider, the service provider must not fill in fields not supported in older API versions, as these would fall in the variable portion of the older structure. </p>
<p>
New applications must be cognizant of the API version negotiated, and not examine the contents of fields in the fixed portion beyond the original end of the fixed portion of the structure for the negotiated API version. </p>
<p>
The members <b>dwPredictiveAutoTransferStates</b> through <b>dwAvailableMediaModes</b> are available only to applications that request an API version of 2.0 or later when calling <b>lineGetAddressCaps</b>. </p>
<h4>QuickInfo</h4>
