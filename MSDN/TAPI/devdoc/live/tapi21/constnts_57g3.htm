<h1><a name="_win32_linetranslateresult__constants"></a>LINETRANSLATERESULT_ Constants</h1>
<p>
The LINETRANSLATERESULT_ bit-flag constants describe various results of an address translation. 
<dl>
<dt>
LINETRANSLATERESULT_CANONICAL </dt>
<dd>
Indicates that the input string was in valid canonical format. </dd>
<dt>
LINETRANSLATERESULT_INTERNATIONAL </dt>
<dd>
Indicates that the call is being treated as an international call (country code specified in the destination address is different from the country code specified for the <b>CurrentLocation</b>). </dd>
<dt>
LINETRANSLATERESULT_LONGDISTANCE </dt>
<dd>
Indicates that the call is being treated as a long distance call (country code specified in the destination address is the same but area code is different from those specified for the <b>CurrentLocation</b>). </dd>
<dt>
LINETRANSLATERESULT_LOCAL </dt>
<dd>
Indicates that the call is being treated as a local call (country code and area code specified in the destination address are the same as those specified for the <b>CurrentLocation</b>). </dd>
<dt>
LINETRANSLATERESULT_INTOLLLIST </dt>
<dd>
Indicates that the local call is being dialed as long distance because the country has toll calling and the prefix appears in the <b>TollPrefixList </b>of the <b>CurrentLocation</b>. </dd>
<dt>
LINETRANSLATERESULT_NOTINTOLLLIST </dt>
<dd>
Indicates that the country supports toll calling but the prefix does not appear in the <b>TollPrefixList</b>, so the call is dialed as a local call. Note that if both INTOLLIST and NOTINTOLLIST are off, the current country does not support toll prefixes, and user-interface elements related to toll prefixes should not be presented to the user; if either such bit is on, the country does support toll lists, and the related user-interface elements should be enabled. </dd>
<dt>
LINETRANSLATERESULT_DIALBILLING </dt>
<dd>
Indicates that the returned address contains a "$". </dd>
<dt>
LINETRANSLATERESULT_DIALQUIET </dt>
<dd>
Indicates that the returned address contain a "@". </dd>
<dt>
LINETRANSLATERESULT_DIALDIALTONE </dt>
<dd>
Indicates that the returned address contains a "W". </dd>
<dt>
LINETRANSLATERESULT_DIALPROMPT </dt>
<dd>
Indicates that the returned address contains a "?". </dd>
<dt>
LINETRANSLATERESULT_VOICEDETECT </dt>
<dd>
Indicates that the returned dialable address contains a ":". 

<p>
<b>Note</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;The ":" (colon) character will be added to the list of characters which can be embedded in a dialable string and passed into destination addresses. Attempting to pass it from an application to a line device that supports an API version earlier than 2.0 will most likely result in LINEERR_INVALADDRESS, or possibly in the character being ignored entirely. The meaning of this character is "Pause until a voice prompt is detected, then continue dialing"; it is intended for use when automatically dialing into systems that give voice prompts, such as long distance calling card processors.
