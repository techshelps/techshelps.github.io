<h2><a name="_win32_logging_calls"></a>Logging Calls</h2>
<p>
<i>Logging</i> a call simply means actively recording the actions and states of a monitored call into a file on a disk. (An application that owns a call is also a monitor of that call.) Though limited call logging is performed by the call manager provided with Win32 Telephony, any application can be programmed to log a call that it is monitoring. </p>
<p>
TAPI facilitates logging by allowing applications to monitor calls and by collecting information from other applications that are controlling calls. TAPI writes the information it collects into the <a href="struc1_0twy.htm"><b>LINECALLINFO</b></a> structure, which can then be read by applications. </p>
