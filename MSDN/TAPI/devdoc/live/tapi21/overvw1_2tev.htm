<p>
If no unknown application has the line open, the TAPI dynamic-link library itself assumes the role of a simplistic unknown application. The TAPI library first passes an owner handle for the call to the highest priority application that is registered for the highest-priority media mode for which a media mode flag is set in the <b>dwMediaMode</b> member of <a href="struc1_0twy.htm"><b>LINECALLINFO</b></a>. If there is no such application, the media mode flag is cleared, and TAPI tries the highest priority application for the next highest-priority media mode. If there is such an application, it can try to make a determination for the highest priority media mode in <b>dwMediaMode</b> in <a href="struc1_0twy.htm"><b>LINECALLINFO</b></a>. </p>
<p>
If no application is found to become the initial owner of a call, the call remains in the <i>offering</i> state until a monitor application becomes an owner through <a href="func2_2m1x.htm"><b>lineSetCallPrivilege</b></a>, or until the call is abandoned by the calling party and is transitioned (by the service provider) to the <i>idle</i> state, at which time all monitoring applications deallocate their handles to the call. </p>
