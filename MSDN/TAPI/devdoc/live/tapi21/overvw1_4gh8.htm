<h2><a name="_win32_taking_ownership_of_a_call"></a>Taking Ownership of a Call</h2>
<p>
In general, when one application learns that another application wants ownership of a call, it simply relinquishes ownership of the call to that other application. Although there can be many co-owners of a call, it should be a transitory state for there to be multiple owners. </p>
<p>
In one specific case, it is valid for an application to actively take ownership of a call owned by another application. This is when the application is instructed to do so by the user—perhaps through a user interface. For example, a fax application may be instructed by a user to break into that same user's existing voice call and use the call to send a fax. In this case, the fax application takes ownership from the previous owner, the application that was controlling the voice call. </p>
<p>
An application can forcibly become owner of a call by taking the following steps: 
<ul>
<li>
Obtain a handle to the call with monitor privilege. If the desired call is one for which the application does not yet have a handle, it should request a handle with <a href="func1_88s3.htm"><b>lineGetNewCalls</b></a>. If the application is already a co-owner of the call and wants to become sole owner, it should start by calling <a href="func2_2m1x.htm"><b>lineSetCallPrivilege</b></a> with the <i>dwCallPrivilege</i> parameter set to LINECALLPRIVILEGE_MONITOR. This action, which relinquishes ownership of the call (temporarily, in this case), is seen by other applications as the departure of an owner. </li>
<li>
Call <b>lineSetCallPrivilege</b> with the <i>dwCallPrivilege</i> parameter set to LINECALLPRIVILEGE_OWNER for the call. Other applications see a new owner coming on line by receiving a <a href="msgs_22cv.htm">LINE_CALLINFO</a> message stating that the number of owners has increased and the number of monitors has changed; the bit LINECALLINFOSTATE_NUMOWNERINCR is on. These applications should yield the call to the new owner but there is no guarantee that they will do so. If the other existing owners do relinquish ownership, the new owner can proceed with what it intended to do on the call. </li>
</ul>
<p>
<b>Note</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no way to shield a call from another application's attempt to become an owner of it, nor is there any reason to do so. Once an application is informed that another application has become an owner, it should draw its activities on the call to an orderly close, and then relinquish ownership, because such changes in ownership are almost always done at the explicit direction of the user. </p>
