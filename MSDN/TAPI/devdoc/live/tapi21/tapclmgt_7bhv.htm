<h3><a name="_win32_limitations"></a>Limitations</h3>
<p>
The developer should be aware of some current user interface (UI) and server connection and service provider management limitations.</p>
<p>
<b>UI Limitations</b></p>
<p>
The current implementation of Remote SP cannot manage user interfaces (UIs) spontaneously created by other service providers (<i>on-the-fly UI</i>), such as the Unimodem <b>Talk/Drop</b> dialog box. The only UI that will work with Remote SP is that which is generated by the TAPI <a href="func1_195z.htm"><b>lineConfigDialog</b></a>, <a href="func1_941g.htm"><b>lineConfigDialogEdit</b></a>, and <a href="func2_7qcn.htm"><b>phoneConfigDialog</b></a> functions. Additionally, the TSPI service provider functions that generate UI (for example, <b>TSPI_providerInstall</b>) do not show the UI of the service provider on the server.</p>
<p>
<b>Server Connections and Service Provider Management Limitations</b></p>
<p>
Remote SP will currently connect to only one telephony server at a time. Additionally, Remote SP will only work with one service provider at a time. This means that a particular user will only have access to TAPI devices serviced by a single service provider.</p>
<p>
For example, if the telephony server has two service providers installed, a client of that telephony server can only have access to one or the other of the service provider's devices, but not to both.</p>
<p class=indent1>
<b>Note</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;A telephony server cannot be a client of another telephony server. </p>
