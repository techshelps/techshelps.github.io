<h1><a name="_win32_linecallorigin__constants"></a>LINECALLORIGIN_ Constants</h1>
<p>
The LINECALLORIGIN_ constants describe the origin of a call. 
<dl>
<dt>
LINECALLORIGIN_OUTBOUND </dt>
<dd>
The call originated from this station as an outgoing call. </dd>
<dt>
LINECALLORIGIN_INTERNAL </dt>
<dd>
The call originated as an incoming call at a station internal to the same switching environment. </dd>
<dt>
LINECALLORIGIN_EXTERNAL </dt>
<dd>
The call originated as an incoming call on an external line. </dd>
<dt>
LINECALLORIGIN_UNKNOWN </dt>
<dd>
The call origin is currently unknown but may become known later. </dd>
<dt>
LINECALLORIGIN_UNAVAIL </dt>
<dd>
The call origin is not available and will never become known for this call. </dd>
<dt>
LINECALLORIGIN_CONFERENCE </dt>
<dd>
The call handle is for a conference call, that is, it is the application's connection to the conference bridge in the switch. </dd>
<dt>
LINECALLORIGIN_INBOUND </dt>
<dd>
The call originated as an incoming call, but the service provider is unable to determine whether it came from another station on the same switch or from an external line. 
</dd>
</dl>
<p>
No extensibility. All 32 bits are reserved. </p>
<p>
The origin of a call is stored in the <b>dwOrigin</b> member of the call's <a href="struc1_0twy.htm"><b>LINECALLINFO</b></a> structure. </p>
<p>
For backward compatibility, it is the responsibility of the service provider to examine the negotiated API version on the line, and to not use the LINECALLORIGIN_INBOUND value if it is not supported on the negotiated version (LINECALLORIGIN_UNAVAIL may be substituted). </p>
