<h1><a name="_win32_lineaddrfeature__constants"></a>LINEADDRFEATURE_ Constants</h1>
<p>
The LINEADDRFEATURE_ constants list the operations that can be invoked on an address. 
<dl>
<dt>
LINEADDRFEATURE_FORWARD </dt>
<dd>
The address can be forwarded. </dd>
<dt>
LINEADDRFEATURE_MAKECALL </dt>
<dd>
An outgoing call can be placed on the address. </dd>
<dt>
LINEADDRFEATURE_PICKUP </dt>
<dd>
A call can be picked up at the address. </dd>
<dt>
LINEADDRFEATURE_SETMEDIACONTROL </dt>
<dd>
Media control can be set on this address. </dd>
<dt>
LINEADDRFEATURE_SETTERMINAL </dt>
<dd>
The terminal modes for this address can be set. </dd>
<dt>
LINEADDRFEATURE_SETUPCONF </dt>
<dd>
A conference call with a NULL initial call can be set up at this address. </dd>
<dt>
LINEADDRFEATURE_UNCOMPLETECALL </dt>
<dd>
Call completion requests can be canceled at this address. </dd>
<dt>
LINEADDRFEATURE_UNPARK </dt>
<dd>
Calls can be unparked using this address. </dd>
<dt>
LINEADDRFEATURE_PICKUPHELD </dt>
<dd>
The <a href="func2_2j00.htm"><b>linePickup</b></a> function (with a null destination address) can be used to pick up a call that is held on the address. This is normally used only in a bridged-exclusive arrangement. </dd>
<dt>
LINEADDRFEATURE_PICKUPGROUP </dt>
<dd>
The <b>linePickup</b> function can be used to pick up a call in the group. </dd>
<dt>
LINEADDRFEATURE_PICKUPDIRECT </dt>
<dd>
The <b>linePickup</b> function can be used to pick up a call on a specific address. </dd>
<dt>
LINEADDRFEATURE_PICKUPWAITING </dt>
<dd>
The <a href="func2_2j00.htm"><b>linePickup</b></a> function (with a null destination address) can be used to pick up a call waiting call. Note that this does not necessarily indicate that a waiting call is actually present, because it is often impossible for a telephony device to automatically detect such a call; it does, however, indicate that the hook-flash function will be invoked to attempt to switch to such a call. 

<p>
<b>Note</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;If none of the new modified "PICKUP" bits is set in the <b>dwAddressFeatures</b> member in <a href="struc1_4xki.htm"><b>LINEADDRESSSTATUS</b></a> but the LINEADDRFEATURE_PICKUP bit <i>is</i> set, then any of the pickup modes may work; the service provider has simply not specified which ones.

</dd>
<dt>
LINEADDRFEATURE_FORWARDFWD </dt>
<dd>
The <a href="func1_6nvo.htm"><b>lineForward</b></a> function can be used to forward calls on the address to other numbers. LINEADDRFEATURE_FORWARD will also be set. </dd>
<dt>
LINEADDRFEATURE_FORWARDDND </dt>
<dd>
The <b>lineForward</b> function (with an empty destination address) can be used to turn on the Do Not Disturb feature on the address. LINEADDRFEATURE_FORWARD will also be set. 

<p>
<b>Note</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;If neither of the new modified "FORWARD" bits is set in the <b>dwAddressFeatures</b> member in <b>LINEADDRESSSTATUS</b> but the LINEADDRFEATURE_FORWARD bit <i>is</i> set, then any of the forward modes may work; the service provider has simply not specified which ones.

</dd>
</dl>
<p>
No extensibility. All 32 bits are reserved. </p>
<p>
This constant is used both in <a href="struc1_606q.htm"><b>LINEADDRESSCAPS</b></a> (returned by <a href="func1_7wfn.htm"><b>lineGetAddressCaps</b></a>) and in <a href="struc1_4xki.htm"><b>LINEADDRESSSTATUS</b></a> (returned by <a href="func1_4shf.htm"><b>lineGetAddressStatus</b></a>). <b>LINEADDRESSCAPS</b> reports the availability of the address features by the service provider (mainly the switch) for a given address. An application would make this determination when it initializes. The <b>LINEADDRESSSTATUS</b> structure reports, for a given address, which address features can actually be invoked while the address is in the current state. An application would make this determination dynamically after address-state changes, typically caused by call-related activities on the address. </p>
