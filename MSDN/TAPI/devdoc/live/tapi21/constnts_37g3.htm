<h1><a name="_win32_linecallreason__constants"></a>LINECALLREASON_ Constants</h1>
<p>
The LINECALLREASON_ bit-flag constants describe the reason for a call. 
<dl>
<dt>
LINECALLREASON_DIRECT </dt>
<dd>
This is a direct incoming or outgoing call. </dd>
<dt>
LINECALLREASON_FWDBUSY </dt>
<dd>
This call was forwarded from another extension that was busy at the time of the call. </dd>
<dt>
LINECALLREASON_FWDNOANSWER </dt>
<dd>
The call was forwarded from another extension that didn't answer the call after some number of rings. </dd>
<dt>
LINECALLREASON_FWDUNCOND </dt>
<dd>
The call was forwarded unconditionally from another number. </dd>
<dt>
LINECALLREASON_PICKUP </dt>
<dd>
The call was picked up from another extension. </dd>
<dt>
LINECALLREASON_UNPARK </dt>
<dd>
The call was retrieved as a parked call. </dd>
<dt>
LINECALLREASON_REDIRECT </dt>
<dd>
The call was redirected to this station. </dd>
<dt>
LINECALLREASON_CALLCOMPLETION </dt>
<dd>
The call was the result of a call completion request. </dd>
<dt>
LINECALLREASON_TRANSFER </dt>
<dd>
The call has been transferred from another number. </dd>
<dt>
LINECALLREASON_REMINDER </dt>
<dd>
The call is a reminder (or "recall") that the user has a call parked or on hold for (potentially) a long time. </dd>
<dt>
LINECALLREASON_UNKNOWN </dt>
<dd>
The reason for the call is currently unknown but may become known later. </dd>
<dt>
LINECALLREASON_UNAVAIL </dt>
<dd>
The reason for the call is unavailable and will not become known later. </dd>
<dt>
LINECALLREASON_INTRUDE </dt>
<dd>
The call intruded onto the line, either by a call completion action invoked by another station or by operator action. Depending on switch implementation, the call may appear either in the <i>connected</i> state, or <i>conferenced</i> with an existing active call on the line. </dd>
<dt>
LINECALLREASON_PARKED </dt>
<dd>
The call was parked on the address. Usually, it appears initially in the <i>onhold</i> state. </dd>
<dt>
LINECALLREASON_CAMPEDON </dt>
<dd>
The call was camped on the address. Usually, it appears initially in the <i>onhold</i> state, and can be switched to using <a href="func2_7l9g.htm"><b>lineSwapHold</b></a>. If an active call becomes <i>idle</i>, the camped-on call may change to the <i>offering</i> state and the device start ringing. </dd>
<dt>
LINECALLREASON_ROUTEREQUEST </dt>
<dd>
The call appears on the address because the switch needs routing instructions from the application. The application should examine the <b>CalledID</b> member in <a href="struc1_0twy.htm"><b>LINECALLINFO</b></a>, and use the <a href="func2_3s50.htm"><b>lineRedirect</b></a> function to provide a new dialable address for the call. If the call is to be blocked instead, the application may call <a href="func1_0zhs.htm"><b>lineDrop</b></a>. If the application fails to take action within a switch-defined timeout period, a default action will be taken. 
</dd>
</dl>
<p>
No extensibility. All 32 bits are reserved. </p>
<p>
The LINECALLREASON_ constants are used in the <b>dwReason</b> member of the <b>LINECALLINFO</b> data structure. </p>
<p>
For backward compatibility, it is the responsibility of the service provider to examine the negotiated API version on the line, and to not use these LINECALLREASON_ values if not supported on the negotiated version (LINECALLREASON_UNAVAIL may be substituted). </p>
