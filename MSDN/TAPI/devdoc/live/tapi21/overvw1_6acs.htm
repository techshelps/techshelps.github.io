<h3><a name="_win32_securing_a_call"></a>Securing a Call</h3>
<p>
If a new call arrives while another call exists on the line or address, similar notification and call information may be supplied following the same mechanism as for any incoming call. If an application does not want any interference by outside events for a call from the switch or phone network, it should secure the call. Securing a call can be done at the time the call is made with a parameter to <a href="func1_0fsc.htm"><b>lineMakeCall</b></a>, or later (when the call already exists) with <a href="func2_4jqk.htm"><b>lineSecureCall</b></a>. The call will be secure until the call is disconnected. Securing a call may be useful, for example, when certain network tones (such as those for call waiting) could disrupt a call's media stream, such as fax. </p>
