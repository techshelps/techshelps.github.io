<h3><a name="_win32_logging_call_information"></a>Logging Call Information</h3>
<p>
An application can call the <a href="func1_5zov.htm"><b>lineGetCallInfo</b></a> function to obtain information about a call. Although this function fills the <a href="struc1_0twy.htm"><b>LINECALLINFO</b></a> structure with a large amount of data, applications need to maintain other items, such as the start and stop time of the call. </p>
<p>
Developers of applications that log call information should note the following guidelines when designing those applications: 
<ul>
<li>
Free the call's handle (<i>hCall</i>) when the call goes idle—that is, when a LINECALLSTATE_IDLE message is received for the call. At any point in the call's existence prior to its deallocation, monitoring applications can retrieve information about the call. </li>
<li>
To keep the call's log sheet complete, log the fact that the call has gone idle. </li>
<li>
Determines whether the application needs to update the user interface to show that important events have occurred, such as the fact that a fax is being received. </li>
</ul>
<p>
