<h1><a name="_win32_linecallinfo_str"></a>LINECALLINFO</h1>
<p>
The <b>LINECALLINFO</b> structure contains information about a call. This information remains relatively fixed for the duration of the call and is obtained with <a href="func1_5zov.htm"><b>lineGetCallInfo</b></a>. If a part of the structure does change, then a <a href="msgs_22cv.htm">LINE_CALLINFO</a> message is sent to the application indicating which information item has changed. Dynamically changing information about a call, such as call progress status, is available in the <a href="struc1_0p9u.htm"><b>LINECALLSTATUS</b></a> structure, returned with the <a href="func1_106r.htm"><b>lineGetCallStatus</b></a> function. </p>

<b>dwReceivingFlowspecSize</b> </dt>

The total size in bytes and offset from the beginning of <b>LINECALLINFO</b> of a WinSock2 <b>FLOWSPEC</b> structure followed by WinSock2 provider-specific data, equivalent to what would have been stored in ReceivingFlowspec.len in a WinSock2 <b>QOS</b> structure. Specifies the quality of service current in effect in the receiving direction on the call. The provider-specific portion following the <b>FLOWSPEC</b> structure must not contain pointers to other blocks of memory, because TAPI does not know how to marshal the data pointed to by the private pointer(s) and convey it through interprocess communication to the application.

<h4>Remarks</h4>
<p>
Device-specific extensions should use the <b>DevSpecific</b> (<b>dwDevSpecificSize</b> and <b>dwDevSpecificOffset</b>) variably sized area of this data structure. </p>
<p>
The <b>LINECALLINFO</b> data structure contains relatively fixed information about a call. This structure is returned with <b>lineGetCallInfo</b>. When information items in this data structure have changed, a LINE_CALLINFO message is sent to the application. A parameter to this message is the information item or field that changed. </p>
<p>
The members <b>dwCallTreatment</b> through <b>dwReceivingFlowspecOffset</b> are available only to applications that open the line device with an API version of 2.0 or later. </p>
<p>
<b>Note</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;The preferred format for specification of the contents of the <b>dwCallID</b> field and the other five similar fields (<b>dwCallerIDFlag</b>, <b>dwCallerIDSize</b>, <b>dwCallerIDOffset</b>, <b>dwCallerIDNameSize</b>, and <b>dwCallerIDNameOffset</b>) is the TAPI canonical number format. For example, a ICLID of "4258828080" received from the switch should be converted to "+1 (425) 8828080" before being placed in the <b>LINECALLINFO</b> structure. This standardized format facilitates searching of databases and callback functions implemented in applications. </p>
<h4>QuickInfo</h4>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Version:</b> Use TAPI version 1.4 and later.<br>
