The LINESPECIALINFO_ bit-flag constants describes special information signals that the network can use to report various reporting and network observation operations. They are special coded tone sequences transmitted at the beginning of network advisory recorded announcements.

<dd>
This special information tone precedes a no circuit or an emergency announcement (trunk blockage category). </dd>
<dt>
LINESPECIALINFO_CUSTIRREG </dt>
<dd>
This special information tone precedes a vacant number, AIS, Centrex number change and nonworking station, access code not dialed or dialed in error, or manual intercept operator message (customer irregularity category). LINESPECIALINFO_CUSTIRREG is also reported when billing information is rejected and when the dialed address is blocked at the switch. </dd>
