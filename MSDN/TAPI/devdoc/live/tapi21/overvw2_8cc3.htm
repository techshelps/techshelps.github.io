<p>
The following information concerns systems on which Assisted Telephony requests are processed: 
<ul>
<li>
The default registry should list a call manager application in the priority list for <a href="func2_40oc.htm"><b>tapiRequestMakeCall</b></a>. It would be helpful, but not essential, for the call manager application to have a menu option that allows users to set it to the highest priority. </li>
<li>
When an Assisted Telephony recipient application is launched automatically by TAPI and if it is the only TAPI application in the system, this action initializes TAPI. If the Assisted Telephony recipient application initializes and shuts down the line device before registering for Assisted Telephony requests, TAPI is shut down as well, and the Assisted Telephony request is lost. Assisted Telephony requests might also be lost when another TAPI application that is launched performs an initialize and shutdown. </li>
</ul>
