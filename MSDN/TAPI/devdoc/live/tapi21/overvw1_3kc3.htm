<h3><a name="_win32_incoming_calls_and_line_privileges"></a>Incoming Calls and Line Privileges</h3>
<p>
An application cannot refuse ownership of a call for which it receives an owner handle. Whether the call is delivered to the application with owner or monitor privileges is decided before the call arrives—at the time the application opens the line on which the call is established by the remote caller. </p>
<p>
If the application opens the line with <a href="func2_2lny.htm"><b>lineOpen</b></a> with the <i>dwPrivilege</i> parameter set to LINECALLPRIVILEGE_MONITOR, it automatically receives a handle with monitoring privileges for all incoming calls on the line. It can then choose to become an owner by calling <a href="func2_2m1x.htm"><b>lineSetCallPrivilege</b></a>. The fact that it indicated LINECALLPRIVILEGE_MONITOR when it opened the line does not prevent it from later becoming an owner with <b>lineSetCallPrivilege</b> or by originating a call with <a href="func1_0fsc.htm"><b>lineMakeCall</b></a> (an application is always an owner of calls it places regardless of the privilege specified with <b>lineOpen</b>). </p>
<p>
When an incoming call has been offered to an application and the application is an owner of the call, the application can answer the call with <a href="func1_17zm.htm"><b>lineAnswer</b></a>. Once the call has been answered, its call state typically transitions to <i>connected</i>, at which time information can be exchanged over the call. </p>
<p>
An application can receive handles to incoming calls only for monitoring. You can modify the application (specifically, the parameters for <a href="func2_2lny.htm"><b>lineOpen</b></a>) to change the privileges with which it initially opens lines. </p>
