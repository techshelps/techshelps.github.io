<p>
The <b>LINECALLSTATUS</b> structure describes the current status of a call. The information in this structure, as returned with <a href="func1_106r.htm"><b>lineGetCallStatus</b></a>, depends on the device capabilities of the address, the ownership of the call by the invoking application, and the current state of the call being queried. </p>

<dt>
<b>tStateEntryTime</b> </dt>
<dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<h4>Remarks</h4>
<p>
Device-specific extensions should use the <b>DevSpecific </b>(<b>dwDevSpecificSize</b> and <b>dwDevSpecificOffset</b>) variably sized area of this data structure. </p>
<p>
The application is sent a LINE_CALLSTATE message whenever the call state of a call changes. This message only provides the new call state of the call. Additional status about a call is available with <b>lineGetCallStatus</b>. </p>
<p>
The members <b>dwCallFeatures2</b> and <b>tStateEntryTime</b> are available only to applications that open the line device with an API version of 2.0 or later. </p>
<h4>QuickInfo</h4>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Version:</b> Use TAPI version 1.4 and later.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Header:</b> Declared in tapi.h.</p>
