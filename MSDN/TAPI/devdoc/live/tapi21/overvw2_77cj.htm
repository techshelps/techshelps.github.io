Two kinds of applications are needed to run Assisted Telephony. Assisted Telephony <i>clients</i> are applications that use Assisted Telephony by calling the functions that have the prefix "tapi." An example of such a client application would be a spreadsheet to which a <b>Dial</b> menu command or toolbar button is added. </p>
<p>
Assisted Telephony <i>servers</i> are applications that can execute Telephony API functions that result from another application's call to a "tapi"-prefixed function. To make itself known as an Assisted Telephony server, such an application registers as one using the <a href="func2_7i44.htm"><b>lineRegisterRequestRecipient</b></a> function. </p>
<p>
The functions of Assisted Telephony (which begin with the prefix "tapi") are known as request functions. Assisted Telephony applications that process these requests—Assisted Telephony servers—are called <i>request recipients</i>. </p>
