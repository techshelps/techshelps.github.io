<h1><a name="_win32_linemediacontrol__constants"></a>LINEMEDIACONTROL_ Constants</h1>
<p>
The LINEMEDIACONTROL_ bit-flag constants describe a set of generic operations on media streams. The interpretations are determined by the media stream. The line device must have the media-control capability for any media-control operation to be effective. 
<dl>
<dt>
LINEMEDIACONTROL_NONE </dt>
<dd>
No change is to be made to the media stream. </dd>
<dt>
LINEMEDIACONTROL_START </dt>
<dd>
Start the media stream. </dd>
<dt>
LINEMEDIACONTROL_RESET </dt>
<dd>
Reset the media stream. Equivalent to an end-of-input. All buffers are released. </dd>
<dt>
LINEMEDIACONTROL_PAUSE </dt>
<dd>
Temporarily pause the media stream. </dd>
<dt>
LINEMEDIACONTROL_RESUME </dt>
<dd>
Resume a paused media stream. </dd>
<dt>
LINEMEDIACONTROL_RATEUP </dt>
<dd>
The speed of the media stream is increased by some stream-defined quantity. </dd>
<dt>
LINEMEDIACONTROL_RATEDOWN </dt>
<dd>
The speed of the media stream is decreased by some stream-defined quantity. </dd>
<dt>
LINEMEDIACONTROL_RATENORMAL </dt>
<dd>
The speed of the media stream is returned to normal. </dd>
<dt>
LINEMEDIACONTROL_VOLUMEUP </dt>
<dd>
The amplitude of the media stream is increased by some stream-defined quantity. </dd>
<dt>
LINEMEDIACONTROL_VOLUMEDOWN </dt>
<dd>
The amplitude of the media stream is decreased by some stream-defined quantity. </dd>
<dt>
LINEMEDIACONTROL_VOLUMENORMAL </dt>
<dd>
The amplitude of the media stream is returned to normal. 
</dd>
</dl>
<p>
The high-order 16 bits can be assigned for device-specific extensions. The low-order 16 bits are reserved. </p>
<p>
Media control is provided to improve performance of actions on media streams in response to telephony-related events. The application should normally manage a media stream through the media-specific API. The media-control functionality provided here is not intended to replace the native media APIs. </p>
<p>
Media-control actions can be associated with the detection of digits, the detection of tones, the transition into a call state, and the detection of a media mode. Consult a line's device capabilities to determine whether media control is available on the line. </p>
