<h1><a name="_win32_lineaddrcapflags__constants"></a>LINEADDRCAPFLAGS_ Constants</h1>
<p>
The LINEADDRCAPFLAGS_ bit-flag constants are used in the <b>dwAddrCapFlags</b> member of the <a href="struc1_606q.htm"><b>LINEADDRESSCAPS</b></a> data structure to describe various Boolean address capabilities. 
<dl>
<dt>
LINEADDRCAPFLAGS_FWDNUMRINGS </dt>
<dd>
Specifies whether the number of rings for a no-answer can be specified when forwarding calls on no answer. If TRUE, the valid range is provided in <b>LINEADDRESSCAPS</b>. </dd>
<dt>
LINEADDRCAPFLAGS_PICKUPGROUPID </dt>
<dd>
Specifies whether a group identifier is required for call pickup. </dd>
<dt>
LINEADDRCAPFLAGS_SECURE </dt>
<dd>
Specifies whether calls on this address can be made secure at call-setup time. </dd>
<dt>
LINEADDRCAPFLAGS_BLOCKIDDEFAULT </dt>
<dd>
Specifies whether the network by default sends or blocks caller ID information when making a call on this address. If TRUE, identifier information is blocked by default; if FALSE, identifier information is transmitted by default. </dd>
<dt>
LINEADDRCAPFLAGS_BLOCKIDOVERRIDE </dt>
<dd>
Specifies whether the default setting for sending or blocking of caller ID information can be overridden per call. If TRUE, override is possible; if FALSE, override is not possible. </dd>
<dt>
LINEADDRCAPFLAGS_DIALED </dt>
<dd>
Specifies whether a destination address can be dialed on this address for making a call. TRUE if a destination address must be dialed; FALSE if the destination address is fixed (as with a "hot phone"). </dd>
<dt>
LINEADDRCAPFLAGS_ORIGOFFHOOK </dt>
<dd>
Specifies whether the originating party's phone can automatically be taken offhook when making calls. </dd>
<dt>
LINEADDRCAPFLAGS_DESTOFFHOOK </dt>
<dd>
Specifies whether the called party's phone can automatically be forced offhook when making calls. </dd>
<dt>
LINEADDRCAPFLAGS_FWDCONSULT </dt>
<dd>
Specifies whether call forwarding involves the establishment of a consultation call. </dd>
<dt>
LINEADDRCAPFLAGS_SETUPCONFNULL </dt>
<dd>
Specifies whether setting up a conference call starts out with an initial call (FALSE) or with no initial call (TRUE). </dd>
<dt>
LINEADDRCAPFLAGS_AUTORECONNECT </dt>
<dd>
Specifies whether dropping a consultation call automatically reconnects to the call on consultation hold. TRUE if reconnect happens automatically; otherwise, FALSE. </dd>
<dt>
LINEADDRCAPFLAGS_COMPLETIONID </dt>
<dd>
Specifies whether the completion identifiers returned by <a href="func1_9ffw.htm"><b>lineCompleteCall</b></a> are useful and unique. TRUE if useful; otherwise, FALSE. </dd>
<dt>
LINEADDRCAPFLAGS_TRANSFERHELD </dt>
<dd>
Specifies whether a hard-held call can be transferred. Often, only calls on consultation hold can be transferred. </dd>
<dt>
LINEADDRCAPFLAGS_TRANSFERMAKE </dt>
<dd>
Specifies whether an entirely new call can be established for use as a consultation call on transfer. </dd>
<dt>
LINEADDRCAPFLAGS_CONFERENCEHELD </dt>
<dd>
Specifies whether a hard-held call can be conferenced to. Often, only calls on consultation hold can be added to as a conference call. </dd>
<dt>
LINEADDRCAPFLAGS_CONFERENCEMAKE </dt>
<dd>
Specifies whether an entirely new call can be established for use as a consultation call (to add) on conference. </dd>
<dt>
LINEADDRCAPFLAGS_PARTIALDIAL </dt>
<dd>
Specifies whether partial dialing is available. </dd>
<dt>
LINEADDRCAPFLAGS_FWDSTATUSVALID </dt>
<dd>
Specifies whether the forwarding status in the <a href="struc1_4xki.htm"><b>LINEADDRESSSTATUS</b></a> structure for this address is valid or is at most a "best estimate," given absence of accurate confirmation by the switch or network. </dd>
<dt>
LINEADDRCAPFLAGS_FWDINTEXTADDR </dt>
<dd>
Specifies whether internal and external calls can be forwarded to different forwarding addresses. This flag is meaningful only if forwarding of internal and external calls can be controlled separately. This flag is TRUE if internal and external calls can be forwarded to different destination addresses; otherwise, it is FALSE. </dd>
<dt>
LINEADDRCAPFLAGS_FWDBUSYNAADDR </dt>
<dd>
Specifies whether call forwarding for busy and for no answer can use different forwarding addresses. This flag is meaningful only if forwarding for busy and for no answer can be controlled separately. This flag is TRUE if forwarding for busy and for no answer can use different destination addresses; otherwise, it is FALSE. </dd>
<dt>
LINEADDRCAPFLAGS_ACCEPTTOALERT </dt>
<dd>
TRUE if an offering call must be accepted using <a href="func1_4838.htm"><b>lineAccept</b></a> to start alerting the users at both ends of the call; otherwise, FALSE. This is typically only used with ISDN. </dd>
<dt>
LINEADDRCAPFLAGS_CONFDROP </dt>
<dd>
TRUE if <a href="func1_0zhs.htm"><b>lineDrop</b></a> on a conference call parent also has the side effect of dropping (that is, disconnecting) the other parties involved in the conference call; FALSE if dropping a conference call still allows the other parties to talk among themselves. </dd>
<dt>
LINEADDRCAPFLAGS_PICKUPCALLWAIT </dt>
<dd>
TRUE if <a href="func2_2j00.htm"><b>linePickup</b></a> can be used to pick up a call detected by the user as a call-waiting call; otherwise, FALSE. </dd>
<dt>
LINEADDRCAPFLAGS_PREDICTIVEDIALER </dt>
<dd>
This address has enhanced call progress monitoring capabilities which can be applied to outgoing calls to determine call states such as <i>ringback</i>, <i>busy</i>, <i>specialinfo</i>, and <i>connected</i>, or the media mode of the device answering the call. It may also have the ability to automatically transfer outgoing calls to another address when a call reaches any of a predefined set of states. </dd>
<dt>
LINEADDRCAPFLAGS_QUEUE </dt>
<dd>
This address is not associated with a particular station or physical device, but is a holding place where calls wait for further processing. The calls placed in the queue may receive a particular treatment. They may also be automatically transferred when a particular resource becomes available (for example, if the queue is an ACD queue and calls are waiting for an available agent). </dd>
<dt>
LINEADDRCAPFLAGS_ROUTEPOINT </dt>
<dd>
This address is not associated with a particular station or physical device, but is a holding place where calls wait for routing by the application (the application examines the called address, and can redirect the call to another address). The call can also be automatically transferred if a routing timeout expires (the switch usually assumes a default routing). </dd>
<dt>
LINEADDRCAPFLAGS_HOLDMAKESNEW </dt>
<dd>
When a call on this address is placed on hold (using <a href="func1_36xw.htm"><b>lineHold</b></a> or external action), a new call is automatically created (most likely in LINECALLSTATE_DIALTONE). </dd>
<dt>
LINEADDRCAPFLAGS_NOINTERNALCALLS </dt>
<dd>
The address is associated with a direct CO line (trunk), and cannot be used to make internal calls on a PBX. The application can use this indication to assist the user in selecting the correct call appearance to use for making a call. When this bit is off, it does not necessarily indicate that the address can be used to make internal calls, because the service provider may not be cognizant of the line type. </dd>
<dt>
LINEADDRCAPFLAGS_NOEXTERNALCALLS </dt>
<dd>
The address is associated with an internal line on a PBX that is restricted in such a way that it cannot be used to place calls to an address outside the switch (for example, it is an intercom). The application can use this indication to assist the user in selecting the correct call appearance to use for making a call. When this bit is off, it does not necessarily indicate that the address can be used to make external calls, because the service provider may not be cognizant of the line type. </dd>
<dt>
LINEADDRCAPFLAGS_SETCALLINGID </dt>
<dd>
The application can choose to set the <b>CallingPartyID</b> member in <b>LINECALLPARAMS</b> when calling <b>lineMakeCall</b> and other functions that accept a <b>LINECALLPARAMS</b> structure. The service provider will, if the content of the identifier is acceptable and a path is available, pass the identifier along to the called party to indicate the identity of the calling party. 
</dd>
</dl>
<p>
No extensibility. All 32 bits are reserved. </p>
