<h3><a name="_win32_opening_lines"></a>Opening Lines</h3>
<p>
After having obtained the capabilities of a line, an application must open the line device before it can access telephony functions on that line. (Because a <i>line device</i> is an abstraction of a <i>line</i> as defined by telephony, <i>opening a line</i> and <i>opening a line device </i>can be used interchangeably.) When a line device has been opened successfully, the application receives a handle for it. The application can then use that line to take incoming calls, make outgoing calls, or monitor call activities on the line for logging purposes. </p>
<p>
To open a line device for any purpose—monitoring or control—the application calls the <a href="func2_2lny.htm"><b>lineOpen</b></a> function. (Later, when the application is finished with the line device, it can close it with <a href="func1_9sth.htm"><b>lineClose</b></a>.) </p>
<p>
The <b>lineOpen</b> function can be invoked in one of two ways: 
<ul>
<li>
Specifying the line device. A <i>specific</i> line device is selected by means of its line-device identifier (the <i>dwDeviceID </i>parameter). The <b>lineOpen</b> request will open the specified line device. Applications interested in handling incoming calls typically use specific line devices because the application has been notified which line is carrying or is expected to carry the incoming call. When a line device has been opened successfully, the application is returned a handle representing the open line. </li>
<li>
Specifying desired properties of any line device. The application can specify that it wants to use <i>any</i> line device that has certain properties. In this case, the application uses the value LINEMAPPER instead of a specific line-device identifier as a <i>dwDeviceID</i> parameter for <a href="func2_2lny.htm"><b>lineOpen</b></a>. The application also specifies which properties it needs on the call in parameters to <b>lineOpen</b>. The function opens any available line device that supports the specified call parameters. This attempt, of course, may fail. If successful, the caller can determine the line-device identifier by calling <a href="func1_99r8.htm"><b>lineGetID</b></a>, specifying the handle (<i>lphLine</i>) to the open line device returned by <b>lineOpen</b>. </li>
</ul>
<p>
An application that has successfully opened a line device can use it to make an outgoing call except when the line supports only incoming calls. </p>
