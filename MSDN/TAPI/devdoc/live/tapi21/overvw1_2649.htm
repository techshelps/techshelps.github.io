<h3><a name="_win32_application_priority"></a>Application Priority</h3>
<p>
Conflicts can arise if multiple applications open the same line device for the same media mode. These conflicts are resolved with a priority scheme by which the user assigns relative priorities to the applications. This is usually done through a Control Panel utility or a Preferences menu in a telephonic application. Note the following points about this mechanism: 
<ul>
<li>
Only the highest priority application for a given media mode ever receives ownership (unsolicited) of a call of that media mode. </li>
<li>
Although ownership is usually received when an incoming call first arrives or when a call is handed off, any application (including a lower priority one) can later acquire ownership by using the <a href="func1_88s3.htm"><b>lineGetNewCalls</b></a> or <a href="func1_97xv.htm"><b>lineGetConfRelatedCalls</b></a> function. </li>
</ul>
<p>
The user can assign relative priorities to the modules (the applications and the DLLs) that use TAPI. The resulting configuration information is stored in the registry. </p>
<p>
For in-depth information about the way applications receive calls in a multi-application environment, see <a href="overvw1_38br.htm">Multiple-Application Programming</a>. </p>
