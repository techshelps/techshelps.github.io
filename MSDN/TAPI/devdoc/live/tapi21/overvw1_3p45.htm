<h3><a name="_win32_using_the_linecallinfo_data_structure"></a>Using the LINECALLINFO Data Structure</h3>
<p>
The <a href="struc1_0twy.htm"><b>LINECALLINFO</b></a> structure stores a large amount of information about a call, and is thus an important source of data. Generally, a logging application reads from <b>LINECALLINFO</b> and writes this information into its log file. </p>
<p>
A separate <b>LINECALLINFO</b> structure exists for every incoming and outgoing call. Information in this structure is obtained by an application with <a href="func1_5zov.htm"><b>lineGetCallInfo</b></a>. An application typically reads the information from <b>LINECALLINFO</b> at the following times: 
<ul>
<li>
When the application first receives a handle for a call in the <a href="msgs_1eud.htm">LINE_CALLSTATE</a> message. </li>
<li>
Each time the application receives notification in a <a href="msgs_22cv.htm">LINE_CALLINFO</a> message that <b>LINECALLINFO</b> has changed. Whenever any part of the structure changes, a LINE_CALLINFO message is sent to the application indicating which information item has changed. </li>
</ul>
<p>
Both the LINE_CALLSTATE message and the LINE_CALLINFO message also supply the call's handle as a parameter. </p>
<p>
Much of the information held in <a href="struc1_0twy.htm"><b>LINECALLINFO</b></a> remains fixed for the duration of the call. Information about a call that changes dynamically, such as call progress status, is available in the <a href="struc1_0p9u.htm"><b>LINECALLSTATUS</b></a> structure, which is returned with the <a href="func1_106r.htm"><b>lineGetCallStatus</b></a> function. Other information needed by logging applications that is not stored in <b>LINECALLINFO</b> is call start time, call stop time, and the call's duration, which it determines by checking the system time when the corresponding <a href="msgs_1eud.htm">LINE_CALLSTATE</a> messages are received. </p>
<p>
<b>LINECALLINFO</b> stays intact after the call is disconnected, so the logging application can later read it in order to write additional information into the log. <b>LINECALLINFO</b> remains available only until the last application that had a handle for the call (owner and monitor handles) deallocates its handle. </p>
