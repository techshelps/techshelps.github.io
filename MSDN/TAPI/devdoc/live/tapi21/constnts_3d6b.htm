<h1><a name="_win32_linetermmode__constants"></a>LINETERMMODE_ Constants</h1>
<p>
The LINETERMMODE_ bit-flag constants describe different types of events on a phone line that can be routed to a terminal device. 
<dl>
<dt>
LINETERMMODE_BUTTONS </dt>
<dd>
These are button-press events sent from the terminal to the line. </dd>
<dt>
LINETERMMODE_LAMPS </dt>
<dd>
These are lamp events sent from the line to the terminal. </dd>
<dt>
LINETERMMODE_DISPLAY </dt>
<dd>
This is display information sent from the line to the terminal. </dd>
<dt>
LINETERMMODE_RINGER </dt>
<dd>
This is ringer-control information sent from the switch to the terminal. </dd>
<dt>
LINETERMMODE_HOOKSWITCH </dt>
<dd>
These are hookswitch events sent from the terminal to the line. </dd>
<dt>
LINETERMMODE_MEDIATOLINE </dt>
<dd>
This is the unidirectional media stream from the terminal to the line associated with a call on the line. Use this value when the routing of both unidirectional channels of a call's media stream can be controlled independently. </dd>
<dt>
LINETERMMODE_MEDIAFROMLINE </dt>
<dd>
This is the unidirectional media stream from the line to the terminal associated with a call on the line. Use this value when the routing of both unidirectional channels of a call's media stream can be controlled independently. </dd>
<dt>
LINETERMMODE_MEDIABIDIRECT </dt>
<dd>
This is the bidirectional media stream associated with a call on the line and the terminal. Use this value when the routing of both unidirectional channels of a call's media stream cannot be controlled independently. 
</dd>
</dl>
<p>
No extensibility. All 32 bits are reserved. </p>
<p>
These constants describe the classes of control and information streams that can be routed directly between a line device and a terminal device (such as a phone set). </p>
