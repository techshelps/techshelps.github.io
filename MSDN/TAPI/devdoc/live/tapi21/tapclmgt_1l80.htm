<h2><a name="_win32_conditions_after_setup"></a>Conditions After Setup</h2>
<p>
After running the <b>tcmsetup</b> program, a set of conditions exists, determined by whether you have specified the machine as a server or client, and what action the program performed (setup or disable).</p>
<p>
After <i>server setup</i>:
<ul>
<li>
The user specified during setup is verified to be an administrator. If the user is not verified, the setup failed.</li>
<li>
The user has the Log On As A Service privilege.</li>
<li>
TAPISRV is set to start automatically.</li>
<li>
TAPISRV is set to log on as the user specified, not as the <b>LocalMachine</b> account.</li>
<li>
The <b>Server</b> subkey under the <b>Telephony</b> registry key is created. Any Management DLL entries are created and filled in. The <b>DisableServer</b> subkey is created and set to 0.</li>
</ul>
<p>
After the <i>server is disabled</i>:
<ul>
<li>
TAPISRV is set to log on as the <b>LocalMachine</b> account.</li>
<li>
TAPISRV is set to start manually.</li>
<li>
The <b>Server </b>subkey under the <b>Telephony </b>registry key is deleted.<br>
<b>Note</b> The Log On As A Service privilege is not revoked.</li>
</ul>
<p>
After <i>client setup</i>:
<ul>
<li>
Remote SP is installed as a service provider<br>
<b>Note</b> Setup does not copy the remotesp.tsp file or verify that the server is a valid machine name or that a server exists. It only adds Remote SP as a TAPI service provider.</li>
</ul>
<p>
After the <i>client is removed</i>:
<ul>
<li>
Remote SP is removed as a service provider. The remotesp.tsp file is not deleted.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p></body>
