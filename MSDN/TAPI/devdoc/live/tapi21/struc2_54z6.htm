<h1><a name="_win32_linemediacontrolmedia_str"></a>LINEMEDIACONTROLMEDIA</h1>
<p>
The <b>LINEMEDIACONTROLMEDIA</b> structure describes a media action to be executed when detecting a media mode change. It is used as an entry in an array. </p>
<pre><code>typedef struct linemediacontrolmedia_tag {
    DWORD  dwMediaModes;
    DWORD  dwDuration;
    DWORD  dwMediaControl;
} LINEMEDIACONTROLMEDIA, FAR *LPLINEMEDIACONTROLMEDIA; 
 </code></pre>
<h4>Members</h4>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>dwMediaModes</b> </dt>
<dd>
One or more media modes. This member uses the following LINEMEDIAMODE_ constants: 
<dl>
<dt>
LINEMEDIAMODE_UNKNOWN </dt>
<dd>
A media stream exists but its mode is not known. This would correspond to a call with an unclassified media type. In typical analog telephony environments, an incoming call's media mode may be unknown until after the call has been answered and the media stream filtered to make a determination. </dd>
<dt>
LINEMEDIAMODE_INTERACTIVEVOICE </dt>
<dd>
The presence of voice energy on the call and the call is treated as an interactive call with humans on both ends. </dd>
<dt>
LINEMEDIAMODE_AUTOMATEDVOICE </dt>
<dd>
The presence of voice energy on the call and the voice is locally handled by an automated application. </dd>
<dt>
LINEMEDIAMODE_DATAMODEM </dt>
<dd>
A data modem session on the call. </dd>
<dt>
LINEMEDIAMODE_G3FAX </dt>
<dd>
A group 3 fax is being sent or received over the call. </dd>
<dt>
LINEMEDIAMODE_G4FAX </dt>
<dd>
A group 4 fax is being sent or received over the call. </dd>
<dt>
LINEMEDIAMODE_TDD </dt>
<dd>
A TDD (Telephony Devices for the Deaf) session on the call. </dd>
<dt>
LINEMEDIAMODE_DIGITALDATA </dt>
<dd>
Digital data is being sent or received over the call. </dd>
<dt>
LINEMEDIAMODE_TELETEX </dt>
<dd>
A teletex session on the call. Teletex is one of the telematic services. </dd>
<dt>
LINEMEDIAMODE_VIDEOTEX </dt>
<dd>
A videotex session on the call. Videotex is one of the telematic services. </dd>
<dt>
LINEMEDIAMODE_TELEX </dt>
<dd>
A telex session on the call. Telex is one of the telematic services. </dd>
<dt>
LINEMEDIAMODE_MIXED </dt>
<dd>
A mixed session on the call. Mixed is one of the ISDN telematic services. </dd>
<dt>
LINEMEDIAMODE_ADSI </dt>
<dd>
An ADSI (Analog Display Services Interface) session on the call. </dd>
<dt>
LINEMEDIAMODE_VOICEVIEW </dt>
<dd>
The media mode of the call is VoiceView. </dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dt>
<b>dwDuration</b> </dt>
<dd>
The duration in milliseconds during which the media mode should be present before the application should be notified or media control action should be taken. </dd>
<dt>
<b>dwMediaControl</b> </dt>
<dd>
The media control action. This member uses the following LINEMEDIACONTROL_ constants: 
<dl>
<dt>
LINEMEDIACONTROL_NONE </dt>
<dd>
No change is to be made to the media stream. </dd>
<dt>
LINEMEDIACONTROL_RESET </dt>
<dd>
Reset the media stream. Equivalent to an end-of-input. All buffers are released. </dd>
<dt>
LINEMEDIACONTROL_PAUSE </dt>
<dd>
Temporarily pause the media stream. </dd>
<dt>
LINEMEDIACONTROL_RESUME </dt>
<dd>
Start or resume a paused media stream. </dd>
<dt>
LINEMEDIACONTROL_RATEUP </dt>
<dd>
The speed of the media stream is increased by some stream-defined quantity. </dd>
<dt>
LINEMEDIACONTROL_RATEDOWN </dt>
<dd>
The speed of the media stream is decreased by some stream-defined quantity. </dd>
<dt>
LINEMEDIACONTROL_RATENORMAL </dt>
<dd>
The speed of the media stream is returned to normal. </dd>
<dt>
LINEMEDIACONTROL_VOLUMEUP </dt>
<dd>
The amplitude of the media stream is increased by some stream-defined quantity. </dd>
<dt>
LINEMEDIACONTROL_VOLUMEDOWN </dt>
<dd>
The amplitude of the media stream is decreased by some stream-defined quantity. </dd>
<dt>
LINEMEDIACONTROL_VOLUMENORMAL </dt>
<dd>
The amplitude of the media stream is returned to normal. 
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<h4>Remarks</h4>
<p>
No extensions. </p>
<p>
The <b>LINEMEDIACONTROLMEDIA</b> structure defines a triple &lt;media mode(s), duration, media-control action&gt;. An array of these triples is passed to the <b>lineSetMediaControl</b> function to set the media control actions triggered by media mode changes for a given call. When a change to a listed media mode is detected, then the corresponding action on the media stream is invoked. </p>
