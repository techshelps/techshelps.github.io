<h3><a name="_win32_call_park"></a>Call Park</h3>
<p>
Two forms of call parking are provided: <i>directed call park</i> and <i>non-directed call park</i>. In directed call park, the application specifies the destination address where the call is to be parked. This roughly behaves like a call transfer to the destination address, but it doesn't alert or time-out as a transfer would. </p>
<p>
In non-directed call park, the switch returns to the application the address where it parked the call. In either case, the <a href="func2_6x63.htm"><b>linePark</b></a> function is used to park a call. A parked call can later be retrieved with <a href="func2_2q5n.htm"><b>lineUnpark</b></a>. The application specifies the park address to <b>lineUnpark</b> that returns a call handle to the unparked call. Appropriate <a href="msgs_1eud.htm">LINE_CALLSTATE</a> messages will be sent to the application as the call is reconnected. </p>
