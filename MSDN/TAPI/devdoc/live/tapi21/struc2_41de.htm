The <b>LINEFORWARD</b> structure describes an entry of the forwarding instructions. </p>

<h4>Members</h4>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>dwForwardMode</b> </dt>
<dd>
The types of forwarding. The <b>dwForwardMode</b> member can have only a single bit set. This member uses the following LINEFORWARDMODE_ constants: 
<dl>
<dt>
LINEFORWARDMODE_UNCOND </dt>
<dd>
Forward all calls unconditionally, irrespective of their origin. Use this value when unconditional forwarding for internal and external calls cannot be controlled separately. Unconditional forwarding overrides forwarding on busy and/or no-answer conditions. </dd>
<dt>
LINEFORWARDMODE_UNCONDINTERNAL </dt>
<dd>
Forward all internal calls unconditionally. Use this value when unconditional forwarding for internal and external calls can be controlled separately. </dd>
<dt>
LINEFORWARDMODE_UNCONDEXTERNAL </dt>
<dd>
Forward all external calls unconditionally. Use this value when unconditional forwarding for internal and external calls can be controlled separately. </dd>
<dt>
LINEFORWARDMODE_UNCONDSPECIFIC </dt>
<dd>
Unconditionally forward all calls that originated at a specified address (selective call forwarding). </dd>
<dt>
LINEFORWARDMODE_BUSY </dt>
<dd>
Forward all calls on busy, irrespective of their origin. Use this value when forwarding for internal and external calls both on busy and on no answer cannot be controlled separately. </dd>
<dt>
LINEFORWARDMODE_BUSYINTERNAL </dt>
<dd>
Forward all internal calls on busy. Use this value when forwarding for internal and external calls on busy and on no answer can be controlled separately. </dd>
<dt>
LINEFORWARDMODE_BUSYEXTERNAL </dt>
<dd>
Forward all external calls on busy. Use this value when forwarding for internal and external calls on busy and on no answer can be controlled separately. </dd>
<dt>
LINEFORWARDMODE_BUSYSPECIFIC </dt>
<dd>
Forward on busy all calls that originated at a specified address (selective call forwarding). </dd>
<dt>
LINEFORWARDMODE_NOANSW </dt>
<dd>
Forward all calls on no answer, irrespective of their origin. Use this value when call forwarding for internal and external calls on no answer cannot be controlled separately. </dd>
<dt>
LINEFORWARDMODE_NOANSWINTERNAL </dt>
<dd>
Forward all internal calls on no answer. Use this value when forwarding for internal and external calls on no answer can be controlled separately. </dd>
<dt>
LINEFORWARDMODE_NOANSWEXTERNAL </dt>
<dd>
Forward all external calls on no answer. Use this value when forwarding for internal and external calls on no answer can be controlled separately. </dd>
<dt>
LINEFORWARDMODE_NOANSWSPECIFIC </dt>
<dd>
Forward all calls that originated at a specified address on no answer (selective call forwarding). </dd>
<dt>
LINEFORWARDMODE_BUSYNA </dt>
<dd>
Forward all calls on busy/no answer, irrespective of their origin. Use this value when forwarding for internal and external calls on both busy and on no answer cannot be controlled separately. </dd>
<dt>
LINEFORWARDMODE_BUSYNAINTERNAL </dt>
<dd>
Forward all internal calls on busy/no answer. Use this value when call forwarding on busy and on no answer cannot be controlled separately for internal calls. </dd>
<dt>
LINEFORWARDMODE_BUSYNAEXTERNAL </dt>
<dd>
Forward all external calls on busy/no answer. Use this value when call forwarding on busy and on no answer cannot be controlled separately for internal calls. </dd>
<dt>
LINEFORWARDMODE_BUSYNASPECIFIC </dt>
<dd>
Forward on busy/no answer all calls that originated at a specified address (selective call forwarding). </dd>
<dt>
LINEFORWARDMODE_UNKNOWN </dt>
<dd>
Calls are forwarded, but the conditions under which forwarding occurs are not known at this time. It is possible that the conditions may become known at a future time. </dd>
<dt>
LINEFORWARDMODE_UNAVAIL </dt>
<dd>
Calls are forwarded, but the conditions under which forwarding occurs are not known, and are never known by the service provider. </dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dt>
<b>dwCallerAddressSize</b> </dt>
<dt>
<b>dwCallerAddressOffset</b> </dt>
<dd>
The size in bytes of the variably sized address field containing the address of a caller to be forwarded, and the offset in bytes from the beginning of the containing data structure. The <b>dwCallerAddressSize/Offset</b> member is set to zero if <b>dwForwardMode</b> is <i>not</i> one of the following: LINEFORWARDMODE_BUSYNASPECIFIC, LINEFORWARDMODE_NOANSWSPECIFIC, LINEFORWARDMODE_UNCONDSPECIFIC, or LINEFORWARDMODE_BUSYSPECIFIC. </dd>
<dt>
<b>dwDestCountryCode</b> </dt>
<dd>
The country code of the destination address to which the call is to be forwarded. </dd>
<dt>
<b>dwDestAddressSize</b> </dt>
<dt>
<b>dwDestAddressOffset</b> </dt>
<dd>
The size in bytes of the variably sized address field containing the address of the address where calls are to be forwarded, and the offset in bytes from the beginning of the containing data structure. 
</dd>
</dl>
<h4>Remarks</h4>
<p>
No extensions. </p>
<p>
Each entry in the <b>LINEFORWARD</b> structure specifies a forwarding request. </p>
