<h3><a name="_win32_assisted_telephony_requests"></a>Assisted Telephony Requests</h3>
<p>
Applications that use Assisted Telephony services only initiate requests that are temporarily queued by TAPI. It is the request recipient application that retrieves these requests and executes them on behalf of the Assisted Telephony application. The <a href="func2_40oc.htm"><b>tapiRequestMakeCall</b></a> function requests the establishment of a voice call. The requesting application does not control the call. </p>
<p>
TAPI allows the user to establish different or the same request recipient applications for each of these services. An application becomes a request recipient by registering with <a href="func2_7i44.htm"><b>lineRegisterRequestRecipient</b></a>, in which TRUE is specified as the value for the parameter <i>bEnable</i>. (Specifying FALSE deregisters the application as a request recipient, which it should do when it has determined that its recipient duties are through for the current session.) The application selects the services it wants to handle in the <i>dwRequestMode</i> parameter of <b>lineRegisterRequestRecipient</b>. A possible value for a request is LINEREQUESTMODE_MAKECALL, to show that the application will handle <b>tapiRequestMakeCall</b> requests. If multiple applications register for the same services, a priority scheme is used to allow the user to select which application is preferred for handling requests. This priority scheme is identical to that used for call hand-off and the routing of incoming calls based on a list of filenames in <b>HandoffPriorities</b> in the registry. </p>
