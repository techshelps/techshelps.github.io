<p>
The Telephony Application Programming Interface (TAPI) simplifies the development of telephonic applications by hiding the complexities of low-level communications programming. TAPI accomplishes this by abstracting telephony services to make them independent of the underlying telephone network and of the way the computer is connected to the switch and phone set. Connections to the switch may be established in a variety of arrangements including directly from the user's workstation or through a server on a local area network. Regardless of their nature, telephony devices and connections are handled in a single, consistent manner, allowing developers to apply the same programming techniques to a broad range of communications functions. </p>
