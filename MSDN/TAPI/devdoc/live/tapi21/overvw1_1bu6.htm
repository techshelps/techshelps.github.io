<h3><a name="_win32_address_translation"></a>Address Translation</h3>
<p>
Applications can provide users with location independence and take advantage of calling-card information managed by Win32 Telephony by storing telephone numbers in the canonical address format. Before a Canonical address can be used in placing a call, it must be converted (translated) into the <i>dialable</i> address format using the <a href="func2_5qyb.htm"><b>lineTranslateAddress</b></a> function. </p>
<p>
To do this, the <b>lineTranslateAddress</b> function starts by examining the settings in the registry to find the user's location, including the country and area code. It then produces a valid dialing sequence by removing unnecessary portions of the number (such as the country code or area code) and adding other digits such as a long distance prefix or a digit used to dial out of a local PBX. </p>
<p>
To avoid inadvertent misdialing, such as if the user has changed locations but has not yet informed Win32 Telephony of the change, an application may want to present the output of this function call to the user in a dialog box. The user can then confirm the translated address or change it if it is incorrect. </p>
