<h1><a name="_win32_linedialtonemode__constants"></a>LINEDIALTONEMODE_ Constants</h1>
<p>
The LINEDIALTONEMODE_ bit-flag constants describe different types of dial tones. A special dial tone typically carries a special meaning (as with message waiting). 
<dl>
<dt>
LINEDIALTONEMODE_NORMAL </dt>
<dd>
This is a normal dial tone, which typically is a continuous tone. </dd>
<dt>
LINEDIALTONEMODE_SPECIAL </dt>
<dd>
This is a special dial tone indicating that a certain condition (known by the switch or network) is currently in effect. Special dial tones typically use an interrupted tone. As with a normal dial tone, this indicates that the switch is ready to receive the number to be dialed. </dd>
<dt>
LINEDIALTONEMODE_INTERNAL </dt>
<dd>
This is an internal dial tone, as within a PBX. </dd>
<dt>
LINEDIALTONEMODE_EXTERNAL </dt>
<dd>
This is an external (public network) dial tone. </dd>
<dt>
LINEDIALTONEMODE_UNKNOWN </dt>
<dd>
The dial tone mode is not currently known but may become known later. </dd>
<dt>
LINEDIALTONEMODE_UNAVAIL </dt>
<dd>
The dial tone mode is unavailable and will not become known. 
</dd>
</dl>
<p>
The high-order 16 bits can be assigned for device-specific extensions. The low-order 16 bits are reserved. </p>
<p>
The LINEDIALTONEMODE_ constants are used within the <a href="struc1_0p9u.htm"><b>LINECALLSTATUS</b></a> data structure for a call in the <i>dialtone</i> state. </p>
