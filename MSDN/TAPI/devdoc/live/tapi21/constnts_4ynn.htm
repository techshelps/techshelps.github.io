<h1><a name="_win32_lineaddressstate__constants"></a>LINEADDRESSSTATE_ Constants</h1>
<p>
The LINEADDRESSSTATE_ bit-flag constants describe various address status items. 
<dl>
<dt>
LINEADDRESSSTATE_OTHER </dt>
<dd>
Address-status items other than those listed below have changed. The application should check the current address status to determine which items have changed. </dd>
<dt>
LINEADDRESSSTATE_DEVSPECIFIC </dt>
<dd>
The device-specific item of the address status has changed. </dd>
<dt>
LINEADDRESSSTATE_INUSEZERO </dt>
<dd>
The address has changed to idle (it is not in use by any stations). </dd>
<dt>
LINEADDRESSSTATE_INUSEONE </dt>
<dd>
The address has changed from idle or in use by many bridged stations to being in use by just one station. </dd>
<dt>
LINEADDRESSSTATE_INUSEMANY </dt>
<dd>
The monitored or bridged address has changed from being in use by one station to being in use by more than one station. </dd>
<dt>
LINEADDRESSSTATE_NUMCALLS </dt>
<dd>
The number of calls on the address has changed. This is the result of events such as a new incoming call, an outgoing call on the address, or a call changing its hold status. This flag covers changes in any of the members <b>dwNumActiveCalls</b>, <b>dwNumOnHoldCalls</b> and <b>dwNumOnHoldPendingCalls</b> in the <a href="struc1_4xki.htm"><b>LINEADDRESSSTATUS</b></a> structure. The application should check all three of these members when it receives a <a href="msgs_7ch1.htm">LINE_ADDRESSSTATE</a> (numCalls) message. </dd>
<dt>
LINEADDRESSSTATE_FORWARD </dt>
<dd>
The forwarding status of the address has changed, including possibly the number of rings for determining a no-answer condition. The application should check the address status to determine details about the address's current forwarding status. </dd>
<dt>
LINEADDRESSSTATE_TERMINALS </dt>
<dd>
The terminal settings for the address have changed. </dd>
<dt>
LINEADDRESSSTATE_CAPSCHANGE </dt>
<dd>
Indicates that, due to configuration changes made by the user or other circumstances, one or more of the members in the <a href="struc1_606q.htm"><b>LINEADDRESSCAPS</b></a> structure for the address have changed. The application should use <a href="func1_7wfn.htm"><b>lineGetAddressCaps</b></a> to read the updated structure. If a service provider sends a <a href="msgs_7ch1.htm">LINE_ADDRESSSTATE</a> message containing this value to TAPI, TAPI will pass it along to applications which have negotiated TAPI version 1.4 or later; applications negotiating a previous API version will receive <a href="msgs_7het.htm">LINE_LINEDEVSTATE</a> messages specifying LINEDEVSTATE_REINIT, requiring them to shutdown and reinitialize their connection to TAPI to obtain the updated information. 
</dd>
</dl>
<p>
No extensibility. All 32 bits are reserved. </p>
<p>
An application is notified about changes to these status items in the LINE_ADDRESSSTATE message. The address's device capabilities indicate which address state changes can possibly be reported for this address. </p>
