<h1><a name="_win32_phoneprivilege__constants"></a>PHONEPRIVILEGE_ Constants</h1>
<p>
The PHONEPRIVILEGE_ bit-flag constants describe the various ways in which a phone device can be opened. 
<dl>
<dt>
PHONEPRIVILEGE_MONITOR </dt>
<dd>
An application that opens a phone device with the monitor privilege is informed about events and state changes occurring on the phone. The application cannot invoke any operations on the phone device that would change its state, so only status operations can be invoked. Multiple applications can monitor a phone device at any given time. </dd>
<dt>
PHONEPRIVILEGE_OWNER </dt>
<dd>
An application that opens a phone device with the owner privilege is allowed to change the state of the lamps, ringer, display, hookswitch, and data blocks of the phone. Opening a phone device in owner mode also provides monitoring of the phone device. Only one application is allowed to be the owner of a phone device at any given time.
