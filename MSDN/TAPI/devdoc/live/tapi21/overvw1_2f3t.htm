<p>
The dialable number format allows multiple destination addresses to be supplied at once. (Dialing formats are described in <a href="overvw2_938z.htm">Dialable Addresses</a>.) This ability can be useful if the service provider offers some form of inverse multiplexing by setting up calls to each of the specified destinations and then managing the information stream as a single high-bandwidth media stream. The application perceives this group of calls as a single call because it receives only a single call handle representing the aggregate of the individual phone calls. </p>
<p>
It is also possible to support inverse multiplexing at the application level. To do this, the application would set up a series of individual calls and synchronize their media streams. </p>
