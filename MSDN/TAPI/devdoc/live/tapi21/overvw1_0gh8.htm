<h3><a name="_win32_ending_the_call"></a>Ending the Call</h3>
<p>
When the modem transmission is finished, the application receives a LINE_CALLSTATE message, which informs it that the state of a line device has changed. In this example, a remote disconnect has occurred. The application disconnects the call at the local end (it "goes on-hook") with <a href="func1_0zhs.htm"><b>lineDrop</b></a>. Alternatively, the application itself may choose to end the call by invoking <b>lineDrop</b> before receiving the remote-disconnect message. </p>
<p>
Here are the steps that might be used to end a call, close the line, and leave TAPI: 
<ol>
<li>
The application calls <a href="func1_0zhs.htm"><b>lineDrop</b></a>, which places the call in the IDLE state. The call still exists, and the application still has its handle. Now the application can examine the call-information record, if desired. </li>
<li>
The application calls <a href="func1_6q5o.htm"><b>lineDeallocateCall</b></a> to release the call handle for the finished call. The call no longer exists. </li>
<li>
If the application expects no more calls on the line, it uses <a href="func1_9sth.htm"><b>lineClose</b></a> to close the line. At this point, there will be no more incoming or outgoing calls on that line. </li>
<li>
The application invokes <a href="func2_0m26.htm"><b>lineShutdown</b></a> to end the use of TAPI's functions for the current session. </li>
</ol>
