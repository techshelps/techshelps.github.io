<p>
Different line devices can have different capabilities and so can their addresses. Additionally, switching features and capabilities can be different for different addresses. An application calls the <a href="func1_7wfn.htm"><b>lineGetAddressCaps</b></a> function to determine the telephony capabilities of each address and then receives this information in a data structure of the type <a href="struc1_606q.htm"><b>LINEADDRESSCAPS</b></a>. In a similar way, an application can call <a href="func1_22nn.htm"><b>lineGetDevCaps</b></a> for a line device to determine the number of addresses assigned to the line, as well as other information. </p>
<p>
TAPI's device-query capability and status and event reporting mechanisms give an application the information it needs to manage the different kinds of bridged-address arrangements. For example, the application can determine whether a bridged station has answered a call by tracking the status changes and call-state event changes on the address. (For more information about call states, see <a href="overvw1_5cz7.htm">Call States and Events</a>.) </p>
<p>
Normally, addresses on a line device are identified by their address identifiers. However, TAPI lets applications that make outgoing calls use alternate address types for the originating address, such as dialable format (see <a href="overvw2_0qk3.htm">Address Formats</a>), or naming mechanisms specific to a given service provider. This can be accomplished through API extensions that are based on switch-assigned station identifiers. A useful function for this purpose is <a href="func1_01ic.htm"><b>lineGetAddressID</b></a>, which retrieves the identifier of an address specified in an alternate format. </p>
