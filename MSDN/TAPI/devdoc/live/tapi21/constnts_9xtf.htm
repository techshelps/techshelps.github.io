<h1><a name="_win32_lineagentstate__constants"></a>LINEAGENTSTATE_ Constants</h1>
<p>
The LINEAGENTSTATE_ constants list the state of an agent on an address. 
<dl>
<dt>
LINEAGENTSTATE_LOGGEDOFF </dt>
<dd>
No agent is logged in on the address. </dd>
<dt>
LINEAGENTSTATE_NOTREADY </dt>
<dd>
The agent is logged in, but occupied with a task other than serving a call (such as on a break). No additional calls should be routed to the agent. </dd>
<dt>
LINEAGENTSTATE_READY </dt>
<dd>
The agent is ready to accept calls. </dd>
<dt>
LINEAGENTSTATE_BUSYACD </dt>
<dd>
The agent is busy handling a call routed from an ACD queue. </dd>
<dt>
LINEAGENTSTATE_BUSYINCOMING </dt>
<dd>
The agent is busy handling an incoming call that was not transferred to the agent from an ACD queue in which the agent is logged in. </dd>
<dt>
LINEAGENTSTATE_BUSYOUTBOUND </dt>
<dd>
The agent is busy handling an outgoing call, such as one routed from a predictive dialing queue. </dd>
<dt>
LINEAGENTSTATE_BUSYOTHER </dt>
<dd>
The agent is busy handling another type of call, such as an outgoing personal call not transferred to the agent by a predictive dialer. This value can also be used when the agent is known to be busy on a call but the type of call is unknown. </dd>
<dt>
LINEAGENTSTATE_WORKINGAFTERCALL </dt>
<dd>
The agent has completed the preceding call, but is still occupied with work related to that call. The agent should not receive additional calls. </dd>
<dt>
LINEAGENTSTATE_UNKNOWN </dt>
<dd>
The agent state is currently unknown, but may become known later. This can be a transitional state when a line or address is first opened. </dd>
<dt>
LINEAGENTSTATE_UNAVAIL </dt>
<dd>
The agent state is unknown and will never become known. In <a href="struc1_4xki.htm"><b>LINEADDRESSSTATUS</b></a>, this condition can also be represented by the <b>dwAgentState</b> member being set to 0. 
</dd>
</dl>
<p>
The upper 16-bits of this set of constants are reserved for device-specific extensions. </p>
