<h2><a name="_win32_address_configurations"></a>Address Configurations</h2>
<p>
The relationship of an address to a line (and to other local addresses) is known as its configuration. The network or switch can configure address-to-line assignments in several ways. The main types of address configurations recognized by TAPI are: 
<ol>
<li>
<b>Private</b> The address is assigned to one line device only. An incoming call for this address is offered (the switch informs the desktop computer of an incoming call) at one line device only. </li>
<li>
<b>Bridged</b> A bridged address is a single address assigned to more than one line device. (Different switch vendors have different names for address bridging, such as multiple appearance directory number (MADN), bridged appearance, or shared appearance.) An incoming call on a bridged address is offered on all lines associated with the address. The network of lines connected together is known as the bridge. Different variations of bridged behavior are possible: <ul>
<li>
<b>Bridged-Exclusive</b> Connecting one of the bridged lines to a remote party causes the address to appear "in use" to all other members of the bridge. </li>
<li>
<b>Bridged-New</b> Connecting one of the bridged lines to a remote party does not preclude the other lines from using the bridged address to answer or make calls. However, a new call appearance is allocated to another of the connected lines. </li>
<li>
<b>Bridged-Shared</b> If one line is connected to a remote party, other bridged lines that use the address automatically enter into a multiparty conference call on the existing call. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<b>Monitored</b> The line indicates the busy or idle status of the address, but the line cannot use the address for answering or making calls. </li>
</ol>
