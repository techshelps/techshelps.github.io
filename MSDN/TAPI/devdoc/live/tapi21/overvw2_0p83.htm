<h2><a name="_win32_lines_channels_and_addresses"></a>Lines, Channels, and Addresses</h2>
<p>
In POTS, exactly one channel exists on a line, and is used exclusively for voice. With ISDN, at least three (and as many as 30 or more) channels can exist on a line simultaneously. Currently, most TAPI functionality involves POTS applications that handle a single line using its single channel because ISDN hardware is not yet widespread. In POTS, an application that wants to transmit data communicates over one line, and a voice application communicates over another line—both of these applications could use the same line, but if so, not at the same time. </p>
<p>
In general, one line has exactly one address (telephone number). In cases where lines carry two or more channels, each channel can have its own address, which means that a line has as many addresses as it has channels. TAPI assigns address identifiers to these different addresses to make it easier to manipulate them. </p>
