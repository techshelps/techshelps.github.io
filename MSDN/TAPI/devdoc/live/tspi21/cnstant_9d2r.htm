<h1><a name="_tspi_linedevstate__constants"></a>LINEDEVSTATE_ Constants</h1>
<p>
The LINEDEVSTATE_ bit-flag constants describe various line status events. 
<dl>
<dt>
LINEDEVSTATE_OTHER </dt>
<dd>
Device-status items other than those listed below have changed. </dd>
<dt>
LINEDEVSTATE_RINGING </dt>
<dd>
The switch tells the line to alert the user. This should be sent repeatedly in a <a href="messgs_58px.htm">LINE_LINEDEVSTATE</a> message, once for each ring cycle. On a POTS device, the service provider can send the message whenever the central office sends ring voltage. On digital devices such as ISDN, the service provider may need to synthesize the repetition of the message if the switch generates only one ring request. Each repetition of the message should show the ring count increasing, so that toll save functions work properly. </dd>
<dt>
LINEDEVSTATE_CONNECTED </dt>
<dd>
The line was previously disconnected and is now connected to TAPI. </dd>
<dt>
LINEDEVSTATE_DISCONNECTED </dt>
<dd>
This line was previously connected and is now disconnected from TAPI. </dd>
<dt>
LINEDEVSTATE_MSGWAITON </dt>
<dd>
The "message" waiting indicator is turned on. </dd>
<dt>
LINEDEVSTATE_MSGWAITOFF </dt>
<dd>
The "message waiting" indicator is turned off. </dd>
<dt>
LINEDEVSTATE_INSERVICE </dt>
<dd>
The line is connected to TAPI. This happens when TAPI is first activated, or when the line wire is physically plugged in and in-service at the switch while TAPI is active. </dd>
<dt>
LINEDEVSTATE_OUTOFSERVICE </dt>
<dd>
The line is out of service at the switch or physically disconnected. TAPI cannot be used to operate on the line device. </dd>
<dt>
LINEDEVSTATE_MAINTENANCE </dt>
<dd>
Maintenance is being performed on the line at the switch. TAPI cannot be used to operate on the line device. </dd>
<dt>
LINEDEVSTATE_OPEN </dt>
<dd>
The line has been opened by another application. </dd>
<dt>
LINEDEVSTATE_CLOSE </dt>
<dd>
The line has been closed by another application. </dd>
<dt>
LINEDEVSTATE_NUMCALLS </dt>
<dd>
The number of calls on the line device has changed. </dd>
<dt>
LINEDEVSTATE_NUMCOMPLETIONS </dt>
<dd>
The number of outstanding call completions on the line device has changed. </dd>
<dt>
LINEDEVSTATE_TERMINALS </dt>
<dd>
The terminal settings have changed. This can happen, for example, if multiple line devices share terminals (for example, two lines sharing a phone terminal). </dd>
<dt>
LINEDEVSTATE_ROAMMODE </dt>
<dd>
The roam mode of the line device has changed. </dd>
<dt>
LINEDEVSTATE_BATTERY </dt>
<dd>
The battery level has changed significantly (cellular). </dd>
<dt>
LINEDEVSTATE_SIGNAL </dt>
<dd>
The signal level has changed significantly (cellular). </dd>
<dt>
LINEDEVSTATE_DEVSPECIFIC </dt>
<dd>
The line's device-specific information has changed. </dd>
<dt>
LINEDEVSTATE_REINIT </dt>
<dd>
Items have changed in the configuration of line devices. To become aware of these changes (as for the appearance of new line devices) the application should reinitialize its use of TAPI. </dd>
<dt>
LINEDEVSTATE_LOCK </dt>
<dd>
This value is most often used with line devices associated with cellular phones. Many cellular phones have a security mechanism that requires the entry of a password to enable the phone to place calls. This value can be used to indicate to TAPI and its client applications that the phone is locked and cannot place calls until the password is entered on the user interface of the phone, so that the application can present an appropriate alert to the user. </dd>
<dt>
LINEDEVSTATE_REMOVED </dt>
<dd>
The device is being removed from the system by the service provider (most likely through user action, through a control panel or similar utility). A <a href="messgs_58px.htm">LINE_LINEDEVSTATE</a> message with this value will normally be immediately followed by a <a href="messgs_7nhh.htm">LINE_CLOSE</a> message on the device. Subsequent attempts to access the device prior to TAPI being reinitialized will result in LINEERR_NODEVICE being returned to the application. If a service provider sends a LINE_LINEDEVSTATE message containing this value to TAPI, TAPI will pass it along to applications which have negotiated this or a subsequent API version; applications negotiating a previous API version will not receive any notification.
