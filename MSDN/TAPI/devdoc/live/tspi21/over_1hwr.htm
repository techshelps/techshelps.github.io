<h3><a name="_tspi_call_park"></a>Call Park</h3>
<p>
Two forms of call parking are provided: <i>directed</i> call park and <i>nondirected</i> call park. In directed call park, the application specifies the destination address where the call is to be parked. This roughly behaves like a call transfer to the destination address, but it doesn't alert or time out as a transfer would.</p>
<p>
In nondirected call park, the switch returns to tapi32.dll the address where it parked the call. In either case, the <a href="func2_45ij.htm"><b>TSPI_linePark</b></a> function is used to park a given call at another address.A parked call can later be retrieved. The tapi32.dll specifies the park address to <a href="func3_4a23.htm"><b>TSPI_lineUnpark</b></a>, which returns a call handle to the unparked call (it retrieves a parked call). Appropriate <a href="messgs_7gth.htm">LINE_CALLSTATE</a> messages are sent to tapi32.dll as the call is reconnected.</p>
