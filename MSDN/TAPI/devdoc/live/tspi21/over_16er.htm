<h3><a name="_tspi_supplementary_telephony_services"></a>Supplementary Telephony Services</h3>
<p>
Supplementary Telephony includes features found on modern PBXs, such as hold, transfer, conference, park, and so on. All supplementary features are optional.</p>
<p>
A service provider offers any combination of the services. A service provider specifies which services it supports through responses to functions such as <a href="func2_5lo3.htm"><b>TSPI_lineGetDevCaps</b></a> or <a href="func1_16k3.htm"><b>TSPI_lineGetAddressCaps</b></a>. A single supplementary service can consist of multiple function calls and messages. </p>
<p>
<b>Note</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;TAPI, and not the service provider developer, defines the behavior of each of these supplementary features.</p>
<p>
A service provider should provide a supplementary telephony service only if it can implement the exact meaning as defined by TAPI. If not, the feature should be provided as an Extended Telephony service.</p>
<p>
All phone-device services are part of Supplementary Telephony.</p>
