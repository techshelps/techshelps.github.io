<p>
The <b>LINEFORWARD</b> structure describes an entry of the forwarding instructions.</p>
<pre><code>typedef struct lineforward_tag {
    DWORD  dwForwardMode;

<h4>Members</h4>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>dwForwardMode</b></dt>
<dd>
The types of forwarding, of type LINEFORWARDMODE_. The <b>dwForwardMode</b> member can have only a single bit set. Values are: 
<dl>
<dt>
LINEFORWARDMODE_UNCOND </dt>
<dd>
Forward all calls unconditionally, irrespective of their origin. Use this value when unconditional forwarding for internal and external calls cannot be controlled separately. Unconditional forwarding overrides forwarding on busy or no-answer conditions. </dd>
<dt>
LINEFORWARDMODE_UNCONDINTERNAL </dt>
<dd>
Forward all internal calls unconditionally. Use this value when unconditional forwarding for internal and external calls can be controlled separately. </dd>
<dt>
LINEFORWARDMODE_UNCONDEXTERNAL </dt>
<dd>
Forward all external calls unconditionally. Use this value when unconditional forwarding for internal and external calls can be controlled separately. </dd>
<dt>
LINEFORWARDMODE_UNCONDSPECIFIC </dt>
<dd>
Forward all calls that originated at a specified address unconditionally (selective call forwarding). </dd>
<dt>
LINEFORWARDMODE_BUSY </dt>
<dd>
Forward all calls on busy, irrespective of their origin. Use this value when forwarding for internal and external calls on busy and no answer cannot be controlled separately. </dd>
<dt>
LINEFORWARDMODE_BUSYINTERNAL </dt>
<dd>
Forward all internal calls on busy. Use this value when forwarding for internal and external calls on busy and no answer can be controlled separately. </dd>
<dt>
LINEFORWARDMODE_BUSYEXTERNAL </dt>
<dd>
Forward all external calls on busy. Use this value when forwarding for internal and external calls on busy and no answer can be controlled separately. </dd>
<dt>
LINEFORWARDMODE_BUSYSPECIFIC </dt>
<dd>
Forward all calls that originated at a specified address on busy (selective call forwarding). </dd>
<dt>
LINEFORWARDMODE_NOANSW </dt>
<dd>
Forward all calls on no answer, irrespective of their origin. Use this value when call forwarding for internal and external calls on no answer cannot be controlled separately. </dd>
<dt>
LINEFORWARDMODE_NOANSWINTERNAL </dt>
<dd>
Forward all internal calls on no answer. Use this value when forwarding for internal and external calls on no answer can be controlled separately. </dd>
<dt>
LINEFORWARDMODE_NOANSWEXTERNAL </dt>
<dd>
Forward all external calls on no answer. Use this value when forwarding for internal and external calls on no answer can be controlled separately. </dd>
<dt>
LINEFORWARDMODE_NOANSWSPECIFIC </dt>
<dd>
Forward all calls that originated at a specified address on no answer (selective call forwarding). </dd>
<dt>
LINEFORWARDMODE_BUSYNA </dt>
<dd>
Forward all calls on busy/no answer, irrespective of their origin. Use this value when forwarding for internal and external calls on busy and no answer cannot be controlled separately. </dd>
<dt>
LINEFORWARDMODE_BUSYNAINTERNAL </dt>
<dd>
Forward all internal calls on busy/no answer. Use this value when call forwarding on busy and no answer cannot be controlled separately for internal calls. </dd>
<dt>
LINEFORWARDMODE_BUSYNAEXTERNAL </dt>
<dd>
Forward all external calls on busy/no answer. Use this value when call forwarding on busy and no answer cannot be controlled separately for internal calls. </dd>
<dt>
LINEFORWARDMODE_BUSYNASPECIFIC </dt>
<dd>
Forward all calls that originated at a specified address on busy/no answer (selective call forwarding). </dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dt>
<b>dwCallerAddressSize</b></dt>
<dt>
<b>dwCallerAddressOffset</b></dt>
<dd>
The size in bytes and the offset from the beginning of the containing data structure in bytes of the variably sized address field containing the address of a caller to be forwarded. The <b>dwCallerAddressSize/Offset</b> member is set to zero if <b>dwForwardMode</b> is not one of the following: LINEFORWARDMODE_BUSYNASPECIFIC, LINEFORWARDMODE_NOANSWSPECIFIC, LINEFORWARDMODE_UNCONDSPECIFIC, or LINEFORWARDMODE_BUSYSPECIFIC.
<p>
The offset <b>dwCallerAddressOffset</b> in the variably sized field of type <b>LINEFORWARD</b> pointed at by <b>dwForwardSize/Offset</b> is relative to the beginning of the <a href="struc1_6inm.htm"><b>LINEADDRESSSTATUS</b></a> data structure (the "root" container).
</dd>
<dt>
<b>dwDestCountryCode</b></dt>
<dd>
The country code of the destination address where the call is to be forwarded.</dd>
<dt>
<b>dwDestAddressSize</b></dt>
<dt>
<b>dwDestAddressOffset</b></dt>
<dd>
The size in bytes and the offset from the beginning of the containing data structure in bytes of the variably sized address field containing the address of the address where calls are to be forwarded.
<p>
The offset <b>dwDestAddressOffset</b> in the variably sized field of type <b>LINEFORWARD</b> pointed at by <b>dwForwardSize/Offset</b> is relative to the beginning of the <a href="struc1_6inm.htm"><b>LINEADDRESSSTATUS</b></a> data structure (the "root" container).

</dd>
</dl>
<h4>Remarks</h4>
<p>
Not extensible.</p>
<p>
Each entry in the <b>LINEFORWARD</b> structure specifies a forwarding request.</p>
