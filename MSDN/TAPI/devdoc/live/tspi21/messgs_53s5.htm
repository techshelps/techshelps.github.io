<h1><a name="_tspi_line_addressstate"></a>LINE_ADDRESSSTATE</h1>
<p>
The LINE_ADDRESSSTATE message is sent to the <a href="func3_7q7o.htm"><b>LINEEVENT</b></a> callback function when the status of an address changes on a line that is currently open by TAPI. TAPI can invoke <a href="func1_4m5v.htm"><b>TSPI_lineGetAddressStatus</b></a> to determine the current status of the address.</p>
<pre><code>LINE_ADDRESSSTATE
htLine = (HTAPILINE) hLineDevice;
htCall = (HTAPICALL) 0;
dwMsg = (DWORD) LINE_ADDRESSSTATE;
dwParam1 = (DWORD) idAddress;
dwParam2 = (DWORD) AddressState;
dwParam3 = (DWORD) 0;
 </code></pre>
<h4>Parameters</h4>
<dl>
<dt>
<i>htLine</i></dt>
<dd>
The TAPI opaque object handle to the line device.</dd>
<dt>
<i>htCall</i></dt>
<dd>
Unused.</dd>
<dt>
<i>dwMsg</i></dt>
<dd>
The value LINE_ADDRESSSTATE.</dd>
<dt>
<i>dwParam1</i></dt>
<dd>
The address identifier of the address that changed status.</dd>
<dt>
<i>dwParam2</i></dt>
<dd>
The address state that changed. This parameter can be a combination of the following LINEADDRESSSTATE_constants: 
<dl>
<dt>
LINEADDRESSSTATE_OTHER </dt>
<dd>
Address-status items other than those listed below have changed. TAPI can check the current address status to determine which items have changed. </dd>
<dt>
LINEADDRESSSTATE_DEVSPECIFIC </dt>
<dd>
The device-specific item of the address status has changed. </dd>
<dt>
LINEADDRESSSTATE_INUSEZERO </dt>
<dd>
The address has changed to idle (it is now in use by zero stations). </dd>
<dt>
LINEADDRESSSTATE_INUSEONE </dt>
<dd>
The address has changed from being idle or from being in use by many bridged stations to being in use by just one station. </dd>
<dt>
LINEADDRESSSTATE_INUSEMANY </dt>
<dd>
The monitored or bridged address has changed from being in use by one station to being in use by more than one station. </dd>
<dt>
LINEADDRESSSTATE_NUMCALLS </dt>
<dd>
The number of calls on the address has changed. This is the result of an event such as a new inbound call, an outbound call on the address, or a call changing its hold status. </dd>
<dt>
LINEADDRESSSTATE_FORWARD </dt>
<dd>
The forwarding status of the address has changed including the number of rings for determining a no-answer condition. The application can check the address status to determine details about the address's current forwarding status. </dd>
<dt>
LINEADDRESSSTATE_TERMINALS </dt>
<dd>
The terminal settings for the address have changed. </dd>
<dt>
LINEADDRESSSTATE_CAPSCHANGE </dt>
<dd>
Due to configuration changes made by the user or other circumstances, one or more of the members in the <a href="struc1_54du.htm"><b>LINEADDRESSCAPS</b></a> structure for the address have changed. If a service provider sends a LINE_ADDRESSSTATE message containing this value to TAPI, TAPI passes it along to applications that have negotiated this or a later API version; applications negotiating an earlier API version receive <a href="messgs_58px.htm">LINE_LINEDEVSTATE</a> messages specifying LINEDEVSTATE_REINIT, requiring them to shut down and reinitialize their connection to TAPI to obtain the updated information. </dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dt>
<i>dwParam3</i></dt>
<dd>
Unused.
</dd>
</dl>
<h4>Remarks</h4>
<p>
This message is sent whenever the line is open by TAPI and an event occurs in which TAPI has expressed an interest. TAPI uses the <a href="func2_9fhv.htm"><b>TSPI_lineSetStatusMessages</b></a> function to specify the set of status-change events in which it is interested. By default, address status reporting is disabled.</p>
<p>
For backward compatibility, older service providers are not expected to generate this value in a LINE_ADDRESSSTATE message. If they do, the message should be handled in the same manner as for newer service providers (as described earlier).</p>
