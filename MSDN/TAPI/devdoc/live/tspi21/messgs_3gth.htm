<h1><a name="_tspi_phone_remove"></a>PHONE_REMOVE</h1>
<p>
The PHONE_REMOVE message notifies TAPI that a phone device has been or is about to be removed from the system.</p>
<pre><code>PHONE_REMOVE
htPhone = (DWORD) 0;
dwMsg = PHONE_REMOVE;
dwParam1 = (DWORD) dwDeviceID;
dwParam2 = (DWORD) 0;
dwParam3 = (DWORD) 0;
 </code></pre>
<h4>Parameters</h4>
<dl>
<dt>
<i>dwDeviceID</i></dt>
<dd>
The device that has been removed.
</dd>
</dl>
<h4>Remarks</h4>
<p>
A service provider sends a PHONE_REMOVE message to TAPI to disable an existing phone device. This can occur when the removal of the device from the system (in a permanent way) is detected by Plug and Play or through a control panel or other user interface. It should not be used when a device is temporarily disconnected, such as if the device is a PCMCIA card that is extracted (use PHONESTATE_DISCONNECTED in this situation).</p>
<p>
When the message is received, TAPI closes the phone device (if it is not already closed) by calling <a href="func3_9z8l.htm"><b>TSPI_phoneClose</b></a>, and sends <a href="messgs_0145.htm">PHONE_CLOSE</a> to all applications that have the phone open. After processing the message, TAPI does not call the service provider referencing the removed device's <i>dwDeviceID</i>. TAPI returns PHONEERR_NODEVICE to any application that attempts to reference the removed <i>dwDeviceID</i>.</p>
<p>
After <a href="func1_2lke.htm"><b>TSPI_providerShutdown</b></a> has been called, the service provider can renumber its devices to remove any numbering "gaps" left by the device removal, so that when <a href="func1_71kj.htm"><b>TSPI_providerEnumDevices</b></a> is subsequently called, installed devices are contiguously numbered. The service provider should not reuse the dwPermanentPhoneID that had been assigned to the device, for as long as possible.</p>
<p>
The PHONE_REMOVE mechanism is to be used only if devices are removed while the service provider is active (for example, between <a href="func1_9pv8.htm"><b>TSPI_providerInit</b></a> and <b>TSPI_providerShutdown</b>).</p>
<p>
This message is sent to the <b>PHONEEVENT</b> callback entry point in TAPI. The service provider receives a pointer to this callback in the <b>TSPI_providerEnumDevices</b> function and in each <a href="func3_9bn2.htm"><b>TSPI_phoneOpen</b></a> function; the PHONE_REMOVE message can be sent to the <b>PHONEEVENT</b> callback function given to any open phone or at startup.</p>
<h4>Backward Compatibility</h4>
<p>
Older service providers are not expected to send this message. If they do, the message is treated in the same manner as described above for new service providers.</p>
