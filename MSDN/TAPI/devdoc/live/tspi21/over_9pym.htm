<h3><a name="_tspi_call_completion"></a>Call Completion</h3>
<p>
When making an outbound call, the unavailability of certain resources can prevent the call from reaching the <i>connected</i> state, as when the destination party is busy or doesn't answer. Unavailable resources include trunk circuits as well as the destination party's station. <a href="func1_0m0c.htm"><b>TSPI_lineCompleteCall</b></a> allows tapi32.dll to specify how it wants to complete a call that cannot be completed normally, and as a result, generates a call completion request. The tapi32.dll has the following options:
<ul>
<li>
<b>Camp-on</b> queues the call until the call can be completed.</li>
<li>
<b>Call back</b> requests the called station to return the call when it returns to idle. Answering the callback can automatically reinitiate (redial) the connection request.</li>
<li>
<b>Intrude</b> allows tapi32.dll to barge in on the existing call.</li>
<li>
<b>Message</b> (also known as "leave word calling") allows tapi32.dll to send one of a small number of predefined messages to the destination. These messages can be text shown on the phone's display, a voice message left for the user, and so on.</li>
</ul>
<p>
A call completion request can be canceled with <a href="func3_18bw.htm"><b>TSPI_lineUncompleteCall</b></a>. Multiple call completion requests can potentially be outstanding for a given address at any one time. To identify individual requests, the implementation returns a completion identifier. When a call completion request completes and results in a new call, the call completion identifier is available in the <a href="struc1_1ks2.htm"><b>LINECALLINFO</b></a> data structure returned by <a href="func1_1shb.htm"><b>TSPI_lineGetCallInfo</b></a>. Canceling a call completion request in progress also uses this call completion identifier.</p>
