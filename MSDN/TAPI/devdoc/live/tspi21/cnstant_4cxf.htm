<h1><a name="_tspi_linemediamode__constants"></a>LINEMEDIAMODE_ Constants</h1>
<p>
The LINEMEDIAMODE_ constants describe the common media modes (the datatypes of a media stream) on calls. They are used in a system of priority ordering when presenting a new incoming call of UNKNOWN media mode with multiple specific media mode flags set. The priority determines which media-handling application the call should be presented to first. (Extension media modes are considered to all have a lower priority order than the common media modes.) 
<dl>
<dt>
LINEMEDIAMODE_UNKNOWN </dt>
<dd>
A media stream exists but its mode is not currently known and may become known later. This corresponds to a call with an unclassified media type. In typical analog telephony environments, an inbound call's media mode can be unknown until after the call has been answered and the media stream filtered to make a determination. </dd>
<dt>
LINEMEDIAMODE_INTERACTIVEVOICE </dt>
<dd>
The presence of voice energy on the call and the call is treated as an interactive call with humans on both ends. </dd>
<dt>
LINEMEDIAMODE_AUTOMATEDVOICE </dt>
<dd>
The presence of voice energy on the call and the voice is locally handled by an automated application. </dd>
<dt>
LINEMEDIAMODE_DATAMODEM </dt>
<dd>
A data modem session on the call. </dd>
<dt>
LINEMEDIAMODE_G3FAX </dt>
<dd>
A group 3 fax is being sent or received over the call. </dd>
<dt>
LINEMEDIAMODE_TDD </dt>
<dd>
A TDD (Telephony Devices for the Deaf) session on the call. </dd>
<dt>
LINEMEDIAMODE_G4FAX </dt>
<dd>
A group 4 fax is being sent or received over the call. </dd>
<dt>
LINEMEDIAMODE_DIGITALDATA </dt>
<dd>
Digital data is being sent or received over the call. </dd>
<dt>
LINEMEDIAMODE_TELETEX </dt>
<dd>
A teletex session on the call. Teletex is one of the telematic services. </dd>
<dt>
LINEMEDIAMODE_VIDEOTEX </dt>
<dd>
A videotex session on the call. Videotex is one the telematic services. </dd>
<dt>
LINEMEDIAMODE_TELEX </dt>
<dd>
A telex session on the call. Telex is one the telematic services. </dd>
<dt>
LINEMEDIAMODE_MIXED </dt>
<dd>
A mixed session on the call. Mixed is one the ISDN telematic services. </dd>
<dt>
LINEMEDIAMODE_ADSI </dt>
<dd>
An ADSI (Analog Display Services Interface) session on the call. </dd>
<dt>
LINEMEDIAMODE_VOICEVIEW </dt>
<dd>
The media mode of the call is VoiceView. 
</dd>
</dl>
<p>
The high-order 8 bits can be assigned for device-specific extensions. The low-order 24 bits are reserved.</p>
<p>
Note that bearer mode and media mode are different notions. The bearer mode of a call is an indication of the quality of the telephone connection as provided primarily by the network. The media mode of a call is an indication of the type of information stream that is exchanged over that call. Group 3 fax and data modem are media modes that use a call with a 3.1kHz voice bearer mode.</p>
