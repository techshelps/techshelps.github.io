<p>
You can develop telephony service providers for a variety of telephone network services and technologies, including:
<ul>
<li>
<b>POTS (Plain Old Telephone Service)</b> Voice and data are transmitted in analog format while in the <i>local loop</i> and are digitally transmitted elsewhere. Typically, one media mode per call, one channel per line.</li>
<li>
<b>ISDN (Integrated Services Digital Network)</b> Transmitted digitally. Speeds of up to 128 Kbps on Basic Rate Interface (BRI-ISDN) lines and much higher on Primary Rate Interface (PRI-ISDN) lines. At least three channels and as many as 32 channels, for simultaneous, independently operated transmission of voice and data. International standard.</li>
<li>
<b>T1/E1</b> Transmitted digitally. T1 is a transmission link with a capacity of 1.544 Mbps, typically used for connecting networks across remote distances. In Europe T1 is called E1.</li>
<li>
<b>Switched 56</b> Signaling at 56 Kbps over dial-up telephone lines, but requires special equipment. Limited to calls to other specially equipped facilities.</li>
<li>
<b>CENTREX</b> Centralized network services through regular telephone lines and using telephone company equipment. No special equipment required.</li>
<li>
<b>Digital PBXs (private branch exchanges) and key systems</b> Voice and data transmitted on private telephone systems using proprietary interfaces.</li>
</ul>
