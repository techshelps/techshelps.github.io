<p>
In POTS, exactly one channel exists on a line, and this is used exclusively for voice. With ISDN, at least three (and as many as 31) channels can exist on a line concurrently. The simplest form of Win32 Telephony functionality involves POTS applications that handle a single line using its single channel. In POTS, an application that wants to transmit data communicates over one line, and a voice application communicates over another line; both of these applications could use the same line, but not at the same time.</p>
<p>
In the simplest case, one line has exactly one address (telephone number). In cases where lines carry two or more channels, each channel usually has its own address, which means that a line has as many addresses as it has channels. To make addresses easier to manipulate, TAPI assigns address identifiers to them, in a contiguous range of integers starting with 0. This lets the software interfaces refer to addresses independently of the address syntax on any particular telephone network.</p>
