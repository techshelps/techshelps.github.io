<h3><a name="_tspi_address_formats"></a>Address Formats</h3>
<p>
An address assigned to a line device is typically selected by its address identifier. Each address identifier corresponds to a directory number through which the address is known to entities that want to make calls to it. Also, making outbound calls typically requires that a directory number be supplied to identify the called party.</p>
