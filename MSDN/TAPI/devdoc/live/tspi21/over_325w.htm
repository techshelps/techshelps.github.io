<h3><a name="_tspi_call_accept_reject_and_redirect"></a>Call Accept, Reject, and Redirect</h3>
<p>
In environments like ISDN, call offering is separate from alerting. On an ISDN network, call offering is the process of sending a call-setup message from the switch. This occurs <i>before</i> ringing, so the call can be redirected before it is answered. The <b>lineAccept</b> function means "start ringing" for ISDN. For POTS, it means that some application has accepted responsibility for the call and has presented it to the user.</p>
<p>
After a call has been offered to tapi32.dll, a time window exists during which tapi32.dll has a number of options:
<ul>
<li>
tapi32.dll can simply answer the call using <a href="func1_2rw2.htm"><b>TSPI_lineAnswer</b></a>.</li>
<li>
tapi32.dll can accept the call using <a href="func1_5rzo.htm"><b>TSPI_lineAccept</b></a>, which also initiates alerting to the caller (as <i>ringback</i>), and to the called party (as <i>ring</i>).</li>
<li>
tapi32.dll can reject the offering call using <a href="func1_87u8.htm"><b>TSPI_lineDrop</b></a>. The call remains valid but transitions to the <i>idle</i> state.</li>
<li>
tapi32.dll can redirect the call using <a href="func2_43lg.htm"><b>TSPI_lineRedirect</b></a>, which deflects the offering call to another address. The call remains valid but transitions to the <i>idle</i> state.</li>
</ul>
