<p>
The service provider must implement and export the Telephony Service Provider Interface (TSPI) functions needed to ensure that the requests from the TAPI dynamic-link library (DLL) are carried out correctly.</p>
<p>
The service provider must process all requests received from the TAPI. A service provider does not have access to other service providers.</p>
<p>
Although TAPI grants simultaneous access by multiple applications to a single service provider, the service provider is not responsible for managing this access.</p>
<p>
TAPI assigns a device identifier to each service provider. The set of device identifiers for all services providers is contiguous and nonoverlapping.</p>
<p>
The service provider supports the low-level, device-specific aspects of telephony. This includes functions that manage the states of calls, dialing, signal generation and detection, and switchboard controlling.</p>
<p>
The implementations of such functions differ greatly from one device to another. For example, a service provider that provides direct management of analog phone lines can contain and control hardware for detecting onhook/offhook signals, generating and filtering tones, and so on. A service provider that worked in conjunction with a PBX can send command streams over a digital network to request similar operations from a piece of remote hardware. Service providers hide the device-specific details of how telephony operations are implemented.</p>
