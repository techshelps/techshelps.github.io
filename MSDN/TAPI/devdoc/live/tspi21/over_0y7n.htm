<h2><a name="_tspi_address_configurations_functions_and_messages"></a>Address Configurations, Functions, and Messages</h2>
<p>
Each line device is assigned one or more <i>addresses</i>. An address corresponds to a telephone directory number, and it is actually assigned twice: first, by the telephone company at the switch, and second, by the user while configuring the local system. If a telephone number is changed at the switch, the user will normally need to assign the new number at the local system, although some systems may be sophisticated enough to perform the reassignment without human interaction.</p>
<p>
After addresses have been assigned to lines, the service provider assigns <i>address identifiers</i> to addresses. An address identifier is a number between 0 and the number of addresses on the line minus one. Because each address depends on its line for its existence, the address's identifier is meaningful only in the context of the associated line device. For this reason, an address name consists of not only the address identifier, but also an identifier of the line.</p>
<p>
More than one address can be assigned to a line device. (The number of assigned addresses is returned by the <a href="func2_5lo3.htm"><b>TSPI_lineGetDevCaps</b></a> function.) These address-to-line assignments (as modeled by the Telephony SPI) are static in that they change only when reconfigured in any of several ways at the switch or network. The relationship between an address and a line and between the address and other local addresses is known as the address's <i>configuration</i>.</p>
<p>
Usually, one of the addresses assigned to a line is that line's <i>primary address</i>. A primary address is the one address on a line that can uniquely identify the line device. This primary address may also be assigned to other lines as a nonprimary address.</p>
<p>
The network or switch can configure address-to-line assignments in several ways. Usually, one of the addresses assigned to a line is that line's primary address. A line's primary address is able to uniquely identify the line device, although the address may also be assigned to other lines as a nonprimary address. Address configurations recognized by the Telephony SPI include:
<ol>
<li>
<b>Private</b> The address is assigned to one line device only. An inbound call for this address is only offered at one line device.</li>
<li>
<b>Bridged</b> A bridged address is a single address assigned to more than one line device. Depending on the switch vendor, different terminology may be used such as <i>multiple appearance directory number (MADN)</i>, <i>bridged appearance</i>, or <i>shared appearance</i>. An incoming call on a bridged address is offered on all lines associated with the address. The network of lines connected together is known as the <i>bridge</i>. Different variations of bridged behavior are possible:<ul>
<li>
<i>Bridged-Exclusive</i>. Connecting one of the bridged lines to a remote party causes the address to appear in use to all other parties that are part of the bridge.</li>
<li>
<i>Bridged-New</i>. Connecting one of the bridged lines to a remote party does not preclude the other lines from using the bridged address to answer or make calls. However, a new call appearance is allocated to another of the connected lines.</li>
<li>
<i>Bridged-Shared</i>. If one line is connected to a remote party, other bridged lines that use the address automatically enter into a multiparty conference call on the existing call.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<b>Monitored</b> The line indicates the busy or idle status of the address, but the line cannot use the address for answering or making calls.</li>
</ol>
