<h1><a name="_tspi_what_s_new_for_tspi_version_2.1"></a>What's New for TSPI Version 2.1</h1>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Part of the Telephony Application Programming Interface (TAPI) information set.</b> TSPI documentation now appears in the same information set as TAPI.</li>
<li>
<b>Updated document organization</b>. The documentation supporting TSPI is organized to parallel TAPI documentation.</li>
<li>
<b>Functions updated. </b>Functions that are implemented in service providers for TAPI version 1.4 and earlier but were replaced by Telephony user interface SPIs (TUISPI) in version 2.0 have been annotated as obsolete. However, owing to their value for earlier TAPI versions, these functions remain in the information set as well as cross-reference to their replacements.</li>
