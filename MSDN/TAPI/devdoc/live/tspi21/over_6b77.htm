<h4><a name="_tspi_hookswitch_devices"></a>Hookswitch Devices</h4>
<p>
A phone device can have multiple hookswitch devices. Each hookswitch device has a speaker and a microphone component, and operates in one of four hookswitch modes: </p>
<table cellspacing=4 cols=2>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=41%>Onhook </td>
<td width=59%>The hookswitch device is onhook, and both its microphone and speaker are disabled. </td>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=41%>Microphone only </td>
<td width=59%>The hookswitch device is offhook, its microphone is enabled, and its speaker is mute. </td>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=41%>Speaker only </td>
<td width=59%>The hookswitch device is offhook, its microphone is disabled, and its speaker is enabled. </td>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=41%>Microphone and speaker </td>
<td width=59%>The hookswitch device is offhook, and both the microphone and the speaker are enabled. </td>
</tr>
</table><br>
<p>
The tapi32.dll can set and query the hookswitch mode of an opened phone's hookswitch devices. To mute or unmute the microphone or speaker component of a hookswitch device, the <a href="func3_8tns.htm"><b>TSPI_phoneSetHookSwitch</b></a> function is used with the appropriate hookswitch mode. This function sets the hookswitch mode of one or more of the hookswitch devices of an open phone device. The <a href="func3_42eg.htm"><b>TSPI_phoneGetHookSwitch</b></a> function queries the hookswitch mode of a hookswitch device of an open phone device.</p>
<p>
When the mode of a phone's hookswitch device is changed manually, for example by lifting the handset from its cradle, the service provider must send a PHONE_STATUS message to the The tapi32.dll callback function to notify it about the state change. Parameters to this message provide an indication of the change.</p>
<p>
The volume of the speaker component of a hookswitch device can be set with <a href="func3_03dx.htm"><b>TSPI_phoneSetVolume</b></a>. The volume setting is different from mute in that muting a speaker and later unmuting it preserves the volume setting of the speaker. The <a href="func3_6tgl.htm"><b>TSPI_phoneGetVolume</b></a><b> </b>function returns the volume setting of the hookswitch device's speaker of an open phone device.</p>
<p>
The microphone component of a hookswitch device can be gain controlled. The gain setting is different from mute in that muting a microphone and later unmuting it preserves the gain setting of the microphone. <a href="func3_5n3i.htm"><b>TSPI_phoneSetGain</b></a> sets the gain of a hookswitch device's microphone of an open phone device, and <a href="func3_33u6.htm"><b>TSPI_phoneGetGain</b></a> returns the gain setting of the hookswitch device's microphone of an opened phone.</p>
<p>
When the volume or gain of a phone's hookswitch device is changed, the service provider sends a PHONE_STATUS message to the tapi32.dll callback function to notify tapi32.dll about the state change. Parameters to this message provide an indication of the change.</p>
