<h1><a name="_tspi_linecallstate__constants"></a>LINECALLSTATE_ Constants</h1>
<p>
The LINECALLSTATE_ bit-flag constants describe the call states a call can be in. 
<dl>
<dt>
LINECALLSTATE_IDLE </dt>
<dd>
The call is idle; no call actually exists. </dd>
<dt>
LINECALLSTATE_OFFERING </dt>
<dd>
The call is being offered to the station, signaling the arrival of a new call. In some environments, a call in the <i>offering</i> state does not automatically alert the user; alerting is done by the switch instructing the line to ring. It does not affect any call states. </dd>
<dt>
LINECALLSTATE_ACCEPTED </dt>
<dd>
The call was offering and has been accepted. This indicates to other (monitoring) applications that the current owner application has claimed responsibility for answering the call. In ISDN, this also initiates alerting to both parties. </dd>
<dt>
LINECALLSTATE_DIALTONE </dt>
<dd>
The call is receiving a dial tone from the switch, which means that the switch is ready to receive a dialed number. </dd>
<dt>
LINECALLSTATE_DIALING </dt>
<dd>
Destination address information (a phone number) is being sent to the switch over the call. Note that the operation <a href="func1_4m7n.htm"><b>TSPI_lineGenerateDigits</b></a> does not place the line into the <i>dialing</i> state. </dd>
<dt>
LINECALLSTATE_RINGBACK </dt>
<dd>
The call is receiving ringback from the called address. Ringback indicates that the other station has been reached and is being alerted. </dd>
<dt>
LINECALLSTATE_BUSY </dt>
<dd>
The call is receiving a busy tone. A busy tone indicates that the call cannot be completed because either a circuit (trunk) or the remote party's station are in use. </dd>
<dt>
LINECALLSTATE_SPECIALINFO </dt>
<dd>
Special information is sent by the network. Special information is typically sent when the destination cannot be reached. </dd>
<dt>
LINECALLSTATE_CONNECTED </dt>
<dd>
The call has been established and the connection is made. Information is able to flow over the call between the originating address and the destination address. </dd>
<dt>
LINECALLSTATE_PROCEEDING </dt>
<dd>
Dialing has completed and the call is proceeding through the switch or telephone network. </dd>
<dt>
LINECALLSTATE_ONHOLD </dt>
<dd>
The call is on hold by the switch. </dd>
<dt>
LINECALLSTATE_CONFERENCED </dt>
<dd>
The call is currently a member of a multiparty conference call. </dd>
<dt>
LINECALLSTATE_ONHOLDPENDCONF </dt>
<dd>
The call is currently on hold while it is being added to a conference. </dd>
<dt>
LINECALLSTATE_ONHOLDPENDTRANSFER </dt>
<dd>
The call is currently on hold awaiting transfer to another number. </dd>
<dt>
LINECALLSTATE_DISCONNECTED </dt>
<dd>
The remote party has disconnected from the call. </dd>
<dt>
LINECALLSTATE_UNKNOWN </dt>
<dd>
The state of the call is not known. This can be due to limitations of the call-progress detection implementation. 
</dd>
</dl>
<p>
The high-order 8 bits can define a device-specific substate of any of the predefined states, provided that one of the LINECALLSTATE_ bits defined above is also set. The low-order 24 bits are reserved for predefined states.</p>
<p>
The LINECALLSTATE_ constants are used as parameters by the <a href="messgs_7gth.htm">LINE_CALLSTATE</a> message sent to the application; the message carries the new call state that the call transitioned to. These constants are also used in members of the <b>LINECALLSTATUS</b> structure, returned by the <b>TSPI_lineGetCallStatus</b> function.</p>
