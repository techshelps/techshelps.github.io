<h1><a name="_tspi_lineaddressstate__constants"></a>LINEADDRESSSTATE_ Constants</h1>
<p>
The LINEADDRESSSTATE_ bit-flag constants describe various address status items. 
<dl>
<dt>
LINEADDRESSSTATE_OTHER </dt>
<dd>
Address-status items other than those listed below have changed. </dd>
<dt>
LINEADDRESSSTATE_DEVSPECIFIC </dt>
<dd>
The device-specific item of the address status has changed. </dd>
<dt>
LINEADDRESSSTATE_INUSEZERO </dt>
<dd>
The address has changed to idle (it is not in use by any stations). </dd>
<dt>
LINEADDRESSSTATE_INUSEONE </dt>
<dd>
The address has changed from being idle or from being in use by many bridged stations to being in use by just one station. </dd>
<dt>
LINEADDRESSSTATE_INUSEMANY </dt>
<dd>
The monitored or bridged address has changed from being in use by one station to being in use by more than one station. </dd>
<dt>
LINEADDRESSSTATE_NUMCALLS </dt>
<dd>
The number of calls on the address has changed. This is the result of such things as a new inbound call, an outbound call on the address, or a call changing its hold status. If this bit is set, one or more of the following members in the <a href="struc1_6inm.htm"><b>LINEADDRESSSTATUS</b></a> structure has changed: <b>dwNumActiveCalls</b>, <b>dwNumOnHoldCalls</b>, and <b>dwNumOnHoldPendingCalls</b>. The application should check all three members when it receives a <a href="messgs_53s5.htm">LINE_ADDRESSSTATE</a> (<i>numCalls</i>) message. </dd>
<dt>
LINEADDRESSSTATE_FORWARD </dt>
<dd>
The forwarding status of the address has changed, including possibly the number of rings for determining a no-answer condition. The application should check the address status to determine details about the address's current forwarding status. </dd>
<dt>
LINEADDRESSSTATE_TERMINALS </dt>
<dd>
The terminal settings for the address have changed. 
</dd>
</dl>
<p>
Not extensible. All 32 bits are reserved.</p>
<p>
An application is notified about changes to these status items in the LINE_ADDRESSSTATE message. The address's device capabilities indicate which address state changes can possibly be reported for this address.</p>
