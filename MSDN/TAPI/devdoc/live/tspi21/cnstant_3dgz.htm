<h1><a name="_tspi_linebusymode__constants"></a>LINEBUSYMODE_ Constants</h1>
<p>
The LINEBUSYMODE_ bit-flag constants describe different busy signals that the switch or network can generate. The different busy signals typically indicate that a different resource required to make a call is currently in use. 
<dl>
<dt>
LINEBUSYMODE_STATION </dt>
<dd>
The busy signal indicates that the called party's station is busy. This is usually signaled with a "normal" busy tone. </dd>
<dt>
LINEBUSYMODE_TRUNK </dt>
<dd>
The busy signal indicates that a trunk or circuit is busy. This is usually signaled with a "fast" busy tone. </dd>
<dt>
LINEBUSYMODE_UNKNOWN </dt>
<dd>
The busy signal's specific mode is currently unknown, but can become known later. </dd>
<dt>
LINEBUSYMODE_UNAVAIL </dt>
<dd>
The busy signal's specific mode is unavailable and cannot become known. 
</dd>
</dl>
<p>
The high-order 16 bits can be assigned for device-specific extensions. The low-order 16 bits are reserved.</p>
<p>
Note that busy signals may be sent as inband tones or out-of-band messages. TAPI makes no assumption about the specific signaling mechanism.</p>
