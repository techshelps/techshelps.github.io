<h1><a name="_tspi_linedisconnectmode__constants"></a>LINEDISCONNECTMODE_ Constants</h1>
<p>
The LINEDISCONNECTMODE_ bit-flag constants describe different reasons for a remote disconnect request. A disconnect mode is available as a call status to the application after the call state transitions to <i>disconnected</i>. 
<dl>
<dt>
LINEDISCONNECTMODE_NORMAL </dt>
<dd>
A "normal" disconnect request by the remote party; the call was terminated normally. </dd>
<dt>
LINEDISCONNECTMODE_UNKNOWN </dt>
<dd>
The reason for the disconnect request is unknown, but can become known later. </dd>
<dt>
LINEDISCONNECTMODE_REJECT </dt>
<dd>
The remote user has rejected the call. </dd>
<dt>
LINEDISCONNECTMODE_PICKUP </dt>
<dd>
The call was picked up from elsewhere. </dd>
<dt>
LINEDISCONNECTMODE_FORWARDED </dt>
<dd>
The call was forwarded by the switch. </dd>
<dt>
LINEDISCONNECTMODE_BUSY </dt>
<dd>
The remote user's station is busy. </dd>
<dt>
LINEDISCONNECTMODE_NOANSWER </dt>
<dd>
The remote user's station does not answer. </dd>
<dt>
LINEDISCONNECTMODE_BADADDRESS </dt>
<dd>
The destination address in invalid. </dd>
<dt>
LINEDISCONNECTMODE_UNREACHABLE </dt>
<dd>
The remote user could not be reached. </dd>
<dt>
LINEDISCONNECTMODE_CONGESTION </dt>
<dd>
The network is congested. </dd>
<dt>
LINEDISCONNECTMODE_INCOMPATIBLE </dt>
<dd>
The remote user's station equipment is incompatible for the type of call requested. </dd>
<dt>
LINEDISCONNECTMODE_UNAVAIL </dt>
<dd>
The reason for the disconnect is unavailable and cannot become known later. </dd>
<dt>
LINEDISCONNECTMODE_NODIALTONE </dt>
<dd>
A dial tone was not detected within a service-provider defined timeout, at a point during dialing when one was expected (such as at a "W" in the dialable string). This can also occur without a service-provider-defined timeout period or without a value specified in the <b>dwWaitForDialTone</b> member of the <a href="struc2_2e0i.htm"><b>LINEDIALPARAMS</b></a> structure. 
</dd>
</dl>
<p>
The high-order 16 bits can be assigned for device-specific extensions. The low-order 16 bits are reserved.</p>
<p>
A remote disconnect request for a given call results in the call state transitioning to the <i>disconnected</i> state and a <a href="messgs_7gth.htm">LINE_CALLSTATE</a> messages is sent to the application. The LINEDISCONNECTMODE_ constants provide details about the remote disconnect request. It is available in the call's <b>LINECALLSTATUS</b> structure when the call is in the <i>disconnected</i> state. While a call is in this state, the application is still allowed to query the calls information and status. For example, user-to-user information received as part of the remote disconnect is available then. The application can clear a <i>disconnected</i> call by dropping the call.</p>
