<p>
<span style=color:#FF0000>[This is preliminary documentation and subject to change.]</span> </p>
<p>
The ICM 2.0 Programmer's Reference includes a sample application, ICMView. It serves both as a functioning application for demonstrating what <a href="icmglsry_6ysj.htm#_win32_icm_2.0_glossary_color_mapping_gloss">color mapping</a> accomplishes, and a programming example illustrating the use of many of the ICM 2.0 functions. </p>
<p>
ICMView is unusual in that it implements color management both inside <i>and</i> outside of the device context. This is helpful for demonstration purposes, but not characteristic of most real-world applications. In general, an application would be likely to use one strategy or the other, not both.</p>
<p>
Much of the sample code is dedicated to creating a normal Windows application. Of particular interest to programmers concerned with color management using ICM 2.0 are the user-defined DIBPaint function in Dibs.c and the user-defined PrintImage function in Print.c.</p>
<p>
DIBPaint illustrates using ICM functions to perform color management within a device context. PrintImage, on the other hand, performs color management outside the device context. It is worth noting that in a more complex application, the printer output profile should be reset every time an end-of-page occurs.</p>
