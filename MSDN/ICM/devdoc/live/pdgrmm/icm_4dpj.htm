Color management is not a new topic. It has been in common use for nearly as long as there have been commercial printing and publishing companies. A well-developed body of theory and experience has been applied in recent years to computerized imaging and publishing systems. The concepts embodied in these theories and practices are based on human color perception.</p>
<p>
It is not necessary for application developers to possess a high level of expertise in the physiology of the eye and nervous system. Nor is it necessary to be an expert in the physics of light. However, an understanding of the fundamentals of vision and imaging will aid developers in using Image Color Management 2.0. These fundamentals include:
