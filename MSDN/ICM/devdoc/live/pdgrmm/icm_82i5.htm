<h2><a name="_win32_what_s_new_in_version_2.0_of_icm"></a>What's New in Version 2.0 of ICM</h2>
<p>
<span style=color:#FF0000>[This is preliminary documentation and subject to change.]</span> </p>
<p>
Version 1.0 of Image Color Management (ICM) was delivered in Microsoft Windows 95, and provides basic color management capabilities within Windows device contexts.</p>
<p>
ICM Version 2.0 is planned for delivery in Windows 98 and Windows NT 5.0, and includes a variety of new functions that implement color management outside of device contexts. These new functions are suitable for more demanding color management requirements, and give applications greater control over the color-management process.</p>

<h4><a name="_win32_a_common_dialog_for_color_management"></a>A Common Dialog for Color Management</h4>
<p>
<span style=color:#FF0000>[This is preliminary documentation and subject to change.]</span> </p>
<p>
One new feature of ICM 2.0 is the common dialog box that is available to applications through the <a href="icm_2zc7.htm"><b>SetupColorMatching</b></a> function. This dialog box gives users control over color management options, using the following interface.</p>
<p>
The dialog box managed by <b>SetupColorMatching</b> should appear when <b>Color Management</b> is chosen on the <b>File</b> menu. The default dialog box looks like the following:</p>
<p>
<img src="images/appui-2.gif" border=0></p>
<p>
The default information that appears in this dialog box is provided by the application. If no information is provided by the application, then the dialog box uses the default monitor <a href="icmglsry_6ysj.htm#_win32_icm_2.0_glossary_color_space_gloss">color space</a> provided by the system. If no monitor color space is available, the <a href="icm_0c38.htm#_win32_srgb_a_proposed_standard_color_space">sRGB</a> color space is assumed.</p>
<p>
The <b>Enable Color Management </b>check box lets the user enable or disable color management on the system.</p>
<p>
The <b>Monitor Profile </b>list box lets the user select a color profile for the monitor from the list of available profiles associated with that monitor. The default profile is the system default profile for the current monitor.</p>
<p>
The <b>Rendering Intent </b>list box lets the user choose a <a href="icmglsry_8sky.htm#_win32_icm_2.0_glossary_rendering_intent_gloss">rendering intent</a>. Possible rendering intents are:</p>
<table cellspacing=4 cols=2>
<tr valign=top>
<th align=left width=32%>Intent</th>
<th align=left width=68%>Description</th>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=32%>Perceptual</td>
<td width=68%>For images and photographs; attempts to maintain the relationship between colors.</td>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=32%>Saturated</td>
<td width=68%>For charts and business graphics; attempts to maintain a color's saturation, rather than its hue or lightness.</td>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=32%>Relative Colorimetric</td>
<td width=68%>Does not preserve the white point; if the output gamut does not support a given color, the nearest supported color is used.</td>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=32%>Absolute Colorimetric</td>
<td width=68%>Preserves the white point; if the output gamut does not support a given color, the nearest supported color is used.</td>
</tr>
</table><br>
<p>
The default intent is "Perceptual." For more information, see <a href="icm_3ng3.htm">Rendering Intents</a>.</p>
<p>
The <b>Printer Profile </b>list box lets the user select a specific profile for the current printer. The default value that appears in this box should always be the default profile for the current printer's current configuration.</p>
<p>
The <b>Proofing </b>check box lets a user enable <a href="icmglsry_6ysz.htm#_win32_icm_2.0_glossary_soft_proofing_gloss">soft</a> or <a href="icmglsry_0mex.htm#_win32_icm_2.0_glossary_hard_proofing_gloss">hard proofing</a>.</p>
<p>
When proofing is enabled, the <b>Target Profile </b>list box defaults to the current printer profile. However, all profiles installed on the system are available in this list box.</p>
<p>
When proofing is enabled, the <b>Rendering Intent </b>list box under <b>Proofing</b> defaults to the intent set in the <b>Rendering Intent </b>list box. The upper <b>Rendering Intent </b>list box is set to the Absolute Colorimetric intent. The user may select a different proofing intent. It would be very unusual, however, for a user to select anything other than Absolute Colorimetric in the upper list box at this time. </p>
<p>
A callback function can be supplied to ICM that enables configuration information to be applied immediately to a device. For details see <a href="icm_36we.htm"><b>ApplyCallbackFunction</b></a>. If the callback function is provided to ICM, the Color Management dialog box will have one additional button, labeled <b>Apply</b>, shown in the following figure. Every time the user selects the <b>Apply</b> button, the callback function is invoked.</p>
