<p>
HLS <a href="icmglsry_6ysj.htm#_win32_icm_2.0_glossary_color_space_gloss">color spaces</a> are also widely used by artists. Its color components are hue, lightness, and saturation. </p>
<p>
Hue has the same meaning as the HSV model, except that a hue angle of 0° corresponds to blue in this model. Magenta is at 60°, red is at 120°. As with the HSV model, complementary colors are 180° apart. </p>
<p>
Lightness is the amount of black or white in a color. Increasing lightness adds white to the hue. Decreasing lightness adds black to the hue.</p>
<p>
<a href="icmglsry_6ysz.htm#_win32_icm_2.0_glossary_saturation_gloss">Saturation</a> in the HLS model is a measure of the "purity" of a hue. As saturation is decreased, the hue becomes more gray. A saturation value of zero results in a grayscale value.</p>
<p>
The following figure is a line drawing of HLS space, which is a double hexcone. Any horizontal cross section of the HLS color space is a hexagon. HLS is a normalized color space. That is, the lightness and saturation values range from 0.0 to 1.0 inclusive. Hue varies from 0° to 360° inclusive.</p>

HLS color spaces can be device dependent or device independent.</p>
