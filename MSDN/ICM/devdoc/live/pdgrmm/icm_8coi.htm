<p>
Color can be described in terms of components. The components most often used by imaging professionals are <i>hue, saturation</i>, and <i>brightness</i>. A hue is what we normally think of as a color. A color's hue fixes its place in the visible spectrum of light. The saturation of a color is how "pure" or "strong" a color is. Neutral gray is said to have zero saturation. The brightness of a color refers to the intensity of light that is reflected or transmitted by an image. </p>
<p>
The terms <i>tint, tone</i>, and <i>shade</i> are also well-used in color imaging literature. A tint of a color is obtained by mixing its hue with white. A tone of a color is created by mixing a hue with gray. A shade of a color is made by adding black to its hue.</p>
