<h1><a name="oledbinvalid_bookmarks"></a>Invalid Bookmarks</h1>
<p>
A bookmark can become invalid for any of the following reasons:
<ul type=disc>
<li>
The row it points to is deleted.<br><br></li>
<li>
It is based on a primary key and some of those key values were changed.<br><br></li>
<li>
The row it points to is no longer in the rowset. This occurs only in rowsets that support DBPROP_OWNUPDATEDELETE when a row is changed in such a way that it no longer meets the search criteria of the rowset, is released, and then is refetched by <b>IRowset::GetNextRows</b>. For example, if the rowset contains only those rows with a job title of Assistant Manager, changing the job title in a row to Manager would remove that row from the rowset. From the point of view of that rowset, the row was deleted.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Bookmarks that have been returned by the provider are guaranteed to have predictable behavior, even if they have become invalid. If the DBPROP_BOOKMARKSKIPPED property is VARIANT_TRUE, the provider skips the bookmarked row and proceeds to the next row. If the DBPROP_BOOKMARKSKIPPED property is not VARIANT_TRUE, the provider will usually return an error. Never must the provider terminate abnormally for a bookmark that it has returned to the user.</p>
<p>
Note, however, that passing a random bookmark value that has not been obtained from the provider is a programming error. The effect of specifying an unknown, random bookmark value is undefined and may include abnormal termination.</p>
