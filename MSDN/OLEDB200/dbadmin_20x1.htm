<h1><a name="oledbidbdatasourceadmin__createdatasource"></a>IDBDataSourceAdmin::CreateDataSource</h1>
<p>
Creates a new data source and data source object, and initializes the data source object to the data source.</p>
<pre><code>HRESULT CreateDataSource(
   ULONG         cPropertySets,
   DBPROPSET   rgPropertySets[],
   IUnknown*      pUnkOuter,
   REFIID            riid,
   IUnknown**      ppSession);
</code></pre>
<p class=label>
<b>Parameters</b></p>
<p class=dt>
<i>cPropertySets</i></p>
<p class=indent>
[in]<br>
The number of DBPROPSET structures in <i>rgPropertySets</i>. If this is zero, the provider ignores <i>rgPropertySets</i> and the method does not do anything.</p>
<p class=dt>
<i>rgPropertySets</i></p>
<p class=indent>
[in/out]<br>
An array of DBPROPSET structures containing properties and values to be set. The properties specified in these structures must belong to the Data Source Creation or Initialization property groups; Initialization properties must be supported by the provider for use in data source creation. If <i>ppSession</i> is not a null pointer, the properties can also belong to the Session property group. If the same property is specified more than once in <i>rgPropertySets</i>, then which value is used is provider-specific. If a provider cannot support a property, then the property is ignored. If <i>cPropertySets</i> is zero, this argument is ignored.</p>
<p class=tl>
For information about the properties in the Data Source Creation, Initialization, and Session property groups that are defined by OLE DB, see "<a href="appcpr_8u7n.htm#oledbdata_source_creation_properties">Data Source Creation Properties</a>," "<a href="appcpr_8u7n.htm#oledbinitialization_properties">Initialization Properties</a>," and "<a href="appcpr_8u7n.htm#oledbsession_properties">Session Properties</a>" in Appendix C. For information about the DBPROPSET and DBPROP structures, see "<a href="ch11pr_5pb9.htm">DBPROPSET Structure</a>" and "<a href="ch11pr_3xt1.htm">DBPROP Structure</a>" in Chapter 11.</P><p class=dt>
<i>pUnkOuter</i></p>
<p class=indent>
[in]<br>
A pointer to the controlling <b>IUnknown</b> interface if a session is desired and is to be created as part of an aggregate. Otherwise, it is a null pointer.</p>
<p class=dt>
<i>riid</i></p>
<p class=indent>
[in]<br>
The requested interface for the session returned in *<i>ppSession</i>. Ignored if <i>ppSession</i> is a null pointer.</p>
<p class=dt>
<i>ppSession</i></p>
<p class=indent>
[in/out]<br>
A pointer to memory in which to return the pointer to the session. If <i>ppSession</i> is a null pointer, no session is created.<br>
</p>
<p class=label>
<b>Return Code</b></p>
<p class=indent>
S_OK<br>
The method succeeded. In all DBPROP structures passed to the method, <i>dwStatus</i> is set to DBPROPSTATUS_OK.</p>
<p class=dt>
</p>
<p class=indent>
DB_S_ERRORSOCCURRED<br>
The new data source was created but one or more properties—for which the <i>dwOptions</i> element of the DBPROP structure was DBPROPOPTIONS_OPTIONAL—were not set. The consumer checks <i>dwStatus</i> in the DBPROP structures to determine which properties were not set. The method can fail to set properties for a number of reasons, including:
<ul type=disc>
<li>
The property was not in the Data Source Creation, Initialization, or Session property group.<br><br></li>
<li>
The property was in the Initialization property group but was not supported for use in data source creation.<br><br></li>
<li>
The property set was not supported by the provider.<br><br></li>
<li>
It was not possible to set the property.</li>
</ul>
<p class=dt>
</p>
<p class=indent>
E_FAIL<br>
A provider-specific error occurred.</p>
<p class=dt>
</p>
<p class=indent>
E_INVALIDARG<br>
<i>cPropertySets</i> was not zero and <i>rgPropertySets</i> was a null pointer.</p>
<p class=tl>
In an element of <i>rgPropertySets</i>, <i>cProperties</i> was not zero and <i>rgProperties</i> was a null pointer.</P><p class=dt>
</p>
<p class=indent>
E_NOINTERFACE<br>
The session did not support the interface specified in <i>riid</i>.</p>
<p class=dt>
</p>
<p class=indent>
E_OUTOFMEMORY<br>
The provider was unable to allocate sufficient memory to create the new data source.</p>
<p class=dt>
</p>
<p class=indent>
DB_E_ALREADYINITIALIZED<br>
<b>Initialize</b> had already been called for the data source object and an intervening call to <b>Uninitialize</b> had not been made.</p>
<p class=dt>
</p>
<p class=indent>
DB_E_DUPLICATEDATASOURCE<br>
A data source with the same name already exists.</p>
<p class=dt>
</p>
<p class=indent>
DB_E_ERRORSOCCURRED<br>
The data source was not created because one or more properties—for which the <i>dwOptions</i> element of the DBPROP structure was DBPROPOPTIONS_REQUIRED or an invalid value—were not set. The consumer checks <i>dwStatus</i> in the DBPROP structures to determine which properties were not set. None of the satisfiable properties are remembered. The method can fail to set properties for a number of reasons, including:
<ul type=disc>
<li>
The property was not in the Data Source Creation, Initialization, or Session property group.<br><br></li>
<li>
The property was in the Initialization property group but was not supported for use in data source creation.<br><br></li>
<li>
The property set was not supported by the provider.</li>
</ul>
<p class=dt>
</p>
<p class=indent>
DB_E_NOAGGREGATION<br>
<i>pUnkOuter</i> was not a null pointer and the data source being created does not support aggregation.</p>
<p class=indent>
<i>pUnkOuter</i> was non-null and <i>riid</i> was not IID_Unknown.</p>
<p class=dt>
</p>
<p class=indent>
DB_SEC_E_AUTH_FAILED<br>
The provider required initialization but an authentication failed. The data source was not created and the data source object remains in an uninitialized state.</p>
<p class=dt>
</p>
<p class=indent>
DB_SEC_E_PERMISSIONDENIED<br>
The consumer did not have permission to create a new data source.<br>
</p>
<p class=label>
<b>Comments</b></p>
<p>
<b>CreateDataSource</b> creates a data source and a data source object and initializes the data source object in one atomic operation.</p>
<p>
The properties DBPROP_INIT_DATASOURCE and DBPROP_INIT_LOCATION are always required by <b>CreateDataSource</b>. If DBPROP_INIT_LOCATION is set to VT_EMPTY, the data source is created in the default location.<br>
