<h1><a name="complexmemberrelationships"></a>Complex Member Relationships</h1>
<p>
Several providers allow member relationships that are not strict trees. They are <i>directed acyclic graphs</i> (DAGs). For such providers, a member can have multiple parents. The column PARENT_COUNT gives the number of parents in such a case. </p>
<p>
When member relationships form a DAG, each link between a member and its parent is represented as a separate row in the members rowset. Therefore, the MEMBER_UNIQUE_NAME value is not the primary key of the members rowset. Rather, it is the combination of MEMBER_UNIQUE_NAME and PARENT_UNIQUE_NAME that is the primary key.</p>
<p>
Among the multiple parents, there is one that is the “real” parent (that is, it represents the preferred rollup path). The others are “step” parents. Conversely, a parent has “real” children and “step” children. The tree operators for ancestors, descendants, parent, and children all follow the “real” links and not the “step” links.</p>
