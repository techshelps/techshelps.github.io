<h1><a name="imdfindfindtuple"></a>IMDFind::FindTuple</h1>
<p>
Returns a pointer to a tuple ordinal based on array of members, a starting ordinal, and an axis identifier.</p>
<pre><code>HRESULT FindTuple(
   ULONG            ulAxisIdentifier,
   ULONG            ulStartingOrdinal,
   ULONG            cMembers,
   LPCOLESTR*      rgpwszMember,
   ULONG*         pulTupleOrdinal);
</code></pre>
<p class=label>
<b>Parameters</b></p>
<p class=dt>
<i>ulAxisIdentifier</i>[in]</p>
<p class=indent>
The numeric identifier of an axis.</p>
<p class=dt>
<i>ulStartingOrdinal</i>[in]</p>
<p class=indent>
The ordinal of the starting tuple on the axis. <b>FindTuple</b> begins with this ordinal and continues in the direction of increasing axis ordinals.</p>
<p class=dt>
<i>cMembers</i>[in]</p>
<p class=indent>
The cardinality of the <i>rgpwszMember</i> array.</p>
<p class=dt>
<i>rgpwszMember</i>[in]</p>
<p class=indent>
An array of members. For more information, see comments.</p>
<p class=dt>
<i>pulTupleOrdinal</i>[out]</p>
<p class=indent>
A pointer to a tuple ordinal. The tuple ordinal is used to calculate the cell ordinal.</p>
<p class=label>
<b>Return Code</b></p>
<p class=indent>
S_OK<br>
The method succeeded.</p>
<p class=indent>
E_FAIL<br>
A provider-specific error occurred.</p>
<p class=indent>
E_INVALIDARG<br>
<i>pulTupleOrdinal</i> was a null pointer.</p>
<p class=tl>
<i>cMembers</i> was less than 1.</P><p class=indent>
MD_E_INVALIDAXIS<br>
<i>ulAxisIdentifier</i> did not identify a valid axis.</p>
<p class=indent>
MD_E_BADTUPLE<br>
The <i>ulStartingOrdinal</i> was greater than the number of tuples on the specified axis.</p>
<p class=tl>
The array of members did not match any tuple on the axis occurring after <i>ulStartingOrdinal</i> (inclusive)</P><p class=tl>
The array of members contained multiple members from the same dimension.</P><p class=tl>
One or more elements of the member array specified a member that does not exist.</P><p class=tl>
One or more elements of the member array contained an ambiguous member specification.</P><p class=label>
<b>Comments</b></p>
<p>
<i>ulAxisIdentifier</i> is the axis number. Axes are numbered starting from 0 (the column axis).</p>
<p>
<i>ulStartingOrdinal</i> is the ordinal number of the tuple from which to begin the search. This tuple is included in the search. In many cases, the axis specification is such that the same tuple can occur more than once on an axis. Because <b>FindTuple</b> finds one tuple per call, <i>ulStartingOrdinal</i> can be used iteratively to find multiple occurrences of the same tuple. Successive calls to this method increment the <i>*pulTupleOrdinal</i> returned by the previous call, and use this as the value of <i>ulStartingOrdinal</i> for the next call.</p>
<p>
<i>rgpwszMember</i> is an array of member names. Each name is null terminated. Member names must be qualified to the degree needed to avoid any ambiguity. Using the MEMBER_UNIQUE_NAME column of the MEMBERS rowset guarantees this. The members are in the order of dimension nesting: Members of the outermost dimension come first, followed by members of inner dimensions.</p>
<p>
<i>pulTupleOrdinal</i> is the ordinal number of the tuple on the axis, as returned in <i>*plTupleOrdinal</i>. Each tuple along an axis is numbered, starting from zero and increasing as you move to the right. This ordinal number can be used to calculate cell ordinals, using the formula described in <b>IMDDataset::GetCellData</b>.</p>
<p>
This method performs an exact match in that it compares for equality. Combined with the fact that members should be qualified enough to create an unambiguous reference, this means there is no possibility, by definition, of finding more than one cell.</p>
<p>
Note that a tuple ordinal for each tuple on an axis is available in the axis rowset.</p>
<p>
You can indicate that you want the default member for a given dimension on an axis by setting the corresponding array element to a null pointer. If <i>rgpwszMember</i> is a null pointer, then the default member is used for all dimensions on the axis. If a dimension does not have a default member, then this case results in MD_E_BADTUPLE.</p>
<p>
If an error occurs, then the contents of *<i>pulTupleOrdinal</i> are undefined.</p>
