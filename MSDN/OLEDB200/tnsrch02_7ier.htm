<h1><a name="axisslicerdimensions"></a>Axis and Slicer Dimensions</h1>
<p>
When formulating a query, an application typically looks at the cubes and divides the set of dimensions into two subsets as follows:
<ul type=disc>
<li>
<i>Axis dimensions</i> for which data is retrieved for multiple members.<br><br></li>
<li>
<i>Slicer dimensions</i> for which data is retrieved for a single member.</li>
</ul>
<p>
For example, suppose there are four dimensions: Geography, Products, Measures, and Quarters. There are two measures: Sales and Cost. The application wants to see Sales for USA for each product category and each quarter. The output looks like the following:</p>

<p>
In this example, the Quarters and Products dimensions are the axis dimensions. Measures and Geography are the slicer dimensions. From a geometrical standpoint, begin with a four-dimensional hypercube. Each dimension is an edge of this hypercube. Then, move along the Measures edge and select the point “Sales.” This selects a three-dimensional cube associated with this coordinate. In this cube, move along the Geography edge and select the point “USA.” This selects a two-dimensional slice in the cube. Then display the appropriate subslice of the two-dimensional slice.</p>
<p>
Essentially, slicer dimensions serve to extract a <i>p</i>-dimensional shadow of the <i>n</i>-dimensional cube (<i>p</i> &lt;= <i>n</i>). The axis dimensions slice this shadow cube along one or more axes and display the result in tabular form.</p>
