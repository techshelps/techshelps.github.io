<h1><a name="samememberinmultiplehierarchies"></a>Same Member in Multiple Hierarchies</h1>
<p>
The MEMBERS rowset has LEVEL_UNIQUE_NAME and LEVEL_NUMBER. These two columns indicate the member's position in the hierarchy. However, it is possible that the same member belongs to more than one hierarchy. OLE DB for OLAP requires that there be a row in the MEMBERS rowset for each occurrence of a member in a different hierarchy. So if a member M belongs to two different hierarchies X and Y, then the MEMBERS rowset has two rows, for which MEMBER_UNIQUE_NAME is “X.M” and “Y.M.” Note that the member name “M” has been qualified here in order to make it unique with the hierarchy name. In this case, the MEMBER_CAPTION for both these rows will be the same.</p>
