<h1><a name="facttable"></a>FACT Table</h1>
<p>
This table contains all the facts. Conceptually, this table is the result of applying a CUBE operator to the table that contains the atomic detail records. It has one column for each level in each dimension of the cube. The VALUE column has the actual data value. </p>
<p>
By definition, there are <i>n</i>+1 columns in this table, where <i>n</i> is the number of rows in the LEVELS table. The names of <i>n</i> columns are taken from the LEVEL_NAME column of the LEVELS table. The additional column is called VALUE. </p>
<p>
This table contains not only the “atomic” facts, but also the “aggregations.” For instance, there is a row for “Sales for 3rd day of September 1996,” which is an atomic fact. There are also rows for “Sales for September 1996,” “Sales for Quarter3, 1996,” “Sales for 1996” (all aggregations), and so on. </p>
