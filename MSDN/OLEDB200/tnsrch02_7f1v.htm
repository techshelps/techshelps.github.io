<h1><a name="implementationstrategiesforproviders"></a>Implementation Strategies for Providers</h1>
<p>
Providers have various options for implementing MDX. Which option to implement depends on what is already available from the data store.</p>
<h2>Providers with Tabular Storage</h2>
<p>
If the provider stores OLAP data as a set of tables (for example, a central fact table with associated dimension tables), then it is likely that SQL is the preferred data access language to extract data from the store. Such providers should implement a preprocessor that maps a statement in MDX to an equivalent SQL query. For more information on how this mapping can be done, see Chapter 6, “Mapping MDX to SQL Statements.”</p>
<p>
This approach is suited ideally for relational OLAP (ROLAP) servers. Rather than implementing support for a new language, they can leverage their existing SQL language implementation.</p>

<B><b>Note</b></B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Relational OLAP</i>, or ROLAP, is a term used to describe OLAP systems that are based on a relational DBMS. A ROLAP server is usually a full-fledged relational DBMS that stores OLAP data as a set of tables. This is in contrast to <i>multidimensional OLAP</i>, or MOLAP, which refers to OLAP systems that store data in inherently multidimensional structures.</p>
<h2>Providers with Nontabular Storage</h2>
<p>
Providers with nontabular storage are usually multidimensional OLAP (MOLAP) systems. MOLAP servers typically have storage structures that are inherently multidimensional. MDX statements provide a direct expression of the query capabilities of these servers. If a MOLAP server has a query language of its own, MDX can be mapped on top of this language. This is usually possible because MDX represents the fundamental query operations that any OLAP client requires.</p>
