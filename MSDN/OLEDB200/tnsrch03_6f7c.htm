<h1><a name="typesofexpressionsinmdx"></a>Types of Expressions in MDX</h1>
<p>
An MDX statement contains expressions that operate on sets, tuples, members, numbers and strings. These expressions form the basis of OLE DB for OLAP’s ability to provide a rich and powerful syntax for specifying datasets.</p>
<p>
Expressions in MDX operate on the following basic entities:
<ul type=disc>
<li>
Number.<b> </b>A number can be an exact numeric such as integer or decimal, or an approximate numeric such as a float or double. You can compose numbers by the usual operators of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division to yield other numbers. These compositions constitute numeric value expression elements.<br><br></li>
<li>
String: A string is a sequence of characters.<br><br></li>
<li>
Member. This represents a member of a dimension. A member value expression<i> </i>can operate upon a member<i> </i>element, which yields other member elements. For example, Boston.Parent yields the parent of the member Boston, which is Massachusetts.<br><br></li>
<li>
Tuple. A tuple is a collection of members from different dimensions. For example, (Boston, [1995]) is a tuple formed by members of two dimensions: Geography and Time. A single member is a degenerated case of a tuple and can be used as an expression without the parentheses.<br><br></li>
<li>
Set. A set is a collection of tuple elements. A set value expression<i> </i>operates on member, tuple, and set elements to yield other sets. A numeric function<i> </i>operates on a set element and yields a number. For example, the function SUM({USA, France}, Sales) operates on the set {USA, France} and yields the sum of Sales. A tuple value expression<i> </i>operates on a set element and yields tuple elements.</li>
</ul>
