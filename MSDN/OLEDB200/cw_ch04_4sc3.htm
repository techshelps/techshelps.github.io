<h1><a name="differencesbetweenicursorbasedoledbactivexcontrols"></a>Differences between ICursor-Based and OLE DB ActiveX Controls</h1>
<p>
The key to successful migration is understanding the difference between the two data access methods and how they apply to your controls. </p>
<p>
All <b>ICursor</b>-based ActiveX controls possess the following characteristics:
<ul type=disc>
<li>
The control has an <b>ICursor</b> type property that is used by a host to detect whether the control supports data binding.<br><br></li>
<li>
This property is available to users only at design time, so that a data source can be assigned to it. At run time this property cannot be set; when read, it returns nothing. <br><br></li>
<li>
The control writer does not supply code for this property. Rather, the writer must implement the <b>IBoundObject</b> interface to receive notifications of changes in the data source and take appropriate action.</li>
</ul>
<p>
OLE DB ActiveX controls possess these characteristics:
<ul type=disc>
<li>
The control implements two properties, one of type <b>DataSource</b> and the other of type <b>DataMember</b>. These properties are used by a host to detect whether the control supports data binding.<br><br></li>
<li>
Both properties are available to users at design time and run time.<br><br></li>
<li>
The control writer must implement these properties and take appropriate action when their values are changed.</li>
</ul>
