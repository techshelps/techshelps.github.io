<h1><a name="hypercubesmulticubes"></a>Hypercubes and Multicubes</h1>
<p>
Multidimensional databases can present their data to an application using two types of cubes: <i>hypercubes</i> and <i>multicubes</i>. In the hypercube model, all data appears logically as a single cube. All parts of the manifold represented by this hypercube have identical dimensionality. In the multicube model, data is segmented into a set of smaller cubes, each of which is composed of a subset of the available dimensions. </p>
<p>
Hypercubes and multicubes differ in terms of available metadata. In a hypercube, each dimension belongs to one cube only. A dimension is “owned” by the hypercube. In a multicube, a dimension can be part of multiple cubes. That is, dimensions are not “owned” by any one cube; rather, they are available to all cubes. In fact, there can be dimensions that do not belong to any cube. </p>
<p>
In the OLE DB for OLAP metadata model, it is possible to browse both hypercube and multicube schemas. The CUBES rowset lists all the available cubes, regardless of whether there is a single hypercube or many multicubes. The DIMENSIONS rowset has one row for each dimension/cube combination. If there are dimensions that are not part of any cube, then the CUBE_NAME field of the DIMENSIONS rowset is NULL. </p>
<h2>Multiple Hypercubes vs. True Multicubes</h2>
<p>
In a true multicube system, dimensions “exist” in the catalog or the schema. Different subcubes use a subset of these dimensions. By contrast, in a “multiple hypercube” system, the catalog or the schema has multiple cubes, each with its own set of dimensions.</p>
<p>
The important distinction between these two systems for OLE DB for OLAP schema rowsets is this: In the true multicube system, if there are two rows in the DIMENSIONS rowset for which the DIMENSION_NAME value is the same (and the CUBE_NAME value is different), then these two rows represent the <i>same</i> dimension. This is because the subcubes are built from the same pool of available dimensions. However, in a multiple hypercube scenario, it is possible for two hypercubes to have a dimension of the same name, each of which has different characteristics. In this case, the DIMENSION_UNIQUE_NAME value is guaranteed to be different. Consumers checking dimension names between cubes for doing natural joins must make sure to check DIMENSION_UNIQUE_NAME values, not DIMENSION_NAME values. </p>
