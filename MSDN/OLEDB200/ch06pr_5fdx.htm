<h1><a name="oledbvalue"></a>Value</h1>
<p>
The <i>value</i> is the actual value of the data. For example, the value of a column containing last names might be "Smith." Unless the type indicator of the data is DBTYPE_BSTR or is combined with DBTYPE_BYREF, DBTYPE_ARRAY, or DBTYPE_VECTOR, the data is stored directly at the offset specified in the binding. Sufficient space must be allocated for the data.</p>
<p>
For example, if the type indicator is DBTYPE_I2, a two-byte integer is stored at the specified offset and two bytes must be allocated at that offset. If the type indicator is DBTYPE_STR, an ANSI string is stored at the specified offset. If the length of the string in bytes is longer than the number of bytes specified at the offset in the <i>cbMaxLen</i> element of the DBBINDING structure, then the string is truncated.</p>
<p>
If the type indicator is DBTYPE_BSTR or is combined with DBTYPE_BYREF, DBTYPE_ARRAY, or DBTYPE_VECTOR, then a pointer to the data is stored at the offset specified in the binding and the data is stored in separately allocated memory. For example, if the type indicator is DBTYPE_BSTR, a pointer to a BSTR is stored at the specified offset and <b>sizeof(BSTR)</b> bytes must be allocated at that offset; the BSTR itself is stored in memory allocated with one of the Automation string allocation functions. If the type indicator is DBTYPE_STR | DBTYPE_BYREF, a pointer to an ANSI string is stored at the specified offset and <b>sizeof(char *)</b> bytes must be allocated at that offset; the string itself is stored in separately allocated memory. For more information, see "<a href="appapr_9nub.htm">Type Indicators</a>" in Appendix A.</p>
<p>
The only exception to these rules is when a reference accessor is used, in which case the value is a pointer to the provider's buffer for rowset data, or a pointer to the consumer's buffer for input parameter data. For more information, see "<a href="ch06pr_39mb.htm">Reference Accessors</a>" later in this chapter.</p>
