<h1><a name="oledbidbproperties__getproperties"></a>IDBProperties::GetProperties</h1>
<p>
Returns the values of properties in the Data Source, Data Source Information, and Initialization property groups that are currently set on the data source object or the values of properties in the Initialization property group that are currently set on the enumerator.</p>
<pre><code>HRESULT GetProperties (
   ULONG                  cPropertyIDSets,
   const DBPROPIDSET   rgPropertyIDSets[],
   ULONG *                  pcPropertySets,
   DBPROPSET **         prgPropertySets);
</code></pre>
<p class=label>
<b>Parameters</b></p>
<p class=dt>
<i>cPropertyIDSets</i></p>
<p class=indent>
[in]<br>
The number of DBPROPIDSET structures in <i>rgPropertyIDSets</i>.</p>
<p class=tl>
If <i>cPropertyIDSets</i> is zero, the provider ignores <i>rgPropertyIDSets</i>. If the data source object or enumerator has not been initialized, the provider returns the values of all properties in the Initialization property group for which values have been set or defaults exist. If the data source object or enumerator has been initialized, the provider returns the values of all properties in the Data Source, Data Source Information, and Initialization property groups, for data source objects, or the Initialization property group, for enumerators, for which values have been set or defaults exist. The provider does not return the values of properties in any of these property groups for which values have not been set and no defaults exist.</P><p class=tl>
If <i>cPropertyIDSets</i> is not zero, the provider returns the values of the requested properties. If a property is not supported, or if the data source object or enumerator is not initialized and the value of a property in a group other than the Initialization property group is requested, the returned value of <i>dwStatus</i> in the returned DBPROP structure for that property is DBPROPSTATUS_NOTSUPPORTED and the value of <i>dwOptions</i> is undefined.</P><p class=dt>
<i>rgPropertyIDSets</i></p>
<p class=indent>
[in]<br>
An array of <i>cPropertyIDSets</i> DBPROPIDSET structures. If the data source object or enumerator has not been initialized, the properties specified in these structures must belong to the Initialization property group. If the data source object or enumerator has been initialized, the properties specified in these structures must belong to the Data Source, Data Source Information, or Initialization property group, for data source objects, or the Initialization property group, for enumerators. The provider returns the values of the properties specified in these structures. If <i>cPropertyIDSets</i> is zero, then this argument is ignored.</p>
<p class=tl>
For information about the properties in the Data Source, Data Source Information, and Initialization property groups that are defined by OLE DB, see "<a href="appcpr_8u7n.htm#oledbdata_source_properties">Data Source Properties</a>," "<a href="appcpr_8u7n.htm#oledbdata_source_information_properties">Data Source Information Properties</a>," and "<a href="appcpr_8u7n.htm#oledbinitialization_properties">Initialization Properties</a>" in Appendix C. For information about the DBPROPIDSET structure, see "<a href="ch11pr_3gbp.htm">DBPROPIDSET Structure</a>" in Chapter 11.</P><p class=dt>
<i>pcPropertySets</i></p>
<p class=indent>
[out]<br>
A pointer to memory in which to return the number of DBPROPSET structures returned in *<i>prgPropertySets</i>. If <i>cPropertyIDSets</i> is zero, *<i>pcPropertySets</i> is the total number of property sets for which the provider supports at least one property in the Data Source, Data Source Information, or Initialization property group, for data source objects, or the Initialization property group, for enumerators. If <i>cPropertyIDSets</i> is greater than zero, *<i>pcPropertySets</i> is set to <i>cPropertyIDSets</i>. If an error other than DB_E_ERRORSOCCURRED occurs, *<i>pcPropertySets</i> is set to zero.</p>
<p class=dt>
<i>prgPropertySets</i></p>
<p class=indent>
[out]<br>
A pointer to memory in which to return an array of DBPROPSET structures. If <i>cPropertyIDSets</i> is zero, then one structure is returned for each property set that contains at least one property belonging to the Initialization property group (if the data source object or enumerator is not initialized), the Data Source, Data Source Information, or Initialization property group (if the data source object is initialized), or the Initialization property group (if the enumerator is initialized). If <i>cPropertyIDSets</i> is not zero, then one structure is returned for each property set specified in <i>rgPropertyIDSets</i>.</p>
<p class=tl>
In the case of properties in the Initialization property group and for a previously persisted data source object, those properties related to sensitive authentication information such as password will be returned in an encrypted form if DBPROP_AUTH_PERSIST_ENCRYPTED is VARIANT_TRUE.</P><p class=tl>
If <i>cPropertyIDSets</i> is not zero, the DBPROPSET structures in *<i>prgPropertySets</i> are returned in the same order as the DBPROPIDSET structures in <i>rgPropertyIDSets</i>; that is, for corresponding elements of each array, the <i>guidPropertySet</i> elements are the same. If <i>cPropertyIDs,</i> in an element of <i>rgPropertyIDSets,</i> is not zero, the DBPROP structures in the corresponding element of *<i>prgPropertySets</i> are returned in the same order as the DBPROPID values in <i>rgPropertyIDs</i>; that is, for corresponding elements of each array, the property IDs are the same.</P><p class=tl>
The provider allocates memory for the structures and returns the address to this memory; the consumer releases this memory with <b>IMalloc::Free</b> when it no longer needs the structures. Before calling <b>IMalloc::Free</b> for *<i>prgPropertySets</i>, the consumer should call <b>IMalloc::Free</b> for the <i>rgProperties</i> element within each element of *<i>prgPropertySets</i>. If *<i>pcPropertySets</i> is zero on output or an error other than DB_E_ERRORSOCCURRED occurs, the provider does not allocate any memory and ensures that *<i>prgPropertySets</i> is a null pointer on output.</P><p class=tl>
For information about the DBPROPSET and DBPROP structures, see "<a href="ch11pr_5pb9.htm">DBPROPSET Structure</a>" and "<a href="ch11pr_3xt1.htm">DBPROP Structure</a>" in Chapter 11.</P><p class=tl>
</P><p class=label>
<b>Return Code</b></p>
<p class=indent>
S_OK<br>
The method succeeded. In all DBPROP structures returned by the method, <i>dwStatus</i> is set to DBPROPSTATUS_OK.</p>
<p class=dt>
</p>
<p class=indent>
DB_S_ERRORSOCCURRED<br>
No value was returned for one or more properties. The consumer checks <i>dwStatus</i> in the DBPROP structure to determine the properties for which values were not returned. <b>GetProperties</b> can fail to return properties for a number of reasons, including:
<ul type=disc>
<li>
The property was not supported by the provider.<br><br></li>
<li>
The data source object or enumerator was not initialized and the property was not in the Initialization property group.<br><br></li>
<li>
The method was called on the data source object, the data source object was initialized, and the property was not in the Data Source, Data Source Information, or Initialization property groups.<br><br></li>
<li>
The method was called on the enumerator, the enumerator was initialized, and the property was not in the Initialization property group.<br><br></li>
<li>
The property set was not supported by the provider. If <i>cPropertyIDs</i> in the DBPROPIDSET structure for the property set was zero, the provider cannot set <i>dwStatus</i> in the DBPROP structure because it does not know the IDs of any properties in the property set. Instead, it sets <i>cProperties</i> to zero in the DBPROPSET structure returned for the property set.</li>
</ul>
<p class=dt>
</p>
<p class=indent>
E_FAIL<br>
A provider-specific error occurred.</p>
<p class=dt>
</p>
<p class=indent>
E_INVALIDARG<br>
<i>cPropertyIDSets</i> was not equal to zero and <i>rgPropertyIDSets</i> was a null pointer.</p>
<p class=tl>
<i>pcPropertySets</i> or <i>prgPropertySets</i> was a null pointer.</P><p class=tl>
In an element of <i>rgPropertyIDSets</i>, <i>cPropertyIDs</i> was not zero and <i>rgPropertyIDs</i> was a null pointer.</P><p class=tl>
In an element of <i>rgPropertyIDSets</i>, <i>guidPropertySet</i> was DBPROPSET_PROPERTIESINERROR and <i>cPropertyIDs</i> was not zero or <i>rgPropertyIDs</i> was not a null pointer.</P><p class=tl>
<i>cPropertyIDSets</i> was greater than 1 and, in an element of <i>rgPropertyIDSets</i>, <i>guidPropertySet</i> was DBPROPSET_PROPERTIESINERROR.</P><p class=dt>
</p>
<p class=indent>
E_OUTOFMEMORY<br>
The provider was unable to allocate sufficient memory in which to return the DBPROPSET or DBPROP structures.</p>
<p class=dt>
</p>
<p class=indent>
DB_E_ERRORSOCCURRED<br>
Values were not returned for any properties. The provider allocates memory for *<i>prgPropertySets</i> and the consumer checks <i>dwStatus</i> in the DBPROP structures to determine why properties were not returned. The consumer frees this memory when it no longer needs the information.<br>
</p>
<p class=label>
<b>Comments</b></p>
<p>
If <b>IDBInitialize::Initialize</b> returns DB_E_ERRORSOCCURRED, the consumer can immediately call <b>GetProperties</b> with the DBPROPSET_PROPERTIESINERROR property set to return all the properties that were in error. For more information, see "<a href="ch11pr_0s4z.htm">Property Sets</a>" in Chapter 11.<br>
