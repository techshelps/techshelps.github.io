<h1><a name="idatasourcelistener"></a>IDataSourceListener</h1>
<p>
A data source is required to return the same <b>IUnknown</b> pointer each time a consumer asks for a particular data member. Once the notification <b>IDataSourceListener::OnDataMemberChanged</b> has been fired, it is valid for the data source to return a different <b>IUnknown </b>(or the same one). Comparison of two data member strings should be done in a case-insensitive manner.</p>
<p>
Data sources generally put off getting the data for a particular data member until it is requested. It is possible to obtain a data member asynchronously by returning Null when data is requested, but then later use <b>IDataSourceListener</b> to indicate that the data member has changed. When the consumer asks for the data in response to the notification, it will be available.</p>
<p>
Because the data source can choose to provide an enumeration of its data members, and the list of members might change, <b>IDataSourceListener</b> also has the ability to notify interested parties (such as a property browser) that the set has changed, but it is not a requirement that the list be kept up-to-date.</p>
