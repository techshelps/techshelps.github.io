<h1><a name="datasets"></a>Datasets</h1>
<p>
The dataset encapsulates a multidimensional result set and is the result of executing an MDX statement. From the discussion in the section “Axes and Slicer Dimensions” in this chapter, it is clear that a dataset consists of a set of axes. The points along an axis are called <i>coordinates</i>. For an axis that consists of a single dimension, these coordinates are a subset of the members of that dimension. If an axis consists of more than one dimension, then each coordinate is a compound entity that has <i>n</i> parts, where <i>n</i> is the number of dimensions oriented along that axis. Each part of the coordinate is a member from one constituent dimension. </p>
<p>
For example, if the “Geography” and “Product” dimensions are oriented along the x-axis of a dataset, a coordinate along this axis may be (USA, Computers). In this example, the “USA” member of the Geography dimension has been combined with the “Computers” member of the Products dimension to result in the compound entity, the tuple. Note that determining a coordinate along the x-axis in this example requires members from each dimension oriented along it.</p>
<p>
At the intersection of axes coordinates are <i>cells</i>. Each cell has multiple pieces of information associated with it. The data itself is one such piece of information. Other pieces of information are: 
<ul type=disc>
<li>
A formatted string, which is the form of cell data that can be displayed<br><br></li>
<li>
The cell ordinal number<br><br></li>
<li>
Display information such as fore color or back color </li>
</ul>
<p>
These are collectively called <i>cell properties</i>.</p>
