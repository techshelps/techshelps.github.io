<h1><a name="propertiesrowset"></a>PROPERTIES Rowset</h1>
<p>
The PROPERTIES rowset contains information about the available properties for each level of the dimension. The assumption here is that each level defines a class of members. The properties of all members in this class are the same. For a data source that does not support named levels, there is a dummy level that includes all the members in the dimension. The name of this level is the same as the name of the dimension.</p>
<p>
The PROPERTIES rowset also contains all available properties for cells in a dataset. Because every provider is going to have at least three properties (the VALUE, FORMATTED_VALUE, and CELL_ORDINAL properties of a cell), the PROPERTIES rowset always has at least three rows. Consumers can distinguish between member properties and cell properties by looking at the PROPERTY_TYPE column. Note that a property can be both a member property and a cell property. Consumers can retrieve only the member property, only the cell property, or both, by restricting the PROPERTY_TYPE field of this rowset.</p>
