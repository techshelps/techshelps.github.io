<H1>Office Compatible 97 Pop-up Menus</H1>As a general rule, Office Compatible 97 products must support pop-up menus. Some exceptions exist, however, so read <I>Office Compatible 97 Testing Requirements</I> to determine whether this requirement applies to your product.  If it does, then read the following sections to determine how your product's pop-up menus will be tested</P>
Pop-up menus have become a popular feature among Office users, who appreciate the immediate access they provide to relevant commands.  Therefore, all File-Based and Non-File-Based Standalone applications must support pop-up menus in at least three different contexts.  In addition, these menus must conform to the guidelines described in The Windows Interface Guidelines for Software Design, which is available from Microsoft Press. Office Compatible 97 will not standardize the specific contexts in which pop-up menus must be supported, nor will it mandate the menus' contents, since designers must be given considerable leeway to choose the best use for pop-up menus in their products.  However, designers are very strongly encouraged to follow Office's example whenever possible.  For example, designers are encouraged to support a toolbar-specific pop-up menu like Office's whenever their product's toolbar is right-clicked.  In other contexts, designers are encouraged to support Cut, Copy, and Paste commands via pop-up menus whenever that makes sense.</P></FONT></BODY>
