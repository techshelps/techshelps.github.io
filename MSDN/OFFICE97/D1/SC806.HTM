<H1>Office Compatible 97 Standard Toolbar</H1>As a general rule, Office Compatible 97 products must support a standard toolbar which is substantially similar to Office. Some exceptions exist, however, so read <I>Office Compatible 97 Testing Requirements</I> to determine whether this requirement applies to your product.  If it does, then read the following sections to determine how your product's standard toolbar will be tested</P>
Office 97 will refine the appearance and functionality of its Toolbars (as compared to Office 95), and although Microsoft intends to share this design with other developers someday, it is not practical to do so now.  Therefore, Office Compatible 97 products should use a standard Toolbar which is substantially similar to the one used in Office 95.  As illustrated below, this design is divided into three regions.  Standard regions 1 and 2 contain buttons whose appearance and location are standardized in all Office applications. The "Application Region", on the other hand, contains buttons that vary from one product to another. </P>
