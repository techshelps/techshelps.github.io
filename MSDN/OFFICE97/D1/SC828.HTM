<b>Add-Ins. </b>An add-in is a product
which uses macros or other technology to enhance the native
functionality of its Office host. In most cases, add-in products
add one or more buttons to the toolbar, or they add new entries
to the Office menu. These toolbar buttons and menu entries are
used to access the add-in's features. </font></p>

<b>Hosted OLE Servers. </b>Compared to an
add-in, a hosted OLE server is a more sophisticated type of
product, which uses OLE technology to extend its Office host's
functionality via inplace editing or OLE automation. Like
add-ins, OLE servers usually alter Office's toolbars or menus. </font></p>

Hosted OLE servers must be clearly
distinguished from standalone OLE servers. A hosted server is one
which can only be used within its Office host. By contrast, a
standalone server is either a file- or non-file-based standalone
application which can operate as an OLE server. This distinction
is important, because an OLE server which can operate as a
standalone application will not be tested according to the hosted
OLE server guidelines. Instead, it must comply with the
requirements for other standalone products. </font></p>

<b>Content Products. </b>A content
product is one which contains information (but generally not
executable instructions) that either controls the operation of
its Office host or that can be displayed by Office for the user's
benefit. Content products include templates, graphic objects,
data files, and similar items. Office-related training tools also
qualify as content products, as do World Wide Web sites and other
Internet sites that distribute data in a format that can be
displayed within Office. Note that some content products, such as
sophisticated templates, contain such advanced user interface
elements (e.g., buttons, dialog boxes) that the distinction
between them and an add-in vanishes. In such cases, the product
must pass the testing requirements that apply to add-in products.
But for most content products, simpler testing requirements
apply.</font></p>
