<H1>Office Compatible 97 Basic Dialog Boxes</H1>As a general rule, Office Compatible 97 products must support basic dialog boxes that correspond to the Open, Save As, and Print dialogs in Microsoft Office. Some exceptions exist, however, so read <I>Office Compatible 97 Testing Requirements</I> to determine whether this requirement applies to your product.  If it does, then read the following section to determine how your product's dialog boxes will be tested.</P>
Office users have come to appreciate the consistency shared by the Office applications' Open, Save As, and Print dialog boxes.  As a result, all File-Based Standalone applications must support comparable dialog boxes.  These dialog boxes may be derived from the Windows 95 common dialog boxes, or they may be created by any other means.  However, they must be substantially similar to either the Office or the Windows standard, and they must comply with all of the guidelines described in The Windows Interface Guidelines for Software Design, which is available from Microsoft Press.</P></FONT></BODY>
