<H2>Format of the Main Stream in a Complex File</H2>The main stream of a Word binary file (complex format) consists of the Word file header (FIB), the text, and the formatting information.</P>
<B>FIB</B></P>
Text of body, footnotes, headers stored during last full save</P>
Text begins at the position recorded in fib.fcMin.</P>
<B>FKPs for CHPs, PAPs and LVCs</B></P>
The first FKP begins at a 512-byte boundary after the last byte text written.. The remaining FKPs are recorded in the 512-byte pages that immediately follow.  The FKPs for CHPs PAPs and LVCs are interleaved.  Previous versions of Word wrote them in contiguous chunks.  The hplcfbte's of the three flavors (CHP, PAP and LVC) are used to find the relevant FKP of the appropriate type.</P>
