<H2>Format of the Table Stream</H2>Word stores various plcfs and tables with the stream named either "0Table" or "1Table".  Ordinarily a file will contain only one table stream.  However, in some unusual circumstances (e.g. crash during file save) a file might have two table streams.  In that case the bit field fWhichTblStm in the FIB should be used to determine which table stream to read.  If fWhichTblStm is 0, then the FIB refers to the stream named "0Table", and if fWhichTblStm is 1, then the FIB refers to the stream name "1Table".</P>
