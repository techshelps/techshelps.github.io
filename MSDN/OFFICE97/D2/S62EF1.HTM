<H2>Format of the Main Stream in a Word Non-Complex File</H2>The main stream of a Word docfile (non-complex format) consists of the Word file header (FIB), the text, and the formatting information.</P>
<B>FIB</B></P>
Stored at beginning of page 0 of the file. fib.fComplex will be set to zero.</P>
<B>text of body, footnotes, headers</B></P>
Text begins at the position recorded in fib.fcMin.</P>
<B>FKPs for CHPs, PAPs and LVCs</B></P>
The first FKP begins at a 512-byte boundary after the last byte text written.. The remaining FKPs are recorded in the 512-byte pages that immediately follow.  The FKPs for CHPs PAPs and LVCs are interleaved.  Previous versions of Word wrote them in contiguous chunks.  The hplcfbte's of the three flavors (CHP, PAP and LVC) are used to find the relevant FKP of the appropriate type.</P>
<B>group of SEPXs</B></P>
SEPXs immediately follow the FKPs and are concatenated one after the other.  SEPXs are no longer guaranteed to start on a page boundary if it would span a boundary if placed immediately after the preceding SEPX.</P></FONT></BODY>
