<b>CHAPTER 13</b></p>
<h1><a name="optimizingyourapplication"></a>Optimizing Your Application</h1>
<p>
When your application performs at its best, your users get more work done with less frustration. As you create larger and more sophisticated applications, the amount of memory your applications use and the speed with which they run become more significant. You may decide you need to optimize your application by making it smaller and by speeding up calculations and displays. This chapter presents optimization techniques you can use to make your application smaller and faster.</p>
