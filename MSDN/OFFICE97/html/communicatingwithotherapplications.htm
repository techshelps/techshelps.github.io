<p>
Microsoft Access makes it easy to communicate with many other Windows components. Microsoft Access supports Automation, formerly called OLE Automation, which is a simple and powerful technology that you can use to work with objects provided by other components. Microsoft Access also supports OLE. With OLE you can link documents created in other components to, or embed them in, your forms and reports. This chapter shows you how to use these technologies to integrate objects and information from other components into your Microsoft Access application.</p>
