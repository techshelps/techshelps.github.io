<h2><a name="overviewofadd-ins"></a>Overview of Add-ins</h2>
<p>
<i>Add-ins</i> are tools written within the Microsoft Access environment that extend the functionality of the basic product. These tools make difficult tasks easier, automate repetitive operations, and add new features. Add-ins can increase productivity by focusing on a single task or function. You can design them to use yourself, to use within your organization, to distribute along with your application, or to sell separately.</p>
<p>
Before developing an add-in, you need to be familiar with creating forms, writing the code behind forms, and writing and debugging Visual Basic code.</p>
<p>
<b>Note</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Microsoft Access versions 1.<i>x</i> and 2.0, you can call code in add-ins and libraries from the current database. To call code in an add-in from the current database in Microsoft Access 95 and Microsoft Access 97, you must first establish a reference to the add-in database by using the <b>References</b> dialog box (available through the <b>Tools</b> menu in the Module window). Alternatively, you can call code in an add-in or library database by using the <b>Run</b> method of the <b>Application</b> object. For more information on establishing references and using library databases, see Chapter 12, <a href="usinglibrarydatabasesdynamic-linklibraries.htm">“Using Library Databases and Dynamic-Link Libraries.”</a> For more information on the <b>Run</b> method, search the Help index for “Run method.”</p>
