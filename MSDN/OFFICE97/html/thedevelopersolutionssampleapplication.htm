<h3>A Sample of What You’ll Find in Developer Solutions</h3>
<p>
The sample forms and reports in Developer Solutions cover the main areas of application design, from changing a form’s toolbars in response to events, to creating a crosstab report with dynamic column headings.</p>
<h4>Sample Forms</h4>
<p>
Forms are the major component of a Microsoft Access application. You use them not only to enter and view data, but also as a way to organize your application into a coherent system. In Developer Solutions, there are examples of forms that:
<ul>
<li>
Switch between entering and editing records.</li>
<li>
Fill a record with data from the previous record.</li>
<li>
Search for records based on values you enter in one or more fields.</li>
<li>
Progressively display more detail about a given subject.</li>
<li>
Synchronize data between two forms.</li>
<li>
Collect and store temporary information.</li>
<li>
Select more than one item in a list box.</li>
</ul>
<p>
In many cases, several techniques are combined on one form, as shown in the EnterOrEditProducts form.</p>
<p>
<img src="aba_appa_4.gif" border=0></p>
<p>
To display this form, in the DeveloperSolutions form, click Sample Forms in the Select A Category Of Examples box, and then click EnterOrEditProducts in the Select An Example box.</p>
<h4>Sample Reports</h4>
<p>
With most applications, you’ll want a way to format and print data for distribution. The reports in Developer Solutions show you how to:
<ul>
<li>
Create a report for a preprinted form.</li>
<li>
Create a form letter.</li>
<li>
Create crosstab reports.</li>
<li>
Draw a circle around important information.</li>
</ul>
<p>
For example, the SalesLetter report uses Visual Basic code to draw a circle around the sales totals that meet or exceed the goal. To preview this report, in the DeveloperSolutions form, click Sample Reports in the Select A Category Of Examples box, and then click SalesLetter in the Select An Example box.</p>
<h4>Sample Code</h4>
<p>
Developer Solutions also includes procedures that you may find useful when developing your own applications. Procedures included in Developer Solutions show you how to:
<ul>
<li>
Link tables at startup.</li>
<li>
Close all objects when the user exits the application.</li>
<li>
Capitalize the first letter of every word in a field.</li>
</ul>
