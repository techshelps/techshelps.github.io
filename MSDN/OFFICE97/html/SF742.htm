<H1>References</H1><P CLASS="t">If you have created references between workbooks in your project, you must do one of three things to ensure that the references are maintained correctly. Either the relative paths between the <I>referencing</I> and the <I>referenced</I> workbooks must be&nbsp;maintained (you must open the referenced workbook(s) prior to opening the referencing workbook(s)), or you must have the AddIn in the AddInPath. The AddinPath is a registry key value that indicates the search path for Addins.</P>

<pre><code><FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE="2">HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\8.0\Excel\_
    Microsoft Excel\AddIn Path.
</FONT></code></pre>
<P CLASS="t">The value for this entry is of type string, with a format like:</P>

<pre><code><FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE="2">c:\msoffice\excel\library; c:\msoffice\excel\library\solver
</FONT></code></pre>
<P CLASS="t">The ';' character delimits each directory in the path.</P>
<P></P>
<P></P>
<P></P>
<P CLASS="t">By default, Office&nbsp;97 setup sets the AddIn path to include the Library subdirectory of the Office subdirectory that contains Excel.exe. So you may want&nbsp;to recommend that users copy your add-in into that directory (Application.LibraryPath).</P>
<P CLASS="t">When the workbooks are closed, you must close them in the opposite order. Microsoft Excel does not allow a referenced workbook to be closed while the referencing workbook is still open. The referencing workbook must be closed first, followed by the workbooks that are referenced. This applies to both add-ins&nbsp;and normal workbooks.</P></FONT>
