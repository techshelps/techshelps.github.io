<H1>TREND</H1><P CLASS="t">Returns values along a linear trend. Fits a straight line (using the method of least squares) to the arrays known_y's and known_x's. Returns the y-values along that line for the array of new_x's that you specify.</P>

<P CLASS="dt1"><FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica" SIZE="2"><B>Known_y's</B></FONT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is the set of y-values you already know in the relationship y = mx + b.</P>
<UL><LI>If the array known_y's is in a single column, then each column of known_x's is interpreted as a separate variable.</LI><LI>If the array known_y's is in a single row, then each row of known_x's is interpreted as a separate variable.</LI></UL><P CLASS="dt1">Known_x's&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is an optional set of x-values that you may already know in the relationship y = mx + b.</P>
<UL><LI>The array known_x's can include one or more sets of variables. If only one variable is used, known_y's and known_x's can be ranges of any shape, as long as they have equal dimensions. If more than one variable is used, known_y's must be a vector (that is, a range with a height of one row or a width of one column).</LI><LI>If known_x's is omitted, it is assumed to be the array {1,2,3,&nbsp;...} that is the same size as known_y's.</LI></UL><P CLASS="dt1">New_x's&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;are new x-values for which you want TREND to return corresponding y-values.</P>
<UL><LI>New_x's must include a column (or row) for each independent variable, just as known_x's does. So, if known_y's is in a single column, known_x's and new_x's must have the same number of columns. If known_y's is in a single row, known_x's and new_x's must have the same number of rows.</LI><LI>If you omit new_x's, it is assumed to be the same as known_x's.</LI><LI>If you omit both known_x's and new_x's, they are assumed to be the array {1,2,3,&nbsp;...} that is the same size as known_y's.</LI></UL><P CLASS="dt1">Const&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is a logical value specifying whether to force the constant b to equal 0.</P>
<UL><LI>If const is TRUE or omitted, b is calculated normally.</LI><LI>If const is FALSE, b is set equal to 0 (zero), and the m-values are adjusted so that y = mx.
</LI></UL><P><B>Remarks</B></P>
<UL><LI>For information about how Microsoft Excel fits a line to data, see LINEST.</LI><LI>You can use TREND for polynomial curve fitting by regressing against the same variable raised to different powers. For example, suppose column A contains y-values and column B contains x-values. You can enter x^2 in column C, x^3 in column D, and so on, and then regress columns B through D against column A.</LI><LI>Formulas that return arrays must be entered as array formulas.</LI><LI>When entering an array constant for an argument such as known_x's, use commas to separate values in the same row and semicolons to separate rows.

<P CLASS="t">Suppose a business wants to purchase a tract of land in July, the start of the next fiscal year. The business collects cost information that covers the most recent 12 months for a typical tract in the desired area. Known_y values are in cells B2:B13; the known_y values are $133,890, $135,000, $135,790, $137,300, $138,130, $139,100, $139,900, $141,120, $141,890, $143,230, $144,000, $145,290.</P>
<P CLASS="t">When entered as a vertical array in the range C2:C6, the following formula returns the predicted prices for March, April, May, June, and July:</P>
<P CLASS="t"><FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica" SIZE="2"><CODE>TREND(B2:B13,,{13;14;15;16;17})</CODE></FONT> equals {146172;147190;148208;149226;150244}</P>
<P CLASS="t">The company can expect a typical tract of land to cost about $150,244 if it waits until July. The preceding formula uses the default array {1;2;3;4;5;6;7;8;9;10;11;12} for the known_x's argument, corresponding to the 12 months of sales data. The array {13;14;15;16;17} corresponds to the next five months.</P></FONT>
