<H1 CLASS="cht">Writing Great Add-Ins</H1><P CLASS="t">Microsoft Excel allows you to fully customize, enhance, personalize, and extend&nbsp;almost every aspect of the application. Programming in the Visual Basic&nbsp;for Applications (VBA) macro language is usually the starting point for&nbsp;customization. But as this book will make clear, you can also extend Microsoft&nbsp;Excel by means of C code or other languages that support either OLE&nbsp;Automation or Windows Dynamic Link Libraries (DLLs). This chapter focuses on the VBA portions of your code, and provides the information needed&nbsp;to write high-quality add-ins.</P>
<P CLASS="t">When your development work is finished, you can create an add-in from your program, making it a seamless part of the Microsoft Excel interface. You can add&nbsp;custom functions, automate complex processes, and/or create complete programs that function entirely inside Microsoft Excel. If you desire, you can virtually take over the Microsoft Excel user interface with custom toolbars, menus, and on-sheet controls.</P>
<P CLASS="t">In reality, an add-in is a type of macro, similar to the concept of a square also being a rectangle. This chapter focuses on authoring great add-ins, but nearly all&nbsp;of the concepts presented here apply to any VBA application. The chapter also&nbsp;details the changes that have occurred since the previous version of Microsoft&nbsp;Excel.</P></FONT>
