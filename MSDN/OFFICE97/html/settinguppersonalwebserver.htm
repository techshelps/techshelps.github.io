<h2><a name="settinguppersonalwebserver"></a>Setting Up a Personal Web Server </h2>
<p>
Microsoft provides two products that make it easy to create a personal Web server on your computer for low-volume Web publishing: Microsoft Personal Web Server and Microsoft Peer Web Services. These products are ideal for publishing departmental home pages, personal home pages, or small-scale Web applications on your company’s intranet. </p>
<p>
Although Personal Web Server and Peer Web Services are intended for small-scale Web publishing, they provide most of the same services and features as Microsoft Internet Information Server, a robust Web server intended for high-volume Web publishing. You can use Personal Web Server or Peer Web Services to develop and test your Web applications, and then transfer them to a Web server running Microsoft Internet Information Server. </p>
<p>
Both Personal Web Server and Peer Web Services can:
<ul>
<li>
Publish Web pages on the Internet or over a LAN on an intranet by using the HTTP service.</li>
<li>
Support Microsoft ActiveX controls.</li>
<li>
Transmit or receive files by using the FTP service. </li>
<li>
Run Internet Server API (ISAPI) and Common Gateway Interface (CGI) scripts.</li>
<li>
Send queries to ODBC data sources by using the Internet Database Connector component (Httpodbc.dll).</li>
<li>
Support the Secure Sockets Layer.</li>
</ul>
<p>
In addition, Peer Web Services can:
<ul>
<li>
Use pass-through security to Windows NT Server and Novell NetWare.</li>
<li>
Use local-user security if Microsoft File and Print Sharing are not installed.</li>
<li>
Perform remote administration by using a Web-based application.</li>
<li>
Distribute documents by using the Gopher service.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Installation Requirements</h3>
<p>
To run Personal Web Server or Peer Web Services, you must meet the following installation requirements.</p>
<h4>Personal Web Server</h4>
<ul>
<li>
A computer with Windows&nbsp;95 installed.</li>
<li>
A CD-ROM drive for the installation compact disc. </li>
<li>
Adequate disk space for your information content.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Peer Web Services</h4>
<ul>
<li>
A computer with Windows&nbsp;NT Workstation version 4.0 installed.</li>
<li>
A CD-ROM drive for the installation compact disc.</li>
<li>
Adequate disk space for your information content. It is recommended that all drives used with Peer Web Services be formatted with the Windows&nbsp;NT File System (NTFS).</li>
</ul>
<h3>Publication Requirements</h3>
<p>
When using Personal Web Server or Peer Web Services, each computer you want to access the server must have Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) installed. The TCP/IP protocol is included with Windows&nbsp;95 and Windows&nbsp;NT Workstation version 4.0. To install and configure the TCP/IP protocol and related components, double-click the <b>Network</b> icon in Control Panel. Each system must meet additional requirements depending on whether you want to use the server on an intranet or the Internet.</p>
<h4>Intranet Publication Requirements</h4>
<ul>
<li>
A network adapter card and local area network (LAN) connection. </li>
<li>
The Windows Internet Name Service (WINS) server or the Domain Name System (DNS) server installed on a computer in your intranet. WINS and DNS run only on Windows&nbsp;NT Server. This step is optional, but it does allow users to use “friendly names” instead of IP addresses when connecting to your server.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Internet Publication Requirements</h4>
<ul>
<li>
An Internet connection and Internet Protocol (IP) address from your Internet Service Provider (ISP).</li>
<li>
DNS registration for that IP address. This step is optional, but it does allow users to use “friendly names” instead of IP addresses when connecting to your server. For example, “microsoft.com” is the friendly domain name registered to Microsoft. Within the microsoft.com domain, Microsoft has named its World Wide Web (WWW) server “www.microsoft.com.” Most ISPs can register your domain names for you.</li>
<li>
A network adapter card suitable for your connection to the Internet.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Installing Personal Web Server</h3>
<p>
The Setup file for the Personal Web Server is available on the Web. To download the Setup program for Personal Web Server for Windows 95, connect to the Microsoft Personal Web Server home page at:</p>
<p>
http://www.microsoft.com/ie/iesk/pws.htm </p>
<p>
You can install Personal Web Server if you are running Windows&nbsp;95 or Windows&nbsp;NT Workstation version 4.0. However, if you are using Windows&nbsp;NT, it is recommended that you install Peer Web Services instead.</p>
<p>
<b><font face="Symbol"><span style="font-family:symbol">&#219;</span></font>&#09;To install Personal Web Server</b>
<ol>
<li>
Connect to the Personal Web Server home page on the Web and download PWS10a.exe.</li>
<li>
Double-click <b>PWS10a.exe</b>.<p>
This starts the installation process. You may be required to supply additional files from your Windows&nbsp;95 Setup disks.</p>
</li>
<li>
When installation is finished, the Setup program asks if you want to restart your computer. Click <b>Yes</b>.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Installing Peer Web Services</h3>
<p>
The files to install Peer Web Services are provided on the Microsoft Windows&nbsp;NT Workstation version 4.0 Setup CD-ROM.</p>
<p>
<b><font face="Symbol"><span style="font-family:symbol">&#219;</span></font>&#09;To install Peer Web Services</b>

This starts the installation process. You may be required to supply additional files from your Windows&nbsp;NT Setup disks.</p>
</li>
<li>
In the first <b>Microsoft Peer Web Services Setup</b> dialog box, click <b>OK</b>.</li>
<li>
In the second <b>Microsoft Peer Web Services Setup</b> dialog box, select which services you want to install, and then click <b>OK</b>.</li>

If you want to use Active Server Pages with either Personal Web Server or Peer Web Services, you must install the Active Server Pages components after installing your server software. These components are not distributed with the Setup programs for Personal Web Server or Peer Web Services. To download the Setup program for these components, connect to http://www.microsoft.com/msdownload/iis_asp.htm. </p>
<p>
<b>Note</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To install the Active Server Pages components for Personal Web Server running on Windows 95, download the Active Server Pages for Windows NT (i386) Setup files.</p>
