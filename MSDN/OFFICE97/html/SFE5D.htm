<H1>Overview</H1><P CLASS="t">As an Office developer, you will find that Microsoft Excel&nbsp;97 is a major upgrade of the product, with a greatly enhanced development environment. Starting with the introduction of Visual Basic for Applications version&nbsp;5.0 and continuing with the evolution of the object model, developers will find any number of reasons to begin using the product as quickly as possible. Great effort has been taken to minimize the conversion effort from previous versions of Microsoft Excel.</P>
<P CLASS="t">In spite of the grand scope of the enhancements, many existing Microsoft Excel&nbsp;95 applications will work without conversion in Microsoft Excel&nbsp;97. In most instances, the newest features in Microsoft Excel have not made obsolete the functionality they replace. For example, Microsoft Excel&nbsp;97 offers developers Visual Basic forms with which to construct custom dialogs. However the dialog sheets introduced in Microsoft Excel&nbsp;5.0 will still work, and for that matter, the dialog tables used through Microsoft Excel&nbsp;4.0 will also work. This chapter provides you with both a conversion guide and a reference document.</P>
