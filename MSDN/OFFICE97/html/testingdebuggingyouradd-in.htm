<p>
You test and debug your add-in in two phases: the first during development and the second after it’s installed in Microsoft Access.</p>
<p>
During development, test and debug each object as you create it. Keep in mind how your add-in will be started by the user, and test it in that context. For example, if you are creating a control wizard, test it in the context of form design.</p>
<p>
After you test the individual objects or components of your add-in, test the overall operation. For example, determine whether:
<ul>
<li>
All the functionality you want is available and working.</li>
<li>
All parts of the add-in work together correctly.</li>
<li>
Your add-in anticipates and allows for different user configurations.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Your add-in should work without problems while it is open as a database before you begin to test it when it is loaded as an add-in.</p>
<p>
To test and debug in the second phase, you need to install your add-in. The following sections discuss the installation process.</p>
