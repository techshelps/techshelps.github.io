<p>
Now that your add-in is tested and debugged, a final development phase is needed. In this phase you clean up your add-in and add extra functionality by using Help files.</p>
<h3>Cleaning Up Your Add-in</h3>
<p>
There are several things you can do to clean up your add-in:
<ul>
<li>
Delete any temporary or unnecessary objects in your add-in. Then, perform one more test pass on your add-in to make sure you didn’t delete a necessary object.</li>
<li>
Repair and compact the database.</li>
<li>
Change the file name extension of your add-in. By convention, add-ins have a .mda file name extension, not the standard Microsoft Access .mdb file name extension. This enables you to easily differentiate add-ins from regular databases. It also keeps the database name out of dialog boxes the user normally sees in Microsoft Access, such as the <b>Open</b> dialog box. Changing the file name extension of the database file has no effect on the operation and behavior of the database; it’s simply a technique to aid in file management at the MS-DOS file level.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Important   Make sure to compile and save all Visual Basic modules in your add-in, including form and report modules, before distributing your application. Users may encounter unexpected errors in add-in modules that haven’t been compiled and saved.</p>
<h3>Creating a Help File</h3>
<p>
Help is a feature that can make your add-in easier to use and can reduce the amount of printed documentation you supply for your add-in. You can create Help files by using the Microsoft Help Compiler, which you can obtain from the following sources:
<ul>
<li>
Microsoft Office 97, Developer Edition</li>
<li>
Microsoft Visual C++</li>
<li>
Microsoft Visual Basic</li>
<li>
Microsoft Developer’s Network</li>
</ul>
<p>
Help topics are called from your add-in’s forms in the same way they are called from any Microsoft Access application’s forms.</p>
