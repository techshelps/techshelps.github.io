<p>
Orders is a sample order entry and invoicing system. Its features include the ShowEvents form, which helps you see the order in which events occur when you are working with forms and controls, and custom data filtering capabilities you can use in addition to the filtering functionality provided by Microsoft Access. There are also several useful functions located in the UtilityFunctions module, such as the IsLocked function which determines whether the current record is locked.</p>
