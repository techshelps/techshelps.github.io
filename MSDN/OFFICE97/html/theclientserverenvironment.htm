<h2><a name="theclientserverenvironment"></a>The Client/Server Environment</h2>
<p>
In a client/server environment, processing tasks are divided between an application on a client computer system, and a database on a server. The client and the server are linked by a network. The client makes requests for services provided by the server. These services may include querying a database, printing a document, or backing up data. The client performs operations on the data that is returned by the server and interacts with the user.</p>
<p>
There are several advantages to a client/server environment. Instead of sending the whole database back and forth across the network, network traffic is limited to queries from the client to the server and responses from the server to the client. Also, the data on the server can be accessed from multiple client applications. The server is responsible for maintaining data integrity and security at a centralized location.</p>
<p>
Important   Before you can use Microsoft Access with a server, you must install the appropriate Open Database Connectivity (ODBC) drivers. If you clicked <b>Typical</b> when you installed Microsoft Access, you don’t have these drivers installed. For information on how to install drivers, search the Help index for “installing drivers.”</p>
<p>
Additionally, you must use the ODBC Data Source Administrator to set up an ODBC data source for each remote database to which you want to connect. To start the ODBC Data Source Administrator, double-click 32bit&nbsp;ODBC<b> </b>in Windows Control Panel.</p>
<p>
<b>Note</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some database server documentation refers to records as <i>rows</i> and to fields as <i>columns</i>. This chapter uses the terms <i>records</i> and <i>fields</i>.</p>
