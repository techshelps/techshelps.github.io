<H2>Performing Lengthy Operations</H2><P CLASS="t">Windows 95 and Windows NT use <I>preemptive multitasking</I>. This means that the&nbsp;operating system determines when an application must give up the processor so that other applications can run. Even though the operating system can preempt Microsoft Excel it is still a good idea to give up the processor during long tasks. Normally, Microsoft Excel gives up the processor frequently, allowing background tasks to run smoothly.</P>
<P CLASS="t">If you expect your DLL function to take a long time, you will need to:</P>
<UL><LI CLASS="ULI1">Give up the processor as frequently as possible.</LI><LI CLASS="ULI1">Determine whether the user has canceled the function by pressing ESC. If the&nbsp;user has canceled, you may want to terminate the lengthy operation.</LI></UL><P></P>
<P></P>
<P></P>
<P></P>
<P CLASS="t">There is a single function called xlAbort that handles both of these tasks at once. First it yields, giving other applications in the system a chance to run. Then it checks whether the user has canceled by pressing ESC. If so, xlAbort returns TRUE; if not, it returns FALSE.</P>
<P CLASS="t">When the user cancels the function by pressing ESC, the DLL should clean up and&nbsp;return as quickly as possible. However, you might want to prompt the user to&nbsp;confirm the cancellation, offering the option of continuing. If the user wants to&nbsp;continue, the pending cancellation can be cleared by calling xlAbort with one argument, an xltypeBool with the value FALSE.</P>
<P CLASS="t">For an example of the xlAbort function, see the fDance function in GENERIC.C in the FRAMEWRK directory.</P></FONT>
