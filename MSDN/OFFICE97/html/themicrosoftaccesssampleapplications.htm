<p>
In addition to the Northwind sample application, which has examples of objects that you can create in your own applications, Microsoft Access includes two sample applications especially for application developers: Orders and Developer Solutions. The Orders and Developer Solutions sample applications provide examples of how an application is constructed and show many techniques that you can use as you develop your own applications.</p>
<p>
You can use the examples in Orders and Developer Solutions as templates for the forms and reports you want to create, or you can use them as ideas for improving your applications. The steps needed to reproduce the forms and reports are documented in Show Me, the Help system designed specifically for these sample applications.</p>
<p>
The best way to see what the sample applications have to offer is to install them and start exploring. The procedures that follow show you how to get started. </p>
<p>
If you clicked <b>Custom</b> when you installed Microsoft Access, and then clicked <b>Select All</b>, you already have copies of Orders and Developer Solutions in the Samples subfolder of the Office folder. If you chose a different option during installation, or if you deleted either of the sample applications, you can install them now.</p>
<p>
