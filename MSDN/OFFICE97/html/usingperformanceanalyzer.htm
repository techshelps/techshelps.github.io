<h2><a name="usingperformanceanalyzer"></a>Using the Performance Analyzer</h2>
<p>
You use the Performance Analyzer to improve the performance of your application by optimizing either your entire database or a single object in your database. Depending on the level of optimization you choose, the Performance Analyzer can do something as simple as adding an index to a field, or it can perform complex operations such as converting an OLE object on a form to an image.</p>
<p>
<b><font face="Symbol"><span style="font-family:symbol">&#219;</span></font>&#09;To use the Performance Analyzer</b>
<ol>
<li>
Open the database you want to optimize.</li>
<li>
On the <b>Tools</b> menu, point to <b>Analyze</b>, and then click <b>Performance</b>.</li>
<li>
In the <b>Object Type</b> list, click the type of database object you want to optimize. <p>

<p>
Tip   To view a list of all database objects at once, click <b>All</b> in the <b>Object Type</b> list.</p>
</li>
<li>
In the <b>Object Name</b> list, select the database objects you want to optimize. </li>
<li>
Repeat steps 3 and 4 until you’ve selected all the objects you want to optimize, and then click <b>OK</b>.<p>
In the dialog box that appears, the <b>Analysis Results</b> box displays a list of three kinds of optimizations: Recommendations, Suggestions, and Ideas. When you click an item in the list, the <b>Analysis Notes</b> box displays information about the proposed optimization. Suggestion optimizations have potential tradeoffs that you should consider before performing them. To view a description of the tradeoffs, click a Suggestion optimization in the <b>Analysis Results</b> box, and then read the information in the <b>Analysis Notes</b> box.</p>
</li>
<li>
Microsoft Access can perform Recommendation and Suggestion optimizations for you. In the <b>Analysis Results</b> box, click each of the Recommendation or Suggestion optimizations you want performed, and then click <b>Optimize</b>. <p>
You must perform Idea optimizations yourself. To perform an Idea optimization, click that optimization, and then follow the instructions in the <b>Analysis Notes</b> box.</p>
