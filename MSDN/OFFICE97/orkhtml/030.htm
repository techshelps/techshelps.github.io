As a workgroup administrator, you might initiate or oversee workgroup
security practices for protecting Excel workbooks. This
section describes the options available in Excel for
protecting workbooks. These options are independent of any additional
security measures at the operating system level.
<P>

<a name="dex2"></a>
<P>
Excel incorporates the symmetric encryption
routine known as RC4. RC4 is stronger than the encryption routine
used in previous versions of Excel, known as Microsoft Office 4.<I>x</I>. Workbooks
from previous versions of Excel are not as secure as
password&#173;protected workbooks in Excel&nbsp;97 (Windows) or Excel&nbsp;98 (Macintosh) format.
For more information about Office encryption, see "<a href="034.htm#CH034H104">Security
Features in Office</A>" in Chapter&nbsp;34, "Microsoft
Office Architecture."
<P>
<FONT COLOR="#0000FF" SIZE=2><B>Note&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</B></FONT>Strong
encryption such as RC4 is banned in France. If a user's locale
setting in <B>Regional Settings</B> on the Control Panel is set to <B>French
(Standard)</B>, that user is not able to open an Office document that
is password protected. Nor can the user save an Office document
with RC4 encryption. The user can, however, use XOR encryption
by saving an Office document with password protection.
<P>

Excel supports three levels of workbook file protection.
All three levels are controlled by the author of the workbook, who is
the user with read&#173;write access to a workbook. The three
levels of workbook protection are:
<P>
<UL TYPE="square">
<P>
<LI>File open protection
<P>
Excel requires the user to enter a password
to open a workbook.
<P>
<LI>File modify protection
<P>
Excel prompts the user to enter a password
to open the workbook read&#173;write. If the user clicks <B>Read
Only</B> at the prompt, Excel opens the workbook read&#173;only.
<P>
<LI>Read&#173;only

<P>
Excel allows many users to edit the same workbook simultaneously,
or to edit copies of a workbook at different times. In both cases,
a user with read&#173;write access to the workbook can share the
workbook by clicking <B>Share Workbook</B> (<B>Tools</B> menu).
This section describes <I>shared workbooks</I>: multiple
users editing the same workbook simultaneously. For information
about <I>workbook merging</I>&nbsp;&#151; users
editing copies of a workbook at different times&nbsp;&#151;
see "<A HREF="#CH030H103">Workbook Merging and
Data Consolidation</A>" later in this chapter.
<P>
<a name="dex8"></a>
<P>
When a workbook is shared, Excel keeps a <I>change
history</I> of the workbook. The change history records
who changes cells, when a change is made, and the previous values
of an edited cell.
<P>
Shared workbooks have the following characteristics:
<P>
<UL TYPE="square">
<P>
<LI>Not all Excel
commands and features are available.
<P>
For example, you cannot delete a sheet in a shared
workbook. For a complete list of limitations when using shared
workbooks, see Excel online Help.
<P>
<LI>Of
the commands and features that are available when working with
a shared workbook, not all are recorded in the change history.
<P>
For example, formatting changes are allowed in a shared
workbook, but not recorded in the change history. For a complete
list of actions that are not recorded, see Excel online
Help.
<P>
<LI>History of cell revisions is maintained
until the <B>Track changes</B> time value on the <B>Advanced</B>
tab in the <B>Share Workbook</B> dialog box (<B>Tools</B> menu)
expires. The history of revisions older than the <B>Track changes</B>
time value is lost, but revisions within the <B>Track changes</B>
time value are kept.
<P>
<LI>Turning off workbook sharing
clears the entire change history.
<P>
Once cleared, the change history cannot be recovered.
To protect the change history, use the <B>Protect Shared Workbook</B>
command (<B>Tools</B> menu, <B>Protection</B> submenu). For more information
about workbook protection, see "<A HREF="#CH030H101">Security
Features in Microsoft Excel</A>" earlier in this chapter.
<P>
</UL>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 COLOR="#0000FF"><B>Tip&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</B></FONT>A
workbook for which the change history has been enabled grows in
size as the change history grows. To conserve disk space, you
can enable sharing without enabling the change history. On the
<B>Advanced</B> tab in the <B>Share</B> <B>Workbook</B> dialog
box (<B>Tools</B> menu), select the <B>Don't keep change history</B>

<P>
<a name="dex9"></a>
<P>
Some common uses of shared workbooks include:
<P>
<UL TYPE="square">
<P>
<LI>Sharing a list among several
users.
<P>
For example, a shared list could be a customer or
parts list or a schedule. In this case, different users might
need access to any part of the workbook at any time.
<P>
<LI>Consolidating
data stored on different worksheets within a single workbook.
<P>
For example, different department managers might maintain
their budgets on departmental sheets in a workbook, and a division
vice president might consolidate the data onto another sheet in
the workbook with the <B>Consolidate</B> command (<B>Data</B> menu).
<P>
<LI>Summarizing
data stored on different rows within a single worksheet.
<P>
For example, different department managers might keep
track of personnel headcount on specific rows in a worksheet,
and a division vice president might summarize the data&nbsp;&#151;
apply an outline and subtotals or averages, for example.
<P>
</UL>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 COLOR="#0000FF"><B>Tip&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</B></FONT>Excel does not offer the same level of multiuser support as does
Microsoft Access. For example, Microsoft Access supports user&#173;level
security, but Excel does not. If you have more complex
needs for data entry, protection, or reporting than Excel can manage, consider using Access. For information
about sharing data between Excel and Access,
see "<a href="027.htm#CH027H102">Sharing
Information with Microsoft Access&nbsp;97</A>" in Chapter&nbsp;27,
"Sharing Information with Microsoft Office Applications."
<P>
<a name="dex10"></a>
<P>
When two or more users of a shared workbook make conflicting changes
(for example, entering different values in the same cell), users
can either review the conflicts or automatically save their own
changes when they save the workbook. Users set this option for
themselves in the <B>Conflicting changes between users</B> group
on the <B>Advanced</B> tab in the <B>Share Workbook</B> dialog
box (<B>Tools</B> menu). If users choose to review changes, they
see a dialog box similar to the following when they either save
a workbook to which another user has made conflicting changes,
or when the <B>Update changes</B> time value is met.

<P>
<a name="dex11"></a>
<P>
Workbook merging and data consolidation have similar purposes:
in both cases, you start with data from multiple sources and end
up with a summary of the data in a single workbook.
<P>
<a name="dex12"></a>
<P>
<I>Workbook merging</I> combines multiple copies of
a single workbook. It is better suited for workbooks in which
multiple contributors edit any part of the data at any time, or
in which a single user edits different versions of the same workbook
on different computers. For example, a mobile user might copy
a shared workbook to a laptop computer. While the user is gone,
other users can continue to edit the shared workbook. Upon returning,
the mobile user can merge changes into the original workbook.
<P>
<I>Data consolidation</I> combines multiple workbooks.
It is designed for summarizing structured data, such as rolling
up departmental budgets into a summary budget for a division.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4><B><A NAME="CH030H201">Merging Workbooks</A></B></FONT>

<P>
Merging workbooks is similar to working with shared workbooks,
but instead of multiple users editing the same workbook simultaneously,
multiple copies of a single workbook are reconciled. As with shared
workbooks, merging requires you to turn on the change history
with the <B>Share Workbook</B> command (<B>Tools</B> menu) before
making copies and distributing the workbook. To merge workbooks,
use the <B>Merge Workbooks</B> command (<B>Tools</B> menu).
<P>
You must turn on the change history in the workbook from the time
you create copies of the workbook to the time you merge changes
back into the original workbook. Specify the duration of the change
history on the <B>Advanced</B> tab in the <B>Share</B> <B>Workbook</B>
dialog box (<B>Tools</B> menu). If you do not know how long it
will be before you merge changes, set the change history duration
to a long period such as 1000&nbsp;days.
<P>
Unless the change history of the workbook is protected, a user
can turn it off. If this happens, you cannot automatically merge
that user's changes. the change history, use the <B>Protect
Shared Workbook</B> command (<B>Tools</B> menu, <B>Protection</B>
submenu). For more information about workbook protection, see
"<A HREF="#CH030H101">Security Features in Microsoft
Excel</A>" earlier in this chapter.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4><B><A NAME="CH030H202">Consolidating Data</A></B></FONT>

<P>
<a name="dex13"></a>
<P>
Consolidating data is similar to merging workbooks, except that
it is not necessary to turn on the change history. Use data consolidation
when you want to compile repetitive, highly structured data from
several subordinate workbooks into one summary workbook.
<P>
When you consolidate data on multiple worksheets within one workbook,
use consolidation by 3&#173;D references and share or route the
workbook. A <I>3&#173;D reference</I> includes a cell
or range reference, preceded by a range of worksheet names, allowing
you to analyze data in the same cell or range of cells on multiple
worksheets within a workbook. Use 3&#173;D formulas on the consolidation
worksheet to refer to the data sources on the detail worksheets.
<P>
If you choose not to use 3&#173;D references, consolidate data
by consistent positions on a worksheet, or by the category of
data. Whether you use 3&#173;D references or position or category
references, start consolidating data by clicking the <B>Consolidate</B>
command (<B>Data</B> menu).

<P>
<FONT SIZE=4><B><A NAME="CH030H203">Tracking Changes and Comments</A></B></FONT>

<P>
<a name="dex15"></a>
<P>
As with Microsoft Word documents or Microsoft PowerPoint presentations,
it is common for many members of a workgroup to revise or annotate
an Excel workbook.
<P>
The commands on the <B>Track Changes</B> submenu (<B>Tools</B>
menu) allow you to record, review, accept, or reject changes to
cell values. When you click <B>Highlight Changes</B> (<B>Tools</B>
menu, <B>Track Changes</B> submenu), Excel turns on
both change history (if it was not already on) and workbook sharing.
All changes to cell values are recorded and indicated by a small
triangle in the upper left corner of changed cells. The triangles
are color coded to distinguish among different users. Pointing
to such a cell displays the most recent change made to that cell,
similar to displaying a ToolTip for a toolbar button.

a comment, click the <B>Comments</B> command (<B>Insert</B> menu).
A cell with a comment has a small red triangle in the upper&#173;right

<P>
Users in a workgroup who have e&#173;mail capability can review
workbooks by routing or sending them through e&#173;mail, with each recipient
adding comments to the workbook. 
<P>
To route a workbook, the sender creates a routing slip, and then routes the workbook to the recipients either one at a time or all at once. The sender can track the status of the routed workbook as the recipients review it. After all of the recipients have reviewed the workbook, it is automatically returned to the original sender.
<P>
When sending a workbook through e-mail, the original sender does not create a routing slip. Whether the sender routes or sends a workbook, the workbook is received as an attachment in an e-mail message.
