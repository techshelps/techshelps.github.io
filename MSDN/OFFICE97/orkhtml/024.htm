<P>
Intranets apply the simple but powerful navigation paradigms of
the Internet to corporate networks. Intranets help users share
and analyze information, collaborate on projects, and find information.
<P>
If your network does not yet have intranet protocols in place,
Office still supports some intranet&#173;like features, such as
hyperlinks between Office documents. With intranet protocols in
place, however, you can integrate Office features and documents
smoothly into your existing intranet.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4><B><A NAME="CH024H201">Intranets and the Internet</A></B></FONT>

<P>
<a name="dex2"></a>
<P>
On the Internet, a relatively small number of people (referred
to as <I>Webmasters</I>) create content for very large
audiences. Internet publishing is their business and content is
their product, so they are willing to invest considerable time
and effort to learn and use specialized HTML authoring tools.
Most intranet users, by contrast, are not Webmasters, but rather
business users who need to create, analyze, and share information
without too much overhead. Intranet users must be able to create
information for an intranet as easily as they do for printing.
If it is difficult to publish to an intranet, the average user
is not likely to do it.
<P>
Office incorporates functionality based on Internet standards
into each application. This new functionality allows your workgroup
to take full advantage of intranets as content producers and consumers.
From an administrator's point of view, one of the best things
about combining Office and an intranet is that this combination
builds upon the work practices and user experience already in
place in many organizations. For example, experienced Office users
can immediately integrate Office documents into existing intranets;
because all Office applications can import and save HTML documents,
Office users can start creating HTML content using the tools they
are already familiar with.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4><B><A NAME="CH024H202">Security Issues with Intranets</A></B></FONT>

<P>
<a name="dex3"></a>
<P>
One issue that concerns many organizations developing intranets
is balancing the requirements for security at the enterprise level
with the free flow of information and collaboration on the desktop.
Often organizations address this issue by separating their companywide
and departmental intranets.
<P>
<a name="dex4"></a>
<P>
Typically, companywide intranet sites are managed by an IS department
with a formal security structure that limits most users to read&#173;only
access of information. In addition, many organizations institute
formal content&#173;publishing procedures that allow only a select
group to add or modify content on the intranet. At the workgroup
or departmental level, intranet sites are more likely to consist
of improvised collections of information and documents with less
centralized control. The Office intranet tools described in this
chapter integrate well into either scenario.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4><B><A NAME="CH024H203">Tools for Intranet Creation and Administration</A>
</B></FONT>

<P>
<a name="dex5"></a>
<P>
This section describes tools and strategies you might want to
deploy as an intranet site administrator.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><B>Managing Intranet Content with Microsoft FrontPage</B></FONT>

<P>
<a name="dex6"></a>
<P>
The FrontPage Web authoring and management program is
designed for nonprogrammers, yet it is robust enough even for
experienced Webmasters. FrontPage is a fast, easy way
to create and manage professional&#173;quality intranet sites.
With easy&#173;to&#173;use tools such as WYSIWYG editing, wizards
that guide you through the creation of your intranet site, and
integration with Office, it has never been easier to set up an
intranet. The capabilities of FrontPage are described in this
section.
<P>
<B>Authoring Tools</B>

<P>
<a name="dex7"></a>
<P>
The FrontPage Editor allows users to create and edit pages for
the World Wide Web without a detailed knowledge of HTML. Working
with graphics is easy with automatic conversion to GIF or JPEG
format and easy creation of graphical hyperlinks. Wizards and
templates help you generate entire intranet sites or individual
pages automatically, and even help you create a standard look
and feel throughout your intranet.
<P>
<B>Site Management</B>

<P>
<a name="dex8"></a>
<P>
The FrontPage Explorer gives you intuitive views of your entire
Web site. If you move or rename a hyperlink, for example, FrontPage
can automatically update all affected links. In addition, multiple
team members can work on the site simultaneously.
<P>
<B>Integration with Office</B>

<P>
<a name="dex9"></a>
<P>
You can include Office documents on your Web site and manage them
with FrontPage just as you would HTML documents. When you double&#173;click
a hyperlink to an Office document in FrontPage, FrontPage starts
the appropriate Office application, rather than the FrontPage
Editor.
<P>
<B>Client/Server Flexibility</B>

<P>
<a name="dex10"></a>
<P>
Security features&nbsp;&#151; including encryption, assigned
Web access rights, and support of proxy servers&nbsp;&#151;
encourage collaboration and keep unauthorized visitors from modifying
your intranet site. FrontPage Server Extensions allow
FrontPage to work with leading Web servers, or you can use the
FrontPage Personal Web Server to publish and test an intranet
site on your own computer.

<P>
<a name="dex11"></a>
<P>
The Web Find Fast indexing software performs full content indexing
and searching of HTML and Office documents on a network. Web Find
Fast runs on most popular network operating systems, such as Windows&nbsp;NT
Server and Novell NetWare. It can create a full&#173;content index
that spans several servers or shared local drives and folders.
Administrators can customize the search page as well as the frequency
of index updates. For more information about Web Find Fast, see
Chapter&nbsp;26, "<a href="026.htm">Finding
Microsoft Office Documents on the Network</A>."

<FONT SIZE=3><B>Creating Office Programming Solutions for Intranets</B></FONT>

<P>
<a name="dex12"></a>
<P>
Office is not only a powerful suite of desktop applications but
also a very powerful cross&#173;platform development environment
for creating custom solutions. In fact, more than 500,000 developers
use the following technologies to create solutions based on Office:
<P>
<UL TYPE="square">
<P>
<LI>Rich object models and ActiveX
and OLE Controls
<P>
At the core of Office solutions is the functionality
provided by the features in each Office application. This functionality
is fully exposed to developers through a rich set of object models.
In addition, Office provides rich support for ActiveX and OLE
Controls. With these prebuilt software components, developers
can add rich interactive capabilities to their applications as
well as their intranet sites.
<P>
<LI>Visual Basic for
Applications
<P>
Visual Basic is a shared development environment that
programmers can use to create solutions with one or more Office applications. Visual Basic includes the Visual Basic language
engine (compiler), a powerful editor (syntax checking, color&#173;coded
syntax, and so forth), and debugging tools. Every Office application
supports Visual Basic.
<P>
<LI>Automation (formerly
called OLE Automation)
<P>
Automation allows developers to combine and reuse
objects from off&#173;the&#173;shelf applications in their custom
solutions. This process involves three elements: a series of instructions
created in Visual Basic, an application that sends instructions
(Automation controller), and an application that responds to those
instructions (Automation server).
<P>
</UL>
<P>
<a name="dex13"></a>
<P>
These technologies work together, allowing the developer to create
more powerful applications in less time. In addition, the technologies
use software that users are already familiar with, making Office
an ideal solutions platform for intranets.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4><B><A NAME="CH024H204">Netscape Web Server Support</A></B></FONT>

<P>
When a Web server sends a document to a Web browser, the Web server
must send the document in the correct format. In most cases this
format is HTML; however, Office also allows for sending
documents in Office application formats such as Word DOC Microsoft format.
<P>
Some Web server software programs, such as Microsoft Internet
Information Server (IIS), store Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions
(MIME) content type and corresponding file&#173;extension mappings
in the Windows registry. Proper MIME type settings in the registry
ensure that the Web server sends Office documents in the correct
format (rather than as plain text, for example).
<P>
Netscape Web servers such as the Netscape Commerce and Fast Track
Web servers do not store MIME type settings in the Windows
registry, but instead store them in a file named Mime.types. This
may prevent these Netscape Web servers from returning Office documents
correctly when requested from a Web browser (through a hyperlink
or Web Find Fast query, for example).
<P>
To correct this problem, you must add Office MIME type information
to the Mime.types files on your Netscape Web server. Note that
there may be multiple copies of the file Mimes.types on your Web
server; you can find all of them by using the file searching capabilities
included with Windows&nbsp;NT Server.

<P>
Most organizations plan intranets that combine HTML and Office
documents. With this in mind, Office provides users and organizations
with the same easy&#173;to&#173;use tools for creating both HTML
and Office documents. For example, you can convert a worksheet
range and chart in Microsoft Excel to an HTML table and GIF format
graphic image. In fact, all Office applications work directly
with HTML.
<P>
When you develop an intranet, you select the technology that best
addresses your organization's needs. HTML provides an effective
solution for broadcasting information across different platforms.
For example, many organizations distribute company policy manuals,
directories, or product information forms in HTML.
<P>
Conversely, native Office document formats are designed for distributing
information that is developed collaboratively and changes frequently.
For example, a team of individual contributors might develop a
business plan with detailed schedules and financial analyses.
Features such as comments, revision marks, and version tracking
are critical in this context.
<P>
<a name="dex15"></a>
<P>
Office is a flexible and robust tool for creating content in either
Office application formats or in HTML. The following table summarizes
common business tasks that you might perform on an intranet and
shows whether you would use HTML or Office document formats or
both.

ActiveX document technology combines the navigation capabilities

with consistent toolbars, caches, and favorites lists.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4><B><A NAME="CH024H206">Creating Hyperlinks in Office Documents</A>
</B></FONT>

<P>
<a name="dex18"></a>
<P>
Many documents are part of a group of related files. Providing
hyperlinks between documents gives the reader or author easier
access to related information. For example, the specifications
for a new bicycle might include hyperlinks to the descriptions
of individual parts that make up the bicycle. Or an annual report
distributed online as a Word document could have hyperlinks
to an Excel spreadsheet containing the year&#173;end
balances, so that users can do their own detailed analyses.
<P>
Office includes a simple dialog box that is shared across all
Office applications to make it easy for any user to create and
edit hyperlinks: the <B>Insert Hyperlink</B> dialog box (<B>Insert</B>
menu).
<P>
<IMG SRC="02402.gif">
<P>
These hyperlinks can go anywhere&nbsp;&#151; to other Office
documents, to HTML documents, or to any file with a recognized
address through a fully qualified path, Uniform Resource Locator
(URL), Universal Naming Convention (UNC), or File Transfer Protocol
(FTP) site. Office users can attach hyperlinks to a variety of
objects, including text, graphics, tables, presentation slides,
spreadsheet cells, and custom database form fields.
<P>
From the administrator's perspective, hyperlinks are generally
simpler to support than OLE or dynamic data exchange (DDE) links.
In the case of OLE or DDE links, Office applications are designed
to maintain a connection to the linked source data, and the maintenance
of this connection introduces problems such as how to manage the
document over a period of time. By contrast, hyperlinks are primarily
navigational tools. As such, the interface for creating and navigating
hyperlinks is simpler than that of OLE or DDE links.
<P>
The hyperlink feature is intended for the corporate or enterprise
intranet with high&#173;speed links and direct file access. Hyperlinks
work on an enterprise local area network (LAN) or a high&#173;speed
wide area network (WAN) without new server functionality. The
hyperlink feature does not require HTTP or any special Web server
software. Office also supports hyperlinks to documents on the
Web, although access time can be much slower.
<P>
Using hyperlinks to navigate between Office documents is similar
to navigating on the Web. To extend the similarity, Office
includes the <B>Web</B> toolbar, which is shared across Office
applications.
<P>
<a name="dex19"></a>
<P>
<IMG SRC="02403.gif">
<P>
<a name="dex20"></a>
<P>
The <B>Web</B> toolbar is similar to standard Web browsers, with
buttons for navigating forward, backward, and to the home page.
With the <B>Search the Web</B> button, users can search an intranet
or the Web. A user can type a URL or file location in the <B>Address</B>
box, which even tracks the most recently visited sites. As in
the <B>Open</B> dialog box (<B>File</B> menu) in Office, the <B>Favorites</B>
menu gives easy access to your most visited sites.

as well as the rest of the enterprise.
<P>
<LI>Documents

<P>
Some documents by their nature require frequent revisions

Once information is created, it is analyzed in many ways. It may
be reused in subsequent publications or in making business decisions.
For example, a sales report that is published by the finance department
may be used by marketing to decide which market to target next.
Important information, which is stored in a database in many organizations,
has to be easily accessible to users at the desktop level for
analysis and effective decision making.
<P>
Excel, Microsoft Access, and Microsoft Project are the
three primary analysis tools in the Office family. Some of their
analysis capabilities include the following:
<P>
<UL TYPE="square">
<P>
<LI>PivotTable views
<P>
You can create custom reports by dragging the fields
in a PivotTable. The data for a PivotTable view can come from
a Excel workbook or any Open Database Connectivity (ODBC)
database, such as SQL Server, Access, or a mainframe
data source.
<P>
<FONT COLOR="#0000FF" SIZE=2><B>Note&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</B></FONT>To
use data from an ODBC database, you must have the appropriate
driver installed and a Data Source Name (DSN) defined and properly
configured. For more information about ODBC, see "<a href="027.htm#CH027H202">Using
Microsoft Access with ODBC and Client/Server Operations</A>"
in Chapter&nbsp;27, "Sharing Information with Microsoft Office
Applications."
<P>
<LI>Web queries
<P>
Not only can you query data from any ODBC database
from within your organization, but with Web queries in Excel, you can also query data on the Web. For example,
you can query a database of demographic information and then analyze
it in Excel to determine whether you are targeting the
right market. For more information about Web queries, see "<a href="025.htm#CH025H102">Web
Support in Excel</A>" in Chapter&nbsp;25,
"Web Support in Microsoft Office Applications."
<P>
<LI>Relational
databases
<P>
Because Access is a powerful, easy&#173;to&#173;use
database management system, end users can create simple databases,
and IS professionals can create full&#173;fledged database applications.
For more information about managing databases on an intranet,
see "<a href="025.htm#CH025H101">Web
Support in Microsoft Access&nbsp;97</A>" in Chapter&nbsp;25,
"Web Support in Microsoft Office Applications."
<P>
<LI>Project
management
<P>
You can use Project to analyze how long
it will take to complete a project, what effect schedule changes
will have on the projected completion date, and how your resources
are being used.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 COLOR="#0000FF"><B>Tip&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</B></FONT>If
you have Project, you can use the Office&nbsp;97 Deployment
Planner to guide you through the process of creating a customized
Office&nbsp;97 installation plan. For more information, see Chapter&nbsp;3,

<FONT SIZE=4><B>Collaborating on Documents in a Workgroup</B></FONT>

<P>
<a name="dex23"></a>
<P>
One of the most powerful uses of an intranet is collaboration.
Typical examples of collaboration include the following:
<P>
<UL TYPE="square">
<P>
<LI>Collaborative authoring
<P>
Often several authors work together to create one
document&nbsp;&#151; a budget or extensive specifications
for one product.
<P>
<LI>Content review
<P>
Peers or managers frequently review a document before
the author publishes it in a final version. Office provides a
set of tools for collaboration, making it as easy as opening a
document and going to work. For example, both Excel
and Word support comments and change tracking.
<P>
<LI>Shared workbooks
<P>
Excel makes it easy for two or more
users to edit the same workbook simultaneously by using the Share
Workbook dialog box (Tools menu).
<P>
<IMG SRC="02404.gif">
<BR>
<P>
</UL>
<P>
<a name="dex24"></a>
<P>
Office also provides the following tools to make it easy to track
and review changes in a document, or, if necessary, roll them
back to earlier versions:
<P>
<UL TYPE="square">
<P>
<LI>Revisions
<P>
Office users can track all changes to a file with
revision marks that are color&#173;coded for each user. In Excel, a color border appears around a cell, while in Word the
modified text appears in a different color or has special formatting
such as underlining or strikethrough.
<P>
<LI>Conflict
resolution
<P>
Multiple changes to the same data are tracked, giving
the original author the ability to roll back changes. The <B>Review</B>
toolbar lets you move through all revisions and comments and decide
which changes to accept and which to reject.
<P>
<LI>Merged
files
<P>
Many people distribute documents through electronic
mail (e&#173;mail). With the ability to merge files, you can bring
everyone's version of a document together into one file.
<P>
</UL>
<P>
For more information about Office tools that support collaboration,
see the application&#173;specific chapters in Part&nbsp;5, beginning
with Chapter&nbsp;29, "<a href="029.htm">Workgroup
Features in Microsoft Access</A>."
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4><B><A NAME="CH024H210">Sharing Information Throughout Your Organization</A>
</B></FONT>

<P>
<a name="dex25"></a>
<P>
Corporate information often needs to be shared throughout an organization.
This may include product information, human resources policies,
customer relations information, or a company phone book. Some
typical situations in which your organization might need to publish
or share data include the following:
<P>
<UL TYPE="square">
<P>
<LI>Distributing content on
an informal or unscheduled basis
<P>
In addition to the traditional publishing methods
described earlier, there are many situations in which a user might
publish a document on an intranet for review and feedback from
other users.
<P>
<LI>Publishing in multiple media
<P>
Although many documents are still created for print,
many are also being published directly on CD&#173;ROM, on an intranet,
or on the Web. Presentations are distributed in an increasing
variety of formats, such as 35mm slides, paper, electronic presentations,
or HTML documents. Users want one tool to publish in multiple
formats.
<P>
<LI>Publishing to a widespread audience
<P>
Once documents are published, users may spend a lot
of time trying to locate key information or find related documents
created by other groups. This effectively limits this size of
the audience for the publication&nbsp;&#151; making publication
on an intranet a useful alternative.

Outlook organizes e&#173;mail, calendars, contacts, tasks, documents, and files into a single, integrated environment. Outlook also helps users share information through

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><B>Electronic Mail</B></FONT>
<P>
Outlook makes it easy for users in your organization to communicate
internally or externally using Exchange Server or Microsoft
Mail. Support for POP3 and SMTP in Outlook also allows users to
communicate directly over the Internet. In addition, Outlook automatically
creates hyperlinks for any URL or public folder address contained
in an e&#173;mail message or any other Outlook item.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><B>Group Scheduling</B></FONT>

<P>
You can use Outlook to schedule meetings with everyone in your
organization or even with external users on the Internet. Outlook
users can also assign tasks across the Internet and be notified
automatically when any updates to the task occur or when the task
is completed. These features extend the ability of users to manage
projects and resources beyond their workgroup on an intranet and
the Internet.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><B>Public Folders</B></FONT>

<P>
With Outlook, you can publish in a public folder such items as
calendars of company holidays or trade shows, contact lists, and
project task lists. Administrators can create custom views of
the task, contact, schedule, or journal items in a public folder,
and each user can also create personalized views of this shared
information.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><B>Workflow Solutions</B></FONT>

<P>
As with Exchange Client, you can create forms in Outlook,
but with several important distinctions. ActiveX document technology
allows your forms in Outlook to contain Office documents or templates.
For example, an Excel expense report template can be
included in an Outlook form. The user fills out the expense report,
and because it is an Outlook form, the report is automatically
sent through e&#173;mail to the appropriate person for approval
and processing.

Each computer that will have access to the server must have Transmission
Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) installed. The TCP/IP
protocol is included with Windows&nbsp;95 and Windows&nbsp;NT
Workstation&nbsp;4.0. To install the TCP/IP protocol, click the
Network icon in Control Panel to install and configure the TCP/IP
protocol and related components.

microsoft.com is the friendly domain name registered to Microsoft.
Within the microsoft.com domain, Microsoft has named its Web server
www.microsoft.com. Most ISPs can register your domain names for
you.
