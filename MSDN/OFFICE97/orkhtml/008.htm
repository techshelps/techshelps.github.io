A well&#173;planned training and support program, including promotion
of Office and documentation, will help your organization
get the most out of Office. This is true whether you are
switching from a competitive product or upgrading from an earlier
version of Office. This chapter focuses on <I>migration
training</I>, or<I> </I>preparing users for
the switch to Office.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4><B><A NAME="CH008H201">Budgeting for Training and Support</A>
</B></FONT>

<P>
<a name="dex3"></a>
<P>
Consider carefully the cost of migration training, support, promotion,
and documentation. Many organizations commit 10&nbsp;percent to
20&nbsp;percent of their Office budget to preparing users for
the transition, helping them learn the new software, and customizing
documentation. Your investment in training helps users master
the many features of Office quickly and minimizes disruptions
in your organization.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4><B><A NAME="CH008H202">Designing a Migration Training Program</A>
</B></FONT>

<P>
<a name="dex4"></a>
<P>
Although deploying Office is a one&#173;time event, learning
Office is an ongoing process. The first priority of the
migration training program is to prepare users to start using
Office. However, you may also want to design a migration
training program for any or all of the following situations:
<P>
<UL TYPE="square">
<P>
<LI>Most people in your organization
use Office to some degree, so you have audiences with different
learning needs. Scheduling training to coincide with the implementation
of Office is a significant task.
<P>
<LI>Many users
use various electronic mail (e&#173;mail), scheduling, word processing,
or spreadsheet applications. Reducing the amount of time that
your organization uses dual software systems is helpful.
<P>
<LI>Some
users may have Office at home. The training program and class
groupings must enhance (or correct) existing knowledge.
<P>
<LI>Many
users have experience with similar software. The training program
needs to relate new information to their existing knowledge.
<P>
<LI>Some
users use two systems for a period of time. They need to understand
when and how to convert files to Office.
<P>
<LI>Some
users resist change, especially when you are moving from non&#173;Microsoft
products. You need to reduce resistance to Office by providing
information about the rollout and training.
<P>
<LI>Some
users are overwhelmed by new information. To master Office,
users have many opportunities to learn&nbsp;&#151; opportunities
that are geared to how they use Office, such as demonstrations,
self&#173;exploration time, computer&#173;guided training, instructor&#173;led
training classes, and desk&#173;side support.
<P>
<LI>Your
organization may want to use customized applications of Office.
The training program must address these applications.
<P>
<LI>Your
internal training and support staff knows your current software
intimately but has no expertise with the new software. In&#173;depth
training prepares your staff to support Office during and after
the transition to Office.
<P>
<LI>During the
Office rollout, your training staff must do their current
jobs and fulfill their extra rollout responsibilities. You may
need to hire a training company to meet the increased need for
training and support.
<P>
<LI>Demands on the help desk
increase significantly as users start using Office. Your
plans must account for this extra demand on resources.

<FONT SIZE=4><B><A NAME="CH008H203">Assemble the Training and Support Teams</A>
</B></FONT>

<P>
<a name="dex6"></a>
<P>
The training team includes a project manager as well as trainers
who deliver training and desk&#173;side support. You may also
consider including writers and editors to prepare documentation
and manage promotion of Office.
<P>
<a name="dex7"></a>
<P>
The support team includes expert users to deliver telephone support
from the help desk. It may also include users who provide informal
support, such as word&#173;processing operators or selected power
users.
<P>
<a name="dex8"></a>
<P>
The training and support teams may include internal or external
resources. The makeup of the training and support teams depends
on the services you plan to offer, the rollout schedule, and the
strength and size of your internal staff.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><B>Identifying Internal Training and Support Resources</B></FONT>

<P>
<a name="dex9"></a>
<P>
Use your internal training staff and help desk staff as much as
possible during the rollout of Office. These groups are
your best long&#173;term providers of information, training, and
support for Office. If their current jobs prevent them from participating
directly in the rollout, keep them up to date about the project
and make sure that they are prepared to support Office after the
transition to Office. Your training staff and support
staff have direct contact with users; they can also help you promote
Office and the training plan.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><B>Identifying External Training and Support Resources</B></FONT>

<P>
<a name="dex10"></a>
<P>
Many organizations work with an outside training company&nbsp;&#151;
a <I>training partner</I>&nbsp;&#151; to shorten
the rollout process or provide services that are not available
internally. Finding the right training partner can be time consuming,
but it is worth the effort to find the company that best fits
your needs.
<P>
<a name="dex11"></a>
<P>
Look for these characteristics in a training partner:
<P>
<UL TYPE="square">
<P>
<LI>Experience with Microsoft
software (for example, a Microsoft Solution Provider)
<P>
<LI>Experience
in software transition or in upgrade planning, training, documentation,
promotion of Office, and support
<P>
<LI>Creativity
in problem solving
<P>
<LI>Flexibility in the face of
change
<P>
<LI>Team&#173;building skills
<P>
<LI>Training
philosophy that reflects or complements your training philosophy
<P>
<LI>Capacity

<P>
<LI>Ability to tailor
the curriculum to different audiences
<P>
<LI>Ability
to adjust documentation to reflect your customization of Office
<P>
</UL>
<P>
<a name="dex12"></a>
<P>
If you engage an outside training company, make sure that your
internal trainers and support staff have a clear understanding
of their roles before, during, and after the rollout.
<P>
<a name="dex13"></a>
<P>
Many training companies support Microsoft products, giving your
organization a variety of choices. For information about authorized
training companies that support Office, call (800) SOLPROV. For
information about other training and support resources, see Appendix&nbsp;E,
"<A HREF="appe.htm">Other
Support Resources</A>."
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4><B><A NAME="CH008H204">Prepare the Training and Support Teams</A>
</B></FONT>

<P>
<a name="dex14"></a>
<P>
Before the rollout, your internal training and support teams must
learn Office. A special training program dedicated to
building their Office skills prepares them to contribute from
the beginning of the planning phases for the transition to the
end of implementation.
<P>
<a name="dex15"></a>
<P>
To get the training and support teams started, provide access
to the software so they can explore on their own. This is an effective
way to get started, particularly if your training and support
teams are already using an earlier version of Office. If you are
not using Windows, however, you should adopt a more structured
mode of learning.
<P>
<a name="dex16"></a>
<P>
When your staff is ready for more structured training, consider
self&#173;paced options, such as videos or computer&#173;based
training, to build basic skills. Use instructor&#173;led training
to build in&#173;depth and job&#173;specific skills.
<P>

Microsoft Press publishes a multimedia, computer&#173;based training
product called Microsoft Office&nbsp;97 Starts Here. Users view
a video introduction for each lesson, practice using the actual
Office&nbsp;97 product, and then take a quiz to test their new
skills. This course is available wherever computer books are sold.

</TABLE>

<P>
After completing training, members of the training and support
teams should use Office to do all of their work. You can
broaden their appreciation of Office by having them test templates,
macros, software integration, file conversion, and cleanup procedures
before you release these to the pilot group.
<P>
If you hire an external training company, their trainers already
know Office. However, they need to become familiar with
your current software and learn how your organization plans to
use Office. Many training companies find an orientation meeting
helpful to learn this type of information. An orientation meeting
is also a good way to build the critically important rapport between
internal and external trainers.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4><B><A NAME="CH008H205">Develop the Training Plan</A></B></FONT>

<P>
<a name="dex18"></a>
<P>
With the training and support teams educated about the capabilities
of Office, the next step is for the teams to prepare the
training plan. The purpose of this plan is to identify learning
needs and to state the methods you will use for training, support,
documentation, and promoting Office. The plan should also
identify who is responsible for each task and the related costs.
For more information about collecting information and building
consensus, see "<A HREF="#OrgWideInput">Organization-wide Input for the Training Plan</A>," later in this chapter.
<P>
The planning, training, and support teams collaborate to prepare
the training plan. To ensure consistency, however, the plan is
written by one individual. This person is usually the training
director or your training partner's project manager. Once the
plan is accepted&nbsp;&#151; usually by the planning team&nbsp;&#151;
you can use the plan to generate enthusiasm at different levels
in your organization.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><B>Contents of the Training Plan</B></FONT>

<P>
<a name="dex19"></a>
<P>
Preparing the training plan requires 40 to 120&nbsp;hours, depending
on its detail and the number of interviews and surveys conducted.
The training plan should include the following:
<P>
<B>Executive Summary</B>

<P>
An executive summary provides an overview of your plans for promoting
Office, preparing documentation, delivering training,
and providing support to key managers, users, and members of the
project team. You should include estimates for all associated
costs related to project planning, documentation, promotion, training,
and support.
<P>
<B>Audience Objectives</B>

<P>
Your plan should include a description of each audience, organized
by department and location. Each description includes audience
size, job function, experience level with related software, and
experience level with the new software. Specify learning objectives
for each audience with each new software application.
<P>
<B>Team Member Responsibilities</B>

<P>
You plan should include a description of the roles and responsibilities
of the training and support teams and of the individual team members
in each department.
<P>
Include a delineation of responsibilities between your internal
and external resources. Roles and responsibilities during the
rollout of Office include designing, developing, editing,
and piloting your courseware and training programs; training trainers
and support staff; scheduling students for classes; duplicating
and distributing materials; setting up classrooms; delivering
training for end users; delivering desk&#173;side support; delivering
help desk support; managing training; and managing support.
<P>
<B>Communication Plan</B>

<P>
You should develop a plan for communication among all teams before
and during the pilot and rollout in each department (for example,
assign each team a group e&#173;mail address and schedule weekly
status meetings).
<P>
Document how help desk and desk&#173;side support calls are recorded
and how issues are tracked and handled until they are resolved.
List key contacts responsible for hardware, software, and training.
Communication among the installation, training, and support teams
is critical for a smooth pilot and rollout. The installation team
needs to receive suggestions about the system. The training and
support teams benefit from information about system updates. The
training team needs to know about frequently asked questions so
they can be answered in training. Keeping this three&#173;way
communication flowing is critical. It can be accomplished through
Microsoft Outlook, using e&#173;mail and discussion groups.
<P>
<B>Departmental Plans</B>

<P>
Design a plan for each department that lists training tasks, resource
needs, and key delivery dates.
<P>
Be as explicit as possible. You may need resources to schedule
training, distribute materials, provide Office demonstrations,
prepare newsletters, deliver training, and deliver support. You
may also require additional resources to set up equipment, classrooms,
telephone lines, and demonstration monitors. This plan is best
created in Microsoft&nbsp;Project and integrated into the overall
project plan.
<P>
<B>Training Programs</B>

<P>
Recommend a training program for each audience. Include what you
plan to offer in the following areas:
<P>
<UL TYPE="square">
<P>
<LI>Promoting Office
<P>
Promoting Office is an important process before,
during, and after the rollout. It keeps people informed about
key benefits, dates, and issues. It also helps you thank people
for their cooperation and patience. The training program identifies
key messages, such as "Office was chosen to help us better
serve our customers" or "There is no magic date for
the rollout&nbsp;&#151; we will roll out Office the day after
the system is ready." It also lists promotion ideas and implementation
plans. For more information about promoting Office, see
"<A HREF="#CH008H208">Promote Office and the
Training Plan</A>," later in this chapter.
<P>
<LI>Preparing
documentation
<P>
The training program describes materials&nbsp;&#151;
such as reference guides, road maps to key features, hands&#173;on
practice exercises, quick reference cards, instructor notes, third&#173;party
books, and online help&nbsp;&#151; that you plan to create
or use. The documentation reflects your unique installation of
Office and job&#173;specific needs. It may include references
to templates, toolbars, integration with third&#173;party products,
samples of your organization's files, file conversion procedures,
and other items unique to your organization. For more information
about documentation, see "<A HREF="#CH008H206">Prepare
the Documentation</A>," later in this chapter.
<P>
<LI>Delivering
training
<P>
The training program explains the training that you
will use to introduce users to Office. Include the type
of training, length of training, and targeted audiences. If self&#173;paced
training is offered, formalize a process to ensure that students
complete the training. Also include information about ongoing
training programs.
<P>
<LI>Providing support
<P>
The training program documents your support during
and after the rollout. Anticipate increased resource demands as
use of the help desk grows. Desk&#173;side support&nbsp;&#151;
support that is delivered face&#173;to&#173;face at a person's
desk&nbsp;&#151; following training is critical for minimizing
the disruption in your organization. Offering desk&#173;side support
shows that you recognize that learning is an ongoing process.
It is best delivered by skilled trainers who know when to educate
and when to answer the question and move on. It is recommended
that trainers rotate delivering training and desk&#173;side support
throughout the transition to Office.

<P>
You can use the process of creating a training plan to generate
enthusiasm for Office and build consensus for the project. To
collect information for the plan, conduct surveys and interviews
with key personnel in management, information systems, and training,
and with typical end users. Listed below are sample questions
you might ask each of these groups. These questions are not intended
to be exhaustive, but to get you started in this process.
<P>
<B>Management</B>

be available in the training room? Will this capability be used
in managing the project?
<P>
<LI>What procedures will
end users need to follow prior to the staging of their new hardware
and software? How will you communicate these requirements?
<P>
</UL>
<P>
<B>Internal Trainers and Help Desk Staff</B>

<P>
<a name="dex23"></a>
<P>
Ask internal trainers and help desk staff questions like these:
<P>
<UL TYPE="square">
<P>
<LI>What would you change from
your last software transition?
<P>
<LI>What different
audiences have you identified in the organization? What type of

<P>
Ask end users questions like these:
<P>
<UL TYPE="square">
<P>
<LI>What type of training do
you prefer: self&#173;guided, instructor&#173;guided, or a combination
of the two?
<P>
<LI>What do you want to be able to do
with Office? Is this similar to how you use your current software
tools?

<P>
<a name="dex24"></a>
<P>
Having identified the learning objectives for each audience, you
are ready to design the training programs. Each audience&#173;specific
training program documents each audience's needs for training,
support, documentation, and promotion of Office.
<P>
<a name="dex25"></a>
<P>
The remainder of this section shows what might be included in
the training program for secretaries who are upgrading from an
earlier version of Office.
<P>
<B>Several Weeks Before the Rollout</B>

<P>
<a name="dex26"></a>
<P>
Several weeks before the secretaries' rollout, the training program
focuses on promoting Office organization&#173;wide. For
example, it could specify the following activities:
<P>
<UL TYPE="square">
<P>
<LI>Periodically produce and
distribute a newsletter to all personnel announcing news relevant
to the rollout of Office. Include the best new features of Office,
plans for training, names of team members, answers to frequently
asked questions, relevant dates, and so forth.
<P>
<LI>Have
managers take the opportunity in staff meetings to discuss Office
and their expectations for how Office will be used in their departments.
<P>
</UL>
<P>
<B>First Week of Secretaries' Rollout</B>

<P>
<a name="dex27"></a>
<P>
In the first week of the Office rollout for the secretaries, the
training program includes promoting Office and providing
documentation and training. For example, it could specify the
following activities:
<P>
<UL TYPE="square">
<P>
<LI>Give a short demonstration
of what is new in Office and how it benefits the secretaries;
provide lunch with the presentation.
<P>
<LI>Hand out
a road map during the demonstration that documents the new features.
This road map can be used later during self&#173;paced practice
sessions.
<P>
<LI>Schedule a two&#173;hour session for
the secretaries to explore the new software and use a computer&#173;based
tutorial on new features in Word, Excel, and Outlook.
<P>
</UL>
<P>
<B>Second and Third Weeks of Secretaries' Rollout</B>

<P>
In the second week of the Office rollout for the secretaries,
the training program focuses on training and documentation, but
also includes promoting Office and providing support.
For example, it could specify the following activities:
<P>
<UL TYPE="square">
<P>
<LI>Schedule three hours of
small&#173;group, instructor&#173;led training on Word, using
a customized reference guide and hands&#173;on practice exercises
that reflect the needs of the secretaries.
<P>
<LI>Schedule
three hours of small&#173;group, instructor&#173;led training
on Excel, using a customized reference guide and hands&#173;on
practice exercises that reflect the needs of the secretaries.
<P>
<LI>Schedule
three hours of small&#173;group, instructor&#173;led training
on Outlook, using a customized reference guide and hands&#173;on
practice exercises that reflect the needs of the secretaries.
<P>
<LI>Distribute
a letter that welcomes back the secretaries from the first class
and explains what to expect over the next few weeks.
<P>
<LI>Make
sure that desk&#173;side support is available when the secretaries
return from training.
<P>
</UL>
<P>
<B>After the Rollout</B>

<P>
After the Office rollout for the secretaries, the training program
emphasizes support, but also includes training and documentation.
For example, it could specify the following activities:
<P>
<UL TYPE="square">
<P>
<LI>Make sure that help desk
support is available on an ongoing basis.
<P>
<LI>Offer
lunch&#173;and&#173;learn sessions or monthly classes on specific
topics such as tables, outlining, tables of contents, linking
Word and Excel documents, and so forth. Documentation
includes short handouts.
<P>
</UL>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4><B><A NAME="CH008H206">Prepare the Documentation</A></B></FONT>

<P>
<a name="dex28"></a>
<P>
The training plan describes the type of documentation needed for
promoting Office and training. Documentation may be different
for each audience. It may be purchased from a third party, used
as is, modified, or written from scratch. Documentation that reflects
your software, policies, and procedures is relevant to users and
helps them learn more quickly.
<P>
<a name="dex29"></a>
<P>
Preparing training and reference documentation&nbsp;&#151;
such as reference guides, hands&#173;on practice, quick reference
cards, and instructor notes&nbsp;&#151; can require days,
weeks, or months. The phases involved include design, development,
writing, editing, testing during the pilot rollout, and revisions
after the pilot. Documentation&#173;related tasks are performed
by your training partner or your internal trainers.
<P>
<a name="dex30"></a>
<P>
If you decide to use a training partner, be aware that courseware
is a collaborative effort that requires internal resources. If
you opt to create materials in&#173;house, it is useful to license
existing materials and then modify them for your organization.
Many types of Office courseware are available, and some companies
offer industry&#173;specific courseware. Speer Software Training,
for example, offers Office courseware specific to the legal industry.
<P>
<a name="dex31"></a>
<P>
To make documentation relevant to users, you can customize it
by including information about your system, templates, macros,
software integration, e&#173;mail etiquette, and offline procedures.
Also include hands&#173;on practice exercises and policies and
procedures that are specific to your organization, such as converting
files.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4><B><A NAME="CH008H207">Schedule the Pilot Training</A></B></FONT>

<P>
<a name="dex32"></a>
<P>
Select the participants for the pilot rollout based on their willingness
and ability to use Office immediately following training.
Also look for people who are positive, open to change, and persuasive
in your organization.
<P>
Scheduling classroom time and self&#173;paced training can complex.
Schedule all training six or more weeks in advance, so that users
can plan ahead. Also schedule any self&#173;paced training so
that users complete all requirements in a timely fashion. Classes
of six similarly&#173;skilled students are ideal for instructor&#173;led
classes.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4><B><A NAME="CH008H208">Promote </A>Office and the Training
Plan</B></FONT>

<P>
<a name="dex33"></a>
<P>
Promoting Office prepares users for the rollout. It helps
them understand why Office was selected and lets them know how
they will benefit. It addresses concerns such as "How long
it will take me to learn, and how will my files convert?"
<P>
<a name="dex34"></a>
<P>
How creative you want to be with promoting Office depends
on the culture of your organization and your budget. Promoting
Office usually starts soon after selecting Office and continues
before and during the transition to Office. Usually the
planning team or the training team is responsible for promoting
Office, but it can be done by other groups.
<P>
Here are some ideas for promoting Office and the training
plan:
<P>
<UL TYPE="square">
<P>
<LI>Write a section in your
newsletters about the change to Office. Include benefits
that the software offers, why it was selected, who is involved
in the teams, tips from users, and answers to frequently asked
questions.
<P>
<LI>Develop PowerPoint presentations
about Office and the training plan to use at demonstrations
and staff meetings and to post on your intranet.
<P>
<LI>Provide
road maps highlighting key features of Office. Install
Office on computers in the classroom so people can experiment
and use computer&#173;based training.
<P>
<LI>Produce
video demonstrations of the benefits of Office for remote
sites.
<P>
<LI>Deliver one&#173;hour briefings to large
groups to demonstrate Office and how it will be customized
for your organization. Use a PowerPoint presentation to discuss
the rollout date, file conversion, training and support that will
be available, who covers users' desks during training, why the
organization is making the change, how long it takes to master
the new software, and so forth. Such a presentation would typically
be delivered a week before a group's rollout. To encourage high
attendance, include lunch.
<P>
<LI>Produce certificates
to distribute after training. Include different colored emblems
for each software product that is learned.
<P>
<LI>Host
a departmental lunch with the senior manager a few weeks after
training so the manager can reinforce expectations, encourage
people to share their best practice ideas, and thank them for
their cooperation and patience.
<P>
<LI>Prepare and
distribute welcome letters and survival bags to users as they
return from their first training session. A survival bag could
include a T&#173;shirt, a mug, computer&#173;oriented novelty
items or candy, monitor cleaner, a pen, and so forth.
<P>
<LI>Allow
casual dress during training sessions.
<P>
<LI>Distribute
tips through e&#173;mail to users who have completed the training.
<P>
<LI>Encourage
discussion groups to use Outlook to share their best practice
examples.
<P>
<LI>Give raffle tickets to people who
attend training. Prizes could include a home computer with Office installed, Microsoft hats, T&#173;shirts, gift certificates, and
an extra vacation day.
<P>
<LI>Encourage managers to
share their expectations with their staffs for how Office should be used on the job.
<P>
</UL>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4><B><A NAME="CH008H209">Test the Training Plan During the Pilot Rollout</A></B></FONT>

<P>
<a name="dex35"></a>
<P>
When you are ready to test the training plan, have pilot rollout
participants test every aspect of it, including promotion of Office,
training, documentation, and support. They should also test the
plans for communication among the installation, training, and
support teams.
<P>
Prepare questions to be answered during the pilot rollout, such
as:
<P>
<UL TYPE="square">
<P>
<LI>Are we providing the right
amount of information to prepare users for the rollout and training?
<P>
<LI>Does
the training help users learn what they need to know?
<P>
<LI>Are
the content, timing, and sequence of topics in the training materials
appropriate?
<P>
<LI>Is the documentation useful during
and after training?
<P>
<LI>Do we provide enough desk&#173;side
and help desk support?
<P>
<LI>Are any of the questions
that users ask during or after training surprising?
<P>
<LI>Is
the customization of the software well received, functional, without
error?
<P>
<LI>Do related procedures, such as procedures
for offline users, work?
<P>
</UL>
<P>
Select a pilot rollout group that is enthusiastic about Office,
willing to provide constructive feedback, and able to start using
Office immediately after their training. Inform the pilot
group that you expect feedback in the areas of promotion of Office,
documentation, training, and support. Consider techniques for
encouraging feedback, such as giving free entertainment software
for home use and a vacation day to the three people who provide
the most suggestions used in the rollout.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4><B><A NAME="CH008H210">Measure Your Success</A></B></FONT>

<P>
<a name="dex36"></a>
<P>
The best way to gauge success in your transition to Office is to observe people in your organization. Are employees using
Office effectively in their jobs? Are they asking thoughtful
questions? Are they finding answers by using resources you have
provided?
<P>
Based on the feedback from your trainers, support staff, and pilot
rollout participants, adjust the documentation and promotion of
Office and the training and support plans. Review communication
among all teams involved in the pilot rollout, and make adjustments
for the rollout. Finally, update all members of the training and
support teams, so they are ready for the rollout.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4><B><A NAME="CH008H211">Implement the Training Plan During the
Office</A> Rollout</B></FONT>

<P>
<a name="dex37"></a>
<P>
Four or more weeks after you run the pilot rollout, the rollout
of Office begins. The rollout may take weeks, months,
or years, depending on the size of your organization. Ease into
the rollout by starting gradually with the training and support
programs.
<P>
For example, if you plan to use four classrooms during the rollout,
start with one classroom and gradually increase to four classrooms
over the next eight weeks. This gradual ramp&#173;up period allows
the installation, training, and support teams to further prepare
to support many new users of Office. Ramping up gradually
also allows you time to respond and to modify the system and training
plan as needed. If the rollout is longer than three months, schedule
two&#173;week breaks between groups, so that the installation,
training, and support teams remain fresh.
<P>
If your organization is undertaking a big change, such as a transition
from WordPerfect or Lotus SmartSuite, be prepared for resistance
among users. The training and support teams need to keep morale
high and help users build confidence in mastering the new tools.
They also must help users and managers develop realistic expectations
regarding the learning curve during the transition.
<P>
It is a good idea to review all migration training plans four
weeks into the rollout and to finalize the training plans in light
of what you learn along the way. Be flexible and recognize that
new developments may require revising the training plan as well
as notifying those users who have already been trained. Such modifications,
although not desirable, are in the best interest of a successful
transition to Office.
<P>
After your organization gets started using Office, you
can begin planning the ongoing training program. It is likely
that your internal resources can create and manage this program,
based on their experiences during the transition. The migration
training program, combined with the ongoing training program,
is the best means for getting the most out of your investment
in Office.
