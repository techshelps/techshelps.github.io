This chapter describes how to migrate from other applications,
such as WordPerfect and Lotus&nbsp;1&#173;2&#173;3, to Microsoft
Office. As an administrator, you probably want to take full advantage
of your investment in Office with minimal disruption to your organization.
This chapter helps to prepare your organization for Office, and
helps you install the new software with as little disruption as
possible.
<P>
<FONT COLOR="#0000FF" SIZE=2><B>Note&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</B></FONT>Some
of the information in this chapter is similar to that in Chapter&nbsp;3,
"<a href="003.htm">Deployment

a comprehensive description of migration issues for a large organization.
This chapter is written for a smaller organization with a less
formal deployment process. Look at both chapters, and then decide
which information best suits your organization.
<P>

<P>
The process of moving your organization from other applications
to Office begins with the planning phase and ends with a successful implementation of Office. Each step in this process is described in the following table.

You probably know from experience that transitions are easier
when you have a plan. That is why it is important to assess your
situation and determine a plan of action before you make your
move.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><B><A NAME="_Toc361637441">Assessing Your Current Configuration</A>
</B></FONT>

<P>
The first step in building a solid migration plan is to assess
your current environment so you can better plan the actual implementation.
<P>
<B>Hardware</B>

<P>
Is your current operating system suitable for the new Office applications?
<P>
Inventory your existing equipment so you can develop a purchasing
plan if necessary. The inventory should address the following
questions:
<P>
<UL TYPE="square">
<P>
<LI>What kinds of computers
are currently installed?
<P>
<LI>How much memory is
available on each computer?
<P>
<LI>How much disk space

<P>
<B>Existing Applications and Systems</B>

<P>
What important files and programs currently exist in your organization
and how will the move to Office affect them?
<P>
Many of your existing computer files and programs are important
to the day&#173;to&#173;day operations of your organization. A
payroll spreadsheet, an online order form, the sales proposal
creation process, or time and billing tracking are examples of
critical business applications. It is important to identify the
impact that the new software will have on these tasks so that
the transition to Office is a smooth one.
<P>
To identify the files, systems, and tasks important to your organization,
think about the various activities and functions that keep your
organization running. Make sure that you consider all areas of
the company. The following table lists some typical examples.

<P>
Even if you determine that these files and systems are not affected,
the examination process may provide an excellent opportunity to
rethink your existing processes in order to take advantage of
the enhanced capabilities of Office.
<P>
<B>Users' Needs and Abilities</B>

<P>
<a name="dex5"></a>
<P>
What are the computer abilities and expectations of the people
affected by the move to Office? How do people work together and
share information on a day&#173;to&#173;day basis?
<P>
In planning your move to Office, you should:
<P>
<UL TYPE="square">
<P>
<LI>Count the number of people
moving to Office.
<P>
<LI>Map out groups of people who
work together and share files.
<P>
<LI>Identify people
with good computer skills who can be enlisted to help.
<P>
<LI>Identify
people who may need special assistance.
<P>
</UL>
<P>
It is very important to understand the computing abilities and
needs of the people in your organization. First, it helps you
determine how big an effort the move represents. Second, you can
take advantage of existing knowledge in your organization by identifying
people who already know about Office applications from previous
experience&nbsp;&#151; and use these people to train and assist
others in your organization. Third, you can begin to develop a
plan to help beginners who may lack computer experience or who
are afraid of change.
<P>
It is also useful to identify how people in your organization
work together and share files and information. Think about how
to keep them working together during the move to Office, although
switching to Office ultimately reduces incompatibility problems
and allows users to help each other through the transition. Moving
small, manageable groups, instead of all employees at once, also
helps you use your resources more effectively.
<P>
<B><A NAME="_Toc361637445">Work Environment</A></B>

<P>
<a name="dex6"></a>
<P>
What special circumstances exist within your organization that
could affect your move to Office?
<P>
<a name="dex7"></a>
<P>
Every organization has a unique set of constraints. It is important
to identify these in the beginning stages of the move, so that
you can plan around them as necessary. Some examples of these
constraints include:
<P>
<UL TYPE="square">
<P>
<LI>Budget
<P>
If your budget is limited, you may want to look for
lower&#173;priced training options, such as purchasing the Step
by Step series of training materials from Microsoft Press. For
more information, see Appendix&nbsp;E, "<A HREF="appe.htm">Other
Support Resources</A>."
<P>
<LI>Peak busy
periods
<P>
Holiday sales, tax&#173;filing deadlines, or audits
can keep your organization busy enough.
<P>
<LI>Other
project deadlines
<P>
Do not expect people to cooperate with a move to new
software if they are already working unusually long hours on another
special project.
<P>
<LI>Available resources
<P>
If you have very few people within your organization
who can help you with the moving process, you can go to an outside
source. For example, find external consultants and trainers to
help you, or try spending a little extra on training so that people
can better help themselves.

For best results, be sensitive to these constraints and work around
them. Schedule the switch to Office after major holidays, a new
business pitch, or the annual trade show. Avoid overburdening
people whose schedules are already overflowing with other important
commitments.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><B><A NAME="_Toc361637446">Developing a Plan for Your Move</A>
</B></FONT>

<P>
Once you thoroughly understand your current situation, you can
plan for the move. Whether you have 3 people or 300, a plan helps
ensure that the process runs as smoothly as possible. A plan helps
you accomplish what needs to be done, identify how it is going
to get done, determine how long it will take, and make sure that
you do not overlook any details.
<P>
Your plan should:
<P>
<UL TYPE="square">
<P>
<LI>Identify specific tasks
to be completed.
<P>
<LI>Assign responsibility and an
expected start date and end date for each task.
<P>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=4><B><A NAME="CH016H202">Test the New Applications</A></B></FONT>

<P>
<a name="dex8"></a>
<P>
For a better idea of what to expect, test the Office applications
before you install them. In small companies, a test can be as
informal as having someone work with the new software first. In
larger companies, you may want to choose a group of users and
perform a more structured test. A useful test includes converting
important files and applications, training users, and, most importantly,
evaluating the process so you can adjust your plan for the final
installation of Office.
<P>
Conducting a test is a great way to put your implementation plan
into practice. It is important to choose a test situation that
allows you to build on success and gives you a tangible demonstration
of the benefits of Office. Some groups or individuals are better
initial testers than others. Use these tips when selecting the
test group:
<P>
<UL TYPE="square">
<P>
<LI>Select willing participants.
<P>
<LI>Keep
the scope of the test small and manageable; three people is a
good number for a test group. If your organization is very small,
one or two users is sufficient.
<P>
<LI>Do not attempt
the hardest scenario first. Pick a situation of average complexity
for solid proof that the plan works for your organization.
<P>
</UL>
<P>
Once you have completed your test, be sure to solicit feedback
from the test group to determine what went well and what could
be improved. This information helps you modify your plan to be
better prepared when you proceed with the companywide Office installation.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4><B><A NAME="CH016H203">Train</A> New Users</B></FONT>

<P>
<a name="dex9"></a>
<P>
The next step is to train people to use the Office applications.
Fortunately, users of the most common competitive word processing
and spreadsheet software can use much of their existing knowledge
in Office.
<P>
Although the choices and options that each Office application
provides may seem overwhelming at first, most things you learn
for one Office application are applicable to any other Office
application. Shortcut keys, navigational key sequences, buttons
you click and other mouse actions, as well as application menus
and toolbars are all consistent between the Office applications.
Therefore, the time you spend learning one Office application
can be leveraged while learning the next one.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><B><A NAME="_Toc361637449">Training Classes</A></B></FONT>

<P>
<a name="dex10"></a>
<P>
Formal training classes can be a very effective way to get people
up and running quickly on the new software. You can send your
employees to classes held at a professional training center or
find someone to come to your office or even right to your desk.
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2 COLOR="#0000FF">For More Information&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT></B><FONT FACE="VERDANA,ARIAL,HELVETICA" SIZE=2>about
setting up a formal training program for Office, see Chapter&nbsp;8,
"<a href="008.htm">Training
and Support Programs for Microsoft Office</A>."</FONT>
<P>
If you are constrained by a budget and cannot afford classroom
training for everyone, you have other options. You can:
<P>
<UL TYPE="square">
<P>
<LI>Educate users about the
general differences between their old applications and the new
Office applications.
<P>
<LI>Give your most
communicative people formal training and have them teach everyone
else.
<P>
<LI>Strongly encourage people to use the online
Help included in each Office application.
<P>
<LI>Purchase
videos or other ready&#173;made training programs and make them
available for people to use.
<P>
<A NAME="_Toc361637450"></A>
</UL>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><B>Successful Training</B></FONT>

<P>
<a name="dex11"></a>
<P>
Whether you hire a professional to train your employees, train
them with your own resources, or let them learn on their own,
you should consider the following:
<P>
<UL TYPE="square">
<P>
<LI>Provide training that meets
the specific needs of your people.
<P>
Most professional trainers are willing to customize
a course for your needs. For example, if your customer service
or marketing people send out a lot of mailings using mail merge
(form letters), ask the trainer to include a mail merge topic
in the Microsoft Word class.
<P>
<LI>Provide uninterrupted training
and learning time.
<P>
This is especially important if you are asking people
to learn on their own. It is difficult to absorb new material
when constantly interrupted with day&#173;to&#173;day responsibilities.
If your organization cannot afford to lose people to training
during working hours, schedule training before work, after work,
or even on weekends. You can also make equipment available off&#173;hours
for people to learn on their own.
<P>
<LI>Encourage
people to use the new Office software.
<P>
The best way to learn how to use a new application
is to have real work to do. For example, using Word to type an
actual letter to an important client can be a great learning experience.
<P>
<LI>Encourage
on&#173;going training and learning.
<P>
Offer a monthly refresher course or casual meeting
where users can share quick tips and experiences.
<P>
</UL>
<P>
When looking for training help, you should consider using one
of Microsoft's many nationwide training centers. These Authorized
Technical Education Centers (ATECs) are certified by Microsoft
to train users on Office applications and Windows. For more information,
see Appendix&nbsp;E, "<A HREF="appe.htm">Other
Support Resources</A>."
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4><B><A NAME="CH016H204">Convert</A> Existing Files to Office Formats
</B></FONT>

<P>
<a name="dex12"></a>
<P>
The last step before you move your organization to Office is to
prepare your files for the move. Convert the files that you use
on a regular basis to the new software format. Use the following
sequence as a guide:
<P>
<OL>
<P>
<LI>Determine which files you
will need immediately after the move to Office.
<P>
<LI>Back
up these files. This prevents permanent losses if you accidentally
save over or change files during the conversion process.
<P>
<LI>Convert
the files to Office application formats. Office applications include
built&#173;in file converters for most popular software.
<P>
<LI>Check
the converted files to make sure they contain the information
you expected.
<P>
</OL>
<P>
During the conversion process, pay special attention to important
business applications. Make sure that critical business files,
such as a payroll spreadsheet or sales proposal template, are
available and working in the new environment. Test the old applications
you plan to keep using, and convert or develop alternatives for
the rest.
<P>
Test the conversion of files that get updated daily. These are
files that cannot be out of service for any length of time (a
daily telephone log, a daily sales order worksheet, and so forth).
Because these files may be updated while you are in the process
of converting them, test the conversion process ahead of time
and identify any problems that occur. Then convert the most recent
version of the file when you are ready.
<P>
If you have large libraries of files to convert to Microsoft Excel
or Word format, you can use the batch conversion tools included
in both programs. If you are converting files for Excel
format, use the File Conversion Wizard. If you are converting
documents to Word format, use the Conversion Wizard.
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2 COLOR="#0000FF">For More Information&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT></B><FONT FACE="VERDANA,ARIAL,HELVETICA" SIZE=2>about
converting to Excel format, see Chapter&nbsp;18, "<a href="018.htm">Switching
to Microsoft Excel</A>." For more information about
converting to Word format, see Chapter&nbsp;21, "<a href="021.htm">Switching
to Microsoft Word</A>."</FONT>
<P>
Most remaining files can and should be converted by the file owners
themselves. Usually this requires little more than opening them
in the new Office application and then saving them in the new
format.
<P>
Finally, record the conversion process. Think about how to best
use what you have learned and pass it on to others. You may want
to write up some tip sheets or hold an informal breakfast or lunch
meeting after people are up and running to discuss your findings.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4><B><A NAME="CH016H205">Distribute</A> Office Throughout Your

<P>
<a name="dex13"></a>
<P>
At this point in the move, you should have a good understanding
of your organization's environment and have made plans for dealing
with important files and applications. Some files are already

<P>
It is useful to centralize the installation process by assigning
someone to be responsible for performing all of the individual
installations in your organization. This technique ensures that
everyone receives the new software as planned. Some tips for this
approach are:
<P>
<UL TYPE="square">
<P>
<LI>Schedule a specific day
and time for each installation
<P>
This eliminates surprises and ensures access to the
desk and computer at a specified time.
<P>
<LI>Avoid
surprising people
<P>
People returning from vacation or illness may not
react favorably to an unexpected installation of new software.
<P>
<LI>Be
flexible within reason
<P>
Reschedule as necessary to accommodate busy users,
but do not let anyone put off upgrading for too long.

<P>
During Office Setup, you can choose a Typical (Windows) or Easy (Macintosh) installation of
the most commonly used Office features and components, or a Custom
installation that lets you select exactly which features and components
you need. You should perform a test installation so you can evaluate
these options rather than experimenting at someone's desk. You
may also want to record the installation options you select so
you can refer to them during subsequent installations.

If there is a LAN already in place in your organization, you may
want to consider running the Office applications from the network
instead of running them on individual computers. The following
table lists the advantages and disadvantages of running applications
from of a network.

You can also choose a mixed environment: Furnish individual copies
of Office applications to those who use them most, and provide
access over the network to more casual users.

Even if you decide to run your applications locally, you can use
the network to install the software on individual computers. There
are several significant benefits of using the network to install
software:
<P>
<UL TYPE="square">
<P>
<LI>A network installation may
be faster, since several users can install applications at the
same time.
<P>
<LI>A network installation is easier
to maintain. If there are any upgrades to the software, you can
place a copy of the new software in the shared folder, and all
users can be certain they are installing the most current version.

Once software is installed, files are converted, and people are
trained, the next major goal is to get past the transition phase
and return to business as usual. Some tips for quickly restoring
order include:
<P>
<UL TYPE="square">
<P>
<LI>Encouraging people to use
their Office applications to do their daily work.
<P>
Practice makes perfect, and it is always easier to
learn by doing.
<P>
<LI>Encouraging people to help and
support each other.
<P>
Working together and sharing experiences are great
way for employees to raise their comfort level.
<P>
<LI>Providing
access to experts.
<P>
If you have in&#173;house experts, or people you think
can become experts, designate them as a resource available to
others. Sometimes people appreciate the recognition and overlook
the fact that they now have more work to do! Other options are
to hire an expert (sometimes a college intern works out well)
or to subscribe to one of Microsoft's telephone support services.
<P>
<LI>Establish
and communicate an end date.
<P>
Set a finite amount of time for users to get through
the transition period. Limit training to a reasonable period of
time.

After completing the previous five steps, your organization should
be well on its way to greater productivity and efficiency. To
fully realize your investment, however, you should tap into the
new power available with Office. Here are some ideas to consider:
<P>
<UL TYPE="square">
<P>
<LI>Make sure you are using
the right tool for each task.
<P>
For example, many people know only word processing.
Heavy statistical typing may be better accomplished in Excel.
<P>
<LI>Encourage employees to generate new ideas
about how to use the new applications to work even more effectively.
<P>
If you have an e&#173;mail system or public folders,
communicate best practices as they emerge within your organization.
<P>
<LI>Develop
some custom applications.
<P>
Turn some paper&#173;based forms into Word templates
or Microsoft Outlook forms. Develop some Excel macros to automate tasks.

in Microsoft Office</A>."</FONT>
<P>
If you do not know enough yet to be able to dream up new ways
that Office can help your organization, consultants can be very
useful in giving you some new ideas. Low&#173;cost sources of
new ideas include local user group meetings, as well as Microsoft
electronic forums on CompuServe; MSN, The Microsoft Network; or
the World Wide Web.
