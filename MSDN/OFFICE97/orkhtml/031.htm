<P>
The most common group scheduling activity is browsing free and
busy information to find an available time for a group of users
to meet.
<P>
<FONT COLOR="#0000FF" SIZE=2><B>Note&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</B></FONT><I>Free/busy
status</I> refers to the format displaying the user's time as free,
busy, out&#173;of&#173;office, or tentative. This information
is published in a common file format on the server. <I>Free/busy
details</I> include appointment specifics such as subject or meeting
location. To see free/busy details, a user must be granted permission
to open another user's Calendar.
<P>
<a name="dex2"></a>
<P>
Outlook users publish their free/busy status using the <B>Advanced
Scheduling</B> command on the <B>Calendar</B> tab in the <B>Options</B>
dialog box (<B>Tools</B> menu). To view other users' unpublished
free/busy status, Outlook users must open another user's Calendar
(with appropriate permission).
<P>
<FONT COLOR="#0000FF" SIZE=2><B>Note&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</B></FONT>Unless
noted otherwise, all references to Schedule+ refer to both Schedule+
95 and Schedule+ 1.0.
<P>
For workgroups using a combination of Outlook and Schedule+, Outlook
differs slightly from Schedule+ in how it handles unpublished
free/busy status. When a Schedule+ user chooses not to publish
free/busy status, other Schedule+ users who have at least read
permission for that user's schedule can still view the free/busy
status in their Meeting Planners. However, when an Outlook user
chooses not to publish free/busy status, other Outlook users&nbsp;&#151;
even those who have read&#173;only permission&nbsp;&#151;
cannot view the user's free/busy status in their Meeting Planners.
Schedule+ users cannot see Outlook users' unpublished free/busy
status, even if the Outlook Calendar is shared.

<B>Managing Scheduling Data with Microsoft Exchange Server</B>
<P>
For Outlook clients who use Microsoft Exchange Server, free/busy
status and free/busy details are stored in a hidden public folder
on the server. Within a single site (<I>intrasite</I>),
this public folder may be replicated to load balance the queries
to the free/busy information. When the free/busy folder is replicated,
network traffic is reduced, especially when a large number of
users are connecting to Microsoft Exchange Server.
<P>
You can also replicate the free/busy folder between two Microsoft
Exchange Server computers located across a remote link. This reduces
the total traffic across the link and improves performance when
users read or write remote schedule data.

<FONT SIZE=4><B><A NAME="CH031H202">Scheduling Resources</A></B></FONT>

<P>
With Outlook, you can plan schedules not only for workgroup users
but also for resources such as conference rooms and AV equipment.
This feature makes it easy for everyone in a workgroup to see
when resources are available and to reserve the resources in advance.
Users can include the resources, along with other attendees, in
a meeting request. You can configure each resource account to
accept or reject meeting requests automatically, or you can have
requests for several resources handled by a single delegate.
<P>
<a name="dex4"></a>
<P>
To set up a resource on Outlook, first create an e&#173;mail account
for each resource, just as you would for a workgroup member. If
a delegate is assigned for a resource, you can configure the resource
account so that users send meeting requests directly to the delegate.
<P>
Unlike Schedule+ resource accounts, Outlook resource accounts
cannot be booked directly. To set up automatic booking of Outlook
resource accounts, you must configure the resource account so
that Outlook automatically responds when meeting requests are
delivered to the Inbox. To do this, you must have Outlook running
on a computer and logged on to the resource account.
<P>
If you want to centralize booking of several resources, you can
assign a single delegate to multiple resource accounts and then
configure the delegate to respond to meeting requests automatically.
All meeting requests sent to the resources are forwarded to the
delegate for processing. The advantage to this method is that
only one computer is required to handle multiple resources. For
example, you can set up a dedicated computer, with Outlook logged
on to the delegate account, to handle the booking of several conference
rooms at once.

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#0000FF" SIZE=2><B>Note&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</B></FONT>This
Outlook feature requires that you use Microsoft Exchange Server
mail system.
<P>
<a name="dex7"></a>
<P>
When you set up Outlook as a workgroup client for Microsoft Exchange
Server, you can set up public folders for users to share information.
Outlook has built&#173;in Calendar, Contacts, and Tasks modules
that can be customized for workgroups to share details such as
company schedules and holidays, employee and customer lists, and
project task lists. Public folders can also be set up for users
to participate in online conversations, to post information or
documents in a bulletin board format, or to collect a list of
shared World Wide Web sites.
<P>
You can develop custom views and forms for public folders to create
custom applications. You can also give public folder users permission
to do this. For more information about creating forms for custom
applications, see <I>Building Microsoft Outlook&nbsp;97 Applications</I>, published by Microsoft Press and available
wherever computer books are sold. For more information about Microsoft
Press, see Appendix&nbsp;E, "<A HREF="appe.htm">Other Support Resources</A>."
<P>
The list of available public folders appears in the Outlook Folder
List and in the Microsoft Exchange Server Administrator program.
Users are not required to know the name or location of the server
where public folder data is stored. If they have permission, other
Microsoft clients (such as Microsoft Exchange Client) running
under different operating systems can also use these public folders.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4><B><A NAME="CH031H203">Setting Up Public Folders</A></B></FONT>

<P>
As the workgroup administrator, you use the Microsoft Exchange
Server Administrator program and the Outlook client to set up
public folders for users in your workgroup. If you grant some
or all of the users permission, they can share the task of creating
the public folders. If you work in a large organization or expect
heavy use of public folders, you might want to create public folder
replicas on additional servers to distribute the user load, and set up a replication schedule to keep all public folder information
up to date.
<P>
Follow these general steps to set up public folders:
<P>
<OL>
<P>
<LI>Determine how the public
folders will be used in your organization. Consider the number
of users, servers needed, and whether you need to tightly control
public folder creation or permit users to share this task.
<P>
<LI>Configure
a Microsoft Exchange Server computer to have a public information
store.
<P>
The public information store can be on a dedicated
public folder server or on a server that also contains a private
information store.
<P>
<LI>Use the Administrator program
to set up the public folder hierarchy and public folder age and
size limits, storage warnings, and access.
<P>
<LI>Use
Outlook to create public folders, set permissions levels, and
create rules and views for items in the public folders.
<P>

necessary, create public folder replicas on additional servers
and set up a replication schedule.

In an organization that has many public folders, it can be awkward
for users to navigate to the folders they want to use, especially
if the folders are deep in the Folder List hierarchy. To simplify
finding a public folder, users can keep frequently used folders
in the Public Folders Favorites folder. When you create public
folders, you can distribute shortcuts easily by sending a message
that contains public folder shortcuts to users who have permission
to use them.

<P>
When users add a public folder shortcut to the Public Folders
Favorites folder, subfolders in that folder are not available
when they use the shortcut. To make sure that subfolders are available
from shortcuts in the Public Folders Favorites folder, have users
create individual shortcuts for each subfolder they want to open

Depending on the permissions you grant, administrators and users
can control access to public folders. Folder access can be controlled
at any point in the folder hierarchy. Permissions are grouped
into predefined roles, or sets of activities, that can be performed
in the folder. For example, the editor role permits users to read,
create, edit, and delete any item in the folder, but not to create
subfolders.

By default, users can view the contents of the Public Folders

the contents of a public folder or any of its subfolders, you

for a folder prevents the user from opening the folder or any
of its subfolders in the Folder List.

<FONT SIZE=5><B><A NAME="CH031H103">Extended Task Management Capabilities with Microsoft Team Manager</A></B></FONT>
<MENU><MENU>

<a name="dex16"></a>
<P>
The Microsoft Team Manager program extends the task management
capabilities of Outlook. Team Manager is a team activity manager
that makes it possible for a workgroup to assign, track, and consolidate
tasks. When Team Manager is used with Outlook, team members use
the Tasks folder in Outlook to receive, view, and update team
tasks. Outlook also serves as the messaging client through which
team members send and receive task information.
<P>
<a name="dex17"></a>
<P>
You can use Team Manager in your workgroup to extend task management
features in Outlook in the following ways:
<P>
<UL TYPE="square">
<P>
<LI>Report on the progress of
more than one task at a time.
<P>
Managers and team members can send lists of task information
to each other.
<P>
<LI>Send regular status reports to
a manager.
<P>
Team Manager automatically consolidates status information
from the entire team in one status report in the manager's team
file.
<P>
<LI>Permit both the manager and team member
to change a task.
<P>
For example, the manager can change the due date for
an assigned task, and the team member can accept or reject the
change.
<P>
<LI>View a read&#173;only team file of tasks
to see the status for everyone on the team and to see how individual
tasks fit into the team's work.
<P>
This read&#173;only view is also a place for anyone
on the team to experiment with schedule changes. For example,
a team member can see what effect a different set of dates would
have on other team members' tasks, without making permanent changes
to the team file.
<P>
<A NAME="CH031H206"></A>
</UL>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4><B>Setting Up Team Manager</B></FONT>

<P>
<a name="dex18"></a>
<P>
Team Manager has two Setup options. Managers use the manager Setup
option, and team members use the team member Setup option. Even
though team members track tasks in Outlook, team member Setup
is required. Users who function both as managers and as team members
must use both Setup options.
<P>
When users install Team Manager, they must choose a messaging
option. If managers and team members are not all using Outlook
as a messaging client, managers can set up a shared folder or
directory on the network to send messages to and receive messages
from team members. Users who function both as managers and as
team members must choose the same messaging option for manager
and team member Setup options. If your workgroup needs to switch
to another messaging option (for example, if you are switching
from network messages to Microsoft Exchange Server with Outlook
as a client), users must reinstall Team Manager with the new messaging
option.
<P>
<FONT COLOR="#0000FF" SIZE=2><B>Note&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</B></FONT>For
more information about how to install Team Manager, how to set
up a team file, and how to create and update tasks using Team
Manager, see your Microsoft Team Manager documentation.
<P>
The following commands are added to the Outlook <B>Tasks</B> menu
when Team Manager is installed using the team member Setup option:
<P>
<UL TYPE="square">
<P>
<LI><B>Team Manager for team members</B>
<P>
This command starts the Team Manager for team members
utility, so that users can get additional details about team tasks
and perform activities such as switching to another team file
if they work on tasks for more than one team.
<P>
<LI><B>Send Updates</B>
<P>
This command opens the appropriate form to send task
update information or a status report to the manager. Task updates
integrate with the manager's team task list. A status report is
the team member's written account of progress.
<P>
<LI><B>View Team Status</B>
<P>
This command opens a read&#173;only version of the
team file.
<P>
<A NAME="CH031H207"></A>
</UL>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4><B>Switching from Schedule+ to Outlook to View Team Tasks</B></FONT>

<P>
<a name="dex19"></a>
<P>
Team Manager can integrate with task lists in either Schedule+
or Outlook. If your workgroup is switching from Schedule+ to Outlook,
users must import their Schedule+ files into Outlook to keep team
tasks synchronized between Team Manager and Outlook.
<P>
When users switch from Schedule+ to Outlook, they may need to
set Team Manager to synchronize tasks with Outlook instead of
Schedule+.

<P>
<B>Task Priorities</B>
<P>
Tasks are prioritized differently in Schedule+, Outlook, and Team
Manager.
<P>
<UL TYPE="square"><LI>Schedule+: Tasks are prioritized from 1 to
9, A to Z, or A1 to Z9. Priority&nbsp;1 is the highest priority.
Priority 3 is the default.
<P>
<LI>Outlook: Tasks are prioritized
as High, Normal, or Low.
<P>
<LI>Team Manager: Tasks are prioritized
as Highest, Very High, High, Medium High, Medium, Medium Low,
Low, Very Low, and Lowest.
<P>
</UL>
<P>
When you import or synchronize tasks between programs, priorities
may change. Schedule+ tasks imported into Outlook are prioritized
as follows:
<UL TYPE="square">
<P>
<LI>1 = High
<P>
<LI>5 = Low
<P>
<LI>2&nbsp;&#150;&nbsp;4 and 6&nbsp;&#150;&nbsp;9 = Normal
<P>
</UL>
<P>
When Outlook tasks are synchronized with Team Manager, Normal
priority tasks appear as Medium priority tasks in Team Manager.
