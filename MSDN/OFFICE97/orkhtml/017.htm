<P>
Most users in your organization are probably already experienced
with database management systems. They understand the basic concepts,
the steps used to create tables, and how to create databases for
different purposes. For users who are converting their files to
Access, this section introduces Access and
some of its basic features&nbsp;&#151; such as single&#173;file
architecture, database objects, and documentation.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4><B><A NAME="CH017H201">Single File Architecture</A></B></FONT>

<P>
<a name="dex1"></a>
<P>
Most database management systems, including dBASE and Paradox,
store individual database components, such as database files (tables),
reports, and forms, in separate MS&#173;DOS&#173;based files.
A complete application may consist of hundreds of individual files.
<P>
<a name="dex2"></a>
<P>
An Access database, by contrast, is a collection of objects
(tables, queries, forms, reports, macros, and modules) stored
in a single file with the .mdb file name extension. When you open
an Access database, you also open all the tools that
help you use information stored in the database.
<P>
<FONT COLOR="#0000FF" SIZE=2><B>Note&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</B></FONT>Although
an Access database can contain all your objects, you
can also work with objects that are stored in separate databases.
For example, you can store tables in one database and forms and
reports in another database. For more information, see "<a href="029.htm#CH029H212">Splitting
a Database into a Front-end/Back-end Application</A>"
in Chapter&nbsp;29, "Workgroup Features in Microsoft Access."
<P>
<a name="dex3"></a>
<P>
Like other common database management systems, such as dBASE and
Paradox, Access is a <I>relational database management system</I>. To efficiently and accurately provide you with information, a relational database needs facts about different subjects stored in separate tables.
<P>
For example, you may have one table that stores only facts about
employees, and another that stores only facts about orders. When
you define relationships between these tables, Access
uses the relationships to find associated information stored in
your database. Using this example, you might define a relationship
between the Employees and Orders tables, so that you can associate
an employee with each order. For more information about relationships,
see "<A HREF="#DefRelAcc">Defining Relationships in Microsoft Access</A>" later
in this chapter.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4><B><A NAME="CH017H202">Database Objects</A></B></FONT>

<P>
<a name="dex4"></a>
<P>
An Access database is made up of different types of objects:
tables, queries, forms, reports, macros, and modules.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><B>Tables</B></FONT>

<P>
<a name="dex5"></a>
<P>
Tables are the basis of any database application. A table is a
collection of related data, or <I>records</I>. Each table column represents a <I>field</I>, and each row represents a <I>record</I>. Access tables are not stored in separate files but are all included in the Access MDB file. You need at least one table in a database. You define relationships between tables in the Relationships window&nbsp;&#151; there is no need for separate index files, such as the NDX files in dBASE.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><B>Queries</B></FONT>

<P>
<a name="dex6"></a>
<P>
A <I>query</I> is a question about the data stored
in tables. You use queries to select or to perform an action on
a subset of data. For example, you could design a query that returns
only customers from New York. A query can bring together data
from multiple tables&nbsp;&#151; it returns a set of records
that is actually a view into the underlying tables. These sets
of records can be updatable or read&#173;only. If updatable, the
resulting data can be added to, changed, or deleted as with any
other table.
<P>
For example, you can run a query with a linked table from dBASE,
several Access tables, and a linked table from Paradox,
and then update the results. Access makes your changes
in all the underlying tables in the query. For information about
linked tables, see "<A HREF="#ImpLinkTabl">Importing and Linking External Tables</A>"
later in this chapter.
<P>
<a name="dex7"></a>
<P>
You can incorporate queries in your application as a substitute
for programming. For example, you can use queries to perform any
of the following data update tasks:
<P>
<UL TYPE="square">
<P>
<LI>Update a field in a specified
subset of records to a new value.
<P>
You can specify the value when you design the query,
provide the value by using a field on a form, or use a field value
from a table or query. This kind of query is called an <I>update
query</I>.
<P>
<LI>Delete a specified subset of records.
<P>
You can determine the scope of records to be deleted
by specifying criteria when you design the query, by providing
the value of a field on a form, or by using a field value from
a table or query. This kind of query is called a <I>delete query</I>.
<P>
<LI>Add
records to a table.
<P>
This kind of query is called an <I>append query</I>.
<P>
<LI>Create a new table based on another table or a set of related tables.
<P>
This kind of query is called a <I>make&#173;table query</I>.
<P>
</UL>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><B>Forms</B></FONT>

<P>
<a name="dex8"></a>
<P>
Access forms are generally based on data from tables
or queries. By using forms, you can view, enter, change, and print
data. In an Access form, you can display data, pictures,
graphs, and documents that you are tracking. Using forms to go
from one table (for example, Customers) to another (for example,
Orders) can be as easy as clicking a button.
<P>
You can create forms on your own, or you can have Access
do it for you by using one of the Form Wizards. The Form Wizards
speed up the process of creating forms by doing all the basic
work for you. When you use a Form Wizard, Access prompts
you for information and creates a form based on your answers.
You can also create a new default form with one click of your
mouse by using the AutoForm Wizard. After you have created a form,
you can view it in Form view or Datasheet view. Form view displays
all the values for one record; Datasheet view displays multiple
records in a tabular format.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><B>Reports</B></FONT>

<P>
<a name="dex9"></a>
<P>
You can use reports to display information from tables and queries
in a way that may be more meaningful and readable than just looking
at a series of records in a table. <FONT COLOR="#000000">Making
a quick report</FONT> is easy in Access. You can create
most reports by using the Report Wizard. The Report Wizard can
automatically create logical groups of data (for example, orders
grouped by customer number); totals (for example, the total number
of orders for all customers); and subtotals (for example, the
total number of orders for each customer). You can add text, data,
pictures, lines, boxes, and graphs to your reports.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><B>Macros</B></FONT>

<P>
<a name="dex10"></a>
<P>
You can use macros to automate repetitive tasks and to extend
the capabilities of a database. A macro automatically carries
out a command or series of commands, called <I>actions</I>,
for you. To create a macro, you can select from a list of actions.
The macro carries out the actions in the order they are listed,
by using the objects or data you have specified for the action
arguments. This is an easy way to do point&#173;and&#173;click
programming. You can link a macro to a button or to an event such
as the closing of a form or report. You may find that you can
meet all of your application's programming needs by using macros.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><B>Modules</B></FONT>

<P>
<a name="dex11"></a>
<P>
You use modules for advanced programming tasks, such as implementing
error handling or creating your own functions. For example, you
may want to create a user&#173;defined function that calculates
market projections or that masks error messages. Microsoft Visual Basic
for Applications code (procedures, functions, public variables,
and so on) resides in modules. Use modules when the actions you
want your application to perform cannot be carried out by a simple
query or macro.

<P>
<B>Which Database Object Should I Use For a Task?</B>
<P>
Access provides several ways to get information from
a database. The type of database object you use depends on the
task you want to perform. For example:
<UL TYPE="square">
<P>
<LI>To view all of the products that a particular
vendor supplies, or that are out of stock or on order, use a query.
<P>
<LI>To view all of the information about a particular product, customer,
or supplier at once, use a form.
<P>
<LI>To organize and print product sales for a formal presentation, use a report.
<P>
<LI>To automate tasks, such as using a button to open a form or to carry
out a menu command or series of menu commands each time a database
opens, use a macro. You can also create buttons with the Command
Button Wizard.
<P>
<LI>To write specialized routines that give your application greater functionality, use a module that contains Visual Basic code.
</UL>
</FONT></TD></TR>
</TABLE>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><B>Database Window</B></FONT>

<P>
<a name="dex13"></a>
<P>
You use the Database window to view all of the database objects
in MDB files&nbsp;&#151; it is your control center for working
with a database. You can use the tabs on the top of the Database
window to work with a specific type of Access object.
The following illustration shows the Access Database window.
<P>
<IMG SRC="01701.gif">
<P>
In Access, you can give tables and other objects longer,
more descriptive names than those permitted by some other database
management systems. For example, you can name a table Order Details
instead of ORDERDET, or you can name a field within a table Quarterly
Results instead of abbreviating it as required in dBASE and many
MS&#173;DOS&#173;based database programs.
<P>
<a name="dex14"></a>
<P>
If you plan to use Visual Basic to work with data, however, it
is easier to refer to the names of objects in the database if
their names are relatively short and have no spaces in them. Longer
names require more typing, and names with spaces require you to
surround them with brackets&nbsp;&#151; for example, <FONT SIZE=2 FACE="COURIER NEW,COURIER">dbs.TableDefs![Quarterly
Results]</FONT>. As an alternative to longer object names,
you can enter a description for an object by right&#173;clicking
the object in the Database window and then clicking <B>Properties</B>.
<P>
By using the <B>View</B> menu, you can display large or small
icons beside the object names in the Database window. You can
also list objects by name and details. The details are the properties
of the object: object description, date modified, date created,
and object type. Each detail appears in a separate column that
you can resize to hide or show more of the information. You can
also sort objects to display them in a different order.
<P>
<a name="dex15"></a>
<P>
The Database window supports a number of drag&#173;and&#173;drop
features. You can:
<P>
<UL TYPE="square">
<P>
<LI>Drag a table, query, form, report, or macro to the Windows desktop to create a shortcut for opening that object without starting Access first.
<P>
<LI>Drag tables and queries from the Database window to Microsoft Excel or Microsoft Word to copy that data onto a worksheet or into a
document.
<P>
<LI>Drag Excel worksheet cells to the Database window to create new tables.
<P>
</UL>
<P>
You can also copy and paste data between applications by using
the <B>Copy</B> and <B>Paste</B> commands (<B>Edit</B> menu).
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><B><A NAME="CrNewObj">Creating New Objects</A></B></FONT>

<P>
<a name="dex16"></a>
<P>
To create a new database object, click the appropriate tab in
the Database window (<B>Tables</B>, <B>Queries</B>, <B>Forms</B>,
and so on), and then click the <B>New</B> button on the right
side of the Database window. For example, to create a new query,
click the <B>Queries</B> tab and then click <B>New</B>. Alternatively,
you can click the <B>New Object</B> button on the <B>Database</B>
toolbar and then select the type of object you want to create.
<P>
When creating new tables, queries, forms, and reports, you can
use a wizard or you can create a blank object. Wizards are useful
for creating anything from simple to complex objects and for learning
about Access. As you become more familiar with 
Access and want to customize tables or other objects, you may
want to start from scratch or use a wizard, and then make modifications in Design view.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><B>Working with Existing Objects</B></FONT>

<P>
To work with an existing object, click the appropriate tab in
the Database window, click the object, and then choose how you
want to work with that object by using the buttons on the right
side of the Database window or a button on the toolbar. The following
sections describe the most common actions you can perform on database
objects.
<P>
<B>Working with Data in Tables, Queries, and Forms</B>

<P>
<a name="dex17"></a>
<P>
To work with the data in a table, query, or form, double&#173;click
the name of the object in the Database window, or select the object
in the Database window and click <B>Open</B>. You can then view,
enter, or modify the data. A table or query always appears as
a <I>datasheet</I>, which displays data in rows and
columns much like a spreadsheet. A form opens by default in Form
view, but you can switch to Datasheet view if you prefer.

Macros are usually linked to a button, linked to a custom menu
option, or triggered by an event in a form or report; however,
you can also run a macro directly from the Database window. To
do this, double&#173;click the name of the macro in the Database
window, or select the macro in the Database window and click <B>Run</B>.
<P>
<B>Changing the Design of an Existing Object</B>

<P>
<a name="dex19"></a>
<P>
To open an object in Design view, select the object name in the
Database window and click <B>Design</B>. In Design view, you can
make changes to the design of tables, queries, and forms. For
example, you can change colors and add sound clips, command buttons,
subforms, drop&#173;down list boxes, and so on. You can change
the design of reports by adding pictures, changing fonts, sizing
column widths, and so on. You can also change macros or modules.
<P>
<B>Switching Between Views of Objects</B>

<P>
<a name="dex20"></a>
<P>
To switch between views of objects, click the arrow to the right
of the <B>View</B> button on the toolbar, and then click the view
you want. The following illustration shows the <B>View</B> button
and the available views.
<P>
<IMG SRC="01702.gif">
<P>
<B>Using the Object&#173;Specific Menus and Toolbars</B>

<P>
The commands available on the menu bar and toolbar vary depending
on the database object you are working with and the view in which
it is displayed. In Access, you can have many objects
open at once. The menu bar and toolbar commands that are available
correspond to the object that is currently selected. A different
set of commands is available when the Database window is selected.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4><B><A NAME="CH017H203">More About Microsoft Access</A></B></FONT>

<P>
<a name="dex21"></a>
<P>
You can learn more about how to use Access by working
with the sample applications and by reading the documentation
included with Access.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><B>Microsoft Access Sample Applications</B></FONT>

<P>
<a name="dex22"></a>
<P>
One of the easiest ways to produce a new database object is to
copy one that resembles what you want. The sample databases included
with Access&nbsp;&#151; which you can find in the
Samples folder in the Program Files\Microsoft Office\Office folder&nbsp;&#151;
provide examples of typical business databases.
<P>
As you browse through the objects in these applications, you can
copy any of them by selecting the name in the Database window
and clicking <B>Copy</B> (<B>Edit</B> menu). Then close the sample
database, open your own application, click the appropriate tab
in the Database window, and click <B>Paste</B> (<B>Edit</B> menu).
If you copy a table, you can modify the field definitions, remove
its data, and type or paste your own data into it. If you copy
a form or report, you can change the <B>RecordSource</B> property
to point to the table or query you want to use and change the
field references.

When you convert to Access from another database management
system, the first step is to bring external data into 
Access by either importing or linking it. Once you have imported
or linked the tables that contain the data, you can specify a
primary key for each of the tables, create any indexes you want,
and define the relationships between the tables. Then you can
proceed with creating the other database objects that make up
your Access application.
<P>
The transition to Access cannot always be accomplished
in one step. Your organization may be so large that you need to
convert in phases. This chapter, therefore, describes both the
complete transition of organizations to Access, and
the sharing of database resources between those who have converted
to Access and those still using another database management
system.
<P>
This chapter is a starting point in the transition process and
offers guidance and information specific to the transition. Many
references to other sources are included that can provide further
assistance. Foremost among these is the documentation that accompanies
Access.

<a name="dex25"></a>
<P>
When you convert to Access, you typically want to use
existing data from external data sources such as database files,
spreadsheets, text files, and Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)
files. To use external data in your Access application,
you can either import or link the data. To successfully import
and link data in spreadsheets, text files, or HTML files, the
data must be in tabular format.
<P>
Access can import or link data from the following formats
and applications:
<P>
<UL TYPE="square">
<P>
<LI>dBASE&nbsp;III, dBASE&nbsp;III+,
dBASE&nbsp;IV, and dBASE version&nbsp;5.0
<P>
<LI>Microsoft
FoxPro versions 2.<I>x</I> and 3.0 (import only for 3.0)
<P>
<LI>Paradox versions 3.<I>x</I>, 4.<I>x</I>, and 5.0
<P>
<LI>Applications that supply 32&#173;bit Open Database Connectivity (ODBC) drivers
<P>
For example, SQL databases such as Microsoft SQL Server,
Sybase SQL Server, and Oracle Server. (The ODBC driver for Microsoft
SQL is available when you install Access.)
<P>
<LI>Databases that use the Microsoft Jet database engine, such as those created with Visual Basic, Microsoft Visual C++, or Excel
<P>
This includes databases created in previous versions of Access.
<P>
<LI>Delimited and fixed&#173;width text files
<P>
<LI>HTML version&nbsp;1.0 lists; HTML versions 2.0 and 3.<I>x</I> lists and tables
<P>
<LI>Lotus 1&#173;2&#173;3 WKS, WK1, WK3, and WK4 formats
<P>
<LI>Excel versions 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 95, and 97
<P>
<LI>Microsoft Exchange and Microsoft Outlook data (collectively referred to
as Microsoft Windows Messaging Service data). Linked data in this

To gain access to data from external data sources, the Microsoft
Jet database engine, which is used by Access, uses one
of several installable ISAM or ODBC drivers. Before you can gain
access to external data, make sure that you have installed the
appropriate drivers. For information about how to install drivers,
see "<A HREF="#CH017H107">Using Built-in Drivers
and ODBC Drivers</A>" later in this chapter.
<P>
Additionally, for each external data source that you want to connect
to using ODBC, you must set up an ODBC data source by using the
ODBC Data Source Administrator. To start the ODBC Data Source
Administrator, double&#173;click the 32&#173;bit ODBC icon in
Control Panel.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><B><A NAME="ImpLinkTabl">Importing and Linking External Tables</A></B></FONT>

<P>
<a name="dex26"></a>
<P>
If you have data in separate data sources, the first step in converting to Access is to make the data available to your Access application. You can do this by importing or linking tables.
If you want to leave the data in its current format, you can link
the tables to an Access database. This way, other users
can still use the tables in the original application. Conversely,
if you plan to use the data only in Access, you can
import the tables.
<P>
If you leave the data in another database or data format and create
linked tables, you can use this data just as you use tables stored
in an Access database. For example, you can edit the
data in linked tables, and you can create queries, forms, and
reports that use the data. You can even combine data in the linked
tables with the data in your Access tables. For example,
you can design a query based on both Access tables and
linked tables. Even though some of the data resides on a different
computer, Access combines the data to answer the query.
<P>
After you link a table from another database, the table icon Access displays in the Database window indicates that the data
in the table is outside of your database&nbsp;&#151; there
is a different icon for tables from each type of data source.
Access stores all the information you supply when linking
the table so it can find the external data whenever you need it.
When you open a linked table, Access opens the appropriate
database file or connection and displays the data. If you delete
the icon in the Database window, you delete the link to the table,
not the external table itself.
<P>
If you plan to use your data only in Access, you should
import the table. Access generally works faster with
its own tables, and you can customize Access tables
to meet your needs.
<P>
Whether you plan to import or <B>link tables</B>, start by clicking the
<B>New Database</B> command (<B>File</B> menu) to create your
Access database. After you have created the new database,
use the <B>Import</B> or <B>Link Tables</B> command (<B>File</B>
menu, <B>Get External Data</B> submenu) to bring your existing
data into the new Access database.
<P>
<a name="dex27"></a>
<P>
The following tips can help you get the most from tables you import
or link:
<P>
<UL TYPE="square">
<P>
<LI>Use long table names
<P>
Access table names are not limited to MS&#173;DOS
file&#173;naming rules. Table names can include spaces as well
as uppercase and lowercase letters. For example, after you import
or link a table called SLSDAT96, you can use the <B>Rename</B> command
(<B>Edit</B> menu) to rename the table Sales Data for&nbsp;1996.
<P>
<LI>Adjust
column widths
<P>
The first time you open a table in Datasheet view,
all the columns have the same width. You can adjust the width
of the columns with the mouse and then save the column&#173;width
settings by clicking the <B>Save</B> command (<B>File</B> menu). The next time
you open the table, the column layout appears the way you left
it.
<P>
<LI>Set field properties
<P>
By setting field properties for a table in Design
view, you can make data easier to work with. For example, you
can specify display formats or validation rules you want Access to use in forms and datasheets.
<P>
<LI>Change
the table structure and set table properties
<P>
When you import your data, you can enhance your tables
by opening each one in Design view and changing the structure
or properties of the table. It is a good idea to make these changes
right away, before you create queries, forms, and reports based
on the tables.
<P>
<LI>Optimize your application
<P>
For information about optimizing Access
databases, see "<a href="007.htm#CH007H206">Optimizing
Microsoft Access</A>" in Chapter&nbsp;7, "Customizing
and Optimizing Microsoft Office."
<P>
</UL>
<P>
<a name="dex28"></a>
<P>
In Access, you can take advantage of the following features
with tables you import, but not with tables you link:
<P>
<UL TYPE="square">
<P>
<LI>Longer field names
<P>
In Access, field names can be up to 64 characters
long and can contain spaces. This gives you much more flexibility
than dBASE, in which field names are limited to 10 characters.
For example, after you import a table from dBASE, you can change
the CUSTADDR field name to Customer Address.
<P>
<LI>Primary
keys
<P>
You can set a primary key that uniquely identifies
each record in the table. If you do not have an appropriate primary
key in your table, you can add a field with the AutoNumber data
type and the <B>NewValues</B> property set to <B>Increment</B> (this is the
default), which automatically assigns a unique sequential number
for each record you add.
<P>
<LI>Indexes
<P>
To speed up operations in fields that you anticipate
searching or sorting often, you can create indexes. Set the <B>Indexed</B>
property of the field to <B>Yes</B>.
<P>
<a name="dex66"></a>
<LI>Relationships
<P>
If you import related tables, you can define relationships
between them that Access uses to relate data in queries,
forms, and reports. If you want, Access can automatically
enforce <I>referential integrity</I> when adding or deleting records
in related tables. Referential integrity ensures that relationships
between records are valid, and that you do not accidentally delete
related data.
<P>
<LI>More data types
<P>
Access provides data types that are not
available in some applications but that may be appropriate for
your data. For example, the Currency data type is ideal for storing
monetary values. After you import a table, you may want to change
the data type of such fields from Number to Currency. The AutoNumber
data type is a good choice for creating primary keys, indexing,
and creating unique relationships if the table does not already
contain a unique value for each record.
<P>
</UL>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><B>Deciding Whether to Import or Link an External Table</B></FONT>

<P>
<a name="dex29"></a>
<P>
Whether you import or link a table depends on whether you will
continue to use the data with the program that originally produced
it. For example, suppose you have a dBASE file that contains a
list of products your company sells. You no longer use dBASE,
and you would like to have this data handy on your computer. In
this case, it makes sense to import the dBASE file into an Access table. To improve the appearance and performance of the
table, you can set a primary key and perhaps change field names
or set other field properties.
<P>
In comparison, suppose your company keeps its sales figures in
a Microsoft SQL Server database on a network. Because you may
use software other than Access to view or edit this
data, you do not want to move it to an Access database.
In this case, it makes sense to link the Sales table and use Access as a front end to your SQL Server database. After you link
the table, you can update the data from Access and print
weekly sales reports.
<P>
If your organization and applications are gradually switching
to Access, first link tables in their current data format,
so you can maintain one master set of data during the transition,
and then import the data after all users and all applications
have switched to Access.
<P>
Even if all users are using Access, you may want to
maintain your data in a separate database as linked tables and
keep your forms, reports, and other objects in their own database.
For more information, see "<a href="029.htm#CH029H212">Splitting
a Database into a Front-end/Back-end Application</A>"
in Chapter&nbsp;29, "Workgroup Features in Microsoft&nbsp;Access."
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><B>Tips for Importing and Linking Data</B></FONT>

<P>
When you import or link a table from another database application,
keep in mind the following:
<P>
<UL TYPE="square">
<P>
<LI>If you import or link a table from a Paradox or an SQL database, you may need to supply a password.
<P>
This password is different from an Access user password; it is the password set in the other application.
<P>
<LI>If you link a table that requires a password, Access stores
this password in your database so you can open the table later
(this is optional for SQL tables).
<P>
For this reason, you may want to add some form of
security to your database to control who can open it. The simplest
form of security is requiring a password to open a database, which
you can set by using the <B>Set Database Password</B> command (<B>Tools</B>
menu, <B>Security</B> submenu). For more information about database passwords,
see "<a href="029.htm#CH029H202">Protecting
File Open with a Database Password</A>" in Chapter&nbsp;29,
"Workgroup Features in Microsoft Access."
<P>
<LI>To link an external table on a network, you must connect to the network and you must have access to the database file.
<P>
If you want Access to automatically connect to the appropriate file server each time you open a linked table, specify the fully qualified network path for the file. For example, if you use a Microsoft Windows&nbsp;NT Server network, you can enter the path to connect to a dBASE file by using the following format: <I>\\server\share\datadir\myfile.dbf</I>
<P>
This format is called the universal naming convention
(UNC) path name and is supported by many networks. When using
this format, you do not need to map a drive letter to a file;
this prevents problems if the drive letter is changed or the database
is moved to a different computer with differently mapped drives.
<P>
<LI>After you import or link an external table, it is a good idea to set table properties in table Design view.
<P>
If you import a table, it is especially important to set a primary key.
<P>
</UL>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4><B><A NAME="CH017H205">Developing Your Application</A></B></FONT>

<P>
<a name="dex30"></a>
<P>
After you import or link your data, you can build the rest of
your Access application. First, you need to refine the
structure of your tables by specifying a primary key for each
table, creating indexes, defining relationships between your tables,
entering validation rules, and establishing referential integrity.
Then you can create queries, forms, and reports that you use to
display and work with your data. To automate tasks and perform
complex operations, write macros and Visual Basic code.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><B><A NAME="DefRelAcc">Defining Relationships in Microsoft Access</A></B></FONT>

<P>
<a name="dex31"></a>
<P>
You create and edit relationships between tables in Access by using the Relationships window. To display the Relationships
window, click the <B>Relationships</B> command (<B>Tools</B> menu).
When you define a relationship in Access, you choose
the fields you want to use to define the relationship between
two tables by dragging a field from one table in the Relationships
window to the appropriate field in the other table. Access displays the kind of relationship it will create. If only one of the related fields is a primary key or unique index, Access creates a one&#173;to&#173;many relationship; if both related
fields are primary keys or unique indexes, Access creates
a one&#173;to&#173;one relationship.
<P>
When you define a relationship, you can specify whether to enforce
referential integrity and whether to allow cascading updates and
cascading deletes. Enforcing referential integrity prevents <I>orphan
records</I> (a master record is deleted when related detail
records still exist in other tables) in your database. For example,
if you select the <B>Enforce Referential Integrity</B> check box
in the <B>Relationships</B> dialog box, no one can enter an order
for a customer that is not in the Customers table or delete a
customer if orders exist for that customer. If you select the
<B>Cascade Update Related Fields</B> or the <B>Cascade Delete
Related Records</B> check box, records that have been edited or
deleted in the primary table are automatically updated in related
tables. You can control how these relationships are maintained
through the Relationships window. The following illustration shows
the Relationships window.
<P>
<IMG SRC="01703.gif">
<P>
To specify the fields used to create the relationship and the
degree of integrity it maintains, double&#173;click the relationship
line between the tables to open the <B>Relationships</B> dialog
box. Access saves these relationships and automatically
shows them in any query that you build. To delete a relationship,
click the relationship line to select it, and then press DELETE.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><B>Defining Table&#173;Level Validation and Referential Integrity </B></FONT>
<P>
<a name="dex32"></a>
<P>
Many other database management systems require you to write validation
code for each form and for any other place in your application
where data is updated. Some database management systems may also
require you to write additional code to maintain referential integrity.
<P>
In Access, you can define validation rules when you
create tables, and referential integrity when you define relationships.
These rules then apply to all of your forms and queries. In many
cases, table&#173;level validation and referential integrity meet
all of your application's validation requirements. If your application
requires more sophisticated validation rules, you can use form&#173;level
validation and write user&#173;defined functions or procedures
in Visual Basic code.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><B>Creating Queries, Forms, and Reports</B></FONT>
<P>
You cannot import or convert queries, forms, and reports from
your old database management system&nbsp;&#151; you must create
new ones in Access. Creating database objects in Access is easy; you can use wizards to create basic database objects
and then customize the objects to meet your needs. For more information,
see "<A HREF="#CrNewObj">Creating New Objects</A>" earlier in this chapter.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><B>Programming in Microsoft Access</B></FONT>

<P>
<a name="dex33"></a>
<P>
In many cases, tasks that require programming in most database
management systems do not require programming in Access.
If you need to program in Access (for example, to implement
error handling or to create your own functions), you use Visual
Basic for Applications code.
<P>
Visual Basic for Applications is similar to the Microsoft Visual
Basic programming language. You write Visual Basic code in blocks
called either <I>procedures</I> or <I>functions</I>.
Procedures and functions contain a series of Visual Basic for
Applications statements that perform an operation. You store your
Visual Basic code in modules. Access has standard modules,
which contain procedures that can be called by procedures in other
modules in the same database or in referenced databases. Access also has form and report modules, which contain code that
is associated with the form or report. For more information about
using Visual Basic with Access, see <I>Building
Applications with Microsoft Access&nbsp;97</I>.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4><B><A NAME="CH017H206">Setting Keyboard Options</A></B></FONT>

<P>
<a name="dex34"></a>
<P>
Once you have switched to Access, you may notice that
the navigation keys work differently in Access than
in some other database applications. For example, when you are
viewing and editing data in a form or datasheet, the arrow keys
may behave differently than they did in your former database management
system.
<P>
For example, in dBASE, pressing the RIGHT ARROW
or LEFT ARROW key moves the insertion point
one character to the right or left within a field. However, in
Access, the contents of a field are automatically selected
by default, and pressing these keys moves to the next or previous
field. If you click in the field or press F2
to activate the insertion point, pressing the RIGHT
ARROW or LEFT ARROW key moves the insertion
point one character to the right or left within a field.
<P>
If you want the navigation keys to work as they do in the application
you are used to, you can set keyboard options on the <B>Keyboard</B>
tab of the <B>Options</B> dialog box (<B>Tools</B> menu). The
following table describes the default keyboard options in Access that you may want to change.

interface. If you are currently using an MS&#173;DOS&#173;based
version of dBASE and are new to Windows, study your Windows documentation
to learn basic techniques.

<FONT SIZE=4><B><A NAME="CH017H208">Using dBASE Files in Microsoft Access</A>
</B></FONT>

<P>
You can use data from DBF files in dBASE&nbsp;III, dBASE&nbsp;III+,
dBASE&nbsp;IV, or dBASE&nbsp;5.0 format. If you need to leave
your data in dBASE DBF format so that dBASE users can continue
to use it, you can link the data to your Access database.
By using Access, you can view and edit the data in linked
tables even if others are using it in dBASE. You can also create
queries, forms, and reports that use the data. You can even combine
data from linked tables with the data from any other tables in
your Access application.
<P>
If you have no need to maintain your dBASE data in its original
format, you can import your DBF files into Access. Unlike
linking the dBASE file, importing the data creates a copy of the
data in Access. Importing a table gives you greater
flexibility and control over the data, but excludes users who
are not running Access from updating the data.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><B>Importing or Linking dBASE Files</B></FONT>

<P>
<a name="dex36"></a>
<P>
If you link a dBASE file, you can also tell Access to
use one or more dBASE index (NDX or MDX) files to improve performance.
Access keeps track of the indexes in a special information
(INF) file. When you use Access to update the data in
your DBF file, Access also updates the index files to
reflect your changes.
<P>
If you link a DBF file and associate an index (NDX or MDX) file,
Access needs the index file to open the linked table.
If you delete or move index files or the information (INF) file,
you cannot open the linked table. If you use dBASE to update data,
you must update the associated indexes within dBASE as well. Access cannot use a linked table unless the indexes you specify
are current.
<P>
If your dBASE files are stored on a read&#173;only drive or CD&#173;ROM,
Access cannot create an INF file in the same folder
as your DBF files. To link tables on a read&#173;only drive, you
must specify the path to the folder where you want Access
to create the INF file. To do so, you need to modify the Windows
registry. In the <B>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Jet\3.5\Engines\Xbase</B>
key, or in the Microsoft Access&#173;specific <B>Jet\3.5</B> key,
create the <B>INFPath</B> value and point it to a read/write location
in which the INF file can be written.
<P>
<FONT COLOR="#0000FF" SIZE=2><B>Note&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</B></FONT>You
can also use a user profile to set the INFPath value. For more
information, see "<A HREF="#CH017H106">Running

<a name="dex38"></a>
<P>
Note the following differences between dBASE data types and Access data types:
<P>
<UL TYPE="square">
<P>
<LI>Numeric data types
<P>
dBASE supports two numeric field types: Numeric and
Float. In Access, you use the Number data type for most
numeric fields and then set the <B>FieldSize</B> property to specify
the range and kind of numeric values that can be entered into
a Number field.
<P>
<LI>Additional field data types
<P>
Access offers two field data types not provided
in dBASE: AutoNumber and Currency. The most common form of AutoNumber
field automatically increments a value by one for each succeeding
record to generate a unique identifier for each record. This data
type is used for primary keys and for creating ID numbers. The
Currency data type is tailored to the kind of rounding and calculation
typical of currency transactions.
<P>
<LI>Fixed&#173;length
fields
<P>
As in dBASE, you must specify the length of Text fields.
If a record exceeds the specified length, data is truncated. Therefore,
set the length of your Text fields to the length of the longest
anticipated entry. However, unlike dBASE, Access does
not actually store all of the unused space characters for fixed&#173;length
fields, so that the size of your files is not a consideration.
<P>
</UL>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4><B><A NAME="CH017H209">Creating Queries</A></B></FONT>

<P>
<a name="dex39"></a>
<P>
After you import or link the data, you can create queries in 
Access&nbsp;&#151; you cannot import your dBASE queries. Access has query wizards to help you create many complex queries.
Use the query wizards to learn how to build queries in Access. Then, as you build more advanced queries, use the wizards
as a starting point for your own query designs.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=4><B><A NAME="CH017H210">Creating Forms</A></B></FONT>

<P>
<a name="dex40"></a>
<P>
Access forms are equivalent to dBASE screens. The dBASE
Form Designer tools limit you to using only fields and text. As
a result of this limitation, the traditional dBASE approach to
adding features to forms is to set in a program function keys
that call procedures related to the form. In dBASE, to make the
user aware of these functions, you add text to the form that indicates
which function keys to press to invoke certain procedures. You
can also write code to create a more user&#173;friendly dBASE
form.
<P>
In Access, you do not need to write code to create user&#173;friendly
forms. You can use the Form Wizard to create attractive forms
from your tables or queries. On the <B>Forms</B> tab in the Database
window, click the <B>New</B> button, and then double&#173;click
<B>Form Wizard</B>. Because Access forms take advantage
of the Windows graphical environment, it is easy to create controls
such as command buttons, check boxes, and drop&#173;down lists.
The Office Assistant and the Form Wizard can guide you through
adding features to your forms without programming. Access
forms also use visual controls to work with built&#173;in features,
such as the record navigation buttons at the bottom of each form.
<P>
<a name="dex41"></a>
<P>
There are many things you can do to update the way your current
dBASE form works when you convert to Access. Here are
some tips for updating your forms to take advantage of Access features:
<P>
<UL TYPE="square">
<P>
<LI>If you are using multiple&#173;choice fields, such as Picture @M, on a dBASE form, consider substituting option buttons, toggle buttons, or a combo box on the Access version of the form.
<P>
<LI>If you have one or more logical fields on a dBASE form, consider replacing them with check box controls.
<P>
<LI>If your dBASE form is programmed to display detail records in a BROWSE window or screen, consider replacing the separate BROWSE interface with
an integrated subform on the Access form, as shown in the following illustration.
<P>
<IMG SRC="01705.gif">
<P>
<LI>Most Access form controls have a <B>SpecialEffect</B> property that you can set to make controls on your forms look three&#173;dimensional.
<P>
<LI>You can have more than one Access form open at a time.
<P>
For example, you may want to link your Inventory form
to your Manufacturing Schedule form and display them simultaneously.
If having more than one form open at once is confusing or causes
a problem, you can set the Modal property of the form to Yes to
force the user to close the current form before opening another.
<P>
<LI>The Access equivalent to the dBASE Picture Functions field
and the Template field is either the <B>Format</B> property or
the <B>InputMask</B> property.
<P>
There is also an Access field property equivalent
for most of the dBASE field Edit Options. When you click a property
on the property sheet, Access displays a brief description
in the status bar at the bottom of the screen.
<P>
</UL>
<P>

<FONT SIZE=4><B><A NAME="CH017H211">Creating Reports</A></B></FONT>
<P>
<a name="dex42"></a> 
<P>
Access uses a banded report designer similar to the one in dBASE, but with extensive graphical tools and data windows.
The information in a report is divided into sections, or <I>bands</I>.
Each section has a specific purpose and prints in a particular
order. As with queries and forms, you can use a Report Wizard
as a quick way to get started creating a report. If you use a
Report Wizard, Access creates a complete report with
an attractive and consistent look that you can apply to all of
your reports. For most reports, the Report Wizards are all you
need. If you want to customize a report, you can do so in report
Design view.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 COLOR="#0000FF"><B>Tip&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</B></FONT>Like
dBASE, Access supports calculated fields in reports.

The Database window displays all of the objects in your database,
much as the Control Center does in dBASE&nbsp;IV. In dBASE, a
catalog gives you access to all the files that make up the database.
However, in Access, all of the objects are contained
in a single file with an MDB extension, with the exception of
linked objects. For linked objects, the links are stored in the
MDB file, but the objects themselves are stored in other files.

<a name="dex46"></a>
<P>
Access uses the Microsoft Jet database engine to read
and write data, whether it is using its own native tables or linking
tables in other data formats. The settings Microsoft Jet uses
to initialize the Xbase driver (the driver for both dBASE and
FoxPro files) are located in the Windows registry in the <B>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Jet\3.5\Engines\Xbase</B>
key.
<P>
The Setup program automatically creates recommended registry settings.
However, you can modify these settings in this key, in the 
Access&#173;specific Jet&nbsp;3.5 registry key, or by using a
user profile. For more information, see "<A HREF="#CH017H106">Running

To switch from FoxPro to Access, you can either link
or import the data from your FoxPro DBF files. You can then modify

you need. This section discusses the similarities and differences
between FoxPro and Access, including data type conversion.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4><B><A NAME="CH017H215">Using FoxPro Files in Microsoft Access</A>

If your FoxPro files are stored on a read&#173;only drive or CD&#173;ROM, Access cannot create an INF file in the same folder
as your DBF or DBC files. To link tables on a read&#173;only drive,
you must specify the path to the folder where you want Access to create the INF file. To do so, you need to modify the
Windows registry. In the <B>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Jet\3.5\Engines\Xbase</B>
key, or in the Access&#173;specific <B>Jet\3.5</B> key,
create the <B>INFPath</B> value and point it to a read/write location
in which the INF file can be written.
<P>
<FONT COLOR="#0000FF" SIZE=2><B>Note&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</B></FONT>You

FoxPro&nbsp;2.5 does not distinguish between tables
created with the MS&#173;DOS version of FoxPro and those created
with the Windows version. Data in tables created with FoxPro&nbsp;2.5
for MS&#173;DOS is stored in OEM format. Data in tables created
with FoxPro&nbsp;2.5 for Windows is stored in ANSI format. Access converts all FoxPro&nbsp;2.5 data from an OEM code page
to the ANSI 1252 code page when importing or linking FoxPro&nbsp;2.5
data, and it converts the ANSI code page to an OEM code page when
exporting to FoxPro&nbsp;2.5 tables. The result is that <I>extended
characters</I> (characters with ASCII and ANSI codes above
128) in tables created with FoxPro&nbsp;2.5 for Windows are not
converted properly.
<P>
If your FoxPro&nbsp;2.5 for Windows tables contain extended characters,
you may want to ensure that the tables are stored in OEM format
(that is, created by FoxPro&nbsp;2.5 for MS&#173;DOS). Releases
of FoxPro subsequent to 2.5 (2.5a, 2.5b, and so on) correctly
identify the code page format of the data, so Access
can correctly determine how to convert extended characters.

<P>
You can use data from tables in Paradox or Paradox for Windows
version&nbsp;3.<I>x</I>, 4.<I>x</I>, or
5.0. format. You cannot use data from tables in Paradox&nbsp;7
format; however, you can save tables from Paradox&nbsp;7 to version&nbsp;5.0
to use the data with Access. If you need to leave your
data in Paradox format so that Paradox users can continue to use
it, you can link the data to your Access database. By
using Access, you can view and edit the data in linked
tables even if others are using it in Paradox.
<P>
If you want to share Paradox tables with Paradox&nbsp;7 users
by linking tables from Access, Paradox&nbsp;7 can save
and use its tables in version&nbsp;5.0 format. If you provide
the correct password, Access can open encrypted Paradox
tables.
<P>
If you have no need to maintain your Paradox data in its original
format, you can import your Paradox tables into Access.
Unlike linking the Paradox table, importing the data creates a
copy of the data in Access. Importing a table gives
you greater flexibility and control over the data, but excludes
users who are not running Access from updating the data.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><B>Importing or Linking Paradox Files</B></FONT>

<P>
Paradox stores important information about a table's primary key
in an index (PX) file. If you link a Paradox table that has a
primary key, Access needs the PX file to open the linked
table. If you delete or move this file, you cannot open the linked
table.
<P>
If you link a Paradox table that does not have a primary key,
you cannot update data in the table using Access. If
you want to be able to update the table, define a primary key
for the table in Paradox.

<FONT SIZE=3><B>Primary Keys in Paradox Tables</B></FONT>

<P>
If you link a Paradox table that has a primary key, Access needs the associated index (PX) file in order to open the

linked table. If you delete or move these files, you cannot open
the linked table.
<P>
If a multiple&#173;field primary key is greater than 255&nbsp;bytes,
the table is opened read&#173;only. If you link an empty Paradox
table with no primary key, you can add records the first time
you use the table. However, because Access cannot update
Paradox tables without primary keys, after the table is closed
and reopened, it is read&#173;only.

You cannot link or import from Paradox tables on read&#173;only
drives. This is because Access cannot create the necessary
lock files.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><B>Encrypted Tables</B></FONT>

<P>
Access does not support auxiliary passwords on Paradox
tables. To use the table with Access, open the table
in Paradox and remove the auxiliary password.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><B>Potential Restructure Problem in Paradox for Windows</B></FONT>

<P>
Problems occasionally occur when you use the Paradox for Windows
table restructure routine. If you are having difficulty getting
Access to open your Paradox&nbsp;4.<I>x</I> table properly, consider restructuring it in Paradox for MS&#173;DOS version&nbsp;4.0 or 4.5, and then try again.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><B>Paradox Referential Integrity</B></FONT>

<P>
Access referential integrity does not work with linked
Paradox tables. You cannot use linked Paradox tables to trigger
cascading deletes or updates, or to prevent orphan records.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><B>Collating Sequences</B></FONT>

<P>
The <I>collating sequence</I> determines the sort
order used when working with tables. When working with Paradox
tables, the Microsoft Jet database engine supports the following
collating sequences: ASCII, International, Norwegian&#173;Danish,
and Swedish&#173;Finnish.
<P>
To import or link Paradox tables, the <B>CollatingSequence</B>
setting in the Windows registry must match the collating sequence
used when the Paradox table was built. The default is setting
is ASCII. If necessary, you can change this value in the Windows
registry in the <B>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Jet\3.5\Engines\Paradox</B>
key, in the Access&#173;specific Jet 3.5 registry key,
or by using a user profile. For more information, see "<A
HREF="#CH017H106">Running Multiple Data Access Applications</A>"
later in this chapter.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><B>Paradox Tables on a Network</B></FONT>

<P>
<a name="dex58"></a>
<P>
If you are using Access to link Paradox data on a network
while Paradox users are working with the data, you must be sure
to define all three <B>ParadoxUserName</B>, <B>ParadoxNetPath</B>,
and <B>ParadoxNetStyle</B> settings in the Windows registry. For
more information about changing Microsoft Jet database engine
settings in the Windows registry, see "<A HREF="#CH017H106">Running
Multiple Data Access Applications</A>" later in this
chapter.
<P>
The following sections describe how to define these settings and
discuss some additional issues when sharing Paradox files on a
network.
<P>
<B>Specifying a User Name with the ParadoxUserName Setting</B>

<P>
The <B>ParadoxUserName</B> setting in the Windows registry defines
the name to be displayed by Paradox if a Paradox table is locked
by Access and a user accessing the data from Paradox
attempts to place an incompatible lock.
<P>
To share Paradox tables that use Access with other Paradox
users, you must modify the Windows registry. In the <B>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Jet\3.5\Engines\Paradox</B>
key, set the <B>ParadoxUserName</B> value to a user name. There
cannot be more than one user registered with the same <B>ParadoxUserName</B>
on the same network. If you specify a <B>ParadoxUserName</B>,
you must also specify <B>ParadoxNetPath</B> and <B>ParadoxNetStyle</B>
values, or you receive an error message when trying to gain access
to external Paradox data.
<P>
<B>Specifying Identical ParadoxNetPath Settings</B>

<P>
In Access, for all users sharing the same Paradox database,
a setting in the Windows registry must specify the full path to
the folder that contains the Paradox.net file (for Paradox&nbsp;3.<I>x</I>)
or the Pdoxusrs.net file (for Paradox&nbsp;4.<I>x</I>
and 5.0). In the <B>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Jet\3.5\Engines\Paradox</B>
key, set the <B>ParadoxNetPath</B> value to the full path.
<P>
In Paradox&nbsp;4.<I>x</I>, you can modify this setting
either by running Nupdate.exe or by using the <B>&#173;net</B>
command&#173;line option. If you use the <B>&#173;net</B> command&#173;line
option, be sure to include a backslash (&nbsp;\&nbsp;) at the
end of the path (Access and the Paradox Nupdate.exe
program place the backslash at the end automatically). The <B>&#173;net</B>
command&#173;line option was not available in Paradox prior to
version&nbsp;4.0. For more information, see the <I>Paradox
Network Administrator's Guide</I>.
<P>
<B>Specifying the Locking Style with the ParadoxNetStyle Setting
</B>

<P>
Use a setting in the Windows registry to specify the network locking
style to use when accessing Paradox data. In the <B>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Jet\3.5\Engines\Paradox</B>
key, set the <B>ParadoxNetStyle</B> to <B>3.</B><I>x</I>
for Paradox&nbsp;3.<I>x</I> or <B>4.</B><I>x</I>
for Paradox&nbsp;4.<I>x</I> and 5.0. You can use the
Paradox&nbsp;4.<I>x</I> locking style to gain access
to Paradox&nbsp;3.<I>x</I>, 4.<I>x</I>,
and 5.0 tables. You cannot link Paradox&nbsp;4.<I>x</I>
tables while using the Paradox&nbsp;3.<I>x</I> locking
style.
<P>
If a Paradox version&nbsp;3.5 user opens a table, you cannot open
or import from this table by using the 4.<I>x</I>
locking style. The table is inaccessible from Access
until the Paradox&nbsp;3.5 user closes it.
<P>
<B>Linking or Opening Paradox Tables in a Private Folder</B>

<P>
Access&nbsp;97 cannot link or open Paradox tables in
the private folder of an active Paradox session. While you have
a linked Paradox table open in Access, records added
by other users are not visible to you until you close and reopen
the table. However, records added by you in Access are
visible to Paradox users when their screen is refreshed (if they
have Auto Refresh turned on).
<P>
<B>Deleting Paradox LCK Files</B>

<P>
Occasionally the Paradox LCK file is inadvertently left in a folder.
This prevents either Access or Paradox from accessing
files in that folder. To fix this, delete the LCK file.
<P>

<P>
</OL>
<P>
If you export a table with table or field names that do not fit
the requirements of the destination database, Access
adjusts the names. For example, if you export data to a Paradox
table, any field names longer than 10&nbsp;characters are truncated.
<P>
If you attempt to export an Access table containing long
field names to Paradox, and the first 25&nbsp;characters are identical
to an existing field name, Access generates a unique
field name.
<P>
When Access exports a table with a field name containing
a number sign&nbsp;(&nbsp;#&nbsp;), it is converted to a period.
An opening or closing parenthesis, curly bracket, or quotation
mark is converted to an underscore character&nbsp;(&nbsp;_&nbsp;).
<P>
Exporting Access Memo fields to Paradox format results
in extra carriage return characters.
<P>
When you use Visual Basic to create Paradox tables, text columns
default to 255&nbsp;characters if you do not specify a field width
by using the <B>FieldSize</B> property. Wide columns such as these
make it easy for the new table to exceed the 1,350&#173;character
maximum width of a Paradox table with a primary key. If you attempt
to append a primary index to a Paradox table wider than 1,350&nbsp;characters,
you receive an error message.

Access&nbsp;97 uses the Microsoft Jet 3.5 database engine
to read and write data, whether it is using its own native tables
or linking tables in other data formats. The settings Microsoft
Jet version&nbsp;3.5 uses to initialize the Paradox driver are
located in the Windows registry in the <B>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Jet\3.5\Engines\Paradox</B>
key.
<P>
The Setup program automatically creates recommended registry settings.
However, you can modify the settings in this key, in the Access&#173;specific Jet&nbsp;3.5 registry key, or by using a
user profile. For more information, see the following section,
"<A HREF="#CH017H106">Running Multiple Data Access

Custom applications developed with Access&nbsp;97, Excel&nbsp;97, Microsoft Visual Basic version&nbsp;5.0, and Microsoft
Visual C++ version&nbsp;5.0 can use the Microsoft Jet 3.5 database
engine to perform their database&#173;related operations. If you
run one or more of these applications on the same computer, they
all initialize the Microsoft Jet 3.5 database engine by using
the Windows registry settings in the <B>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Jet\3.5\Engines</B>
key.
<P>
If you modify any of these settings, your changes apply to all
applications using the Microsoft Jet 3.5 database engine on the
same computer. There are three ways you can avoid this:
<P>
<UL TYPE="square">
<P>
<LI>Change the settings in the
<B>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Office\8.0\Access\Jet\3.5\Engines</B>
key.
<P>
Any settings defined in the <B>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Office\8.0\Access\Jet\3.5\Engines</B> key override settings in the  <B>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Jet\3.5\Engines</B>
key and apply only to Access&nbsp;97.
<P>
<LI>If you have Microsoft Office&nbsp;97 Developer Edition, use the
Setup Wizard to create an installation program for a custom Access application that sets up a user profile.
<P>
A user profile is an alternative set of registry keys
that can contain settings that override the standard Access and Microsoft Jet&nbsp;3.5 settings. A user profile is
specified by using the <B>/profile</B> command&#173;line option when
you start your application. User profiles are analogous to the
appname.ini files used in previous versions of Access.
<P>
<LI>Create
a user profile by using the Registry Editor, and then specify
it by using the <B>/profile</B> command&#173;line option when
you start your application. For more information about user profiles,
see Access online Help.
<P>
</UL>
<P>
For more information about Access registry settings, see Access online Help.
<P>
Similar considerations apply to database applications developed
with Access&nbsp;95, Excel&nbsp;95, Microsoft
Visual Basic version&nbsp;4.0, and Microsoft Visual C++ version&nbsp;4.0,
because they can share the same Microsoft Jet version&nbsp;3.0
database engine. However, database engine settings in these applications
do not affect applications that share use of the Microsoft Jet&nbsp;3.5
database engine, and are read from a separate set of subkeys under
the <B>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Jet\3.0\Engines</B>
key.
<P>
These considerations do not apply to Access versions&nbsp;1.<I>x</I>
and 2.0 and Visual Basic version&nbsp;3.0, which use INI files
for initialization information. The following table shows where
each of these previous version applications looks for its initialization
information.
