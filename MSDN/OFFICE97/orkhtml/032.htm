<P>
PowerPoint has no features for protecting presentations or the
content of slides. Instead, use the security features built into
the operating system used by your workgroup.
<P>
For example, if you administer Windows&nbsp;NT Server version&nbsp;3.51
or 4.0, you can secure folders and files and configure user access
privileges on the server. Users running PowerPoint under Windows&nbsp;NT
Workstation version&nbsp;3.51 or 4.0 can secure folders and files
for which they have ownership, and can configure user access privileges
if they have permission to do so. Users running PowerPoint on
a Windows&nbsp;95 computer can restrict the way a folder is shared,
and can protect files by making them read&#173;only.
<P>
Macintosh users can set access privileges for individual files by putting the files in a shared folder or disk. To set access privileges for the folder or disk, click the <B>Sharing</B> command (<B>Finder’s File</B> menu).
<P>
For information about using these security features, consult the
documentation for your operating system.

A presentation conference consists of the presenter (or conference
owner) and the audience (or conference participants). The following
diagram illustrates a presentation conference. Computer A, located
in Oregon, is the conference owner and controls the presentation.
Computer B in California and Computer C in Ireland are conference
participants, or <I>nodes</I>, linked to the conference
owner.

<B>Showing a Presentation on Two Linked Computers</B>
<P>
A feature similar to presentation conferencing is the ability
to show a presentation on one computer from another computer,
connected serially with a null&#173;modem cable. Use the <B>View
On Two Screens</B> command (<B>Slide Show</B> menu) to present
slide shows this way.
<P>
The advantage to delivering a presentation on two linked machines,
rather than connecting a large&#173;screen monitor to the presenter's
computer, is that the presenter can use the Stage Manager feature
(as in presentation conferencing) without it being visible to
the audience. Using the <B>Stage Manager</B> toolbar, the presenter
can skip to other slides in the show or view the speaker notes.
For more information about viewing on two screens, see PowerPoint
online Help.

<UL TYPE="square">
<P>
<LI>PowerPoint&nbsp;97 or PowerPoint&nbsp;95
and (if needed) a 97&#173;to&#173;95 converter

<P>
<LI>File sharing
<P>
For information about file sharing, see your Windows
documentation.
<P>
<LI>Network connection and correct
networking protocol
<P>
Computers communicating over a network must be connected
to the same LAN and must have TCP/IP networking protocol installed.
Presentation conferences use the Pptconference network port (port
number 1711). However, presentation conferences between PowerPoint&nbsp;97
and PowerPoint&nbsp;95 users must use the Conference network port
(port number 531) to ensure proper compatibility.

<P>
<a name="dex5"></a>
<P>
A presentation conference must be set up in advance. Typically,
users make a conference call on their telephones to go through
the Presentation Conference Wizard together. To start the Presentation
Conference Wizard, click <B>Presentation Conference</B> (<B>Tools</B>
menu). The wizard allows users to identify conference participants
and the conference owner; establishes the type of connection for
each participant; and allows users to share information for making
the connection, such as the computer name or IP address of each
participant.
<P>
Some of the steps in setting up a conference require advance planning
and communication between the presenter and audience members.
The following sections explain the details of the conferencing
process.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><B><A NAME="_Toc367431123">Setting the Type of Connection</A>
</B></FONT>

<P>
<a name="dex6"></a>
<P>
Presentation conferences can mix Internet and LAN connections.
The conference owner may have an Internet connection to some participants
and a LAN connection to others. Each participant chooses either
a LAN or Internet connection to the conference owner. For Internet
connections, all conference participants (including the presenter)
must have an Internet connection active before starting the conference.
For LAN connections, conference participants must be connected
by TCP/IP protocol.
<P>
The following diagram illustrates these connection scenarios.
<P>
<A NAME="_Toc367431124"><IMG SRC="03202.gif"></A>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><B>Getting Connection Information</B></FONT>

<P>
<a name="dex7"></a>
<P>
For Internet connections, the presenter must supply the IP address
for each Internet audience member. Internet audience members can
enter their IP address in the <B>Connection Details</B> panel
in the Presentation Conference Wizard.
<P>
For LAN connections, the presenter must supply the computer name
of each audience member. LAN audience members enter their computer
name in the <B>Connection Details</B> panel of the Presentation
Conference Wizard.
<P>
<FONT COLOR="#0000FF" SIZE=2><B>Note&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</B></FONT>Presenters
can use the <B>Save List</B> and <B>Open List</B> buttons in the Presentation
Conference Wizard to save and reuse lists of audience computer
names and IP addresses. These lists, called conference address
lists, are stored in a CFL file. Presenters can save different
address lists for different audience groups.

<P>
<a name="dex8"></a>
<P>
The presenter can choose whether all participants must join the
conference immediately or whether participants may join the conference
in&#173;progress.
<P>
If all participants must join immediately, all audience members
must click <B>Finish</B> on the Presentation Conference Wizard
before or about the same time as the presenter does. As soon as
the presenter clicks <B>Finish</B>, PowerPoint connects the presenter's
computer to the nodes of all the participants. If a node does
not respond (because the user has not yet clicked <B>Finish</B>),
PowerPoint attempts two or three more times to make the connection.
The conference does not begin unless all nodes are connected.
<P>
If participants may join the conference in&#173;progress, the
conference can begin as long as PowerPoint can connect the presenter's
computer to at least one participant node. Once the conference
is in progress, the presenter's computer attempts periodically
to connect to other nodes.
<P>
<a name="dex9"></a>
<P>
When the presenter's computer establishes a connection with each
audience node, it sends a copy of the presentation to each participant's
Windows\Temp folder; the file is named with the standard temporary&#173;file
naming scheme. The presentation opens as an untitled presentation
on each of the audience nodes.

For the presenter, a presentation conference appears the same
as viewing the presentation in slide show mode. For audience nodes,
the presentation is a read&#173;only version of the slide show,
although audience members have access to the pen tool for marking
slides. The presenter has access to Speaker Notes, Meeting Minder,
Slide Meter, and Slide Navigator, but these features are not visible
to audience nodes.
<P>
<a name="dex11"></a>
<P>
The following elements in a presentation are not supported on
audience nodes during a presentation conference:
<P>
<UL TYPE="square">
<P>
<LI>Objects such as sound or
video clips that play when double&#173;clicked play on the presenter's
computer, but not on the audience nodes.
<P>
<LI>Shared
applications, such as Microsoft Graph, do not open on audience
nodes.
<P>
For example, if the presenter double&#173;clicks a
chart, audience members see a read&#173;only chart. Microsoft
Graph runs only on the presenter's computer.
<P>
<LI>The
component for editing linked and embedded objects does not open
on audience nodes.
<P>
For example, if the presenter double&#173;clicks an
embedded Microsoft Word table, the table is displayed read&#173;only
on the nodes. PowerPoint runs the Word tools necessary for editing
the table only on the presenter's computer.

The presenter runs the slide show with the <B>Stage Manager</B>
toolbar. Buttons on this toolbar allow the presenter to navigate
through the presentation by advancing to the next slide, going
back to the previous slide, or opening the Slide Navigator to
go to any slide in the presentation. Using the<B> </B>toolbar,
the presenter can also run Slide Meter to compare presentation
timing with pre&#173;recorded rehearsal timing, and can open Meeting
Minder to take down minutes and action items.
<P>
The <B>Stage Manager</B> toolbar also gives the presenter access
to the pen tool for marking on the current slide, and a button
for erasing all participants' marks. For information about the
pen tool, see "<A HREF="#CH032H204">Understanding
the Audience's Role</A>" later in this chapter. Marks
that participants make on the current slide disappear when the presenter goes to another slide.

Items</B> tab in the <B>Meeting Minder</B> dialog box.
<P>
<a name="dex15"></a>
<P>
Action items accumulated during the slide show are placed on a
slide that PowerPoint automatically appends to the end of the
presentation. Since this slide is created during the slide show,
the presenter must send it to the audience members in order for
them to see it. The presenter clicks the <B>Send Slide</B> button
on the <B>Stage Manager</B> toolbar to transmit the action items
slide to each participant's computer.

<B>Did You Know?</B>

When PowerPoint appends action items slides to the end of a slide
show, it generates a new slide based on the <B>Number of bullets

in the <B>Style Checker Options</B> dialog box. (To display this
dialog box, click <B>Style Checker</B> on the <B>Tools</B> menu,
and then click the <B>Options</B> button). This option identifies
the maximum number of bullets per slide.
<P>
For example, a user can specify that the number of bullets on
one slide cannot exceed 6. If the presenter creates 10 action
items during a presentation conference, PowerPoint appends 2 slides
to the end of the presentation: the first slide contains the first
6 action items, and the second slide contains the remaining 4.

You can send a presentation through e-mail when you want all recipients to receive a copy at the same time. When you want others to review a presentation, you can route the presentation to one recipient after another so that each sees the previous person’s comments or you can route it to all recipients at once.
<P>
Users in a workgroup running Windows&nbsp;95, Windows&nbsp;NT Workstation, or Windows&nbsp;NT Server 3.51 or later can review presentations by routing or sending a presentation through e-mail. Each recipient can add comments to the slides.
<P>
Macintosh users in a workgroup running Quarterdeck Mail can review presentations by routing or sending a presentation through e-mail. Macintosh users running one of the following products can send presentations through e-mail:

<FONT COLOR="#0000FF" SIZE=2><B>Note&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</B></FONT>If
you are routing or sending a presentation to a user who has not yet upgraded
to PowerPoint&nbsp;97, first save the presentation in a format
that the target version of PowerPoint can open, such as PowerPoint&nbsp;95
&amp; 97 format. For information about sharing presentations
among different versions of PowerPoint, see Chapter&nbsp;14, "<a href="014.htm">Upgrading
from Previous Versions of Microsoft PowerPoint</A>."
<P>
<a name="dex20"></a>
Comments are text objects with unique formatting. You can change
the default formatting of the object using the <B>Comment</B>
command (<B>Format</B> menu), and you can change the shape of
the object by using commands on the <B>Change AutoShape</B> submenu
(<B>Draw</B> menu). Each user in the workgroup can use a different
shape or format to differentiate comments, as shown in the following
illustration.


<P>
<IMG SRC="03203.gif">
<P>
If a slide becomes cluttered with comments, you can use the <B>Comments</B>
command (<B>View</B> menu) to hide them. Clicking <B>Comments</B>
again on the <B>View</B> menu displays the comments. Comments
are on the top layer of a slide whenever you display them.

<a name="dex21"></a>
<P>
The Pack and Go Wizard packages all the contents of a presentation
so that the presentation can be delivered on another computer,
such as a laptop. Because the Pack and Go Wizard can pack a PowerPoint viewer along with the presentation, in many cases the destination
computer does not need to have PowerPoint installed. To start the
Pack and Go Wizard, click <B>Pack and Go</B> (<B>File</B> menu).
<P>
For presentations that contain ActiveX controls or objects that
are linked or embedded in the presentation, the corresponding
component must be installed on the destination computer for the
control or object to run when double&#173;clicked. For example,
the Pack and Go Wizard packs Microsoft Graph objects along with
the presentation to which they are linked, but it does not pack
the Microsoft Graph application. If the destination computer does
not have Microsoft Graph installed, the chart is displayed read&#173;only.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4><B><A NAME="CH032H206">Packing the Viewer</A></B></FONT>

<P>
<a name="dex22"></a>
<P>
If the destination computer has PowerPoint installed, you do not need to pack a viewer to show your presentation. When you pack the presentation, select <B>Don’t include a viewer</B> in the Pack and Go Wizard.

<P>
If the destination computer does not have PowerPoint installed, but is running under Windows&nbsp;NT Workstation 3.51 or later, Windows&nbsp;NT Server 3.51 or later, or Windows&nbsp;95, you can pack a PowerPoint viewer to show your presentation. Select <B>Viewer for Windows&nbsp;95 or NT</B> in the Pack and Go Wizard. You cannot pack a presentation to show on a Macintosh unless the destination computer has PowerPoint installed.

Because the PowerPoint viewer must be able to read the presentation
file format, the Pack and Go Wizard may need to pack along converters,
depending on the format of the presentation. To determine the
file format for saving the presentation and whether to pack along
any converters, the Pack and Go Wizard detects which viewer is included
and what default format for saving presentations is selected,
as shown in the following table.

When you finish the Pack and Go Wizard, it packs up the Pack and
Go Setup program, along with all the identified files and links,
and stores them in a CAB file. On the destination computer, Pack
and Go Setup decompresses the CAB file and writes the necessary
PowerPoint entries in the Windows registry or in PowerPnt.ini
(depending on the version of Windows), or in the PowerPoint settings
file (Macintosh).
<P>
When the 32&#173;bit viewer is packed, Pack and Go
Setup gives you the option of starting the viewer automatically

Typically, presentations delivered from a laptop are delivered
over a large&#173;screen monitor attached to the laptop. If the
large&#173;screen monitor has its own CPU with PowerPoint&nbsp;97
installed, however, you can deliver the presentation from the
laptop with the <B>View On Two Screens</B> feature (<B>Slide Show</B>
menu). This feature does not use a PowerPoint viewer; PowerPoint&nbsp;97
must be installed on both computers, and the computers must be
connected serially by null&#173;modem cable. For more information

<P>
Users in a workgroup who have e-mail capability can review presentations by routing or sending them through e-mail, with each recipient adding comments to the presentation. 

<P>
To <I>route</I> a presentation, the sender creates a routing slip, and then routes the presentation to the recipients either one at a time or all at once. The sender can track the status of the routed presentation as the recipients review it. After all of the recipients have reviewed the presentation, it is automatically returned to the original sender. 

<P>
When sending a presentation through e-mail, the original sender does not create a routing slip. Whether the sender routes or sends a presentation, the presentation is received as an attachment in an e-mail message.
