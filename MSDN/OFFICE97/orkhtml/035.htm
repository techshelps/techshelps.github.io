<a name="dex1"></a>
<P>
Microsoft Access documents are called databases. An  Access
database is a collection of <I>database objects</I>:
tables, queries, forms, reports, macros, and modules. You can
design new objects or open existing ones to work with your database.
Unlike many database programs, an Access database can
contain all of the objects that make up a database application
in a single file with the .mdb file name extension. For this reason,
an Access database file is sometimes called a <I>database
container</I>.
<P>
You can store general-purpose Microsoft Visual Basic for Applications procedures in a <I>library database</I>. An Access database application can call procedures from a library database after establishing a link to the database called a <I>reference</I>. You can create or purchase tools called <I>add-ins</I> to add custom features to Access. Access user-level security account information is stored in a database called a <I>workgroup information file</I>.
<P>
<A NAME="CH035H201"><IMG SRC="03501.gif"></A>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4><B>Tables</B></FONT>

<P>
<a name="dex2"></a>
<P>
In Microsoft Access, you store data in <I>tables</I>.
Tables organize data into columns and rows. Each row in a table
is called a <I>record</I>. Each column in a record
is called a <I>field</I>. For example, each record
in a Customers table contains information about one customer.
Each customer's record contains fields named for each piece of
information you want to store about the customer, such as LastName,
FirstName, Address, City, State/Province, PostalCode, and Phone.
Users can enter and modify data in tables directly or through
queries and data&#173;entry forms, which are described later in
this section.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><B>Storing Related Data in Separate Tables</B></FONT>

<P>
<a name="dex3"></a>
<P>
You can create a separate table for each topic of data, such as
customers, employees, or products. Using a separate table for
each topic means that you store that data only once, which makes
your database more efficient and reduces data&#173;entry errors.
For example, if you store both customer and order information
in one table, whenever a customer places an additional order,
you have to reenter information about that customer. Not only
is this inefficient, but errors can occur when information is
reentered. If you keep separate tables for customers and orders,
each customer has only one record&nbsp;&#151; in the
Customers table. If you need to update or correct information
about a customer, you need to change the data in only one record.
This method eliminates redundant entries and reduces data&#173;entry
errors.
<P>
<a name="dex4"></a>
<P>
The process of eliminating redundancy by dividing data into separate
related tables is called <I>normalization</I>. Access provides a wizard called the Table Analyzer Wizard to help
you normalize your database. For information about running the
Table Analyzer Wizard, see "<a href="007.htm#CH007H206">Optimizing
Microsoft Access</A>" in Chapter&nbsp;7, "Customizing
and Optimizing Microsoft Office."
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><B>Defining Relationships</B></FONT>

<P>
<a name="dex5"></a>
<P>
To bring the data from multiple tables together for a query, form,
or report, you define <I>relationships</I> between
the tables based on a common piece of information stored in both
tables. For example, a Customers table typically contains a CustomerID
field whose value uniquely identifies each customer. If the Orders
table also has a CustomerID field, you can define a relationship
between the two tables, so that when you enter orders, you can
enter a customer's ID number to relate information from the Customers
table to that order. Instead of actually typing the CustomerID,
you can use a lookup list box, as shown in the Orders form from
the Northwind sample database.
<P>
<IMG SRC="03502.gif">
<P>
Although the BillTo list displays only the customer's name, picking
a customer from the list stores that customer's CustomerID number
in the Orders table. The customer's address information that is
displayed below the customer's name is not stored in the Orders
table. This information is looked up from the Customers table
and displayed based on the relationship defined between the CustomerID
field in the Customers table and the CustomerID field in the Orders
table.
<P>
If you need to enter an order for a customer that is not available
in the BillTo list, first you open the Customers form and enter
a new record for that customer. Then Access automatically
makes the new customer available in the BillTo lookup list box
on the Orders form.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4><B><A NAME="CH035H202">Queries</A></B></FONT>

<P>
<a name="dex6"></a>
<P>
You use <I>queries</I> to view, change, and analyze
data in different ways. You can also use them as the source of
records for forms and reports. You can create a query either by
using a wizard or from scratch in query Design view. In Design
view, you specify the data you want to work with by adding the
tables or queries that contain the data, and then specifying criteria
and other information in the query design grid. In Microsoft Access,
you can create many types of queries: select queries, parameter
queries, crosstab queries, action queries, and SQL queries. This
section describes the types of queries you can use in Access.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><B>Select Queries</B></FONT>

<P>
<a name="dex7"></a>
<P>
A select query is the most common type of query. A select query
retrieves data from one or more tables based on criteria you specify
at design time such as category, range, and Boolean (logical yes/no
or true/false) operators. Access displays the results
on a datasheet where you can update the records (with some restrictions).
You can also use a select query to group records and to calculate
sums, counts, averages, and other types of totals.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><B>Parameter Queries</B></FONT>

<P>
<a name="dex8"></a>
<P>
When you run a parameter query, it displays a dialog box prompting
you for information, such as criteria for retrieving records or
a value you want to insert in a field. You can design the query
to prompt you for more than one piece of information&nbsp;&#151;
for example, you can design it to prompt you for two dates. Access can then retrieve all records that fall between those two
dates.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><B>Crosstab Queries</B></FONT>

<P>
<a name="dex9"></a>
<P>
A crosstab query displays summarized values (sums, counts, and
averages) from one field in a table and groups them by one set
of facts listed down the left side of the datasheet and another
set of facts listed across the top of the datasheet. You can create
a crosstab query either by using the Crosstab Query Wizard or
from scratch. You can display crosstab data without creating a
crosstab query in your database by using the PivotTable Wizard
instead. With a PivotTable, you can change row and column headings
on demand to analyze data in different ways.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><B>Action Queries</B></FONT>

<P>
<a name="dex10"></a>
<P>
An action query makes changes to many records in one operation.
There are four types of action queries: delete, update, append,
and make&#173;table.
<P>
<B>Delete Queries</B>

<P>
<a name="dex11"></a>
<P>
A delete query deletes a group of records from one or more tables.
For example, you can use a delete query to remove products that
are discontinued or for which there are no orders. With delete
queries, you always delete entire records, not just selected fields
within records.
<P>
<B>Update Queries</B>

<P>
<a name="dex12"></a>
<P>
An update query makes global changes to a group of records in
one or more tables. For example, you can raise prices by 10&nbsp;percent
for all dairy products, or you can raise salaries by 5&nbsp;percent
for the people within a certain job category. With an update query,
you can change data in existing tables.
<P>
<B>Append Queries</B>

<P>
<a name="dex13"></a>
<P>
An append query adds a group of records from one or more tables
to the end of one or more tables. For example, suppose that you
acquire new customers and a database that contains a table of
information about those customers. To avoid typing all this information
in, you can append it to the Customers table. Append queries are
also helpful for:
<P>
<UL TYPE="square">
<P>
<LI>Appending fields based on
criteria.
<P>
For example, you may want to append only the names
and addresses of customers with outstanding orders.
<P>
<LI>Appending
records when some of the fields in one table do not exist in the
other table.
<P>
For example, in the Northwind sample database, the
Customers table has 11&nbsp;fields. Suppose that you want to append
records from another table that has fields that match 9 of the
11&nbsp;fields in the Customers table. An append query appends
the data in the matching fields and ignores the others.
<P>
</UL>
<P>
<B>Make&#173;Table Queries</B>

<P>
<a name="dex14"></a>
<P>
A make&#173;table query creates a new table from all or part of
the data in one or more tables. Make&#173;table queries are helpful
for:
<P>
<UL TYPE="square">
<P>
<LI>Creating a table to export
to other Access databases.
<P>
For example, you may want to create a table that contains
several fields from the Employees table, and then export that
table to a database used by the personnel department.
<P>
<LI>Creating
reports that display data from a specified point in time.
<P>
For example, suppose you want to print a report on
15&#173;May&#173;97 that displays the first quarter's sales totals
based on the data that was in the underlying tables as of 9:00&nbsp;A.M.
on 1&#173;Apr&#173;97. A report based on a query or an SQL statement
extracts the most up&#173;to&#173;date data from the tables (the
data as of 15&#173;May&#173;97), rather than the records as of
a specific date and time. To preserve the data exactly as it was
at 9:00&nbsp;A.M. on 1&#173;Apr&#173;97, create and run a make&#173;table
query at that point in time to retrieve the records you need,
and store them in a new table. Then use this table, rather than
a query, as the basis for the reports.
<P>
<LI>Making
a backup copy of a table.
<P>
<LI>Creating a history
table that contains old records.
<P>
For example, you can create a table that stores all
the old orders before deleting them from the current Orders table.
<P>
<LI>Improving
performance of forms and reports based on multiple&#173;table
queries or SQL statements.
<P>
For example, suppose you want to print multiple reports
that are based on a five&#173;table query that includes totals.
You may be able to speed things up by first creating a make&#173;table
query that retrieves the records you need and stores them in one
table. Then you can base the reports on this table or specify
the table in an SQL statement as the record source for a form
or report, so that you do not have to rerun the query for each report.
However, the data in the table is frozen at the time you run the
make&#173;table query.
<P>
</UL>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><B>SQL Queries</B></FONT>

<P>
<a name="dex15"></a>
<P>
An SQL query is a query you create by using an SQL statement.
Examples of SQL&#173;specific queries are union queries, pass&#173;through
queries, data&#173;definition queries, and subqueries.
<P>
<B>Union Queries</B>

<P>
<a name="dex16"></a>
<P>
A union query combines fields from one or more tables or queries
into one field in the query's results. For example, if you have
six vendors who send new inventory lists each month, you can combine
these lists into one result set by using a union query, and then
create a make&#173;table query based on the union query to make
a new table.
<P>
<B>Pass&#173;through Queries</B>

<P>
<a name="dex17"></a>
<P>
A pass&#173;through query sends commands directly to Open Database
Connectivity (ODBC) data sources, such as Microsoft SQL Server
databases, by using commands that are accepted by the server.
For example, you can use a pass&#173;through query to retrieve
records or change data. You can also use pass&#173;through queries
to run <I>stored procedures</I> (SQL programs that
are stored on the server) and to perform operations that are only
available by using server&#173;specific commands.
<P>
<B>Data&#173;Definition Queries</B>

<P>
<a name="dex18"></a>
<P>
A data&#173;definition query uses SQL Data Definition Language
(DDL) statements to create, delete, or alter tables and to create
indexes. DDL statements can be used only with Microsoft Jet format
(MDB) databases. To work with SQL Server tables and indexes, use
pass&#173;through queries instead. To work with other non&#173;Microsoft
Jet format tables supported by Access, use the <B>Data
Access Objects (DAO) Create</B> methods in Microsoft Visual Basic for Applications.
<P>
<B>Subqueries</B>

<P>
A subquery consists of an SQL SELECT statement inside another
select query or action query. You can enter these statements in
the <B>Field</B> row of the query design grid to define a new
field, or in the <B>Criteria</B> row to define criteria for a
field. You can use subqueries to:
<P>
<UL TYPE="square">
<P>
<LI>Test for the existence of
some result from the subquery (by using the EXISTS or NOT EXISTS
reserved words).
<P>
<LI>Find any values in the main
query that are equal to, greater than, or less than values returned
by the subquery (by using the ANY, IN, or ALL reserved words).
<P>
<LI>Create
subqueries within subqueries (nested subqueries).
<P>
<A NAME="CH035H203"></A>
</UL>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4><B>Forms</B></FONT>

<P>
<a name="dex19"></a>
<P>
<I>Forms</I> give users a way of entering data into
databases, displaying data on the screen, and printing data. For
example, database developers can create forms that act as switchboards,
using buttons or hyperlinks to navigate to the various objects
in a database. Developers can also create forms that are custom
dialog boxes that prompt users for the information required to
complete operations. Forms can contain text, graphics, data, color,
and ActiveX controls (formerly called OLE controls or custom controls).
For more information about ActiveX controls, see "<a href="034.htm#CH034H103">Office
Support for ActiveX</A>" in Chapter&nbsp;34, "Microsoft
Office Architecture."
<P>
To display data on a form from an underlying record source, such
as a table or query, set the <B>RecordSource</B> property to the
name of the table or query. You create a link between a form and
its record source by using graphical objects called controls.
For more information about controls, see "<A HREF="#CH035H207">Controls</A>"
later in this chapter. The default appearance of a form is controlled
by a form template. For more information, see "<A HREF="#CH035H208">Form
and Report Templates</A>" later in this chapter.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4><B><A NAME="CH035H204">Reports</A></B></FONT>

<P>
<a name="dex20"></a>
<P>
A <I>report</I> is an effective way to present data
from your Microsoft Access database in a printed format. Because
you have control over the size and appearance of everything in
a report, you can display the information the way you want to
see it. The data in a report comes from an underlying table, query,
or SQL statement. Other information in the report is stored in
the report's design. You create a link between a report and its
record source by using graphical objects called controls. For
more information about controls, see "<A HREF="#CH035H207">Controls</A>"
later in this chapter. The default appearance of a report is controlled
by a report template. For more information, see "<A HREF="#CH035H208">Form
and Report Templates</A>" later in this chapter.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4><B><A NAME="CH035H205">Macros</A></B></FONT>

<P>
<a name="dex21"></a>
<P>
A <I>macro</I> is a set of one or more actions that
perform a particular operation, such as opening a form or printing
a report. You can use macros to automate common tasks. You can
run macros directly from the <B>Macros</B> tab of the Database
window, from another macro or event procedure, or in response
to an event that occurs on a form, report, or control.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4><B><A NAME="CH035H206">Modules</A></B></FONT>

<P>
<a name="dex22"></a>
<P>
Visual Basic code provides another way to automate tasks in a
Microsoft Access database application. Visual Basic code is stored
in <I>modules</I>.
<P>
A database can contain two types of modules:
<P>
<UL TYPE="square">
<P>
<LI>Standard modules
<P>
Use standard modules to store code you may want to
run from anywhere in the application. You can call public procedures
in standard modules from expressions, macros, event procedures,
or procedures in other standard modules.
<P>
<LI>Class
modules
<P>
Use class modules to create your own custom objects.
The <B>Sub</B> and <B>Function</B> procedures that you define in a class module become methods of the custom object. The properties you define
with the <B>Property Get</B>, <B>Property Let</B>, and <B>Property Set</B> statements become properties of the custom object.
<P>
</UL>
<P>
Each form and report in your database can contain an associated
form module or report module. Form and report modules are a type
of class module, but you cannot save them separately from the
form or report that they belong to.
<P>
<a name="dex23"></a>
<P>
Use a form or report module to contain procedures associated with
event properties of the form or report. For example, code associated
with a form's <B>OnOpen</B> property runs when the form is opened.
Procedures&#173;associated event properties are called <I>event
procedures</I>. A form or report module can also contain
procedures that are not triggered by events.
<P>
A form or report module is part of the form or report's design.
Thus, if you copy a form or report to another database, its module
is copied with it; if you delete a form or report, its module
is deleted as well. Access creates the form or report
module automatically when you first add Visual Basic code to the
form or report.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4><B><A NAME="CH035H207">Controls</A></B></FONT>

<P>
<a name="dex24"></a>
<P>
In addition to the database objects discussed in the previous
sections, the forms and reports in a Microsoft Access database
contain an additional set of objects called <I>controls.
</I>All the information on a form or report is contained
in controls. Controls are objects on a form or report that display
data, perform actions, or decorate the form or report. For example,
you can use a text box control on a form or report to display
data, a command button control on a form to open another form
or report, or a line or rectangle control to separate and group
other controls to make them more readable.
<P>
Access includes built&#173;in controls and ActiveX controls,
which are all accessible through the toolbox in form Design view
or report Design view. Access includes the following
types of built&#173;in controls: text box, label, option group,
option button, check box, toggle button, combo box, list box,
command button, image control, bound object frame, unbound object
frame, subform/subreport, page break, line, rectangle, and tab
control. For information about these controls, see Microsoft online Help.
<P>
Controls can be bound, unbound, or calculated. A <I>bound
control</I> is tied to a field in an underlying table or
query. You use bound controls to display, enter, and update values
from fields in your database. A <I>calculated control</I>
uses an expression as its source of data. An expression can use
data from a field in an underlying table or query of a form or
report, or from another control on the form or report. An <I>unbound
control</I> does not have a data source. You can use unbound
controls to display information, lines, rectangles, and pictures.

<P>
<B>ActiveX Controls</B>
<P>
You can use ActiveX controls to add custom functionality to forms.
Microsoft Access&nbsp;97 includes two ActiveX controls: the Calendar
control, and the WebBrowser control. The Calendar control makes
it easy to display and update a monthly calendar on a form. You
can use the WebBrowser control to display Web pages and other
documents in an Access form. Before you can add the WebBrowser
control to a form, you must have Microsoft Internet Explorer version&nbsp;3.0 or later installed. For more information about the WebBrowser control,
see Chapter&nbsp;25, "<a href="025.htm">Web
Support in Microsoft Office Applications</A>." Additional
ActiveX controls are available in Microsoft Office&nbsp;97, Developer
Edition, and from independent software vendors.

<FONT SIZE=4><B><A NAME="CH035H208">Form and Report Templates</A></B></FONT>

<P>
<a name="dex25"></a>
<P>
When users create a form or report without using a wizard, Microsoft
Access uses a template to define the default characteristics of
the form or report. The template determines which sections a form
or report has and defines each section's dimensions. The template
also contains all the default property settings for the form.
<P>
The default templates for forms and reports are named Normal.
However, you can use any existing form or report as a template.
You specify which template you want to use on the <B>Forms/Reports</B>
tab in the <B>Options</B> dialog box (<B>Tools</B> menu). If you
specify a template other than Normal, this setting is stored in
the Windows registry in the <B>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\8.0\Access\Settings</B>
key and applies to all new forms or reports that the current user
creates. You can import templates (that is, forms or reports to
use as templates) to use in your Access database, and
you can export them to use them in other databases.
<P>
Form and report templates define:

<FONT SIZE=4><B><A NAME="CH035H209">Library Databases</A></B></FONT>

<P>
A library database is a collection of procedures and database
objects that you can call from any application. You can use libraries
to store routines that you use often, so that you do not have to write
the same routine for each application you create. You can also
use libraries to distribute new features to users.
<P>
<a name="dex26"></a>
<P>
To use a library database from your Microsoft Access application,
you must first establish a link, called a <I>reference</I>,
from your application to the library. You can establish a reference
in the <B>References</B> dialog box (<B>Tools</B> menu). Library
database files have an .mda file name extension.
<P>
For more information about creating and using library databases,
see Chapter&nbsp;12, "Using Library Databases and Dynamic&#173;Link
Libraries," in <I>Building Applications with Microsoft
Access&nbsp;97</I>.

<P>
<a name="dex27"></a>
<P>
<I>Add&#173;ins </I>are tools written within the Microsoft
Access environment that extend the functionality of the basic
product. These tools make difficult tasks easier, automate repetitive
operations, and add new features. Add&#173;ins can increase productivity
by focusing on a single task or function. You can create them
to use yourself, to use within your organization, or to distribute
along with a database application. You can also purchase add&#173;ins
created by independent software developers.
<P>
Access has three kinds of add&#173;ins: wizards, builders,
and menu add&#173;ins. Each type has its own advantages and uses.
A <I>wizard</I> helps a user create a new table, query,
form, report, or control. A <I>builder</I> helps a
user set properties in Design view. A <I>menu add&#173;in</I>
is not context&#173;specific and can be used anywhere in Access. Wizards and builders are available to the user through
the same interface that supports the Access wizards
and builders. By default, menu add&#173;ins are available through
the <B>Add&#173;Ins</B> submenu (<B>Tools</B> menu). The interface
through which an add&#173;in is available is determined by how
the add&#173;in is registered when it is installed.
<P>
Add&#173;in files are saved like library database files, with
the .mda file name extension. Add&#173;in files can also be saved
as MDE files. An MDE file has Visual Basic source code removed,
and the design of any forms, reports, and modules is secured.
MDE files have an .mde file name extension. For more information
about MDE files, see Chapter&nbsp;29, "<a href="029.htm">Workgroup
Features in Microsoft Access</A>." Users can add or
remove add&#173;ins from Access by pointing to <B>Add&#173;Ins</B>
(<B>Tools</B> menu) and then clicking <B>Add&#173;In Manager</B>.
<P>
For information about creating add&#173;ins in Access,
see Chapter&nbsp;17, "Creating Wizards, Builders, and Menu
Add&#173;ins," in <I>Building Applications with Microsoft
Access&nbsp;97</I>.

<P>
A wizard handles complex operations. It usually consists of a
series of dialog boxes that provide a step&#173;by&#173;step interface
to guide the user through the process of creating an object. Wizards
usually use forms, graphics, and helpful text to shield the user
from the technical intricacies of an operation. Access
Form and Report Wizards are examples of this type of add&#173;in.
These add&#173;ins guide you through creating forms and reports.
<P>
Microsoft Access provides direct support for several types of
wizards. As a result, the wizards you create are available through
the same user interface as the Access wizards. For example,
if you create or install a wizard to design a specific type of
form, it appears in the same list as the Access Form
Wizards. The types of wizards that Access supports include:
<P>
<UL TYPE="square">
<P>
<LI>Control Wizards
<P>
<LI>Form
Wizards
<P>
<LI>Query Wizards
<P>
<LI>Report
Wizards
<P>
<LI>Table Wizards

</UL>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><B>Builders</B></FONT>

<P>
<a name="dex29"></a>
<P>
A builder is a simpler tool than is a wizard. A builder usually
consists of a single dialog box or form that guides the user through
the process of setting a property, such as constructing an expression.
The Access Expression Builder is an example of this
type of add&#173;in.
<P>
As with wizards, Access provides direct support for
many types of builders. You can create or install builders for
any property, even those that Access does not provide
builders for. Also, you can install more than one builder for
the same property. Additional builders are available to users
through the standard builder interface. For example, if one or
more builders are already installed for a property, your builder
is available from a list of builders. The types of builders that
Access supports include:
<P>
<UL TYPE="square">
<P>
<LI>Property Builders
<P>
<LI>Expression
Builders
<P>
<A NAME="_Toc330030183"></A>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><B>Menu Add&#173;ins</B></FONT>

<P>
<a name="dex30"></a>
<P>
A menu add&#173;in is a general&#173;purpose tool that accomplishes
a task that does not fit into the wizard or builder categories.
A menu add&#173;in typically operates on multiple objects or on
the Access application itself. The Add&#173;In Manager
is an example of a menu add&#173;in.
<P>
Menu add&#173;ins are supported by Access through the
<B>Add&#173;Ins</B> submenu (<B>Tools</B> menu). When you install
a menu add&#173;in, the command to run it is added to the <B>Add&#173;Ins</B>
submenu. It is important to understand that menu add&#173;ins
are available to the user whenever the <B>Tools</B> menu is available.
After a menu add&#173;in is installed, you can also add a button
or command to run the menu add&#173;in from any toolbar by using
the <B>Customize</B> dialog box (<B>View</B> menu, <B>Toolbars</B>
submenu). This means that menu add&#173;ins are not context&#173;sensitive
like wizards and builders. A wizard is designed to aid the user
within a specific context, such as form or query design. A menu
add&#173;in is designed to perform a general function that may
not fit within the context of the user's current operation.
<P>
Several add&#173;ins are included with Access. Not all
of these add-ins are installed when you choose the Typical installation
during Setup. To install the add-ins you need, rerun Setup and
click <B>Add/Remove</B>; then select the <B>Wizards</B> or <B>Advanced
Wizards</B> option, as described in the following tables. The
functionality of an add-in is available to all databases opened
with a particular installation of Access.
<P>
<a name="dex31"></a>
<P>
The following table describes the add&#173;ins that are always
installed, regardless of the installation option you choose during
Setup.

<FONT SIZE=4><B><A NAME="CH035H211">Workgroup Information Files</A></B></FONT>

<P>
<a name="dex33"></a>
<P>
A <I>workgroup information file</I> is a file that
Microsoft Access reads when starting up; it contains information
about the users in a workgroup. If user&#173;level security is
being used, this information includes users' account names, their
passwords, and the groups that they belong to.
<P>
Even when user&#173;level security is not being explicitly used,
Access requires the workgroup information file in order
to start up. This is because user&#173;level security
is always activated before Access starts running to
eliminate the possibility of a security back door. Before user&#173;level
security is explicitly established, all users are automatically
logged on by using the default Admin user account. Once user&#173;level
security is established, a user must log on by using a particular
account. Each user account can have a password defined that is
required when logging on with the account. The default name for
the workgroup information file for Microsoft Access&nbsp;97 is
System.mdw.
<P>
<FONT COLOR="#0000FF" SIZE=2><B>Note&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</B></FONT>In
previous versions of Microsoft Access, user-preference settings
specified in the <B>Options</B> dialog box (<B>Tools</B> menu) are stored in
the workgroup information file. In Microsoft Access&nbsp;97, these
settings are stored in the Windows registry in the <B>HKEY_CURRENT_USERSoftware\Microsoft\Office\8.0\Access\Settings</B>
key.
<P>
For users to share data in a secured workgroup, they must use
the Workgroup Administrator to specify a workgroup information
file that defines the user and group accounts for the workgroup
before they start Access. Alternatively, users can specify
a workgroup information file by using the <B>/wrkgrp</B> command&#173;line
option when they start Microsoft Access.
<P>
The Workgroup Administrator is a separate application named Wrkgadm.exe
that is installed in the Windows\System folder (for Windows&nbsp;95)
or the Windows\System32 folder (for Windows&nbsp;NT Workstation
3.51 and 4.0). Running the Workgroup Administrator specifies the
workgroup information file in the Windows registry as the setting
for the <B>SystemDB</B> value in the <B>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Office\8.0\Access\Jet\3.5
\Engines</B> key. Using the <B>/wrkgrp</B> command&#173;line option
to specify a workgroup information file overrides the value stored
in the registry during that program session, but does not change
it.
<P>
The workgroup information file that a user specifies is the file
that Access uses every time it starts up, until the
user specifies some other file. If a user does not belong to a
secure workgroup and has not specified a workgroup information
file, Access uses the default System.mdw file created
when Access was installed. The default System.mdw file
is located in the Windows\System folder (Windows&nbsp;95) or the
Windows\System32 folder (Windows&nbsp;NT Workstation 3.51 and
4.0).
<P>
After users have specified a workgroup information file, they
should back up their System.mdw file. If the file somehow becomes
corrupted, the user must restore the backup copy, get a new copy
from a workgroup administrator (if that is who originally provided
the file), or re&#173;create it. Users must have a valid workgroup
information file to run Access.
<P>
For more information about the Access user&#173;level
security model, see "<a href="029.htm#CH029H101">Security
Features in Microsoft Access</A>" in Chapter&nbsp;29,

<FONT SIZE=4><B><A NAME="CH035H212">Microsoft Access and the Microsoft Jet
Database Engine</A></B></FONT>

<P>
<a name="dex34"></a>
<P>
Together, Microsoft Access and the Microsoft Jet database engine
form a complete database management system (DBMS). Microsoft Access
is responsible for the user interface and all the ways that users
view, edit, and manipulate data through forms, queries, reports,
and so forth. Microsoft Jet&nbsp;&#151; the data manager component
of the DBMS&nbsp;&#151; retrieves data from and stores data
in user and system databases.
<P>
Microsoft Jet is a relational database engine that handles all
database processing for Access. Microsoft Jet can also
provide data to ODBC client applications.
<P>
Microsoft Jet is made up of a set of dynamic&#173;link libraries
(DLLs):
<P>
<UL TYPE="square">
<P>
<LI>Microsoft Jet DLL (Msjet35.dll)
<P>
Msjet35.dll is the main program that evaluates and
carries out requests for data. If the request is for native data&nbsp;&#151;
data stored in the Microsoft Access Database (MDB) format&nbsp;&#151;
Msjet35.dll also handles the reading and writing of the data.
If the request involves non&#173;native data, then Msjet35.dll
makes calls to either the ODBC Driver Manager DLL (Odbc32.dll)
or one of the external installable ISAM DLLs, as explained later
in this section.
<P>
<LI>Data Access Objects DLL (Dao350.dll)
<P>
Dao350.dll is the Microsoft Jet component that provides
a developer interface to Microsoft Jet. Data Access Objects (DAO)
includes a rich, high&#173;level set of objects that insulates
developers from the physical details of reading and writing records.
<P>
<LI>Installable ISAM DLLs
<P>
Microsoft Jet provides access to several external
Indexed Sequential Access Method (ISAM) format files by using
a series of installable DLL files referred to as installable ISAMs.
Microsoft Jet supports the external ISAM formats shown in the
following table.

<P>
</UL>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><B>Linked Tables</B></FONT>

<P>
<a name="dex35"></a>
<P>
In general, you store data locally in tables in the database.
You can also create links to tables in other Access
databases, to data in other file formats (such as Microsoft Excel,
dBASE, and Paradox), and to ODBC data sources, such as Microsoft
SQL Server. These links are stored in the database container and
act like native tables. You can use a linked table just as you
would use any other table in your Access database. For
example, you can create forms, reports, and queries that use the
external table. Any changes to the table are reflected in the
linked database. An icon that represents the linked table appears
in the Database window along with icons for the local tables in
the database, so you can open the linked table whenever you want
to. For more information about linked tables, see "<a href="017.htm#CH017H204">Using
External Data in Microsoft Access</A>" in Chapter&nbsp;17,
"Switching to Microsoft Access."
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><B>Direct Table Opening</B></FONT>

<P>
You cannot use the Access user interface to open an
external table directly. However, you can open external tables
directly by using DAO code in Visual Basic. A developer may use
this method to get a value quickly from a table that does not
need to be accessed very often in the application.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><B>ODBC Connectivity</B></FONT>

<P>
<a name="dex36"></a>
<P>
With Microsoft Jet, users can retrieve data from ODBC data sources. The ODBC standard is typically
used to connect to server&#173;based database systems. Access includes ODBC drivers for Microsoft SQL Server. The ODBC
standard can also be used to connect to nonserver databases and
spreadsheets.
<P>
As with installable ISAM data, Access can connect to
ODBC data sources by linking or opening tables. Access
also supports SQL pass&#173;through queries with ODBC data sources,
as described earlier in this chapter. The disadvantage of applications
that use pass&#173;through queries is that they are not portable.
For example, an application written for Microsoft SQL Server fails
if it attempts to gain access to an Oracle server, because it
contains server&#173;specific commands. Users create SQL pass&#173;through
queries by clicking <B>SQL Specific</B> on the <B>Query</B> menu
and then clicking <B>Pass&#173;Through</B>.
<P>
For an in&#173;depth discussion of Microsoft Jet and its architecture,
see the <I>Microsoft Jet Database Engine Programmer's Guide</I>,
which is published by Microsoft Press and available wherever computer
books are sold. For more information about Microsoft Press books,
see Appendix&nbsp;E, "<A HREF="appe.htm">Other
Support Resources</A>."

<a name="dex37"></a>
<P>
<B>Separating the Application from the Data</B>
<P>
If you are distributing an application to a number of users, or
if the data is located on a server, consider using a back&#173;end
database to hold the tables that contain the data and a front&#173;end
database to hold the application's other objects. You can then
base all objects in the application on linked tables from the
back&#173;end database. For an example of this type of architecture,
see the Orders sample application (Orders.mdb), installed in the
Program&nbsp;Files\Microsoft Office\Office\Samples folder when
you choose a Custom installation during Setup. The forms, queries,
reports, and other objects are contained in Orders.mdb. The database
tables, however, are in the Northwind database (Northwind.mdb).
<P>
When you separate the application's data from its objects, you
can distribute upgraded queries, forms, reports, macros, and modules
in the new version of the front&#173;end database without disturbing
the application's data. Similarly, you can exchange one set of
data for another or back up the data on the back&#173;end database
without affecting the objects in the front&#173;end database.
If the data is located on a server, you can reduce the network
load and improve performance by having users run the front&#173;end
database on their workstations rather than from the server. An
additional advantage of separating the data from the rest of the
application is that you can upgrade the custom application to
future versions of Microsoft Access independently of the shared
database tables. This makes it easier for users with different
versions of Microsoft Access to use the same data.

Menu Settings</A></B></FONT>
<P>
In Microsoft Access, you can organize the commands on toolbars,
menu bars, and shortcut menus the way you want so that you can find
and use them quickly. In previous versions of Access,
toolbars contained only buttons. In Microsoft Access&nbsp;97,
toolbars can contain buttons, menus, or both. This means that
menu bars and shortcut menus are now different types of toolbars;
therefore, you can customize all three the same way. For example,
although the built&#173;in menu bar still appears by default at
the top of the screen and contains standard menus such as <B>File</B>,
<B>Edit</B>, and <B>View</B>, you can customize it by adding or
removing buttons and menus or by moving it to a different location.
<P>
In addition to customizing the built&#173;in toolbars, menu bars,
and shortcut menus, you can create your own custom toolbars, menu
bars, and shortcut menus. To create and customize toolbars, menu
bars, and shortcut menus, and to set properties that affect how
they look and behave, use the <B>Customize</B> dialog box (<B>View</B>
menu, <B>Toolbars</B> submenu). By customizing toolbars, menu
bars, and shortcut menus, you can change Access to better
suit the needs of your workgroup. For example, you can add frequently
used commands and dialog box options to toolbars and remove items
that users rarely use.
<P>
New custom toolbars, menu bars, and shortcut menus are stored
in the database file and are available to all users who share
the database. If you want to copy custom toolbars and menus from
another Access database, you can import them. You cannot
import a single toolbar, menu bar, or shortcut menu; you must
import all the toolbars, menu bars, and shortcut menus in the
database file.

Conflicts can occur in Microsoft Access when a database is being
replicated or when more than one user attempts to edit the same
record in a shared database.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4><B><A NAME="CH035H215">Replication Conflicts</A></B></FONT>

<P>
During replication setup&nbsp;&#151; for example, when a user
drags a database to the Windows&nbsp;95 Briefcase&nbsp;&#151;
the Jet database engine requests globally unique identifiers (GUIDs)
from the operating system that are associated with each row of
data in the Design Master. These GUIDs are then copied into any
replica databases. If a row changes in the Design Master or a
replica, a counter is incremented for the row. This makes it easy
for Microsoft Access to compare the values of rows, detect that
a change has been made, and replicate the changed data in other
databases. If the same row is changed in more than one database
simultaneously, Access selects between them based on
the following rules:
<P>
<UL TYPE="square">
<P>
<LI>Access chooses
the database that has the highest value for its counter. The row
that has changed most often has a higher counter, because the
counter is incremented every time a row is changed.
<P>
<LI>If
both rows have been changed the same number of times (counters
are the same on both rows in both databases), Access
chooses a database randomly, as the replication logic cannot reasonably
know which of the two rows has the correct data.
<P>
</UL>
<P>
Regardless of how the data is selected, users who submit the data
that is not chosen are told by the Conflict Resolver in Access that their data was rejected. Users can then resubmit their
change or accept the other data.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4><B><A NAME="CH035H216">Locking Conflicts</A></B></FONT>

<P>
If record locking is set to <B>No Locks</B>, there may be locking
conflicts when more than one user attempts to edit or save the
same record in a shared database. Users can set record locking
on the <B>Advanced</B> tab of the <B>Options</B> dialog box (<B>Tools</B>
menu).
<P>
The <B>No Locks</B> setting allows more than one user to edit
a record simultaneously, but the record is locked during the instant
when it is being saved. If two users attempt to save changes to
the same record, Microsoft Access displays a message to the second
user who tries to save the record. This user can then discard
the record, copy the record to the Clipboard, or replace the changes
made by the other user. By using this last option, it is possible
for users to write over one another's changes.
<P>
For more information about record locking, see "<a href="029.htm#CH029H102">Multiuser
Applications and Locking</A>" in Chapter&nbsp;29, "Workgroup
Features in Microsoft Access."
