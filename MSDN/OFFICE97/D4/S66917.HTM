<H2>table row:</H2><P>A contiguous sequence of paragraphs within the text stream of a document that is partitioned into subsequences of paragraphs called <B>cells.</B> The last paragraph of each cell is terminated by a special paragraph mark called a <B>cell mark.</B> Following the cell mark that ends the last cell of a table row, the table row is terminated by a special paragraph mark called a <B>row mark</B>. When Word displays a table row, it assigns a rectangular shaped display area to each cell in the row. All of the cell display area's top's are aligned at the same vertical position on a page. The leftmost display area in a table row is assigned to the 0th cell of the row; the next display area to the right is assigned to the 1st cell of the row, etc. The text of the cell is wrapped to fit its display area.<B> </B>As more text is added to the cell, the cell display area extends downward. A set of table properties that determine how many cells are in a row, where the horizontal boundaries of cell display areas are, and what borders are drawn around each cell in the table is stored for the <B>row mark </B>that marks the end of the table row.</P></BODY></HTML>
