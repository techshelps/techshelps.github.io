<H2>ROUTING SLIP</H1>A routing slip is stored in the main document stream as an RS (Routing Slip) structure followed by a set of variable length data. After the RS are 4 null terminated strings. Each string is preceded by a short containing the string length (including the null terminator). The strings are: the subject, the message text, status and title. Following these strings are a variable number (rs.cRecip) of Routing Recipient (RR) records. Each RR is immediately followed by a variable number (rr.cb) of bytescontaining private data, which is in turn followed by a null terminated string containing the recipient name.</P></BODY></HTML>
