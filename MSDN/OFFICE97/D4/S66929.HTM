<H2>FORMAT OF THE TABLE STREAM</H1>Word stores various plcfs and tables with the stream named either "0Table" or "1Table".  Ordinarily a file will contain only one table stream.  However, in some unusual circumstances (e.g. crash during file save) a file might have two table streams.  In that case the bit field fWhichTblStm in the FIB should be used to determine which table stream to read.  If fWhichTblStm is 0, then the FIB refers to the stream named "0Table", and if fWhichTblStm is 1, then the FIB refers to the stream name "1Table".</P>

<P>Written immediately after the <B>clx</B>. This is recorded in all Word documents. The <B>sttbfffn</B> is an sttbf where each string is instead an FFN structure (note that just as for a pascal-style string, the first byte in the FFN records the total number of bytes not counting the count byte itself). The names of the fonts correspond to the ftc codes in the CHP structure. For example, the first font name listed corresponds is the name for ftc = 0.</P>
<P><B>sttbttmbd </B>(true type font embedding string table)</P>
<P>Written immediately after the end of previously recorded structure if document contains embedded true type fonts.</P>

<P><B>autosave</B><B>Source </B>(name of original)</P>
<P>Written immediately after the <B>sttbfAssoc</B> table. This field only appears in autosave files. These files are normal Word documents in every other way. Also, autosaved files are typically in the complex file format except that we don't overwrite the tables (plcf*, etc.). I.e., an autosaved file is typically longer than the equivalent Word document.</P>
