<H2>bin table</H2><P>Each <B>FKP</B> can be viewed as bucket or <B>bin</B> that contains the properties of a certain range of <B>FC</B>s in the Word file. In Word files, a <B>PLC</B>,<B> </B>the <B>plcfbte </B>(<B>PL</B>ex of F<B>C</B>s containing <B>B</B>in <B>T</B>able <B>E</B>ntries) is maintained. It<B> </B>records the association between a particular range of <B>FC</B>s and the <B>PN </B>(<B>P</B>age <B>N</B>umber) of the <B>FKP </B>that contains the properties for that <B>FC</B> range in the file. In a <B>complex (fast-saved)</B> Word document,<B> FKP </B>pages are intermingled with pages of text<B> </B>in a random pattern which reflects the history of past fast saves. In a complex document, a <B>plcfbteChpx</B> which records the location of every <B>CHPX FKP</B> must be stored and a <B>plcfbtePapx</B> which records the location of every <B>PAPX FKP </B>must be stored<B>. </B>In a <B>non-complex, full-saved</B> document, all of the <B>CHPX FKPS </B>are recorded in consecutive 512-byte pages with the <B>FKP</B>s recorded in ascending <B>FC </B>order, as are all of the <B>PAPX FKPS</B>.  A plcfbteLvcx serves the same purpose for LVCX FKPS.</P>
<P>In a full save document, the plcfbte's may not have been able to be expanded during the save process due to a lack of RAM.  In that situation, the plcfbte's will be interspersed with the property pages in a linked list of FBD pages.</P></BODY></HTML>
