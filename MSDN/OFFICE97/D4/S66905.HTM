<H2>PLCF (PLex of Cps (or FCs) stored in File):</H2><P>A data structure consisting of two parallel arrays that allows a relation to be established between a certain <B>CP</B> position in the document text stream (or <B>FC</B> position in a file) and an arbitrary data structure. It consists of an array of <B>n+1 CP</B>s or <B>FC</B>s followed by an array of <B>n</B> instances of a particular arbitrary data structure. In typical usage, the <B>nth CP </B>or<B> FC</B> of the <B>PLCF</B> is in one-to-one correspondence with the <B>nth </B>instance<B> </B>of the arbitrary data structure, with the <B>n+1st</B> <B>CP </B>or<B> FC</B> marking the limit of the <B>nth</B> instance's influence. When a <B>PLCF</B> is used to record a partitioning of the document's text stream or a partitioning of the bytes stored in a file, the 0th <B>CP/FC </B>stored in the <B>PLCF</B> will be 0. When a <B>PLCF </B>is used to record the location of certain marks or links within the document text stream, the 0th <B>CP/FC</B> stored in the <B>PLCF </B>will record the position of the 0th mark or link. To properly interpret a <B>PLCF</B> stored in a Word file, the length of the stored <B>PLCF</B> and the length of the arbitrary data structure stored in the <B>PLCF </B>must be known<B>. </B>The length of the stored <B>PLCF</B> is recorded in the <B>FIB. </B>The lengths of the data structures stored in <B>PLCF</B>s within Word files are listed later in this document.</P></BODY></HTML>
