<H2>field</H2><P>A field is a two-part structure that may be recorded in the CP stream of a document. The first part of the structure contains <B>field codes</B> which instruct Window's Word to insert text into the second part of the structure, the <B>field result</B>. Fields in Window's Word are used to insert text from an external file or to quote another part of a document, to mark index and table of contents entries and produce indexes and tables of contents, maintain DDE links to other programs, to produce dates, times, page numbers, sequence numbers, etc. There are 91 different field types.</P>
<P>A <B>field begin mark</B> delimits the beginning of a field and precedes any of the field codes stored in the field. The end of the field codes and the beginning of the field result is marked with the <B>field separator</B> and the field result and the field itself are terminated by a <B>field end mark.</B></P>
<P>The CP locations of the field begin mark, field separator, and field end mark are recorded in <B>plcfld</B> data structures that are maintained for the main document and all of the subdocuments of the main document whenever a field is inserted or edited. A field can be <B>dead</B>, in which case it has no field separator, no field result, and no entry in the <B>plcfld</B>.  (See the definition of the FLD structure for a list of possible dead field code strings.)  An array of two-byte <B>FLD</B> structures is stored in the <B>plcfld</B> in one-to-one correspondence with the CP entries recorded. An <B>FLD</B> associated with a <B>field begin mark</B> records the type of the field. An <B>FLD</B> associated with the <B>field end mark</B> records the current status of the field (i.e. whether the result is dirty or has been edited, whether the result has been locked, etc.)</P>
<P>Fields may be nested. 20 levels of nesting are permitted.</P></BODY></HTML>
