<H2>Object Container Hierarchy</H2>Escher has an object containership hierarchy similar to other drawing programs. At the root of the hierarchy is a drawing group object. There is one drawing group per client document. Drawing groups contain drawings. Drawings in turn contain shapes that are the objects that actually mark a page. Next to the drawings in a drawing group is a collection that contains the images and pictures used by the drawings. Escher keeps pictures in a separate collection to be able to incrementally load and save them. </P>

A few other points are worth noting</P>
<SPAN CLASS="list"><UL><LI CLASS="ULI1">Associated with each shape is a piece of client data that keeps the shape's anchor, text and OLE data, as well as host specific properties. The format of this structure is host-defined.</LI><LI CLASS="ULI1">Shapes store their properties in a separate structure called a property table. The property table is basically a sorted list of property id-value pairs. </LI><LI CLASS="ULI1">Each drawing group has a shape property table that stores the defaults for new shapes. </LI><LI CLASS="ULI1">Each drawing has a collection of rules that govern the shapes in the drawing. </LI><LI CLASS="ULI1">This object hierarchy does <B>not</B> exactly correspond to the record hierarchy in the file format.  In the file format, drawings are not saved inside drawing groups, but in separate top-level containers.  In this scheme, hosts can save drawing group information with per-document information, and save drawing information with per-sheet, per-slide, or per-page information.</LI></UL></SPAN></FONT></BODY>
