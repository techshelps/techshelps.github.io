<BR></P>Remarks</P>
An annuity is a series of fixed cash payments made over a period of time. An annuity can be a loan (such as a home mortgage) or an investment (such as a monthly savings plan).</P>
For all <SPAN CLASS="pop">arguments</SPAN>, cash paid out (such as deposits to savings) is represented by negative numbers; cash received (such as dividend checks) is represented by positive numbers.</P>
<SPAN CLASS="lee">Rate</SPAN> is calculated by iteration. Starting with the value of <SPAN CLASS="narg">guess</SPAN>, <SPAN CLASS="lee">Rate</SPAN> cycles through the calculation until the result is accurate to within 0.00001 percent. If <SPAN CLASS="lee">Rate</SPAN> can't find a result after 20 tries, it fails. If your guess is 10 percent and <SPAN CLASS="lee">Rate</SPAN> fails, try a different value for <SPAN CLASS="narg">guess</SPAN>.</P>

Example</P>
This example uses the <SPAN CLASS="lee">Rate</SPAN> function to calculate the interest rate of a loan given the total number of payments (<SPAN CLASS="cte">TotPmts</SPAN>), the amount of the loan payment (<SPAN CLASS="cte">Payment</SPAN>), the present value or principal of the loan (<SPAN CLASS="cte">PVal</SPAN>), the future value of the loan (<SPAN CLASS="cte">FVal</SPAN>), a number that indicates whether the payment is due at the beginning or end of the payment period (<SPAN CLASS="cte">PayType</SPAN>), and an approximation of the expected interest rate (<SPAN CLASS="cte">Guess</SPAN>).</P>
