<BR></P>Remarks</P>
An annuity is a series of fixed cash payments made over a period of time. An annuity can be a loan (such as a home mortgage) or an investment (such as a monthly savings plan).</P>
The <SPAN CLASS="narg">rate</SPAN> and <SPAN CLASS="narg">nper</SPAN> <SPAN CLASS="pop">arguments</SPAN> must be calculated using payment periods expressed in the same units. For example, if <SPAN CLASS="narg">rate</SPAN> is calculated using months, <SPAN CLASS="narg">nper</SPAN> must also be calculated using months.</P>
For all arguments, cash paid out (such as deposits to savings) is represented by negative numbers; cash received (such as dividend checks) is represented by positive numbers.</P>

Example</P>
This example uses the <SPAN CLASS="lee">Pmt</SPAN> function to return the monthly payment for a loan over a fixed period. Given are the interest percentage rate per period (<SPAN CLASS="cte">APR / 12</SPAN>), the total number of payments (<SPAN CLASS="cte">TotPmts</SPAN>), the present value or principal of the loan (<SPAN CLASS="cte">PVal</SPAN>), the future value of the loan (<SPAN CLASS="cte">FVal</SPAN>), and a number that indicates whether the payment is due at the beginning or end of the payment period <SPAN CLASS="cte">(PayType).</SPAN></P>
