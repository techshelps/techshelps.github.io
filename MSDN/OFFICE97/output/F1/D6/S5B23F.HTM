<H2>Hide Method</H2>Applies To</P>
<SPAN CLASS="eln">UserForm</SPAN> object.</P>
Description</P>
Hides an object but doesn't unload it.</P>
Syntax</P>
<SPAN CLASS="p">object</SPAN><B>.</B><SPAN CLASS="lee">Hide</SPAN></P>
The <SPAN CLASS="p">object</SPAN> placeholder represents an <SPAN CLASS="pop">object expression</SPAN> that evaluates to an object in the Applies To list. If <SPAN CLASS="p">object</SPAN> is omitted, the <SPAN CLASS="lee">UserForm</SPAN> with the <SPAN CLASS="pop">focus</SPAN> is assumed to be <SPAN CLASS="p">object</SPAN>.</P>
Remarks</P>
When an object is hidden, it's removed from the screen and its <SPAN CLASS="lee">Visible</SPAN> property is set to <SPAN CLASS="lee">False</SPAN>. A hidden object's controls aren't accessible to the user, but they are available programmatically to the running application, to other processes that may be communicating with the application through <SPAN CLASS="pop">dynamic data exchange (DDE)</SPAN> or Automation, and to <SPAN CLASS="lee">Timer</SPAN> control events.</P>
When a <SPAN CLASS="lee">UserForm </SPAN>is hidden, the user can't interact with the application until all code in the event procedure that caused the <SPAN CLASS="lee">UserForm</SPAN> to be hidden has finished executing.</P>
If the <SPAN CLASS="lee">UserForm</SPAN> isn't loaded when the <SPAN CLASS="lee">Hide</SPAN> method is invoked, the <SPAN CLASS="lee">Hide</SPAN> method loads the <SPAN CLASS="crkt">UserForm</SPAN> but doesn't display it.</P>
See Also</P>
<SPAN CLASS="eln">Load</SPAN> statement, <SPAN CLASS="eln">Show</SPAN> method, <SPAN CLASS="eln">Unload</SPAN> statement.</P>
Example </P>
The following example assumes two <SPAN CLASS="eln">UserForms</SPAN> in a program. In UserForm1's Initialize event, UserForm2 is loaded and shown. When the user clicks UserForm2, it is hidden and UserForm1 appears. When UserForm1 is clicked, UserForm2 is shown again.</P>

<pre><code>' This is the Initialize event procedure for UserForm1.
Private Sub UserForm_Initialize()
    Load UserForm2
    UserForm2.Show
End Sub
' This is the Click event of UserForm2.
Private Sub UserForm_Click()
    UserForm2.Hide
End Sub

' This is the click event for UserForm1.
Private Sub UserForm_Click()
    UserForm2.Show
End Sub</code></pre>
