<H1>Shape Object</H1>Description</P>
Represents an object in the drawing layer, such as an AutoShape, freeform, OLE object, ActiveX control, or picture. The <SPAN CLASS="lee">Shape</SPAN> object is a member of the <SPAN CLASS="lee">Shapes</SPAN> collection, which includes all the shapes in the main story of a document or in all the headers and footers of a document.</P>
A shape is always attached to an anchoring range. You can position the shape anywhere on the page that contains the anchor.</P>
<SPAN CLASS="nh">Note</SPAN>   There are three objects that represent shapes: the <SPAN CLASS="lee">Shapes</SPAN> collection, which represents all the shapes on a document; the <SPAN CLASS="lee">ShapeRange</SPAN> collection, which represents a specified subset of the shapes on a document (for example, a <SPAN CLASS="lee">ShapeRange</SPAN> object could represent shapes one and four on the document, or it could represent all the selected shapes on the document); and the <SPAN CLASS="lee">Shape</SPAN> object, which represents a single shape on a document. If you want to work with several shapes at the same time or with shapes within the selection, use a <SPAN CLASS="lee">ShapeRange</SPAN> collection.</P>
Using the Shape Object</P>
This section describes how to:</P>
<SPAN CLASS="list"><UL><LI CLASS="ULI1">Return an existing shape on a document, indexed by name or number.</LI><LI CLASS="ULI1">Return a shape or shapes within a selection.</LI><LI CLASS="ULI1">Return a newly created shape.</LI><LI CLASS="ULI1">Return a single shape from within a group.</LI><LI CLASS="ULI1">Return a newly formed group of shapes.
</LI></UL></SPAN>Returning an Existing Shape on a Document</P>
Use <SPAN CLASS="lee">Shapes</SPAN>(<SPAN CLASS="p">index</SPAN>), where <SPAN CLASS="p">index</SPAN> is the name or the index number, to return a single <SPAN CLASS="lee">Shape</SPAN> object. The following example horizontally flips shape one on the active document.</P>

<pre><code>ActiveDocument.Shapes(1).Flip msoFlipHorizontal</code></pre>
The following example horizontally flips the shape named "Rectangle 1" on the active document.</P>

<pre><code>ActiveDocument.Shapes("Rectangle 1").Flip msoFlipHorizontal</code></pre>
Each shape is assigned a default name when it is created. For example, if you add three different shapes to a document, they might be named "Rectangle 2," "TextBox 3," and "Oval 4." To give a shape a more meaningful name, set the <SPAN CLASS="lee">Name</SPAN> property.</P>
Returning a Shape or Shapes Within a Selection</P>
Use <SPAN CLASS="lee">Selection.ShapeRange</SPAN>(<SPAN CLASS="p">index</SPAN>), where <SPAN CLASS="p">index</SPAN> is the name or the index number, to return a <SPAN CLASS="lee">Shape</SPAN> object that represents a shape within a selection. The following example sets the fill for the first shape in the selection, assuming that the selection contains at least one shape.</P>

<pre><code>Selection.ShapeRange(1).Fill.ForeColor.RGB = RGB(255, 0, 0)</code></pre>
The following example sets the fill for all the shapes in the selection, assuming that the selection contains at least one shape.</P>

<pre><code>Selection.ShapeRange.Fill.ForeColor.RGB = RGB(255, 0, 0)</code></pre>
Returning a Newly Created Shape</P>
To add a <SPAN CLASS="lee">Shape</SPAN> object to the collection of shapes for the specified document and return a <SPAN CLASS="lee">Shape</SPAN> object that represents the newly created shape, use one of the following methods of the <SPAN CLASS="lee">Shapes</SPAN> collection: <SPAN CLASS="lee">AddCallout</SPAN>, <SPAN CLASS="lee">AddCurve</SPAN>, <SPAN CLASS="lee">AddLabel</SPAN>, <SPAN CLASS="lee">AddLine</SPAN>, <SPAN CLASS="lee">AddOleControl</SPAN>, <SPAN CLASS="lee">AddOleObject</SPAN>, <SPAN CLASS="lee">AddPolyline</SPAN>, <SPAN CLASS="lee">AddShape</SPAN>, <SPAN CLASS="lee">AddTextbox</SPAN>, <SPAN CLASS="lee">AddTextEffect</SPAN>, or <SPAN CLASS="lee">BuildFreeForm</SPAN>. The following example adds a rectangle to the active document.</P>

<pre><code>ActiveDocument.Shapes.AddShape msoShapeRectangle, 50, 50, 100, 200</code></pre>
Returning a Single Shape from Within a Group</P>
Use <SPAN CLASS="lee">GroupItems</SPAN>(<SPAN CLASS="p">index</SPAN>), where <SPAN CLASS="p">index</SPAN> is the shape name or the index number within the group, to return a <SPAN CLASS="lee">Shape</SPAN> object that represents a single shape in a grouped shape.</P>
Returning a Newly Formed Group of Shapes</P>
Use the <SPAN CLASS="lee">Group</SPAN> or <SPAN CLASS="lee">Regroup</SPAN> method to group a range of shapes and return a single <SPAN CLASS="lee">Shape</SPAN> object that represents the newly formed group. After a group has been formed, you can work with the group the same way you work with any other shape.</P>
Anchoring and Positioning a Shape</P>
Every <SPAN CLASS="lee">Shape</SPAN> object is anchored to a range of text. A shape is anchored to the beginning of the first paragraph that contains the anchoring range. The shape will always remain on the same page as its anchor.</P>
You can view the anchor itself by setting the <SPAN CLASS="lee">ShowObjectAnchors</SPAN> property to <SPAN CLASS="lee">True</SPAN>. The shape's <SPAN CLASS="lee">Top</SPAN> and <SPAN CLASS="lee">Left</SPAN> properties determine its vertical and horizontal positions. The shape's <SPAN CLASS="lee">RelativeHorizontalPosition</SPAN> and <SPAN CLASS="lee">RelativeVerticalPosition</SPAN> properties determine whether the position is measured from the anchoring paragraph, the column that contains the anchoring paragraph, the margin, or the edge of the page.</P>
If the <SPAN CLASS="lee">LockAnchor</SPAN> property for the shape is set to <SPAN CLASS="lee">True</SPAN>, you cannot drag the anchor from its position on the page.</P>
Formatting a Shape</P>
Use the <SPAN CLASS="lee">Fill</SPAN> property to return the <SPAN CLASS="lee">FillFormat</SPAN> object, which contains all the properties and methods for formatting the fill of a closed shape. The <SPAN CLASS="lee">Shadow</SPAN> property returns the <SPAN CLASS="lee">ShadowFormat</SPAN> object, which you use to format a shadow. Use the <SPAN CLASS="lee">Line</SPAN> property to return the <SPAN CLASS="lee">LineFormat</SPAN> object, which contains properties and methods for formatting lines and arrows. The <SPAN CLASS="lee">TextEffect</SPAN> property returns the <SPAN CLASS="lee">TextEffectFormat</SPAN> object, which you use to format WordArt. The <SPAN CLASS="lee">Callout</SPAN> property returns the <SPAN CLASS="lee">CalloutFormat</SPAN> object, which you use to format line callouts. The <SPAN CLASS="lee">WrapFormat</SPAN> property returns the <SPAN CLASS="lee">WrapFormat</SPAN> object, which you use to define how text wraps around shapes. The <SPAN CLASS="lee">ThreeD</SPAN> property returns the <SPAN CLASS="lee">ThreeDFormat</SPAN> object, which you use to create 3-D shapes. You can use the <SPAN CLASS="lee">PickUp</SPAN> and <SPAN CLASS="lee">Apply</SPAN> methods to transfer formatting from one shape to another.</P>
Use the <SPAN CLASS="lee">SetShapesDefaultProperties</SPAN> method for a <SPAN CLASS="lee">Shape</SPAN> object to set the formatting for the default shape for the document. New shapes inherit many of their attributes from the default shape.</P>
Other Important Shape Properties</P>
Use the <SPAN CLASS="lee">Type</SPAN> property to specify the type of shape: freeform, AutoShape, OLE object, callout, or linked picture, for instance. Use the <SPAN CLASS="lee">AutoShapeType</SPAN> property to specify the type of AutoShape: oval, rectangle, or balloon, for instance.</P>
Use the <SPAN CLASS="lee">Width</SPAN> and <SPAN CLASS="lee">Height</SPAN> properties to specify the size of the shape.</P>
The <SPAN CLASS="lee">TextFrame</SPAN> property returns the <SPAN CLASS="lee">TextFrame</SPAN> object, which contains all the properties and methods for attaching text to shapes and linking the text between text frames.</P>
Remarks</P>
<SPAN CLASS="lee">Shape</SPAN> objects are anchored to a range of text but are free-floating and can be positioned anywhere on the page. <SPAN CLASS="lee">InlineShape</SPAN> objects are treated like characters and are positioned as characters within a line of text. You can use the <SPAN CLASS="lee">ConvertToInlineShape</SPAN> method and the <SPAN CLASS="lee">ConvertToShape</SPAN> method to convert shapes from one type to the other. You can convert only pictures, OLE objects, and ActiveX controls to inline shapes.</P>
