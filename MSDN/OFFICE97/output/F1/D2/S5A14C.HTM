ActiveX control, Bound Object Frame control, Chart control, Check Box control, Combo Box control, Command Button control, Form, Form section, Image control, Label control, Line control, List Box control, <SPAN CLASS="eln">Module</SPAN> object, <SPAN CLASS="eln">Modules</SPAN> collection, Option Button control, Option Group control, Page, Page Break control, Rectangle control, <SPAN CLASS="eln">Reference</SPAN> object, <SPAN CLASS="eln">Reference</SPAN> object (Extensibility Object Model), Report, Report section, Subform/Subreport control, Tab control, Text Box control, Toggle Button control, Unbound Object Frame control.</P>
Description</P>
You can use the <SPAN CLASS="eln">Name</SPAN> property to specify or determine the <SPAN CLASS="pop">string expression</SPAN> that identifies the name of a <SPAN CLASS="pop">form</SPAN>, <SPAN CLASS="pop">report</SPAN>, <SPAN CLASS="pop">section</SPAN>, <SPAN CLASS="pop">control</SPAN>, or Reference object.</P>
Setting</P>
A valid name must conform to the <SPAN CLASS="pop">object-naming rules</SPAN> for Microsoft Access. For forms and reports, the name may be up to 64 characters long. For controls, the name may be as long as 255 characters.</P>
For forms and reports, set the <SPAN CLASS="eln">Name</SPAN> property by clicking <SPAN CLASS="eln">Save</SPAN> on the <SPAN CLASS="eln">File</SPAN> menu in <SPAN CLASS="pop">Design view</SPAN> and entering a valid name. To change the name of an existing form or report in the <SPAN CLASS="pop">Database window</SPAN>, click the name, then either click <SPAN CLASS="eln">Rename</SPAN> on the <SPAN CLASS="eln">Edit</SPAN> menu or click the name again. You can also change the name by right-clicking it and clicking <SPAN CLASS="eln">Rename</SPAN> on the <SPAN CLASS="pop">shortcut menu</SPAN>. To change the name of an existing form or report when the object is open, click <SPAN CLASS="eln">Save As/Export</SPAN> on the <SPAN CLASS="eln">File</SPAN> menu.</P>
For a section or control, you can set this property by using the <SPAN CLASS="jump">property sheet</SPAN>, a <SPAN CLASS="jump">macro</SPAN>, or <SPAN CLASS="jump">Visual Basic</SPAN>. You can use the <SPAN CLASS="eln">Name</SPAN> property in expressions for forms and reports.</P>
You can set this property only in Design view.</P>
<SPAN CLASS="nh">Note</SPAN>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a <SPAN CLASS="eln">Reference</SPAN> object, this property is read-only in all views.</P>
Remarks</P>
The default name for new forms and reports is the object name plus a unique integer. For example, the first new form is Form1, the second new form is Form2, and so on. A form can't have the same name as another <SPAN CLASS="pop">system object</SPAN>, such as the Screen object.</P>
For an <SPAN CLASS="pop">unbound control</SPAN>, the default name is the type of control plus a unique integer. For example, if the first control you add to a form is a text box, its <SPAN CLASS="eln">Name</SPAN> property setting is Text1.</P>
For a <SPAN CLASS="pop">bound control</SPAN>, the default name is the name of the field in the underlying source of data. If you create a control by dragging a field from the field list, the field's FieldName property setting is copied to the control's <SPAN CLASS="eln">Name</SPAN> property box.</P>
You can't use "Form" or "Report" to name a control or section.</P>
Controls on the same form or report can't have the same name, but controls on different forms or reports can have the same name. A control and a section on the same form can't share the same name.</P>
