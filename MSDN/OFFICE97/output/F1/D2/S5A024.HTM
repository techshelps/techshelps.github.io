<H2>Activate, Deactivate Events</H2>Applies To</P>
Form, Report.</P>
Description</P>
<SPAN CLASS="list"><UL><LI CLASS="ULI1">The Activate event occurs when a <SPAN CLASS="pop">form</SPAN> or <SPAN CLASS="pop">report</SPAN> receives the <SPAN CLASS="pop">focus</SPAN> and becomes the active window.</LI><LI CLASS="ULI1">The Deactivate event occurs when a form or report loses the focus to a Table, Query, Form, Report, Macro, or Module window, or to the Database window.
</LI></UL></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="nh">Note</SPAN>   The Deactivate event doesn't occur when a form or report loses the focus to a dialog box, to a form for which the PopUp property is set to Yes, or to a window in another application.</P>
Remarks</P>
To run a <SPAN CLASS="pop">macro</SPAN> or <SPAN CLASS="pop">event procedure</SPAN> when these events occur, set the OnActivate<SPAN CLASS="jump"> or </SPAN>OnDeactivate property to the name of the macro or to [Event Procedure].</P>
You can make a form or report active by opening it, clicking it or a <SPAN CLASS="pop">control</SPAN> on it, or by using the SetFocus method in Visual Basic (for forms only).</P>
The Activate event can occur only when a form or report is visible.</P>
The Activate event occurs before the <SPAN CLASS="jump">GotFocus</SPAN> event; the Deactivate event occurs after the <SPAN CLASS="jump">LostFocus</SPAN> event.</P>
When you switch between two open forms, the Deactivate event occurs for the form being switched from, and the Activate event occurs for the form being switched to. If the forms contain no visible, enabled controls, the LostFocus event occurs for the first form before the Deactivate event, and the GotFocus event occurs for the second form after the Activate event.</P>
When you first open a form, the following events occur in this order:</P>
    Open <img src="rarrow.gif"> Load <img src="rarrow.gif"> Resize <img src="rarrow.gif"> Activate <img src="rarrow.gif"> Current</P>
When you close a form, the following events occur in this order:</P>
    Unload <img src="rarrow.gif"> Deactivate <img src="rarrow.gif"> Close</P>
