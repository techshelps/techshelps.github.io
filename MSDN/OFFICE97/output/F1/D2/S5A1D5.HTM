<H2>Repaint Method</H2>Applies To</P>
<SPAN CLASS="eln">Form</SPAN> object.</P>
Description</P>
The <SPAN CLASS="eln">Repaint</SPAN> method completes any pending screen updates for a specified <SPAN CLASS="pop">form</SPAN>. When performed on a form, the <SPAN CLASS="eln">Repaint</SPAN> method also completes any pending recalculations of the form's <SPAN CLASS="pop">controls</SPAN>.</P>
Syntax</P>
<SPAN CLASS="p">form</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="l">.Repaint</SPAN></P>
The <SPAN CLASS="eln">Repaint</SPAN> method has the following argument.</P>

<BR></P>Remarks</P>
Microsoft Access sometimes waits to complete pending screen updates until it finishes other tasks. With the <SPAN CLASS="eln">Repaint</SPAN> method, you can force immediate repainting of the controls on the specified form. You can use the <SPAN CLASS="eln">Repaint</SPAN> method:</P>
<SPAN CLASS="list"><UL><LI CLASS="ULI1">When you change values in a number of fields. Unless you force a repaint, Microsoft Access might not display the changes immediately, especially if other fields, such as those in an expression in a <SPAN CLASS="pop">calculated control</SPAN>, depend on values in the changed fields.</LI><LI CLASS="ULI1">When you want to make sure that a form displays data in all of its fields. For example, fields containing <SPAN CLASS="pop">OLE objects</SPAN> often don't display their data immediately after you open a form.
</LI></UL></SPAN>This method doesn't cause a <SPAN CLASS="pop">requery</SPAN> of the database, nor does it show new or changed records in the form's underlying record source. You can use the Requery method to requery the source of data for the form or one of its controls.</P>
<SPAN CLASS="nh">Notes</SPAN></P>
<SPAN CLASS="list"><UL><LI CLASS="ULI1">Don't confuse the <SPAN CLASS="eln">Repaint</SPAN> method with the Refresh method, or with the <SPAN CLASS="eln">Refresh</SPAN> command on the <SPAN CLASS="eln">Records</SPAN> menu. The <SPAN CLASS="eln">Refresh</SPAN> method and <SPAN CLASS="eln">Refresh</SPAN> command show changes you or other users have made to the underlying record source for any of the currently displayed records in forms and datasheets. The <SPAN CLASS="eln">Repaint</SPAN> method simply updates the screen when repainting has been delayed while Microsoft Access completes other tasks.</LI><LI CLASS="ULI1">The <SPAN CLASS="eln">Repaint</SPAN> method differs from the Echo method in that the <SPAN CLASS="eln">Repaint</SPAN> method forces a single immediate repaint, while the <SPAN CLASS="eln">Echo</SPAN> method turns repainting on or off.</LI></UL></SPAN>See Also</P>
<SPAN CLASS="eln">Recalc</SPAN> method, RepaintObject action, <SPAN CLASS="eln">RepaintObject</SPAN> method.</P>
Example</P>
The following example uses the <SPAN CLASS="eln">Repaint</SPAN> method to repaint a form when the form receives the focus:</P>

<pre><code>Private Sub Form_Activate()
    Me.Repaint
End Sub</code></pre>
