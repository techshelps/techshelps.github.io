<H2>Print Event</H2>Applies To</P>
Report section.</P>
Description</P>
The Print event occurs after data in a <SPAN CLASS="pop">report</SPAN> <SPAN CLASS="pop">section</SPAN> is formatted for printing, but before the section is printed.</P>
Remarks</P>
To run a <SPAN CLASS="pop">macro</SPAN> or <SPAN CLASS="pop">event procedure</SPAN> when this event occurs, set the OnPrint property to the name of the macro or to [Event Procedure].</P>
For a report <SPAN CLASS="pop">detail section</SPAN>, the Print event occurs for each record in the section just before Microsoft Access prints the data in the record. A Print event procedure or macro has access to the data in the current record.</P>
For report <SPAN CLASS="pop">group headers</SPAN>, the Print event occurs for each new group, and a Print macro or event procedure has access to the data in the group header and the data in the first record in the detail section. For report <SPAN CLASS="pop">group footers</SPAN>, the Print event occurs for each new group, and a Print macro or event procedure has access to the data in the group footer and the data in the last record in the detail section.</P>
You can use the Print event to run a macro or event procedure only after Microsoft Access has prepared data for printing on a page. For example, you can calculate running page totals that are printed in the page header or footer.</P>
For changes that affect page layout, such as displaying or hiding controls, use the <SPAN CLASS="jump">Format</SPAN> event.</P>
The Print event occurs only for sections that are actually printed. If you need access to data from sections that aren't printed (for example, you are keeping a running sum, but are only printing certain pages), use the Format event instead.</P>
The <SPAN CLASS="jump">Page</SPAN> event occurs after all the Format events for the report, and after all the Print events for a page, but before the page is actually printed.</P>
