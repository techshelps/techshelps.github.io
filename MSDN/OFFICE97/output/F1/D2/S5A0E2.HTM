Description</P>
The <SPAN CLASS="eln">Echo</SPAN> method specifies whether Microsoft Access <SPAN CLASS="pop">repaints</SPAN> the display screen.</P>
Syntax</P>
<SPAN CLASS="l">Application.Echo </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="p">echoon</SPAN>[<SPAN CLASS="l">, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="p">statusbartext</SPAN>]</P>

<BR></P>Remarks</P>
If you are running Visual Basic code that makes a number of changes to objects displayed on the screen, your code may be faster if you turn off screen repainting until the procedure has finished running. You may also want to turn repainting off if your code makes changes that the user shouldn't see or doesn't need to see.</P>
The <SPAN CLASS="eln">Echo</SPAN> method doesn't suppress the display of <SPAN CLASS="pop">modal</SPAN> dialog boxes, such as error messages, or <SPAN CLASS="pop">pop-up forms</SPAN>, such as property sheets.</P>
If you turn screen repainting off, the screen won't show any changes, even if the user presses <SPAN CLASS="kn">CTRL+BREAK</SPAN> or Visual Basic encounters a <SPAN CLASS="pop">breakpoint</SPAN>, until you turn screen repainting back on. You may want to create a <SPAN CLASS="pop">macro</SPAN> that turns repainting on and assign the macro to a key or custom menu command. You can then use the key combination or menu command to turn repainting on if it has been turned off in Visual Basic.</P>
If you turn screen repainting off and then try to step through your code, you won't be able to see your progress through the code, or any other visual cues, until repainting is turned back on. However, your code will continue to execute.</P>
<SPAN CLASS="nh">Note</SPAN>   Don't confuse the <SPAN CLASS="eln">Echo</SPAN> method with the Repaint method. The <SPAN CLASS="eln">Echo</SPAN> method turns screen repainting on or off. The <SPAN CLASS="eln">Repaint</SPAN> method forces an immediate screen repainting.</P>

Example</P>
The following example uses the <SPAN CLASS="eln">Echo</SPAN> method to prevent the screen from being repainted while certain operations are underway. While the procedure opens a form and minimizes it, the user only sees an hourglass icon to indicate that processing is taking place, and the screen isn't repainted. When this task is completed, the hourglass changes back to a pointer and screen repainting is turned back on.</P>
