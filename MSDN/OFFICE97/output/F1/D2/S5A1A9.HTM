Description</P>

Setting</P>
The <B>PictureData</B> property setting is the <SPAN CLASS="eln">PictureData</SPAN> property of another <SPAN CLASS="pop">image control</SPAN>, <SPAN CLASS="pop">command button</SPAN>, <SPAN CLASS="pop">toggle button</SPAN>, form, or report.</P>
You set this property by using <SPAN CLASS="jump">Visual Basic</SPAN>.</P>

You can use this property to display different background pictures in a form, depending on actions taken by the user. For example, you might open a Customers form using a different background picture depending on whether the form is opened for data entry or for browsing.</P>

Example</P>
The following example uses three image controls to animate a butterfly image across a form. The Hidden1 image control contains a picture of a butterfly with its wings up and the Hidden2 image control contains a picture of the same butterfly with its wings down. Both image controls have their <SPAN CLASS="eln">Visible</SPAN> property set to <SPAN CLASS="eln">False</SPAN> (0). The <SPAN CLASS="eln">TimerInterval</SPAN> property is set to 200. Each time the Timer event occurs, the picture in the image control Visible1 is changed by using the <SPAN CLASS="eln">PictureData</SPAN> property of the hidden image controls, and the visible image control is moved 200 twips to the right. The visible image control is moved back to the left side of the form when its <SPAN CLASS="eln">Left</SPAN> property value is greater than the width of the form stored in the public variable <SPAN CLASS="cte">gfrmWidth</SPAN>. The value of <SPAN CLASS="cte">gfrmWidth</SPAN> is set to <SPAN CLASS="cte">Me.Width</SPAN> in the form's open event.</P>

<pre><code>Private Sub Form_Timer()
    Static intPic As Integer
    Select Case intPic
        Case Is = 1
            Me!Visible1.PictureData = Me!Hidden1.PictureData
        Case Is = 2
            Me!Visible1.PictureData = Me!Hidden2.PictureData
        Case Else
    End Select
    If intPic = 2 Then intPic = 0
    intPic = intPic + 1
    If (Me!Visible1.Left &gt; gfrmWidth) Then Me!Visible1.Left = 0
    Me!Visible1.Left = Me!Visible1.Left + 200
End Sub</code></pre>
