<H2>Bookmark Property</H2>Applies To</P>
Form.</P>
Description</P>
You can use the <SPAN CLASS="eln">Bookmark</SPAN> property with forms to set a <SPAN CLASS="pop">bookmark</SPAN> that uniquely identifies a particular <SPAN CLASS="pop">record</SPAN> in the form's underlying table, query, or <SPAN CLASS="pop">SQL statement</SPAN>.</P>
Setting</P>
The <SPAN CLASS="eln">Bookmark</SPAN> property contains a <SPAN CLASS="pop">string expression</SPAN> created by Microsoft Access.</P>
You can set this property by using a <SPAN CLASS="jump">macro</SPAN> or <SPAN CLASS="jump">Visual&nbsp;Basic</SPAN>.</P>
<SPAN CLASS="nh">Note</SPAN>   You get or set the form's <SPAN CLASS="eln">Bookmark</SPAN> property separately from the DAO Bookmark property of the underlying table or query.</P>
Remarks</P>
When a bound form is opened in <SPAN CLASS="pop">Form view</SPAN>, each record is assigned a unique bookmark. In Visual&nbsp;Basic, you can save the bookmark for the <SPAN CLASS="pop">current record</SPAN> by assigning the value of the form's <SPAN CLASS="eln">Bookmark</SPAN> property to a string variable. To return to a saved record after moving to a different record, set the form's <SPAN CLASS="eln">Bookmark</SPAN> property to the value of the saved string variable. You can use the StrComp function to compare a <SPAN CLASS="eln">Variant</SPAN> or string variable to a bookmark, or when comparing a bookmark against a bookmark. The third argument for the <SPAN CLASS="eln">StrComp</SPAN> function must be set to a value of zero.</P>
<SPAN CLASS="nh">Note</SPAN>   Bookmarks are not saved with the records they represent and are only valid while the form is open. They are re-created by Microsoft Access each time a bound form is opened.</P>
There is no limit to the number of bookmarks you can save if each is saved with a unique string variable.</P>
The <SPAN CLASS="eln">Bookmark</SPAN> property is only available for the form's current record. To save a bookmark for a record other than the current record, move to the desired record and assign the value of the <SPAN CLASS="eln">Bookmark</SPAN> property to a string variable that identifies this record.</P>
You can use bookmarks in any form that is based entirely on Microsoft Access tables. However, other database products may not support bookmarks. For example, you can't use bookmarks in a form based on a <SPAN CLASS="pop">linked table</SPAN> that has no primary index.</P>
<SPAN CLASS="pop">Requerying</SPAN> a form invalidates any bookmarks set on records in the form. However, clicking <SPAN CLASS="eln">Refresh</SPAN> on the <SPAN CLASS="eln">Records</SPAN> menu doesn't affect bookmarks.</P>
Since Microsoft Access creates a unique bookmark for each record in a form's recordset when a form is opened, a form's bookmark will not work on another recordset, even when the two recordsets are based on the same table, query, or SQL statement. For example, suppose you open a form bound to the Customers table. If you then open the Customers table by using Visual&nbsp;Basic and use the Seek method to locate a specific record in the table, you can't set the form's <SPAN CLASS="eln">Bookmark</SPAN> property to the current table record. To perform this kind of operation you can use the FindFirst method with the form's RecordsetClone property.</P>
An error occurs if you set the <SPAN CLASS="eln">Bookmark</SPAN> property to a string variable and then try to return to that record after the record has been deleted.</P>
The value of the <SPAN CLASS="eln">Bookmark</SPAN> property isn't the same as a record number.</P>

<SPAN CLASS="eln">Bookmark</SPAN> property ("DAO Language Reference"), <SPAN CLASS="eln">Bookmarkable</SPAN> property ("DAO Language Reference"), <SPAN CLASS="eln">RecordsetClone</SPAN> property.</P>
Example</P>
To test the following example with the Northwind sample database, you need to add a command button named <SPAN CLASS="cte">cmdFindContactName</SPAN> to the Suppliers form, and then add the following code to the button's Click event. When the button is clicked, the user is asked to enter a portion of the contact name to find. If the name is found, the form's <SPAN CLASS="eln">Bookmark</SPAN> property is set to the <SPAN CLASS="eln">Recordset</SPAN> object's DAO <SPAN CLASS="eln">Bookmark</SPAN> property, which moves the form's current record to the found name.</P>

<pre><code>Private Sub cmdFindContactName_Click()
    Dim rst As Recordset, strCriteria As String
    strCriteria = "[ContactName] Like '*" &amp; InputBox("Enter the " _
        &amp; "first few letters of the name to find") &amp; "*'"

    Set rst = Me.RecordsetClone
    rst.FindFirst strCriteria
    If rst.NoMatch Then
        MsgBox "No entry found"
    Else
        Me.Bookmark = rst.Bookmark
    End If
End Sub</code></pre>
