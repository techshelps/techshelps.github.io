<H2>Print Event — Macros</H2>Description</P>
To run a <SPAN CLASS="pop">macro</SPAN> when the Print event occurs, set the OnPrint property to the name of the macro.</P>
Remarks</P>
You can use the PrintCount property to check whether the Print event has occurred more than once for a record. For example, if part of a record is printed on one page and the rest is printed on the next page, the Print event occurs twice, and the <SPAN CLASS="eln">PrintCount</SPAN> property is set to 2. You can check the <SPAN CLASS="eln">PrintCount</SPAN> property value for Print macros that should run only once for a record, such as a macro that shows totals for the records on a page in a page footer.</P>
You can use the <SPAN CLASS="jump">CancelEvent</SPAN> action in a Print macro to cancel printing of a section. Microsoft Access prints a blank area on the page where the section would have been when the <SPAN CLASS="pop">report</SPAN> is printed. You can use the CancelEvent action to skip a record in a report and leave a blank area on the page in its place when the report is printed.</P>
A Print macro runs only for sections that are actually printed.</P>
<B>Note</B>   You can't use a Print macro to set properties for any object.</P>
