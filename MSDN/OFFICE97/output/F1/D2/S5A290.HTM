<H1>DateCreated, LastUpdated Properties</H1>Applies To</P>
<SPAN CLASS="eln">Document</SPAN> object, <SPAN CLASS="eln">QueryDef</SPAN> object, <SPAN CLASS="eln">Recordset</SPAN> object, Table-Type <SPAN CLASS="eln">Recordset</SPAN> object, <SPAN CLASS="eln">TableDef</SPAN> object.</P>
Description</P>
<SPAN CLASS="list"><UL><LI CLASS="ULI1"><SPAN CLASS="eln">DateCreated</SPAN> — returns the date and time that an object was created, or the date and time a <SPAN CLASS="pop">base table</SPAN> was created if the object is a table-type Recordset object (<SPAN CLASS="pop">Microsoft Jet workspaces</SPAN> only).</LI><LI CLASS="ULI1"><SPAN CLASS="eln">LastUpdated</SPAN> — returns the date and time of the most recent change made to an object, or to a base table if the object is a table-type <SPAN CLASS="eln">Recordset</SPAN> object (Microsoft Jet workspaces only).
</LI></UL></SPAN>Return Values</P>
The return value is a Variant (<SPAN CLASS="eln">Date/Time</SPAN> subtype).</P>
Remarks</P>
For table-type <SPAN CLASS="eln">Recordset</SPAN> objects, the date and time settings are derived from the computer on which the base table was created or last updated. For other objects, <SPAN CLASS="eln">DateCreated</SPAN> and <SPAN CLASS="eln">LastUpdated</SPAN> return the date and time that the object was created or&nbsp;last updated. In a multiuser environment, users should get these settings directly from the file server to avoid discrepancies in the <SPAN CLASS="eln">DateCreated</SPAN> and <SPAN CLASS="eln">LastUpdated</SPAN> property settings.</P>
Example</P>
This example demonstrates the <SPAN CLASS="eln">DateCreated</SPAN> and <SPAN CLASS="eln">LastUpdated</SPAN> properties by adding a new <SPAN CLASS="eln">Field</SPAN> to an existing <SPAN CLASS="eln">TableDef</SPAN> and by creating a new <SPAN CLASS="eln">TableDef</SPAN>. The DateOutput function is required for this procedure to run.</P>

Example (Microsoft Access)</P>
The following example enumerates through all <SPAN CLASS="eln">QueryDef</SPAN> objects in the database and lists those which have been created or changed within the last sixty days:</P>

<pre><code>Sub TimeUpdated()

Example (Microsoft Excel)</P>
This example displays the dates and times when the Customer recordset in the Nwindex.mdb database was created and last updated.</P>
To create the Nwindex.mdb database, run the Microsoft Excel example for the <SPAN CLASS="lee">CreateDatabase</SPAN> method.</P>

<pre><code>Dim creation As Variant, changed As Variant
Dim db As Database, td As TableDef
Set db = Workspaces(0).OpenDatabase(Application.Path &amp; "\NWINDEX.MDB")
