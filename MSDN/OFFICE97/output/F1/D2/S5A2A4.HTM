<H1>Errors Collection</H1>Description</P>
An <SPAN CLASS="eln">Errors</SPAN> collection contains all stored <SPAN CLASS="eln">Error</SPAN> objects, each of which pertains to a single operation involving <SPAN CLASS="pop">DAO</SPAN>.</P>
Remarks</P>
Any operation involving DAO objects can generate one or more errors. As each error occurs, one or more <SPAN CLASS="eln">Error</SPAN> objects are placed in the <SPAN CLASS="eln">Errors</SPAN> collection of the <SPAN CLASS="eln">DBEngine</SPAN> object. When another DAO operation generates an error, the <SPAN CLASS="eln">Errors</SPAN> collection is cleared, and the new set of <SPAN CLASS="eln">Error</SPAN> objects is placed in the <SPAN CLASS="eln">Errors</SPAN> collection. The highest-numbered object in the <SPAN CLASS="eln">Errors</SPAN> collection (<SPAN CLASS="cte">DBEngine.Errors.Count - 1</SPAN>) corresponds to the error reported by the Microsoft Visual&nbsp;Basic for Applications (VBA) <SPAN CLASS="eln">Err</SPAN> object.</P>
DAO operations that don't generate an error have no effect on the <SPAN CLASS="eln">Errors</SPAN> collection.</P>
Elements of the <SPAN CLASS="eln">Errors</SPAN> collection aren't appended as they typically are with other collections, so the <SPAN CLASS="eln">Errors</SPAN> collection doesn't support the <SPAN CLASS="eln">Append</SPAN> and <SPAN CLASS="eln">Delete</SPAN> methods.</P>
The set of <SPAN CLASS="eln">Error</SPAN> objects in the <SPAN CLASS="eln">Errors</SPAN> collection describes one error. The first <SPAN CLASS="eln">Error</SPAN> object is the lowest level error, the second the next higher level, and so forth. For example, if an <SPAN CLASS="pop">ODBC</SPAN> error occurs while trying to open a Recordset object, the first error object contains the lowest level ODBC error; subsequent errors contain the ODBC errors returned by the various layers of ODBC. In this case, the ODBC driver manager, and possibly the driver itself, return separate <SPAN CLASS="eln">Error</SPAN> objects. The last <SPAN CLASS="eln">Error</SPAN> object contains the DAO error indicating that the object couldn't be opened.</P>
Enumerating the specific errors in the <SPAN CLASS="eln">Errors</SPAN> collection enables your error-handling routines to more precisely determine the cause and origin of an error, and take appropriate steps to recover.</P>
<SPAN CLASS="nh">Note</SPAN>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you use the <SPAN CLASS="eln">New</SPAN> keyword to create an object that causes an error either before or while being placed into the <SPAN CLASS="eln">Errors</SPAN> collection, the collection doesn't contain error information about that object, because the new object is not associated with the <SPAN CLASS="eln">DBEngine</SPAN> object. However, the error information is available in the VBA <SPAN CLASS="eln">Err</SPAN> object.</P>
