<H2>Refresh Method</H2>Applies To</P>
<SPAN CLASS="eln">Form</SPAN> object.</P>
Description</P>
The <SPAN CLASS="eln">Refresh</SPAN> method immediately updates the records in the underlying record source for a specified <SPAN CLASS="pop">form</SPAN> or <SPAN CLASS="pop">datasheet</SPAN> to reflect changes made to the data by you and other users in a multiuser environment.</P>
Syntax</P>
<SPAN CLASS="p">form</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="l">.Refresh</SPAN></P>
The <SPAN CLASS="eln">Refresh</SPAN> method has the following argument.</P>

<BR></P>Remarks</P>
Using the <SPAN CLASS="eln">Refresh</SPAN> method is equivalent to clicking <SPAN CLASS="eln">Refresh</SPAN> on the <SPAN CLASS="eln">Records</SPAN> menu.</P>
Microsoft Access refreshes records automatically, based on the <SPAN CLASS="eln">Refresh Interval</SPAN> setting on the <SPAN CLASS="eln">Advanced</SPAN> tab of the <SPAN CLASS="eln">Options</SPAN> dialog box, available by clicking <SPAN CLASS="eln">Options</SPAN> on the <SPAN CLASS="eln">Tools</SPAN> menu. ODBC data sources are refreshed based on the <SPAN CLASS="eln">ODBC Refresh Interval</SPAN> setting on the <SPAN CLASS="eln">Advanced</SPAN> tab of the <SPAN CLASS="eln">Options</SPAN> dialog box. You can use the <SPAN CLASS="eln">Refresh</SPAN> method to view changes that have been made to the current set of records in a form or datasheet since the record source underlying the form or datasheet was last refreshed.</P>
The <SPAN CLASS="eln">Refresh</SPAN> method shows only changes made to records in the current set. Since the <SPAN CLASS="eln">Refresh</SPAN> method doesn't actually requery the database, the current set won't include records that have been added or exclude records that have been deleted since the database was last requeried. Nor will it exclude records that no longer satisfy the criteria of the query or filter. To requery the database, use the Requery method. When the record source for a form is requeried, the current set of records will accurately reflect all data in the record source.</P>
<SPAN CLASS="nh">Notes</SPAN></P>
<SPAN CLASS="list"><UL><LI CLASS="ULI1">It's often faster to refresh a form or datasheet than to requery it. This is especially true if the initial query was slow to run.</LI><LI CLASS="ULI1">Don't confuse the <SPAN CLASS="eln">Refresh</SPAN> method with the Repaint method, which <SPAN CLASS="pop">repaints</SPAN> the screen with any pending visual changes.

Example</P>
The following example uses the <SPAN CLASS="eln">Refresh</SPAN> method to update the records in the underlying record source for the form Customers whenever the form receives the focus:</P>

<pre><code>Private Sub Form_Activate()
    Me.Refresh
End Sub</code></pre>
