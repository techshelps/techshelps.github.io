<BR></P>Remarks</P>
You can use the <SPAN CLASS="eln">SetFocus</SPAN> method when you want a particular field or control to have the focus so that all user input is directed to this object.</P>
In order to read some of the properties of a control, you need to ensure that the control has the focus. For example, a <SPAN CLASS="pop">text box</SPAN> must have the focus before you can read its Text property.</P>
Other properties can be set only when a control doesn't have the focus. For example, you can't set a control's Visible or Enabled properties to <SPAN CLASS="eln">False</SPAN> (0) when that control has the focus.</P>
You can also use the <SPAN CLASS="eln">SetFocus</SPAN> method to navigate in a form according to certain conditions. For example, if the user selects <SPAN CLASS="eln">Not applicable</SPAN> for the first of a set of questions on a form that's a questionnaire, your Visual Basic code might then automatically skip the questions in that set and move the focus to the first control in the next set of questions.</P>
You can move the focus only to a visible control or form. A form and controls on a form aren't visible until the form's <SPAN CLASS="jump">Load</SPAN> event has finished. Therefore, if you use the <SPAN CLASS="eln">SetFocus</SPAN> method in a form's Load event to move the focus to that form, you must use the Repaint method before the <SPAN CLASS="eln">SetFocus</SPAN> method.</P>
You can't move the focus to a control if its <SPAN CLASS="eln">Enabled</SPAN> property is set to <SPAN CLASS="eln">False</SPAN>. You must set a control's <SPAN CLASS="eln">Enabled</SPAN> property to <SPAN CLASS="eln">True</SPAN> (–1) before you can move the focus to that control. You can, however, move the focus to a control if its <SPAN CLASS="eln">Locked</SPAN> property is set to&nbsp;<SPAN CLASS="eln">True</SPAN>.</P>
If a form contains controls for which the <SPAN CLASS="eln">Enabled</SPAN> property is set to <SPAN CLASS="eln">True</SPAN>, you can't move the focus to the form itself. You can only move the focus to controls on the form. In this case, if you try to use <SPAN CLASS="eln">SetFocus</SPAN> to move the focus to a form, the focus is&nbsp;set to the control on the form that last received the focus.</P>
<SPAN CLASS="nh">Tip</SPAN>   You can use the <SPAN CLASS="eln">SetFocus</SPAN> method to move the focus to a <SPAN CLASS="pop">subform</SPAN>, which is a type of control. You can also move the focus to a control on a subform by using the <SPAN CLASS="eln">SetFocus</SPAN> method twice, moving the focus first to the subform and then to the control on the subform.</P>
