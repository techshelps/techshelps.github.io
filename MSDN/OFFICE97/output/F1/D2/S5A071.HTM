Description</P>

<SPAN CLASS="nh">Notes</SPAN></P>
<SPAN CLASS="list"><UL><LI CLASS="ULI1">The Click event applies only to <SPAN CLASS="pop">forms</SPAN>, form <SPAN CLASS="pop">sections</SPAN>, and <SPAN CLASS="pop">controls</SPAN> on a form, not controls on a <SPAN CLASS="pop">report</SPAN>.</LI><LI CLASS="ULI1">This event doesn't apply to <SPAN CLASS="pop">check boxes</SPAN>, <SPAN CLASS="pop">option buttons</SPAN>, or <SPAN CLASS="pop">toggle buttons</SPAN> in an <SPAN CLASS="pop">option group</SPAN>. It applies only to the option group itself.</LI><LI CLASS="ULI1">This event doesn't apply to a <SPAN CLASS="pop">label</SPAN> attached to another control, such as the label for a <SPAN CLASS="pop">text box</SPAN>. It applies only to "freestanding" labels. Clicking an attached label has the same effect as clicking the associated control. The normal events for the control occur, not any events for the attached label.</LI><LI CLASS="ULI1">This event applies to a <SPAN CLASS="pop">control containing a hyperlink</SPAN>.
</LI></UL></SPAN>Remarks</P>
To run a <SPAN CLASS="pop">macro</SPAN> or <SPAN CLASS="pop">event procedure</SPAN> when this event occurs, set the OnClick property to the name of the macro or to [Event Procedure].</P>
On a form, this event occurs when the user clicks a blank area or <SPAN CLASS="pop">record selector</SPAN> on the form.</P>
For a control, this event occurs when the user:</P>
<SPAN CLASS="list"><UL><LI CLASS="ULI1">Clicks a control with the left mouse button. Clicking a control with the right or middle mouse button does not trigger this event.</LI><LI CLASS="ULI1">Clicks a control containing hyperlink data with the left mouse button. Clicking a control with the right or middle mouse button does not trigger this event. When the user moves the mouse pointer over a control containing hyperlink data, the mouse pointer changes to a "hand" icon. When the user clicks the mouse button, the hyperlink is activated, and then the Click event occurs.</LI><LI CLASS="ULI1">Selects an item in a <SPAN CLASS="pop">combo box</SPAN> or <SPAN CLASS="pop">list box</SPAN>, either by pressing the arrow keys and then pressing the <SPAN CLASS="kn">ENTER</SPAN> key or by clicking the mouse button.</LI><LI CLASS="ULI1">Presses <SPAN CLASS="kn">SPACEBAR</SPAN> when a command button, check box, option button, or toggle button has the <SPAN CLASS="pop">focus</SPAN>.</LI><LI CLASS="ULI1">Presses the <SPAN CLASS="kn">ENTER</SPAN> key on a form that has a command button whose Default property is set to Yes.</LI><LI CLASS="ULI1">Presses the <SPAN CLASS="kn">ESC</SPAN> key on a form that has a command button whose Cancel property is set to Yes.</LI><LI CLASS="ULI1">Presses a control's <SPAN CLASS="pop">access key</SPAN>. For example, if a command button's Caption property is set to &amp;Go, pressing <SPAN CLASS="kn">ALT+G</SPAN> triggers the event.
</LI></UL></SPAN>Typically, you attach a Click <SPAN CLASS="pop">event procedure</SPAN> or <SPAN CLASS="pop">macro</SPAN> to a command button to carry out commands and command-like actions. For the other applicable controls, use this event to trigger actions in response to one of the occurrences discussed earlier in this topic.</P>
For a command button only, Microsoft Access runs the macro or event procedure specified by the OnClick property when the user chooses the command button by pressing the <SPAN CLASS="kn">ENTER</SPAN> key or an access key. The macro or event procedure runs once. If you want the macro or event procedure to run repeatedly while the command button is pressed, set its AutoRepeat property to Yes. For other types of controls, you must click the control by using the mouse button to trigger the Click event.</P>
The Click event for a command button occurs when you choose the command button. In addition, if the command button doesn't already have the focus when you choose it, the <SPAN CLASS="jump">Enter</SPAN> and <SPAN CLASS="jump">GotFocus</SPAN> events for the command button occur before the Click event.</P>
Double-clicking a control causes both the <SPAN CLASS="jump">DblClick</SPAN> and Click events to occur. For command buttons, double-clicking triggers the following events, in this order:</P>
    MouseDown <img src="rarrow.gif"> MouseUp <img src="rarrow.gif"> Click <img src="rarrow.gif"> DblClick <img src="rarrow.gif"> Click</P>
You can use a <SPAN CLASS="jump">CancelEvent</SPAN> action in a DblClick macro to cancel the second Click event. For more information, see the DblClick event topic.</P>
The Click event for an option group occurs after you change the value of one of the controls in the option group by clicking the control. For example, if you click a toggle button, option button, or check box in an option group, the Click event for the option group occurs after the <SPAN CLASS="jump">BeforeUpdate and AfterUpdate</SPAN> events for the option group.</P>
<SPAN CLASS="nh">Tip</SPAN>   To distinguish between the left, right, and middle mouse buttons, use the MouseDown and MouseUp events.</P>
