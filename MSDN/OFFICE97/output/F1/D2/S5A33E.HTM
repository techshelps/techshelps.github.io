<H1>Var, VarP Functions</H1>Description</P>
Return estimates of the variance for a population or a population sample represented as a set of values contained in a specified field on a query.</P>
Syntax</P>
<SPAN CLASS="eln">Var(</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="p">expr</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="eln">)</SPAN></P>
<SPAN CLASS="eln">VarP(</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="p">expr</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="eln">)</SPAN></P>
The <SPAN CLASS="p">expr</SPAN> placeholder represents a <SPAN CLASS="pop">string expression</SPAN> identifying the field that contains the numeric data you want to evaluate or an expression that performs a calculation using the data in that field. Operands in <SPAN CLASS="p">expr</SPAN> can include the name of a table field, a constant, or a function (which can be either intrinsic or user-defined but not one of the&nbsp;other <SPAN CLASS="pop">SQL</SPAN> aggregate functions).</P>
Remarks</P>
The <SPAN CLASS="eln">VarP</SPAN> function evaluates a population, and the <SPAN CLASS="eln">Var</SPAN> function evaluates a population sample.</P>
If the underlying query contains fewer than two records, the <SPAN CLASS="eln">Var</SPAN> and <SPAN CLASS="eln">VarP</SPAN> functions return a Null value, which indicates that a variance can't be calculated.</P>
You can use the <SPAN CLASS="eln">Var</SPAN> and <SPAN CLASS="eln">VarP</SPAN> functions in a query expression or in an <SPAN CLASS="pop">SQL statement</SPAN>.</P>
Specifics (Microsoft Access)</P>
In Microsoft&nbsp;Access, you can use the <SPAN CLASS="eln">Var</SPAN> and <SPAN CLASS="eln">VarP</SPAN> functions in the <SPAN CLASS="pop">query design grid</SPAN>, in an <SPAN CLASS="pop">SQL</SPAN> statement in <SPAN CLASS="pop">SQL view</SPAN> of the <SPAN CLASS="pop">Query window</SPAN>, or in an SQL statement within Visual Basic code. You can also use the <SPAN CLASS="eln">Var</SPAN> and <SPAN CLASS="eln">VarP</SPAN> functions in a <SPAN CLASS="pop">calculated control</SPAN> on a form or report.</P>
The <SPAN CLASS="eln">Var</SPAN> and <SPAN CLASS="eln">VarP</SPAN> functions are most useful in <SPAN CLASS="pop">totals queries</SPAN> and <SPAN CLASS="pop">crosstab queries</SPAN>. They function the same way whether you create the query in the query design grid or as an SQL&nbsp;statement in SQL view.</P>
In the query design grid, you can create a new totals query by clicking the <SPAN CLASS="eln">Totals</SPAN> button on the <SPAN CLASS="eln">Query Design</SPAN> <SPAN CLASS="pop">toolbar</SPAN>. The <SPAN CLASS="eln">Total</SPAN> row is then inserted in the grid. You can set the <SPAN CLASS="eln">Total</SPAN> cell beneath a field to the aggregate function to perform on the data in that field.</P>
For example, suppose you have an Orders table that has both a Freight field and a ShipCity field. You can create a query that displays the variance of freight cost for orders sent to each city. Create a new totals query, and drag the ShipCity field to the query design grid. The <SPAN CLASS="eln">Total</SPAN> cell beneath the ShipCity field should be set to Group By. Drag the Freight field to the query design grid, and set the <SPAN CLASS="eln">Total</SPAN> cell beneath it to Var. When you run the query, it will display the variance of freight cost for orders sent to each city.</P>
You can view the SQL statement for this query by switching to SQL view. In this example, Microsoft Access creates the following SQL statement:</P>

<pre><code>SELECT ShipCity, Var(Freight) AS VarOfFreight
FROM Orders GROUP BY ShipCity;</code></pre>
You can also use an SQL statement within Visual Basic code. For example, the following code creates a dynaset-type <SPAN CLASS="eln">Recordset</SPAN> object from the preceding SQL statement:</P>

<pre><code>Sub VarFreight()
    Dim dbs As Database, rst As Recordset, strSQL As String

    Set dbs = CurrentDb
    strSQL = "SELECT ShipCity, Var(Freight) AS VarOfFreight " _
    &amp; "FROM Orders GROUP BY ShipCity;"
    Set rst = dbs.OpenRecordset(strSQL)
    rst.MoveLast
    Debug.Print rst.RecordCount
    Set dbs = Nothing
End Sub</code></pre>
To use the <SPAN CLASS="eln">Var</SPAN> and <SPAN CLASS="eln">VarP</SPAN> functions in a calculated control, set the control's <SPAN CLASS="eln">ControlSource</SPAN> property to an expression containing either of these functions. For example, to display the variance across freight costs in a text box, enter the following expression in the <SPAN CLASS="eln">ControlSource</SPAN> property of the text box:</P>

<pre><code>=Var([Freight])</code></pre>
If you use the <SPAN CLASS="eln">Var</SPAN> or <SPAN CLASS="eln">VarP</SPAN> function in a calculated control, you can restrict the set of records against which the function is performed by setting the form's <SPAN CLASS="eln">Filter</SPAN> property.</P>
Example</P>
This example uses the Orders table to estimate the <SPAN CLASS="pop">variance</SPAN> of freight costs for orders shipped to the United Kingdom. </P>
This example calls the EnumFields procedure, which you can find in the SELECT statement example.</P>

<pre><code>Sub VarX()

    Dim dbs As Database, rst As Recordset

    ' Modify this line to include the path to Northwind
    ' on your computer.
    Set dbs = OpenDatabase("Northwind.mdb")

    ' Calculate the variance of freight costs for 
    ' orders shipped to the United Kingdom. 
    Set rst = dbs.OpenRecordset("SELECT " _
        &amp; "Var(Freight) " _
        &amp; "AS [UK Freight Variance] " _
        &amp; "FROM Orders WHERE ShipCountry = 'UK';")

    ' Populate the Recordset.
    rst.MoveLast
    
    ' Call EnumFields to print the contents of the 
    ' Recordset. Pass the Recordset object and desired
    ' field width.
    EnumFields rst, 20

    Debug.Print

    Set rst = dbs.OpenRecordset("SELECT " _
        &amp; "VarP(Freight) " _
        &amp; "AS [UK Freight VarianceP] " _
        &amp; "FROM Orders WHERE ShipCountry = 'UK';")

    ' Populate the Recordset.
    rst.MoveLast

    ' Call EnumFields to print the contents of the 
    ' Recordset. Pass the Recordset object and desired
    ' field width.
    EnumFields rst, 20

    dbs.Close

End Sub</code></pre>
Example (Microsoft Access)</P>
The following example assumes that you have an Orders table that contains a field called Freight. You can use the <SPAN CLASS="eln">Var</SPAN> and <SPAN CLASS="eln">VarP</SPAN> functions to estimate the variance of freight costs for orders shipped to the United Kingdom. Enter the following expressions in SQL view in the Query window:</P>

<pre><code>SELECT Var([Freight]) AS [UKFreightVariance] FROM Orders
WHERE [ShipCountry] = 'UK';

SELECT VarP([Freight]) AS [UKFreightVarianceP] FROM Orders
WHERE [ShipCountry] = 'UK';</code></pre>
The next example creates a calculated control that displays the estimated variance for&nbsp;freight costs for records in the same Orders table. Open a new form and set its&nbsp;<SPAN CLASS="eln">RecordSource</SPAN> property to Orders. Enter the following expression in the <SPAN CLASS="eln">ControlSource</SPAN> property of a text box on the form. To apply a condition that limits the&nbsp;search to only some records, such as those for orders shipped to the United Kingdom, set the form's <SPAN CLASS="eln">Filter</SPAN> property.</P>

<pre><code>=Var([Freight])</code></pre>
