<H2>Picture Property</H2>Applies To</P>
Command Button control, Form, Image control, Page, Report, Toggle Button control.</P>
Description</P>
You can use the <SPAN CLASS="eln">Picture</SPAN> property to specify a <SPAN CLASS="pop">bitmap</SPAN> or other type of graphic to be displayed on a <SPAN CLASS="pop">command button</SPAN>, <SPAN CLASS="pop">image control</SPAN>, <SPAN CLASS="pop">toggle button</SPAN>, page on a <SPAN CLASS="pop">tab control</SPAN> or as a background picture on a <SPAN CLASS="pop">form</SPAN> or <SPAN CLASS="pop">report</SPAN>. Buttons can display either a caption or a picture.</P>
Setting</P>
The <SPAN CLASS="eln">Picture</SPAN> property contains (bitmap) or the path and file name of a bitmap or other type of graphic to be displayed.</P>
You can set this property by using:</P>
<SPAN CLASS="list"><UL><LI CLASS="ULI1">The <SPAN CLASS="jump">property sheet</SPAN>. Click the <SPAN CLASS="eln">Build</SPAN> button to the right of the property box (for command buttons and toggle buttons). When you select one of the bitmap files from the <B>Available Pictures</B> list, the property setting is (bitmap).</LI><LI CLASS="ULI1">A <SPAN CLASS="jump">macro</SPAN>.</LI><LI CLASS="ULI1"><SPAN CLASS="jump">Visual Basic</SPAN>. You can use a <SPAN CLASS="pop">string expression</SPAN> that includes the path and the name of the graphic, as in the following example:

<pre><code>btnShowLogo.Picture = "c:\Windows\Winlogo.bmp"</code></pre>
</LI><LI CLASS="ULI1">The <B>Picture</B> command on the <B>Insert</B> menu (for image controls or background pictures on forms and reports) to select a bitmap or other type of graphic.
</LI></UL></SPAN>The default setting is (none). After the graphic is loaded into the object, the property setting is (bitmap) or the path and file name of the graphic. If you delete (bitmap) or the path and file name of the graphic from the property setting, the picture is deleted from the object and the property setting is again (none).</P>
If the PictureType property is set to Embedded, the graphic is stored with the object.</P>
Remarks</P>
You can create custom bitmaps by using Microsoft Paintbrush or another application that creates bitmap files. A bitmap file must have a .bmp, .ico, or .dib extension. You can also use graphics files in the .wmf or .emf formats, or any other graphic file type for which you have a graphics filter. Forms, reports, and image controls support all graphics. Command buttons and toggle buttons only support bitmaps.</P>
Buttons can display either a caption or a picture. If you assign both to a button, the picture will be visible, the caption won't. If the picture is deleted, the caption reappears. Microsoft Access displays the picture centered on the button and clipped if the picture is larger than the button.</P>
<SPAN CLASS="nh">Tip</SPAN>   To create a command button or toggle button with a caption and a picture, you could include the desired caption as part of the bitmap and assign the bitmap to the <SPAN CLASS="eln">Picture</SPAN> property of the control.</P>
