<H2>GotFocus, LostFocus Events</H2>Applies To</P>
ActiveX control, Bound Object Frame control, Chart control, Check Box control, Combo Box control, Command Button control, Form, List Box control, Option Button control, Text Box control, Toggle Button control, Unbound Object Frame control.</P>
Description</P>
<SPAN CLASS="list"><UL><LI CLASS="ULI1">The GotFocus event occurs when a <SPAN CLASS="pop">form</SPAN> or <SPAN CLASS="pop">control</SPAN> receives the <SPAN CLASS="pop">focus</SPAN>.</LI><LI CLASS="ULI1">The LostFocus event occurs when a form or control loses the focus.
</LI></UL></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="nh">Note</SPAN>   The GotFocus and LostFocus events apply only to forms and controls on a form, not controls on a <SPAN CLASS="pop">report</SPAN>.</P>
Remarks</P>
To run a <SPAN CLASS="pop">macro</SPAN> or <SPAN CLASS="pop">event procedure</SPAN> when these events occur, set the OnGotFocus<SPAN CLASS="jump">, or </SPAN>OnLostFocus property to the name of the macro or to [Event Procedure].</P>
These events occur when the focus moves in response to a user action, such as pressing the <SPAN CLASS="kn">TAB</SPAN> key or clicking the object, or when you use the SetFocus method in Visual Basic or the <SPAN CLASS="jump">SelectObject</SPAN>, <SPAN CLASS="jump">GoToRecord</SPAN>, <SPAN CLASS="jump">GoToControl</SPAN>, or <SPAN CLASS="jump">GoToPage</SPAN> action in a macro.</P>
A control can receive the focus only if its Visible and Enabled properties are set to Yes. A form can receive the focus only if it has no controls or if all visible controls are disabled. If a form contains any visible, enabled controls, the GotFocus event for the form doesn't occur.</P>
You can specify what happens when a form or control receives the focus by running a macro or an event procedure when the GotFocus event occurs. For example, by attaching a GotFocus event procedure to each control on a form, you can guide the user through your application by displaying brief instructions or messages in a text box. You can also provide visual cues by enabling, disabling, or displaying controls that depend on the control with the focus.</P>
<SPAN CLASS="nh">Note</SPAN>   To customize the order in which the focus moves from control to control on a form when you press the <SPAN CLASS="kn">TAB</SPAN> key, set the <SPAN CLASS="pop">tab order</SPAN> or specify <SPAN CLASS="pop">access keys</SPAN> for the controls.</P>
The GotFocus event differs from the <SPAN CLASS="jump">Enter</SPAN> event in that the GotFocus event occurs every time a control receives the focus. For example, suppose the user clicks a check box on a form, then clicks a report, and finally clicks the check box on the form to bring it to the foreground. The GotFocus event occurs both times the check box receives the focus. In contrast, the Enter event occurs only the first time the user clicks the check box. The GotFocus event occurs after the Enter event.</P>
The LostFocus event differs from the <SPAN CLASS="jump">Exit</SPAN> event in that the LostFocus event occurs every time a control loses the focus. The Exit event occurs only before a control loses the focus to another control on the same form. The LostFocus event occurs after the Exit event.</P>
If you move the focus to a control on a form, and that control doesn't have the focus on that form, the Exit and LostFocus events for the control that does have the focus on the form occur before the Enter and GotFocus events for the control you moved to.</P>
If you use the mouse to move the focus from a control on a main form to a control on a <SPAN CLASS="pop">subform</SPAN> of that form, the following events occur:</P>
    Exit (for the control on the main form)</P>
     <img src="darrow.gif"></P>
    LostFocus (for the control on the main form)</P>
     <img src="darrow.gif"></P>
    Enter (for the subform control)</P>
     <img src="darrow.gif"></P>
    Exit (for the control on the subform that had the focus)</P>
     <img src="darrow.gif"></P>
    LostFocus (for the control on the subform that had the focus)</P>
     <img src="darrow.gif"></P>
    Enter (for the control on the subform that the focus moved to)</P>
     <img src="darrow.gif"></P>
    GotFocus (for the control on the subform that the focus moved to)</P>
If the control you move to on the subform previously had the focus, neither its Enter event nor its GotFocus event occurs, but the Enter event for the subform control does occur. If you move the focus from a control on a subform to a control on the main form, the Exit and LostFocus events for the control on the subform don't occur, just the Exit event for the subform control and the Enter and GotFocus events for the control on the main form.</P>
<SPAN CLASS="nh">Note</SPAN>   You often use the mouse or a key such as <SPAN CLASS="kn">TAB</SPAN> to move the focus to another control. This causes <SPAN CLASS="jump">mouse</SPAN> or <SPAN CLASS="jump">keyboard</SPAN> events to occur in addition to the events discussed in this topic.</P>
When you switch between two open forms, the <SPAN CLASS="jump">Deactivate</SPAN> event occurs for the first form, and the <SPAN CLASS="jump">Activate</SPAN> event occurs for the second form. If the forms contain no visible, enabled controls, the LostFocus event occurs for the first form before the Deactivate event, and the GotFocus event occurs for the second form after the Activate event.</P>
