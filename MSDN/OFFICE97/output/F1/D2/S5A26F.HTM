<H2>CacheStart Property</H2>Applies To</P>
Dynaset-Type <SPAN CLASS="eln">Recordset</SPAN> object, <SPAN CLASS="eln">Recordset</SPAN> object.</P>
Description</P>
Sets or returns a value that specifies the <SPAN CLASS="pop">bookmark</SPAN> of the first record in a <SPAN CLASS="jump">dynaset-type </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="lee">Recordset</SPAN> object containing data to be locally cached from an <SPAN CLASS="pop">ODBC data source</SPAN> (<SPAN CLASS="pop">Microsoft Jet workspaces</SPAN> only).</P>
Settings And Return Values</P>
The setting or return value is a <SPAN CLASS="lee">String</SPAN> that specifies a bookmark.</P>
Remarks</P>
Data caching improves the performance of an application that retrieves data from a remote server through dynaset-type <SPAN CLASS="lee">Recordset</SPAN> objects. A cache is a space in local memory that holds the data most recently retrieved from the server in the event that the data will be requested again while the application is running. When data is requested, the <SPAN CLASS="pop">Microsoft Jet database engine</SPAN> checks the cache for the requested data first rather than retrieving it from the server, which takes more time. Only data from an ODBC data source can be saved in the cache.</P>
Any Microsoft Jet-connected ODBC data source, such as a <SPAN CLASS="pop">linked table</SPAN>, can have a local cache. To create the cache, open a <SPAN CLASS="lee">Recordset</SPAN> object from the remote data source, set the <SPAN CLASS="lee">CacheSize</SPAN> and <SPAN CLASS="lee">CacheStart</SPAN> properties, and then use the <SPAN CLASS="lee">FillCache</SPAN> method or step through the records using the Move methods.</P>
The <SPAN CLASS="lee">CacheStart</SPAN> property setting is the bookmark of the first record in the <SPAN CLASS="lee">Recordset</SPAN> object to be cached. You can use the bookmark of any record to set the <SPAN CLASS="lee">CacheStart</SPAN> property. Make the record you want to start the cache the <SPAN CLASS="pop">current record</SPAN>, and set the <SPAN CLASS="lee">CacheStart</SPAN> property equal to the <SPAN CLASS="lee">Bookmark</SPAN> property.</P>
The Microsoft Jet database engine requests records within the cache range from the cache, and it requests records outside the cache range from the server.</P>
Records retrieved from the cache don't reflect changes made concurrently to the source data by other users.</P>
To force an update of all the cached data, set the <SPAN CLASS="lee">CacheSize</SPAN> property of the <SPAN CLASS="lee">Recordset</SPAN> object to 0, set it to the size of the cache you originally requested, and then use the <SPAN CLASS="lee">FillCache</SPAN> method.</P>

<SPAN CLASS="eln">CacheSize</SPAN> property.</P>
Specifics (Microsoft Access)</P>
When you use the <SPAN CLASS="eln">CacheStart</SPAN> property in a Microsoft Access module, you must include an <SPAN CLASS="eln">Option Compare Binary</SPAN> statement in the <SPAN CLASS="pop">Declarations section</SPAN> of the module. The <SPAN CLASS="pop">bookmark</SPAN> set or returned by the <SPAN CLASS="eln">CacheStart</SPAN> property is a <SPAN CLASS="eln">Variant</SPAN> array of <SPAN CLASS="eln">Byte</SPAN> data, so the <SPAN CLASS="pop">string comparison</SPAN> method for the module must be binary. If a bookmark is evaluated with a text-based string comparison method, such as the <SPAN CLASS="eln">Option Compare Text</SPAN> statement or the default setting for the <SPAN CLASS="eln">Option Compare Database</SPAN> statement, the current record may be set to an incorrect record.</P>
