<H2>Current Event</H2>Applies To</P>
Form.</P>
Description</P>
The Current event occurs when the <SPAN CLASS="pop">focus</SPAN> moves to a record, making it the current record, or when the <SPAN CLASS="pop">form</SPAN> is <SPAN CLASS="pop">refreshed</SPAN> or <SPAN CLASS="pop">requeried</SPAN>.</P>
Remarks</P>
To run a <SPAN CLASS="pop">macro</SPAN> or <SPAN CLASS="pop">event procedure</SPAN> when this event occurs, set the OnCurrent property to the name of the macro or to [Event Procedure].</P>
This event occurs both when a form is opened and whenever the focus leaves one record and moves to another. Microsoft Access runs the Current macro or event procedure before the first or next record is displayed.</P>
By running a macro or event procedure when a form's Current event occurs, you can display a message or synchronize records in another form related to the current record. For example, when a customer record becomes current, you can display the customer's previous order. When a supplier record becomes current, you can display the products manufactured by the supplier in a Suppliers form. You can also perform calculations based on the current record or change the form in response to data in the current record.</P>
If your macro or event procedure runs a <SPAN CLASS="jump">GoToControl</SPAN> or <SPAN CLASS="jump">GoToRecord</SPAN> action or the corresponding method of the DoCmd object in response to an <SPAN CLASS="jump">Open</SPAN> event, the Current event occurs.</P>
The Current event also occurs when you refresh a form or requery the form's underlying table or query — for example, when you click <SPAN CLASS="eln">Remove Filter/Sort</SPAN> on the <SPAN CLASS="eln">Records</SPAN> menu or use the <SPAN CLASS="jump">Requery</SPAN> action in a macro or the Requery method in Visual&nbsp;Basic code.</P>
When you first open a form, the following events occur in this order:</P>
    Open <img src="rarrow.gif"> Load <img src="rarrow.gif"> Resize <img src="rarrow.gif"> Activate <img src="rarrow.gif"> Current</P>
