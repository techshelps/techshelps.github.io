<H2>Load, Unload Events</H2>Applies To</P>
Form.</P>
Description</P>
<SPAN CLASS="list"><UL><LI CLASS="ULI1">The Load event occurs when a <SPAN CLASS="pop">form</SPAN> is opened and its records are displayed.</LI><LI CLASS="ULI1">The Unload event occurs after a form is closed but before it's removed from the screen. When the form is reloaded, Microsoft Access redisplays the form and reinitializes the contents of all its <SPAN CLASS="pop">controls</SPAN>.
</LI></UL></SPAN>Remarks</P>
To run a <SPAN CLASS="pop">macro</SPAN> or <SPAN CLASS="pop">event procedure</SPAN> when these events occur, set the OnLoad<SPAN CLASS="jump">, or </SPAN>OnUnload property to the name of the macro or to [Event Procedure].</P>
The Load event is caused by user actions such as:</P>
<SPAN CLASS="list"><UL><LI CLASS="ULI1">Starting an application.</LI><LI CLASS="ULI1">Opening a form by clicking <SPAN CLASS="eln">Open</SPAN> in the <SPAN CLASS="pop">Database window</SPAN>.</LI><LI CLASS="ULI1">Running the <SPAN CLASS="jump">OpenForm</SPAN> action in a macro.
</LI></UL></SPAN>The Unload event is caused by user actions such as:</P>
<SPAN CLASS="list"><UL><LI CLASS="ULI1">Clicking a Form window's <SPAN CLASS="eln">Close</SPAN> button or clicking <SPAN CLASS="eln">Close</SPAN> on the <SPAN CLASS="eln">File</SPAN> menu or a form's Control<SPAN CLASS="pop"> menu</SPAN>.</LI><LI CLASS="ULI1">Running the <SPAN CLASS="jump">Close</SPAN> action in a macro.</LI><LI CLASS="ULI1">Quitting an application by right-clicking the application's taskbar button and then clicking <SPAN CLASS="eln">Close</SPAN>.</LI><LI CLASS="ULI1">Quitting Windows while an application is running.
</LI></UL></SPAN>By running a macro or an event procedure when a form's Load event occurs, you can specify default settings for controls, or display calculated data that depends on the data in the form's records.</P>
By running a macro or an event procedure when a form's Unload event occurs, you can verify that the form should be unloaded or specify actions that should take place when the form is unloaded. You can also open another form or display a dialog box requesting the user's name to make a log entry indicating who used the form.</P>
When you first open a form, the following events occur in this order:</P>
    Open <img src="rarrow.gif"> Load <img src="rarrow.gif"> Resize <img src="rarrow.gif"> Activate <img src="rarrow.gif"> Current</P>
If you're trying to decide whether to use the Open or Load event for your macro or event procedure, one significant difference is that the Open event can be canceled, but the Load event can't. For example, if you're dynamically building a record source for a form in an event procedure for the form's Open event, you can cancel opening the form if there are no records to display.</P>
When you close a form, the following events occur in this order:</P>
    Unload <img src="rarrow.gif"> Deactivate <img src="rarrow.gif"> Close</P>
The Unload event occurs before the <SPAN CLASS="jump">Close</SPAN> event. The Unload event can be canceled, but the Close event can't.</P>
<SPAN CLASS="nh">Note</SPAN>   When you create macros or event procedures for events related to the Load event, such as <SPAN CLASS="jump">Activate</SPAN> and <SPAN CLASS="jump">GotFocus</SPAN>, be sure that they don't conflict (for example, make sure you don't cause something to happen in one macro or procedure that is canceled in another) and that they don't cause <SPAN CLASS="pop">cascading events</SPAN>.</P>
