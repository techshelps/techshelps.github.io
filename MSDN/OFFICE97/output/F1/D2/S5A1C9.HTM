<H2>RecordsetClone Property</H2>Applies To</P>
Form.</P>
Description</P>
You can use the <SPAN CLASS="eln">RecordsetClone</SPAN> property to refer to a form's Recordset object specified by the form's RecordSource property.</P>
Setting</P>
The <SPAN CLASS="eln">RecordsetClone</SPAN> property setting is a copy of the underlying query or table specified by the form's <SPAN CLASS="eln">RecordSource</SPAN> property. If a form is based on a query, for example, referring to the <SPAN CLASS="eln">RecordsetClone</SPAN> property is the equivalent of cloning a <SPAN CLASS="eln">Recordset</SPAN> object by using the same query. If you then apply a filter to the form, the <SPAN CLASS="eln">Recordset</SPAN> object reflects the filtering.</P>
This property is available only by using <SPAN CLASS="jump">Visual&nbsp;Basic</SPAN> and is read-only in all views.</P>
Remarks</P>
You use the <SPAN CLASS="eln">RecordsetClone</SPAN> property to navigate or operate on a form's records independent of the form itself. For example, you can use the <SPAN CLASS="eln">RecordsetClone</SPAN> property when you want to use a method, such as the FindFirst method, that can't be&nbsp;used with forms.</P>
When a new <SPAN CLASS="eln">Recordset</SPAN> object is opened, its first record is the <SPAN CLASS="pop">current record</SPAN>. If you use one of the <SPAN CLASS="jump">Find</SPAN> or <SPAN CLASS="jump">Move</SPAN> methods to make any other record in the <SPAN CLASS="eln">Recordset</SPAN> object current, you must synchronize the current record in the <SPAN CLASS="eln">Recordset</SPAN> object with the form's current record by assigning the value of the DAO Bookmark property to the form's Bookmark property.</P>
You can use the RecordCount property to count the number of records in a <SPAN CLASS="eln">Recordset</SPAN> object. The following example shows how you can combine the <SPAN CLASS="eln">RecordCount</SPAN> property and the <SPAN CLASS="eln">RecordsetClone</SPAN> property to count the records in a form:</P>

<pre><code>Forms!Orders.RecordsetClone.MoveLast
MsgBox "My form contains " _
    &amp; Forms!Orders.RecordsetClone.RecordCount _
    &amp; " records.", vbInformation, "Record Count"</code></pre>
<SPAN CLASS="nh">Note</SPAN>   If you close the form or if you change the form's <SPAN CLASS="eln">RecordSource</SPAN> property, the <SPAN CLASS="eln">Recordset</SPAN> object is no longer valid. If you subsequently refer to the <SPAN CLASS="eln">Recordset</SPAN> object or to previously saved bookmarks in the form or the <SPAN CLASS="eln">Recordset</SPAN> object, an error will occur.</P>
See Also</P>
<SPAN CLASS="eln">Bookmark</SPAN> property, <SPAN CLASS="eln">Bookmark</SPAN> property ("DAO Language Reference"), <B>FindFirst</B>, <B>FindLast</B>, <B>FindNext</B>, <SPAN CLASS="eln">FindPrevious</SPAN> methods ("DAO Language Reference"), <B>MoveFirst</B>, <B>MoveLast</B>, <B>MoveNext</B>, <SPAN CLASS="eln">MovePrevious</SPAN> methods ("DAO Language Reference"), <SPAN CLASS="eln">Recordset</SPAN> object ("DAO Language Reference"), <SPAN CLASS="eln">RecordSource</SPAN> property.</P>
Example</P>
The following example uses the <SPAN CLASS="eln">RecordsetClone</SPAN> property to create a new clone of the <SPAN CLASS="eln">Recordset</SPAN> object from the Orders form and then prints the names of the fields in the Debug window.</P>

<pre><code>Sub Print_Field_Names()
    Dim rst As Recordset, intI As Integer
    Dim fld As Field

    Set rst = Me.RecordsetClone
    For Each fld in rst.Fields
        ' Print field names.
        Debug.Print fld.Name
    Next
End Sub</code></pre>
The next example uses the <SPAN CLASS="eln">RecordsetClone</SPAN> property and the <SPAN CLASS="eln">Recordset</SPAN> object to synchronize a recordset's record with the form's current record. When a company name is selected from a combo box, the <SPAN CLASS="eln">FindFirst</SPAN> method is used to locate the record for that company and the <SPAN CLASS="eln">Recordset</SPAN> object's DAO <SPAN CLASS="eln">Bookmark</SPAN> property is assigned to the form's <SPAN CLASS="eln">Bookmark</SPAN> property, causing the form to display the found record.</P>

<pre><code>Sub SupplierID_AfterUpdate()
    Dim rst As Recordset
    Dim strSearchName As String

    Set rst = Me.RecordsetClone
    strSearchName = Str(Me!SupplierID)
    rst.FindFirst "SupplierID = " &amp; strSearchName
        If rst.NoMatch Then
            MsgBox "Record not found"
        Else
            Me.Bookmark = rst.Bookmark
        End If
    rst.Close
End Sub</code></pre>
