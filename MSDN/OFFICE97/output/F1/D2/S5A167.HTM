<H2>KeyDown, KeyUp Events</H2>Applies To</P>
Bound Object Frame control, Check Box control, Combo Box control, Command Button control, Form, List Box control, Option Button control, Tab control, Text Box control, Toggle Button control.</P>
Description</P>
<SPAN CLASS="list"><UL><LI CLASS="ULI1">The KeyDown event occurs when the user presses a key while a <SPAN CLASS="pop">form</SPAN> or <SPAN CLASS="pop">control</SPAN> has the <SPAN CLASS="pop">focus</SPAN>. This event also occurs if you send a keystroke to a form or control by using the <SPAN CLASS="jump">SendKeys</SPAN> action in a <SPAN CLASS="pop">macro</SPAN> or the SendKeys statement in Visual Basic.</LI><LI CLASS="ULI1">The KeyUp event occurs when the user releases a key while a form or control has the focus. This event also occurs if you send a keystroke to a form or control by using the SendKeys action in a macro or the <SPAN CLASS="eln">SendKeys</SPAN> statement in Visual Basic.
</LI></UL></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="nh">Note</SPAN>   The KeyDown and KeyUp events apply only to forms and controls on a form, not controls on a <SPAN CLASS="pop">report</SPAN>.</P>
Remarks</P>
To run a macro or <SPAN CLASS="pop">event procedure</SPAN> when these events occur, set the OnKeyDown<SPAN CLASS="jump"> or </SPAN>OnKeyUp property to the name of the macro or to [Event Procedure].</P>
For both events, the object with the focus receives all keystrokes. A form can have the focus only if it has no controls or all its visible controls are disabled.</P>
A form will also receive all keyboard events, even those that occur for controls, if you set the KeyPreview property of the form to Yes. With this property setting, all keyboard events occur first for the form, and then for the control that has the focus. You can respond to specific keys pressed in the form, regardless of which control has the focus. For example, you may want the key combination <SPAN CLASS="kn">CTRL+X</SPAN> to always perform the same action on a form.</P>
If you press and hold down a key, the KeyDown and <SPAN CLASS="jump">KeyPress</SPAN> events alternate repeatedly (KeyDown, KeyPress, KeyDown, KeyPress, and so on) until you release the key, then the KeyUp event occurs.</P>
Although the KeyDown and KeyUp events occur when most keys are pressed, they are typically used to recognize or distinguish between:</P>
<SPAN CLASS="list"><UL><LI CLASS="ULI1">Extended character keys, such as function keys.</LI><LI CLASS="ULI1">Navigation keys, such as <SPAN CLASS="kn">HOME</SPAN>, <SPAN CLASS="kn">END</SPAN>, <SPAN CLASS="kn">PAGE UP</SPAN>, <SPAN CLASS="kn">PAGE DOWN</SPAN>, <SPAN CLASS="kn">UP ARROW</SPAN>, <SPAN CLASS="kn">DOWN ARROW</SPAN>, <SPAN CLASS="kn">RIGHT ARROW</SPAN>, <SPAN CLASS="kn">LEFT ARROW</SPAN>, and <SPAN CLASS="kn">TAB</SPAN>.</LI><LI CLASS="ULI1">Combinations of keys and standard keyboard modifiers (<SPAN CLASS="kn">SHIFT</SPAN>, <SPAN CLASS="kn">CTRL</SPAN>, or <SPAN CLASS="kn">ALT</SPAN> keys).</LI><LI CLASS="ULI1">The numeric keypad and keyboard number keys.
</LI></UL></SPAN>The KeyDown and KeyUp events don't occur when you press:</P>
<SPAN CLASS="list"><UL><LI CLASS="ULI1">The <SPAN CLASS="kn">ENTER</SPAN> key if the form has a <SPAN CLASS="pop">command button</SPAN> for which the Default property is set to Yes.</LI><LI CLASS="ULI1">The <SPAN CLASS="kn">ESC</SPAN> key if the form has a command button for which the Cancel property is set to Yes.
</LI></UL></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="nh">Tip</SPAN>   To find out the <SPAN CLASS="pop">ANSI</SPAN> character corresponding to the key pressed, use the <SPAN CLASS="jump">KeyPress</SPAN> event.</P>
The KeyDown and KeyPress events occur when you press or send an ANSI key. The KeyUp event occurs after any event for a control caused by pressing or sending the key. If a keystroke causes the focus to move from one control to another control, the KeyDown event occurs for the first control, while the KeyPress and KeyUp events occur for the second control.</P>
If a <SPAN CLASS="pop">modal</SPAN> dialog box is displayed as a result of pressing or sending a key, the KeyDown and KeyPress events occur, but the KeyUp event doesn't occur.</P>
