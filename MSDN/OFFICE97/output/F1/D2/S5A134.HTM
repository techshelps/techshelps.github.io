<H2>Me Property</H2>Applies To</P>
Form, Report.</P>
Description</P>
You can use the <SPAN CLASS="eln">Me</SPAN> property in <SPAN CLASS="jump">Visual Basic</SPAN> to refer to a <SPAN CLASS="pop">form</SPAN>, <SPAN CLASS="pop">report</SPAN>, (or to the form or report associated with a <SPAN CLASS="pop">subform</SPAN> or <SPAN CLASS="pop">subreport</SPAN>), or <SPAN CLASS="pop">class module</SPAN> where Visual Basic code is currently running.</P>
Setting</P>
The <SPAN CLASS="eln">Me</SPAN> property is available only by using Visual Basic and is read-only in all views.</P>
Remarks</P>
The <B>Me</B> property contains an object reference to the current form or report and is faster than a fully qualified object reference. For example, the following two code fragments refer to the value of the LastName control for the current record on the Employees form:</P>

<pre><code>strLastName = Forms!Employees.LastName</code></pre>

<pre><code>strLastName = Me!LastName</code></pre>
In most cases, the form or report referred to by the <SPAN CLASS="eln">Me</SPAN> property is the same form or report referred to by the ActiveForm or ActiveReport properties of the Screen object. However, these properties refer to the form or report with the <SPAN CLASS="pop">focus</SPAN>, whereas the <SPAN CLASS="eln">Me</SPAN> property always refers to the form or report in which code is running. For example, a <SPAN CLASS="jump">Timer</SPAN> event can occur in a form that doesn't have the focus. When that happens, the code <SPAN CLASS="cte">Screen.ActiveForm</SPAN> refers to the form with the focus, and the <SPAN CLASS="eln">Me</SPAN> property refers to the form in which the Timer event occurred. Therefore, when you are creating generic procedures that operate on the current form, the preferred method is to pass the form to the procedure by using the <SPAN CLASS="eln">Me</SPAN> property rather than the <SPAN CLASS="eln">ActiveForm</SPAN> property.</P>
You can use the <SPAN CLASS="eln">Me</SPAN> keyword in class modules to refer to the current instance of that class. Just as you use <SPAN CLASS="eln">Me</SPAN> in form or report class modules to retrieve a reference to the current form or report, you use <SPAN CLASS="eln">Me</SPAN> in a class module to retrieve a reference to the current class module object.</P>

<SPAN CLASS="eln">ActiveForm</SPAN> property, <SPAN CLASS="eln">ActiveReport</SPAN> property, <B>Form</B>, <SPAN CLASS="eln">Report</SPAN> properties, <SPAN CLASS="eln">Parent</SPAN> property, <SPAN CLASS="eln">Screen</SPAN> object.</P>
Example</P>
The following example shows how to change the caption of a Customers form to a value supplied by the user. The ChangeCaption subroutine passes the <SPAN CLASS="eln">Me</SPAN> property (representing the <SPAN CLASS="eln">Form</SPAN> object) to specify the active form. Because the ChangeCaption procedure changes the caption of the active form (not a specific form), it can be called from other procedures in an application.</P>

<pre><code>ChangeCaption Me, InputBox("Enter new caption " _
    &amp; "for form")

Sub ChangeCaption(frmCurrentForm As _
    Form, strCaption As String)
' Change caption.
    If TypeName(frmCurrentForm.Caption) = "Null" Then
        frmCurrentForm.Caption = strCaption
        Exit Sub
    End If
    If UCase(strCaption) _
            &lt;&gt; UCase(frmCurrentForm.Caption) Then
        frmCurrentForm.Caption = strCaption
    End If
End Sub</code></pre>
