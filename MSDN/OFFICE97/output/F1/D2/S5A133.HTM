<H2>MDE Property</H2>Applies To</P>
<SPAN CLASS="eln">Database</SPAN> object.</P>
Description</P>
You can use the <SPAN CLASS="eln">MDE</SPAN> property to determine whether a database has been saved as an .mde file.</P>
Setting</P>
When a database is saved as an .mde file, Microsoft Access adds the <SPAN CLASS="eln">MDE</SPAN> property to the database and sets it to the String value "T".</P>
The <SPAN CLASS="eln">MDE</SPAN> property can be determined only by using <SPAN CLASS="jump">Visual Basic</SPAN> and is read-only in all views.</P>
<SPAN CLASS="ih">Important</SPAN>   Trying to determine the <SPAN CLASS="eln">MDE</SPAN> property for a database that hasn't been saved as an .mde file will generate <SPAN CLASS="pop">run-time error</SPAN> 3270 (property not found). The <SPAN CLASS="eln">MDE</SPAN> property doesn't exist in a database until the database is saved as an .mde file.</P>
Remarks</P>
You can convert a database to an .mde file by pointing to <SPAN CLASS="eln">Database Utilities</SPAN> on the <SPAN CLASS="eln">Tools</SPAN> menu and clicking <SPAN CLASS="eln">Make MDE File</SPAN>. When you save a database as an .mde file, Microsoft Access removes all editable source code, compiles all modules, and compacts the database. Your Visual Basic code still works, but the code cannot be viewed or changed. In addition, you can't add or make changes to form or report objects.</P>
<HR CLASS="ws">
<SPAN CLASS="wh">Warning</SPAN>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be sure to retain a copy of your original database. If you need to change any code or the design of objects in an .mde database, you must do so in the original database and then create a new .mde database. You will also need the original database in order to convert to future versions of Microsoft Access because you can't directly convert .mde files.</P>
<HR CLASS="we">
Saving a database as an .mde file is most appropriate when you want to prevent changes to forms or reports, or hide your Visual Basic code from the database users. You could also convert a database to an .mde file when you create your own wizards or for the front-end portion of a <SPAN CLASS="pop">front-end/back-end application</SPAN>.</P>
A replicated database can't be saved as an .mde file; however, once a database is saved as an .mde file, it can be replicated.</P>
Example</P>
The following example uses the IsItMDE function to check the <SPAN CLASS="eln">MDE</SPAN> property for the current database:</P>

<pre><code>Dim dbs As Database
Set dbs = CurrentDb
If IsItMDE(dbs) &lt;&gt; True Then
    ' Process custom database code.
End If

Function IsItMDE(dbs As Database) As Boolean
    Dim strMDE As String
    On Error Resume Next
    strMDE = dbs.Properties("MDE")
    If Err = 0 AND strMDE = "T" Then
        ' This is an MDE database.
        IsItMDE = True
    Else
        IsITMDE = False
    End if
End Function</code></pre>
