<H2>Controls Collection</H2>Description</P>
The <SPAN CLASS="eln">Controls</SPAN> collection contains all of the <SPAN CLASS="pop">controls</SPAN> on a form, report, or section, within another control, or attached to another control. The <SPAN CLASS="eln">Controls</SPAN> collection is a member of a Form, Report, <SPAN CLASS="eln">Section</SPAN>, or Control object. The following diagram illustrates the relationship between the <SPAN CLASS="eln">Controls</SPAN> collection and a <SPAN CLASS="eln">Form</SPAN> or <SPAN CLASS="eln">Report</SPAN> object.</P>
Remarks</P>
You can enumerate individual controls, count them, and set their properties in the <SPAN CLASS="eln">Controls</SPAN> collection. For example, you can enumerate the <SPAN CLASS="eln">Controls</SPAN> collection of a particular form and set the <SPAN CLASS="eln">Height</SPAN> property of each control to a specified value.</P>
<SPAN CLASS="nh">Tip</SPAN>   The <SPAN CLASS="eln">For Each...Next</SPAN> statement is useful for enumerating a collection.</P>
It is faster to refer to the <SPAN CLASS="eln">Controls</SPAN> collection implicitly, as in the following examples, which refer to a control called NewData on a form named OrderForm. Of the following syntax examples, <SPAN CLASS="cte">Me!NewData</SPAN> is the fastest way to refer to the control.</P>

<pre><code>Me!NewData                    ' Or Forms!OrderForm!NewData.</code></pre>

<pre><code>Me![New Data]                ' Use if control name contains space.</code></pre>

<pre><code>Me("NewData")                ' Performance is slightly slower.</code></pre>
You can also refer to an individual control by referring explicitly to the <SPAN CLASS="eln">Controls</SPAN> collection.</P>

<pre><code>Me.Controls!NewData        ' Or Forms!OrderForm.Controls!NewData.</code></pre>

<pre><code>Me.Controls![New Data]</code></pre>

<pre><code>Me.Controls("NewData")</code></pre>
Additionally, you can refer to a control by its index in the collection. The <SPAN CLASS="eln">Controls</SPAN> collection is indexed beginning with zero.</P>

<pre><code>Me(0)                            ' Refer to first item in collection.</code></pre>

<pre><code>Me.Controls(0)</code></pre>
<SPAN CLASS="nh">Note</SPAN>   You can use the <SPAN CLASS="eln">Me</SPAN> keyword to represent a form or report within code only if you're referring to the form or report from code within the <SPAN CLASS="pop">form module</SPAN> or <SPAN CLASS="pop">report module</SPAN>. If you're referring to a form or report from a <SPAN CLASS="pop">standard module</SPAN> or a different form's or report's module, you must use the full reference to the form or report.</P>
To work with the controls on a section of a form or report, use the Section property to return a reference to a <SPAN CLASS="eln">Section</SPAN> object. Then refer to the <SPAN CLASS="eln">Controls</SPAN> collection of the <SPAN CLASS="eln">Section</SPAN> object.</P>
Two types of <SPAN CLASS="eln">Control</SPAN> objects, the <SPAN CLASS="pop">tab control</SPAN> and <SPAN CLASS="pop">option group</SPAN> control, have <SPAN CLASS="eln">Controls</SPAN> collections that can contain multiple controls. The <SPAN CLASS="eln">Controls</SPAN> collection belonging to the option group control contains any <SPAN CLASS="pop">option button</SPAN>, <SPAN CLASS="pop">check box</SPAN>, <SPAN CLASS="pop">toggle button</SPAN>, or <SPAN CLASS="pop">label</SPAN> controls in the option group. </P>
The tab control contains a Pages collection, which is a special type of <SPAN CLASS="eln">Controls</SPAN> collection. The <SPAN CLASS="eln">Pages</SPAN> collection contains Page objects. <SPAN CLASS="eln">Page</SPAN> objects are also controls. The ControlType property constant for a <SPAN CLASS="eln">Page</SPAN> control is <SPAN CLASS="eln">acPage</SPAN>. A <SPAN CLASS="eln">Page</SPAN> object, in turn, has its own <SPAN CLASS="eln">Controls</SPAN> collection, which contains all the controls on an individual page.</P>
Other <SPAN CLASS="eln">Control</SPAN> objects have a <SPAN CLASS="eln">Controls</SPAN> collection that can contain an attached label. These controls include the text box, option group, option button, toggle button, check box, combo box, list box, command button, bound object frame, and unbound object frame controls.</P>
Properties</P>
<SPAN CLASS="eln">Application</SPAN> property, <SPAN CLASS="eln">Count</SPAN> property, <SPAN CLASS="eln">Item</SPAN> property (ObjectFrame control), <SPAN CLASS="eln">Parent</SPAN> property.</P>
