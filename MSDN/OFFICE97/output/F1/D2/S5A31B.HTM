<H2>Avg Function</H2>Description</P>
Calculates the arithmetic mean of a set of values contained in a specified field on a&nbsp;query.</P>
Syntax</P>
<SPAN CLASS="eln">Avg(</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="p">expr</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="eln">)</SPAN></P>
The <SPAN CLASS="p">expr</SPAN> placeholder represents a <SPAN CLASS="pop">string expression</SPAN> identifying the field that contains the numeric data you want to average or an expression that performs a calculation using the data in that field. Operands in <SPAN CLASS="p">expr</SPAN> can include the name of a table field, a constant, or a function (which can be either intrinsic or user-defined but not one of the other <SPAN CLASS="pop">SQL</SPAN> <SPAN CLASS="pop">aggregate</SPAN> functions).</P>
Remarks</P>
The average calculated by <SPAN CLASS="eln">Avg</SPAN> is the arithmetic mean (the sum of the values divided by the number of values). You could use <SPAN CLASS="eln">Avg</SPAN>, for example, to calculate average freight cost.</P>
The <SPAN CLASS="eln">Avg</SPAN> function doesn't include any Null fields in the calculation.</P>
You can use <SPAN CLASS="eln">Avg</SPAN> in a query expression and in the SQL property of a QueryDef object or when creating a Recordset object based on an SQL query.</P>
See Also</P>
<SPAN CLASS="eln">QueryDef</SPAN> object ("DAO Language Reference"), <SPAN CLASS="eln">SQL</SPAN> property ("DAO Language Reference").</P>
Specifics (Microsoft Access)</P>
In Microsoft Access, you can use the <SPAN CLASS="eln">Avg</SPAN> function in the <SPAN CLASS="pop">query design grid</SPAN>, in an <SPAN CLASS="pop">SQL</SPAN> statement in <SPAN CLASS="pop">SQL view</SPAN> of the <SPAN CLASS="pop">Query window</SPAN>, or in an SQL statement within Visual&nbsp;Basic code. You can also use the <SPAN CLASS="eln">Avg</SPAN> function in a <SPAN CLASS="pop">calculated control</SPAN> on a form or report.</P>
The <SPAN CLASS="eln">Avg</SPAN> function is most useful in <SPAN CLASS="pop">totals queries</SPAN> and <SPAN CLASS="pop">crosstab queries</SPAN>. It functions the same way whether you create the query in the query design grid or as an SQL statement in SQL view.</P>
In the query design grid, you can create a new totals query by clicking the <SPAN CLASS="eln">Totals</SPAN> button on the <SPAN CLASS="eln">Query Design</SPAN> <SPAN CLASS="pop">toolbar</SPAN>. The <SPAN CLASS="eln">Total</SPAN> row is then inserted in the grid. You can set the <SPAN CLASS="eln">Total</SPAN> cell beneath a field to the aggregate function to perform on the data in that field.</P>
For example, suppose you have an Orders table that has both a Freight field and a ShipCity field. You can create a query that displays the average freight cost for orders sent to each city to which your company ships. Create a new totals query, and drag the ShipCity field to the query design grid. The <SPAN CLASS="eln">Total</SPAN> cell beneath the ShipCity field should be set to Group By. Drag the Freight field to the query design grid, and set the <SPAN CLASS="eln">Total</SPAN> cell beneath it to Avg. When you run the query, it will display the average freight cost by city.</P>
You can view the SQL statement for this query by switching to SQL view. In this example, Microsoft Access creates the following SQL statement:</P>

<pre><code>SELECT ShipCity, Avg(Freight) AS AvgOfFreight FROM Orders GROUP BY ShipCity;</code></pre>
You can also use an SQL statement within Visual&nbsp;Basic Code. For example, the following procedure creates a dynaset-type <SPAN CLASS="eln">Recordset</SPAN> object from the preceding SQL statement:</P>

<pre><code>Sub AvgFreight()
    Dim dbs As Database, rst As Recordset, strSQL As String
    Set dbs = CurrentDb
    strSQL = "SELECT ShipCity, Avg(Freight) AS AvgOfFreight " _
        &amp; "FROM Orders GROUP BY ShipCity;"
    Set rst = dbs.OpenRecordset(strSQL)
    rst.MoveLast
    Debug.Print rst.RecordCount
    Set dbs = Nothing
End Sub</code></pre>
To use the <SPAN CLASS="eln">Avg</SPAN> function in a calculated control, set the control's <SPAN CLASS="eln">ControlSource</SPAN> property to an expression containing the <SPAN CLASS="eln">Avg</SPAN> function. For example, to display the average freight cost for a set of orders in a text box, enter the following expression in the <SPAN CLASS="eln">ControlSource</SPAN> property of the text box:</P>

<pre><code>=Avg([Freight])</code></pre>
If you use the <SPAN CLASS="eln">Avg</SPAN> function in a calculated control, you can restrict the set of records against which the function is performed by setting the form's <SPAN CLASS="eln">Filter</SPAN> property.</P>
Example</P>
This example uses the Orders table to calculate the average freight charges for orders with freight charges over $100.</P>
This example calls the EnumFields procedure, which you can find in the SELECT statement example.</P>

<pre><code>Sub AvgX()

    Dim dbs As Database, rst As Recordset

    ' Modify this line to include the path to Northwind
    ' on your computer.
    Set dbs = OpenDatabase("Northwind.mdb")

    ' Calculate the average freight charges for orders
    ' with freight charges over $100.
    Set rst = dbs.OpenRecordset("SELECT Avg(Freight)" _
        &amp; " AS [Average Freight]" _
        &amp; " FROM Orders WHERE Freight &gt; 100;")
    
    ' Populate the Recordset.
    rst.MoveLast
    
    ' Call EnumFields to print the contents of the
    ' Recordset. Pass the Recordset object and desired
    ' field width.
    EnumFields rst, 25

    dbs.Close

End Sub</code></pre>
Example (Microsoft Access)</P>
The following example assumes that you have an Orders table that contains a field called Freight. You can use the <SPAN CLASS="eln">Avg</SPAN> function to calculate the average freight charges for orders with freight charges over $100. Enter the following expression in SQL view in the Query window:</P>

<pre><code>SELECT Avg([Freight]) AS [AverageFreight] FROM Orders WHERE [Freight] &gt; 100;</code></pre>
The next example creates a calculated control that displays the average freight charges for all of the underlying records in a form based on the same Orders table. Open a new&nbsp;form and set its <SPAN CLASS="eln">RecordSource</SPAN> property to Orders. Enter this expression in the <SPAN CLASS="eln">ControlSource</SPAN> property of a text box on the form. To apply a condition that limits the calculation to only some records, such as those for orders greater than $100, set the form's <SPAN CLASS="eln">Filter</SPAN> property.</P>

<pre><code>=Avg([Freight])</code></pre>
