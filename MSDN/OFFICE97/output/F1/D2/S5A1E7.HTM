<H2>Retreat Event</H2>Applies To</P>
Report section.</P>
Description</P>
The Retreat event occurs when Microsoft Access returns to a previous <SPAN CLASS="jump">report section</SPAN> during report formatting.</P>
<SPAN CLASS="nh">Note</SPAN>   The Retreat event applies to all report sections except <SPAN CLASS="pop">page headers</SPAN> and <SPAN CLASS="pop">footers</SPAN>.</P>
Remarks</P>
To run a <SPAN CLASS="pop">macro</SPAN> or <SPAN CLASS="pop">event procedure</SPAN> when this event occurs, set the OnRetreat property to the name of the macro or to [Event Procedure].</P>
Under certain circumstances, Microsoft Access must return to a previous report section to determine where certain <SPAN CLASS="pop">controls</SPAN> and <SPAN CLASS="pop">sections</SPAN> are on a report and whether they will fit in a given space. Examples include:</P>
<SPAN CLASS="list"><UL><LI CLASS="ULI1">Groups (except for page headers and footers) for which the KeepTogether property is set to either Whole Group or With First Detail.</LI><LI CLASS="ULI1"><SPAN CLASS="pop">Subreports</SPAN> or <SPAN CLASS="pop">subforms</SPAN> for which the CanGrow and/or CanShrink property is set to Yes.</LI><LI CLASS="ULI1">Sections on the last page of a report.</LI></UL></SPAN>In these situations, the <SPAN CLASS="jump">Format</SPAN> event occurs as Microsoft Access determines how the sections will fit on the printed page (however, a <SPAN CLASS="jump">Print</SPAN> event doesn't occur because the sections aren't being printed yet). If the sections can't be printed, Microsoft Access backs up to the necessary location so that the sections can actually be printed on the following page. The Retreat event occurs for each section past which Microsoft Access retreats. The Format event for each section then occurs again as Microsoft Access prepares to actually print the sections.</P>
For example, whenever Microsoft Access reaches the end of the last page while formatting a report, the Retreat event occurs for each previous section until Microsoft Access reaches the first section at the top of the last page. Then the Format event occurs again for each section on the page, followed by the Print events.</P>
You can run an event procedure or macro when the Retreat event occurs to undo any changes that you made when the Format event occurred for the section. This is useful when your Format event procedure or macro carries out actions, such as calculating page totals or controlling the size of a section, that you want to perform only once for each section.</P>
The Retreat event is also useful for maintaining the positioning of report items. For example, the Sales By Year report in the Northwind sample database uses this event to&nbsp;determine if a page header is printed or not (the page header is printed on pages following a page where the group header has been printed, and the page header isn't printed on the page following a page where the group footer has been printed).</P>
