<H1>Idle Method</H1>Applies To</P>
<SPAN CLASS="eln">DBEngine</SPAN> object.</P>
Description</P>
Suspends data processing, enabling the <SPAN CLASS="pop">Microsoft&nbsp;Jet database engine</SPAN> to complete any pending tasks, such as memory optimization or <SPAN CLASS="pop">page</SPAN> timeouts (<SPAN CLASS="pop">Microsoft&nbsp;Jet workspaces</SPAN> only).</P>
Syntax</P>
<SPAN CLASS="eln">DBEngine.Idle</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="eln"> [</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="eln">dbRefreshCache</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="eln">]</SPAN></P>
Remarks</P>
The <SPAN CLASS="eln">Idle</SPAN> method allows the Microsoft&nbsp;Jet database engine to perform background tasks that may not be up-to-date because of intense data processing. This is often true&nbsp;in multiuser, multitasking environments that don't have enough background processing time to keep all records in a Recordset current.</P>
Usually, read locks are removed and data in local dynaset-type <SPAN CLASS="eln">Recordset</SPAN> objects are&nbsp;updated only when no other actions (including mouse movements) occur. If you periodically use the <SPAN CLASS="eln">Idle</SPAN> method, Microsoft&nbsp;Jet can catch up on background processing tasks by releasing unneeded read locks.</P>
Specifying the optional <SPAN CLASS="eln">dbRefreshCache</SPAN> argument forces any pending writes to .mdb&nbsp;files, and refreshes memory with the most current data from the .mdb file.</P>
You don't need to use this method in single-user environments unless multiple instances of an application are running. The <SPAN CLASS="eln">Idle</SPAN> method may increase performance in&nbsp;a multiuser environment because it forces the database engine to write data to disk, releasing locks on memory.</P>
<SPAN CLASS="nh">Note</SPAN>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can also release read locks by making operations part of a <SPAN CLASS="pop">transaction</SPAN>.</P>
Example</P>
This example uses the <SPAN CLASS="eln">Idle</SPAN> method to ensure that an output procedure is accessing the most current data available from the database. The IdleOutput procedure is required for this procedure to run.</P>

<pre><code>Sub IdleX()

    Dim dbsNorthwind As Database
    Dim strCountry As String
    Dim strSQL As String
    Dim rstOrders As Recordset

    Set dbsNorthwind = OpenDatabase("Northwind.mdb")

    ' Get name of country from user and build SQL statement
    ' with it.
    strCountry = Trim(InputBox("Enter country:"))
    strSQL = "SELECT * FROM Orders WHERE ShipCountry = '" &amp; _
        strCountry &amp; "' ORDER BY OrderID"

    ' Open Recordset object with SQL statement.
    Set rstOrders = dbsNorthwind.OpenRecordset(strSQL)
    ' Display contents of Recordset object.
    IdleOutput rstOrders, strCountry

    rstOrders.Close
    dbsNorthwind.Close

End Sub

Sub IdleOutput(rstTemp As Recordset, strTemp As String)

    ' Call the Idle method to release unneeded locks, force
    ' pending writes, and refresh the memory with the current
    ' data in the .mdb file.
    DBEngine.Idle dbRefreshCache

    ' Enumerate the Recordset object.
    With rstTemp
        Debug.Print "Orders from " &amp; strTemp &amp; ":"
        Debug.Print , "OrderID", "CustomerID", "OrderDate"
        Do While Not .EOF
            Debug.Print , !OrderID, !CustomerID, !OrderDate
            .MoveNext
