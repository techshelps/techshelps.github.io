<H2>Delete, BeforeDelConfirm, AfterDelConfirm Events</H2>Applies To</P>
Form.</P>
Description</P>
<SPAN CLASS="list"><UL><LI CLASS="ULI1">The Delete event occurs when the user performs some action, such as pressing the <SPAN CLASS="kn">DEL</SPAN> key, to delete a <SPAN CLASS="pop">record</SPAN>, but before the record is actually deleted.</LI><LI CLASS="ULI1">The BeforeDelConfirm event occurs after the user deletes to the buffer one or more records, but before Microsoft Access displays a dialog box asking the user to confirm the deletions.</LI><LI CLASS="ULI1">The AfterDelConfirm event occurs after the user confirms the deletions and the records are actually deleted or when the deletions are canceled.
</LI></UL></SPAN>Remarks</P>
To run a <SPAN CLASS="pop">macro</SPAN> or <SPAN CLASS="pop">event procedure</SPAN> when these events occur, set the OnDelete<SPAN CLASS="jump">, </SPAN>BeforeDelConfirm<SPAN CLASS="jump">, or </SPAN>AfterDelConfirm property to the name of the macro or to [Event Procedure].</P>
After a record is deleted, it's stored in a temporary buffer. The BeforeDelConfirm event occurs after the Delete event (or if you've deleted more than one record, after all the records are deleted, with a Delete event occurring for each record), but before the <SPAN CLASS="eln">Delete Confirm</SPAN> dialog box is displayed. Canceling the BeforeDelConfirm event restores the record or records from the buffer and prevents the <SPAN CLASS="eln">Delete Confirm</SPAN> dialog box from being displayed.</P>
The AfterDelConfirm event occurs after a record or records are actually deleted or after a deletion or deletions are canceled. If the BeforeDelConfirm event isn't canceled, the AfterDelConfirm event occurs after the <SPAN CLASS="eln">Delete Confirm</SPAN> dialog box is displayed. The AfterDelConfirm event occurs even if the BeforeDelConfirm event is canceled. The AfterDelConfirm event procedure returns status information about the deletion. For example, you can use a macro or event procedure associated with the AfterDelConfirm event to recalculate totals affected by the deletion of records.</P>
If you cancel the Delete event, the BeforeDelConfirm and AfterDelConfirm events don't occur and the <SPAN CLASS="eln">Delete Confirm</SPAN> dialog box isn't displayed.</P>
<SPAN CLASS="nh">Note</SPAN>   The BeforeDelConfirm and AfterDelConfirm events don't occur and the <SPAN CLASS="eln">Delete Confirm</SPAN> dialog box isn't displayed if you clear the <SPAN CLASS="eln">Record Changes</SPAN> <SPAN CLASS="pop">check box</SPAN> under <SPAN CLASS="eln">Confirm</SPAN> on the <SPAN CLASS="eln">Edit/Find</SPAN> tab of the <SPAN CLASS="eln">Options</SPAN> dialog box, available by clicking <SPAN CLASS="eln">Options</SPAN> on the <SPAN CLASS="eln">Tools</SPAN> menu.</P>
By running a macro or an event procedure when the Delete event occurs, you can prevent a record from being deleted or allow a record to be deleted only under certain conditions. You can also use a Delete event to display a dialog box asking whether the user wants to delete a record before it's deleted.</P>
To delete a record, you can click <SPAN CLASS="eln">Delete Record</SPAN> on the <SPAN CLASS="eln">Edit</SPAN> menu. This deletes the current record (the record indicated by the <SPAN CLASS="pop">record selector</SPAN>). You can also click the record selector or click <SPAN CLASS="eln">Select Record</SPAN> on the <SPAN CLASS="eln">Edit</SPAN> menu to select the record, and then press the <SPAN CLASS="kn">DEL</SPAN> key to delete it. If you click <B>Delete </B><SPAN CLASS="eln">Record</SPAN>, the record selector of the current record, or <SPAN CLASS="eln">Select Record</SPAN>, the <SPAN CLASS="jump">Exit</SPAN> and <SPAN CLASS="jump">LostFocus</SPAN> events for the control that has the focus occur. If you've changed any data in the record, the <SPAN CLASS="jump">BeforeUpdate and AfterUpdate</SPAN> events for the record occur before the Exit and LostFocus events. If you click the record selector of a different record, the <SPAN CLASS="jump">Current</SPAN> event for that record also occurs.</P>
After you delete the record, the focus moves to the next record following the deleted record, and the Current event for that record occurs, followed by the <SPAN CLASS="jump">Enter</SPAN> and <SPAN CLASS="jump">GotFocus</SPAN> events for the first control in that record.</P>
The BeforeDelConfirm event then occurs, just before Microsoft Access displays the <SPAN CLASS="eln">Delete Confirm</SPAN> dialog box asking you to confirm the deletion. After you respond to the dialog box by confirming or canceling the deletion, the AfterDelConfirm event occurs.</P>
You can delete one or more records at a time. The Delete event occurs after each record is deleted. This enables you to access the data in each record before it's actually deleted, and selectively confirm or cancel each deletion in the Delete macro or event procedure. When you delete more than one record, the Current event for the record following the last deleted record and the Enter and GotFocus events for the first control in this record don't occur until all the records are deleted. In other words, a Delete event occurs for each selected record, but no other events occur until all the selected records are deleted. The BeforeDelConfirm and AfterDelConfirm events also don't occur until all the selected records are deleted.</P>
