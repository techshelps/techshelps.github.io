<H2>Updated Event</H2>Applies To</P>
ActiveX control, Bound Object Frame control, Unbound Object Frame control.</P>
Description</P>
The Updated event occurs when an <SPAN CLASS="pop">OLE object's</SPAN> data has been modified.</P>
<SPAN CLASS="nh">Note</SPAN>   The Updated event applies only to <SPAN CLASS="pop">controls</SPAN> on a <SPAN CLASS="pop">form</SPAN>, not controls on a <SPAN CLASS="pop">report</SPAN>.</P>
Remarks</P>
To run a <SPAN CLASS="pop">macro</SPAN> or <SPAN CLASS="pop">event procedure</SPAN> when this event occurs, set the OnUpdated property to the name of the macro or to [Event Procedure].</P>
You can use this event to determine if an object's data has been changed since it was last saved.</P>
The Updated event occurs when the data in an OLE object has been modified. This update can come from the application in which the object was created or from one of the <SPAN CLASS="pop">linked</SPAN> copies of this object. As a result, this event is asynchronous with other Microsoft Access control events.</P>
<SPAN CLASS="nh">Notes</SPAN></P>
<SPAN CLASS="list"><UL><LI CLASS="ULI1">The Updated event and the <SPAN CLASS="jump">BeforeUpdate and AfterUpdate</SPAN> events for <SPAN CLASS="pop">bound</SPAN> and <SPAN CLASS="pop">unbound object frames</SPAN> are not related. The Updated event occurs when an OLE object's data is changed, and the BeforeUpdate and AfterUpdate events occur when data is <SPAN CLASS="pop">updated</SPAN>. Although not related, all three events usually occur when an OLE object's data is changed. The Updated event generally occurs before the BeforeUpdate and AfterUpdate events; however, this may not happen every time.</LI><LI CLASS="ULI1">The Calendar control included with Microsoft Access&nbsp;97 no longer supports the Updated event. If you convert a database that includes the Calendar control from a previous version of Microsoft Access to Microsoft Access&nbsp;97, you should move any code in the Updated event of the Calendar control to the AfterUpdate event.
