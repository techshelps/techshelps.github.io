<H2>RecordLocks Property</H2>Applies To</P>
Action query, Crosstab query, Form, Parameter query, <SPAN CLASS="eln">QueryDef</SPAN> object, Report, Select query, SQL-Specific query.</P>
Description</P>
You can use the <SPAN CLASS="eln">RecordLocks</SPAN> property to determine how records are locked and what happens when two users try to edit the same record at the same time. When you edit a record, Microsoft Access can automatically lock that record to prevent other users from changing it before you are finished.</P>
<SPAN CLASS="list"><UL><LI CLASS="ULI1">Forms. Specifies how <SPAN CLASS="pop">records</SPAN> in the underlying table or query are <SPAN CLASS="pop">locked</SPAN> when data in a <SPAN CLASS="pop">multiuser database</SPAN> is updated.</LI><LI CLASS="ULI1">Reports. Specifies whether records in the underlying table or query are locked while a report is previewed or printed.</LI><LI CLASS="ULI1">Queries. Specifies whether records in a query (typically an <SPAN CLASS="pop">action query</SPAN> in a multiuser database) are locked while the query is run.</LI></UL></SPAN>Setting</P>
The <SPAN CLASS="eln">RecordLocks</SPAN> property uses the following settings.</P>

This is also called "optimistic" locking. If two users attempt to save changes to the same record, Microsoft Access displays a message to the user who tries to save the record second. This user can then discard the record, copy the record to the Clipboard, or replace the changes made by the other user. This setting is typically used on read-only forms or in single-user databases. It is also used in multiuser databases to permit more than one user to be able to make changes to the same record at the same time.</P>
In reports, records aren't locked while the report is previewed or printed.</P>
In queries, records aren't locked while the query is run.</P></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP"><FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica" SIZE="2">0</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP"><FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica" SIZE="2">All Records</P></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP"><FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica" SIZE="2">All records in the underlying table or query are locked while the form is open in <SPAN CLASS="pop">Form view</SPAN> or <SPAN CLASS="pop">Datasheet view</SPAN>, while the report is previewed or printed, or while the query is run. Although users can read the records, no one can edit, add, or delete any records until the form is closed, the report has finished printing, or the query has finished running.</P></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP"><FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica" SIZE="2">1</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP"><FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica" SIZE="2">Edited Record</P></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP"><FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica" SIZE="2">(Forms and queries only) A <SPAN CLASS="pop">page</SPAN> of records is locked as soon as any user starts editing any field in the record and stays locked until the user moves to another record. Consequently, a record can be edited by only one person at a time. This is also called "pessimistic" locking.</P></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP"><FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica" SIZE="2">2</P></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>
<BR></P>You can set this property by using a form's <SPAN CLASS="jump">property sheet</SPAN>, a <SPAN CLASS="jump">macro</SPAN>, or <SPAN CLASS="jump">Visual&nbsp;Basic</SPAN>.</P>
Remarks</P>
You can use the No Locks setting for forms if only one person uses the underlying tables or queries or makes all the changes to the data.</P>
In a multiuser database, you can use the No Locks setting if you want to use optimistic locking and warn users attempting to edit the same record on a form. You can use the Edited Record setting if you want to prevent two or more users editing data at the same time.</P>
You can use the All Records setting when you need to ensure that no changes are made to data after you start to preview or print a report or run an <SPAN CLASS="pop">append</SPAN>, <SPAN CLASS="pop">delete</SPAN>, <SPAN CLASS="pop">make-table</SPAN>, or <SPAN CLASS="pop">update</SPAN> query.</P>
In Form view or Datasheet view, each locked record has a locked indicator in its record selector.</P>
<SPAN CLASS="nh">Tip</SPAN>   To change the default <SPAN CLASS="eln">RecordLocks</SPAN> property setting for forms, click <SPAN CLASS="eln">Options</SPAN> on the <SPAN CLASS="eln">Tools</SPAN> menu, click the <SPAN CLASS="eln">Advanced</SPAN> tab on the <SPAN CLASS="eln">Options</SPAN> dialog box, and then select the desired option under <SPAN CLASS="eln">Default Record Locking</SPAN>.</P>
Data in a form, report, or query from an <SPAN CLASS="pop">Open Database Connectivity</SPAN> (ODBC) database is treated as if the No Locks setting were chosen, regardless of the <SPAN CLASS="eln">RecordLocks</SPAN> property setting.</P>
