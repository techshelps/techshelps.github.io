<H2>ApplyFilter Event</H2>Applies To</P>
Form.</P>
Description</P>
The ApplyFilter event occurs when the user does one of the following:</P>
<SPAN CLASS="list"><UL><LI CLASS="ULI1">Clicks <SPAN CLASS="eln">Apply Filter/Sort</SPAN> on the <SPAN CLASS="eln">Records</SPAN> menu in <SPAN CLASS="pop">Form view</SPAN>, clicks <SPAN CLASS="eln">Apply Filter/Sort</SPAN> on the <SPAN CLASS="eln">Filter</SPAN> menu in the Filter window, or clicks the <SPAN CLASS="eln">Apply Filter</SPAN> button on the <SPAN CLASS="pop">toolbar</SPAN>. This applies the most recently created <SPAN CLASS="pop">filter</SPAN> (created by using either the <SPAN CLASS="pop">Filter By Form</SPAN> feature or the <SPAN CLASS="pop">Advanced Filter/Sort</SPAN> window).</LI><LI CLASS="ULI1">On the <SPAN CLASS="eln">Records</SPAN> menu in Form view, points to <SPAN CLASS="eln">Filter</SPAN> and clicks <SPAN CLASS="eln">Filter By Selection</SPAN>, or clicks the <SPAN CLASS="eln">Filter By Selection</SPAN> button on the toolbar. This applies a filter based on the current selection in the <SPAN CLASS="pop">form</SPAN>.</LI><LI CLASS="ULI1">On the <SPAN CLASS="eln">Records</SPAN> menu in Form view, points to <SPAN CLASS="eln">Filter</SPAN> and clicks <SPAN CLASS="eln">Filter Excluding Selection</SPAN>. This applies a filter excluding the current selection in the form.</LI><LI CLASS="ULI1">Clicks <SPAN CLASS="eln">Remove Filter/Sort</SPAN> on the <SPAN CLASS="eln">Records</SPAN> menu in Form view, or clicks the <SPAN CLASS="eln">Remove Filter</SPAN> button on the toolbar. This removes any filter (or sort) currently applied to the form.</LI><LI CLASS="ULI1">Clicks <SPAN CLASS="eln">Filter By Selection</SPAN>, <B>Filter Excluding Selection</B>, or <SPAN CLASS="eln">Remove Filter/Sort</SPAN> or enters a value or <SPAN CLASS="pop">expression</SPAN> in the <SPAN CLASS="eln">Filter For</SPAN> box on the <SPAN CLASS="pop">shortcut menu</SPAN> when a <SPAN CLASS="pop">bound control</SPAN> has the <SPAN CLASS="pop">focus</SPAN>.</LI><LI CLASS="ULI1">Closes the Advanced Filter/Sort window or the Filter By Form window.</LI><LI CLASS="ULI1">Clicks <SPAN CLASS="eln">Advanced Filter/Sort</SPAN> on the <SPAN CLASS="eln">Filter</SPAN> menu while the Filter By Form window is open, or clicks <SPAN CLASS="eln">Filter By Form</SPAN> on the <SPAN CLASS="eln">Filter</SPAN> menu while the Advanced Filter/Sort window is open. This causes the ApplyFilter event to occur when the open filter window is closed, and then the <SPAN CLASS="jump">Filter</SPAN> event to occur when the other filter window is opened.
</LI></UL></SPAN>Remarks</P>
To run a <SPAN CLASS="pop">macro</SPAN> or <SPAN CLASS="pop">event procedure</SPAN> when this event occurs, set the OnApplyFilter property to the name of the macro or to [Event Procedure].</P>
You can use the ApplyFilter event to:</P>
<SPAN CLASS="list"><UL><LI CLASS="ULI1">Make sure the filter that is being applied is correct. For example, you may want to be sure that any filter applied to an Orders form includes criteria restricting the OrderDate field. To do this, check the form's Filter property value to make sure this criteria is included in the <SPAN CLASS="pop">WHERE</SPAN> clause expression.</LI><LI CLASS="ULI1">Change the display of the form before the filter is applied. For example, when you apply a certain filter, you may want to disable or hide some fields that aren't appropriate for the records displayed by this filter.</LI><LI CLASS="ULI1">Undo or change actions you took when the Filter event occurred. For example, you can disable or hide some controls on the form when the user is creating the filter, because you don't want these controls to be included in the filter criteria. You can then enable or show these controls after the filter is applied.
</LI></UL></SPAN>The actions in the ApplyFilter macro or event procedure occur before the filter is applied or removed; or after the Advanced Filter/Sort or Filter By Form window is closed, but before the form is redisplayed. The criteria you've entered in the newly created filter are available to the ApplyFilter macro or event procedure as the setting of the <SPAN CLASS="eln">Filter</SPAN> property.</P>
<SPAN CLASS="nh">Note</SPAN>   The ApplyFilter event doesn't occur when the user does one of the following:</P>
<SPAN CLASS="list"><UL><LI CLASS="ULI1">Applies or removes a filter by using the <SPAN CLASS="jump">ApplyFilter</SPAN>, <SPAN CLASS="jump">OpenForm</SPAN>, or <SPAN CLASS="jump">ShowAllRecords</SPAN> actions in a macro, or their corresponding methods of the DoCmd object in Visual&nbsp;Basic.</LI><LI CLASS="ULI1">Uses the <SPAN CLASS="jump">Close</SPAN> action or the Close method of the <SPAN CLASS="eln">DoCmd</SPAN> object to close the Advanced Filter/Sort window or the Filter By Form window.</LI><LI CLASS="ULI1">Sets the <SPAN CLASS="eln">Filter</SPAN> property or FilterOn property in a macro or Visual&nbsp;Basic (although you can set these properties in an ApplyFilter macro or event procedure).
