<H2>DblClick Event</H2>Applies To</P>
Bound Object Frame control, Chart control, Check Box control, Combo Box control, Command Button control, Form, Form section, Image control, Label control, List Box control, Option Button control, Option Group control, Page, Rectangle control, Tab control, Text Box control, Toggle Button control, Unbound Object Frame control.</P>
Description</P>
The DblClick event occurs when the user presses and releases the left mouse button twice over an <SPAN CLASS="pop">object</SPAN> within the double-click time limit of the system.</P>
On a form, the DblClick event occurs when the user double-clicks a blank area or record selector on the form. For a control, it occurs when the user double-clicks a control or its label in Form view. The DblClick event occurs when the user double-clicks the form or control but before the result of the double-click action occurs (for example, before Microsoft Access selects the word that the insertion point is on in a text box).</P>
<SPAN CLASS="nh">Notes</SPAN></P>
<SPAN CLASS="list"><UL><LI CLASS="ULI1">The DblClick event applies only to forms, form <SPAN CLASS="pop">sections</SPAN>, and controls on a form, not controls on a <SPAN CLASS="pop">report</SPAN>.</LI><LI CLASS="ULI1">This event doesn't apply to <SPAN CLASS="pop">check boxes</SPAN>, <SPAN CLASS="pop">option buttons</SPAN>, or <SPAN CLASS="pop">toggle buttons</SPAN> in an <SPAN CLASS="pop">option group</SPAN>. It applies only to the option group itself.</LI><LI CLASS="ULI1">This event doesn't apply to a <SPAN CLASS="pop">label</SPAN> attached to another control, such as the label for a text box. It applies only to "freestanding" labels. Double-clicking an attached label has the same effect as double-clicking the associated control. The normal events for the control occur, not any events for the attached label.
</LI></UL></SPAN>Remarks</P>
To run a <SPAN CLASS="pop">macro</SPAN> or <SPAN CLASS="pop">event procedure</SPAN> when this event occurs, set the OnDblClick property to the name of the macro or to [Event Procedure].</P>
For controls, the result of double-clicking depends on the control. For example, double-clicking a word in a text box selects the entire word. Double-clicking a control containing an <SPAN CLASS="pop">OLE object</SPAN> starts the application used to create the object, allowing it to be edited.</P>
If the DblClick event doesn't occur within the double-click time limit of the system, the form, form section, or control recognizes two <SPAN CLASS="jump">Click</SPAN> events instead of a single DblClick event. The double-click time limit depends on the setting under <SPAN CLASS="eln">Double-Click Speed</SPAN> on the <SPAN CLASS="eln">Buttons</SPAN> tab of the <SPAN CLASS="eln">Mouse</SPAN> option of Windows Control Panel.</P>
By running a macro or an event procedure when the DblClick event occurs, you can open a window or document when an icon is double-clicked.</P>
Double-clicking a control causes both Click and DblClick events to occur. If the control doesn't already have the <SPAN CLASS="pop">focus</SPAN> when you double-click it, the <SPAN CLASS="jump">Enter</SPAN> and <SPAN CLASS="jump">GotFocus</SPAN> events for the control occur before the Click and DblClick events.</P>
For objects that receive mouse events, the events occur in this order:</P>
    MouseDown <img src="rarrow.gif"> MouseUp <img src="rarrow.gif"> Click <img src="rarrow.gif"> DblClick</P>
When you double-click a <SPAN CLASS="pop">command button</SPAN>, the following events occur in this order:</P>
    MouseDown <img src="rarrow.gif"> MouseUp <img src="rarrow.gif"> Click <img src="rarrow.gif"> DblClick <img src="rarrow.gif"> MouseUp <img src="rarrow.gif"> Click</P>
The second click may have no effect (for example, if the Click macro or event procedure opens a <SPAN CLASS="pop">modal</SPAN> dialog box in response to the first Click event). To prevent the second Click macro or event procedure from running, put a <SPAN CLASS="jump">CancelEvent</SPAN> action in the DblClick macro or use the Cancel argument in the DblClick event procedure. Note that, generally speaking, double-clicking a command button should be discouraged.</P>
If you double-click any other control besides a command button, the second Click event doesn't occur.</P>
