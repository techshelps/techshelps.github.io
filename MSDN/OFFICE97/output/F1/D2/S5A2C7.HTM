<H1>MoveFirst, MoveLast, MoveNext, MovePrevious Methods</H1>Applies To</P>
Dynamic-Type <SPAN CLASS="eln">Recordset</SPAN> object, Dynaset-Type <SPAN CLASS="eln">Recordset</SPAN> object, Forward-Only–Type <SPAN CLASS="eln">Recordset</SPAN> object, <SPAN CLASS="eln">Recordset</SPAN> object, Snapshot-Type <SPAN CLASS="eln">Recordset</SPAN> object, Table-Type <SPAN CLASS="eln">Recordset</SPAN> object.</P>
Description</P>
Move to the first, last, next, or previous record in a specified Recordset object and make that record the <SPAN CLASS="pop">current record</SPAN>.</P>
Syntax</P>
<SPAN CLASS="p">recordset</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="eln">.</SPAN>{<SPAN CLASS="eln">MoveFirst</SPAN> | <SPAN CLASS="eln">MoveLast</SPAN> [<B>dbRunAsync</B>] | <SPAN CLASS="eln">MoveNext</SPAN> | <SPAN CLASS="eln">MovePrevious</SPAN>}</P>
The <SPAN CLASS="p">recordset</SPAN> placeholder is an <SPAN CLASS="pop">object variable</SPAN> that represents an open <SPAN CLASS="eln">Recordset</SPAN> object.</P>
Remarks</P>
Use the <SPAN CLASS="eln">Move</SPAN> methods to move from record to record without applying a condition.</P>
<HR CLASS="cas">
<SPAN CLASS="cah">Caution</SPAN>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you edit the current record, be sure you use the <SPAN CLASS="eln">Update</SPAN> method to save the changes before you move to another record. If you move to another record without updating, your changes are lost without warning.</P>
<HR CLASS="cae">
When you open a <SPAN CLASS="eln">Recordset</SPAN>, the first record is current and the <SPAN CLASS="eln">BOF</SPAN> property is <SPAN CLASS="eln">False</SPAN>. If the <SPAN CLASS="eln">Recordset</SPAN> contains no records, the <SPAN CLASS="eln">BOF</SPAN> property is <SPAN CLASS="eln">True</SPAN>, and there is no current record.</P>
If the first or last record is already current when you use <SPAN CLASS="eln">MoveFirst</SPAN> or <SPAN CLASS="eln">MoveLast</SPAN>, the current record doesn't change.</P>
If you use <SPAN CLASS="eln">MovePrevious</SPAN> when the first record is current, the <SPAN CLASS="eln">BOF</SPAN> property is <SPAN CLASS="eln">True</SPAN>, and there is no current record. If you use <SPAN CLASS="eln">MovePrevious</SPAN> again, an error occurs, and <SPAN CLASS="eln">BOF</SPAN> remains <SPAN CLASS="eln">True</SPAN>.</P>
If you use <SPAN CLASS="eln">MoveNext</SPAN> when the last record is current, the <SPAN CLASS="eln">EOF</SPAN> property is <SPAN CLASS="eln">True</SPAN>, and there is no current record. If you use <SPAN CLASS="eln">MoveNext</SPAN> again, an error occurs, and <SPAN CLASS="eln">EOF</SPAN> remains <SPAN CLASS="eln">True</SPAN>.</P>
If <SPAN CLASS="p">recordset</SPAN> refers to a table-type <SPAN CLASS="eln">Recordset</SPAN> (<SPAN CLASS="pop">Microsoft Jet workspaces</SPAN> only), movement follows the <SPAN CLASS="pop">current index</SPAN>. You can set the current index by using the <SPAN CLASS="eln">Index</SPAN> property. If you don't set the current index, the order of returned records is undefined.</P>
<SPAN CLASS="ih">Important</SPAN>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can use the <SPAN CLASS="eln">MoveLast</SPAN> method to fully populate a dynaset- or snapshot-type <SPAN CLASS="eln">Recordset</SPAN> to provide the current number of records in the <SPAN CLASS="eln">Recordset</SPAN>. However, if you use <SPAN CLASS="eln">MoveLast</SPAN> in this way, you can slow down your application's performance. You should only use <SPAN CLASS="eln">MoveLast</SPAN> to get a record count if it is absolutely necessary to obtain an accurate record count on a newly opened <SPAN CLASS="eln">Recordset</SPAN>. If you use the <B>dbRunAsync</B> constant with <SPAN CLASS="eln">MoveLast</SPAN>, the method call is asynchronous. You can use the <B>StillExecuting</B> property to determine when the <B>Recordset</B> is fully populated, and you can use the <B>Cancel</B> method to terminate execution of the&nbsp;asynchronous <B>MoveLast</B> method call.</P>
You can't use the <SPAN CLASS="eln">MoveFirst</SPAN>, <SPAN CLASS="eln">MoveLast</SPAN>, and <SPAN CLASS="eln">MovePrevious</SPAN> methods on a <SPAN CLASS="pop">forward-only–type</SPAN> <B>Recordset</B> object.</P>
To move the position of the current record in a <SPAN CLASS="eln">Recordset</SPAN> object a specific number of&nbsp;records forward or backward, use the <SPAN CLASS="eln">Move</SPAN> method.</P>
See Also</P>
<SPAN CLASS="eln">AbsolutePosition</SPAN> property, <SPAN CLASS="eln">BOF</SPAN>, <SPAN CLASS="eln">EOF</SPAN> properties, <SPAN CLASS="eln">Cancel</SPAN> method, <SPAN CLASS="eln">FindFirst</SPAN>, <SPAN CLASS="eln">FindLast</SPAN>, <SPAN CLASS="eln">FindNext</SPAN>, <SPAN CLASS="eln">FindPrevious</SPAN> methods, <SPAN CLASS="eln">Index</SPAN> property, <SPAN CLASS="eln">Move</SPAN> method, <SPAN CLASS="eln">RecordCount</SPAN> property, <SPAN CLASS="eln">Seek</SPAN> method, <SPAN CLASS="eln">StillExecuting</SPAN> property.</P>
Example</P>
This example uses the <SPAN CLASS="eln">MoveFirst</SPAN>, <SPAN CLASS="eln">MoveLast</SPAN>, <SPAN CLASS="eln">MoveNext</SPAN>, and <SPAN CLASS="eln">MovePrevious</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="eln"> </SPAN>methods to move the record pointer of a <SPAN CLASS="eln">Recordset</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="eln"> </SPAN>based on the supplied command. The MoveAny procedure is required for this procedure to run.</P>

Example (Microsoft Access)</P>
The following example uses the <SPAN CLASS="eln">MoveLast</SPAN> method to populate the <SPAN CLASS="eln">Recordset</SPAN> object so the number of records can be counted. The <SPAN CLASS="eln">MoveFirst</SPAN> method then moves the current record pointer to the first record in the <SPAN CLASS="eln">Recordset</SPAN> object. The procedure prompts the user to enter a number, then moves that number of records forward.</P>

<pre><code>Sub MoveThroughRecords()
    Dim dbs As Database, rst As Recordset, intI As Integer
    Dim strNumber As String
    
    ' Return reference to current database.
    Set dbs = CurrentDb
    Set rst = dbs.OpenRecordset("Products")
    ' Populate Recordset object.
    rst.MoveLast
    ' Return to first record.
    rst.MoveFirst
    ' Get number smaller than number of records.
    strNumber = InputBox("Please enter a number less than " _
        &amp; rst.RecordCount &amp; ".")
    ' Move specified number of records.
    For intI = 1 To strNumber
        rst.MoveNext
    Next intI
