<H1>KeepLocal Property</H1>Applies To</P>
<SPAN CLASS="eln">Document</SPAN> object, <SPAN CLASS="eln">QueryDef</SPAN> object, <SPAN CLASS="eln">TableDef</SPAN> object.</P>
Description</P>
Sets or returns a value on a table, query, form, report, macro, or module that you do not want to replicate when the database is replicated (<SPAN CLASS="pop">Microsoft Jet workspaces</SPAN> only).</P>
<SPAN CLASS="nh">Note</SPAN>   Before getting or setting the <SPAN CLASS="op">KeepLocal</SPAN> property on a TableDef, or QueryDef<B> </B>object, you must create it by using the CreateProperty method and append it to the Properties collection for the object.</P>
Settings and Return Values</P>
The setting or return value is a Text data type. If you set this property to <SPAN CLASS="cte">"T"</SPAN>, the object will remain local when the database is replicated. You can't use the <SPAN CLASS="eln">KeepLocal</SPAN> property on objects after they have been replicated.</P>
Remarks</P>
Once you set the <B>KeepLocal</B> property, it will appear in the <SPAN CLASS="eln">Properties</SPAN> collection for the Document object representing the host object.</P>
Before setting the <SPAN CLASS="eln">KeepLocal </SPAN>property, you should check the value of the Replicable<SPAN CLASS="eln"> </SPAN>property.</P>
After you make a database replicable, all new objects created within the <SPAN CLASS="pop">Design Master</SPAN>, or in any other <SPAN CLASS="pop">replicas</SPAN> in the set, are <SPAN CLASS="pop">local objects</SPAN>. Local objects remain in the replica in which they're created and aren't copied throughout the <SPAN CLASS="pop">replica set</SPAN>. Each time you make a new replica in the set, the new replica contains all the replicable objects from the source replica, but none of the local objects from the source replica.</P>
If you create a new object in a replica and want to change it from local to replicable so&nbsp;that all users can use it, you can either create the object in or import it into the Design Master. Be sure to delete the local object from any replicas; otherwise, you will encounter a design error. After the object is part of the Design Master, set the object's <SPAN CLASS="eln">Replicable</SPAN> property to <SPAN CLASS="eln">True</SPAN>.</P>
The object on which you are setting the <SPAN CLASS="eln">KeepLocal</SPAN> property might have already inherited that property from another object. However, the value set by the other object has no effect on the behavior of the object you want to keep local. You must explicitly set the property for each object.</P>

<SPAN CLASS="eln">CreateProperty</SPAN> method, <SPAN CLASS="eln">Replicable</SPAN> property.</P>
Example</P>
The following example appends the <SPAN CLASS="eln">KeepLocal</SPAN> property to the properties collection of&nbsp;a document object for the Utilities module in the Northwind database. You set this property on an object (such as a table) before a database is made replicable. When the database is converted to a <SPAN CLASS="pop">Design Master</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="eln">,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="eln"> </SPAN>the object you specified to remain local will not be dispersed to other members of the replica set. Adjust the path to Northwind.mdb as appropriate to its location on your computer.</P>

<pre><code>Sub KeepLocalNWObjectX()

    Dim dbsNorthwind As Database
    Dim docTemp As Document
    Dim prpTemp As Property

    Set dbsNorthwind = OpenDatabase("Northwind.mdb")
    Set docTemp = dbsNorthwind.Containers("Modules"). _
        Documents("Utility Functions")
    Set prpTemp = doc.CreateProperty("KeepLocal", _
        dbText, "T")
    docTemp.Properties.Append prpTemp
    dbsNorthwind.Close

End Sub</code></pre>
The following code sets the <SPAN CLASS="eln">KeepLocal</SPAN> property on the specified <SPAN CLASS="eln">TableDef</SPAN> object to <SPAN CLASS="cte">"T"</SPAN>. If the <SPAN CLASS="eln">KeepLocal</SPAN> property doesn't exist, it is created and appended to the table's <SPAN CLASS="eln">Properties</SPAN> collection, and given a value of <SPAN CLASS="cte">"T"</SPAN>.</P>

<pre><code>Sub SetKeepLocal(tdfTemp As TableDef)

    On Error GoTo ErrHandler

    tdfTemp.Properties("KeepLocal") = "T"

    On Error GoTo 0

    Exit Sub

ErrHandler:

    Dim prpNew As Property

    If Err.Number = 3270 Then
        Set prpNew = tdfTemp.CreateProperty("KeepLocal", _
            dbText, "T")
        tdfTemp.Properties.Append prpNew
    Else
        MsgBox "Error " &amp; Err &amp; ": " &amp; Error
    End If

End Sub</code></pre>
