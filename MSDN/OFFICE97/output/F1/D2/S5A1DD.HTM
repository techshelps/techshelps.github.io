<H2>Reports Collection</H2>Description</P>
The <SPAN CLASS="eln">Reports</SPAN> collection contains all of the currently open <SPAN CLASS="pop">reports</SPAN> in a Microsoft Access <SPAN CLASS="pop">database</SPAN>.</P>
Remarks</P>
You can use the <SPAN CLASS="eln">Reports</SPAN> collection in Visual&nbsp;Basic or in an <SPAN CLASS="pop">expression</SPAN> to refer to reports that are currently open. For example, you can enumerate the <SPAN CLASS="eln">Reports</SPAN> collection to set or return the values of properties of individual reports in the <SPAN CLASS="pop">collection</SPAN>.</P>
<SPAN CLASS="nh">Tip</SPAN>   The <SPAN CLASS="eln">For Each...Next</SPAN> statement is useful for enumerating a collection.</P>
You can refer to an individual Report object in the <SPAN CLASS="eln">Reports</SPAN> collection either by referring to the report by name, or by referring to its index within the collection.</P>
The <SPAN CLASS="eln">Reports</SPAN> collection is indexed beginning with zero. If you refer to a report by its index, the first report is Reports(0), the second report is Reports(1), and so on. If you opened Report1 and then opened Report2, Report2 would be referenced in the <SPAN CLASS="eln">Reports</SPAN> collection by its index as Reports(1). If you then closed Report1, Report2 would be referenced in the <SPAN CLASS="eln">Reports</SPAN> collection by its index as Reports(0).</P>
<SPAN CLASS="nh">Note</SPAN>   To list all reports in the database, whether open or closed, enumerate the Documents collection of the reports' Container object. You can then use the Name property of each individual Document object to return the name of a report.</P>
You can't add or delete a <SPAN CLASS="eln">Report</SPAN> object from the <SPAN CLASS="eln">Reports</SPAN> collection.</P>
Properties</P>
<SPAN CLASS="eln">Application</SPAN> property, <SPAN CLASS="eln">Count</SPAN> property, <SPAN CLASS="eln">Item</SPAN> property (collections), <SPAN CLASS="eln">Item</SPAN> property (ObjectFrame control), <SPAN CLASS="eln">Parent</SPAN> property.</P>
