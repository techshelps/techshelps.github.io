<P>The primary goals for the new wizard design are:

<UL>
	<LI>To update and improve overall graphic design styling and layout: 
<P>The new design calls for a new graphics style and a larger wizard size. (The UI design team is currently reviewing graphics styles and palette issues for the Wizard97 style. The next revision of this spec will include design and palette information for graphics) 

<P>In addition, by slightly enlarging the overall wizard size, layout of wizard text and controls can be improved.  Also, some 'negative space' within this slightly larger wizard gives a more contemporary look.
</LI>

	<LI>To provide a consistent and helpful user interface throughout the entire wizard: 
<P>Wizards have been inconsistent in their use of introductory and finish pages, interior page titles (or the lack of) and their presentation of information.  In the new wizard's Welcome page design, a general explanation of the Wizard's task or purpose is stated.  A list of the main or specific tasks can also be included. On all interior pages, a header area will name the task particular to each page and include a brief one-sentence description. The Completion page can contain either a general description of what was accomplished by the wizard or actually list the specific items completed by the user.  Following these simple guidelines will create consistent and easy to follow wizards.
