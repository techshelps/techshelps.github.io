<p>
One of the main benefits for IS administrators or decision makers that was described in this chapter is the great extent to which your department can leverage its knowledge of Windows NT. As you begin to deploy a thin-client/server solution, especially using the WinFrame server, you’ll want to make sure that the other members of your IS department receive training on Windows NT Ser-ver before they receive WinFrame training.</p>
<p>
In addition, the ICA client software, ICA protocol, and ICA system services are available today. Citrix Systems and others will continue to develop and extend their functionality.</p>
<p>
And finally, when you begin deploying a thin-client/server solution using WinFrame, you’ll gain a tremendous amount of control over how you deploy applications to your users.</p>
