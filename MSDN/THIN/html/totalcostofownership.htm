<p>
Zona Research, quoted on both the Boundless and NCD Web sites, calculates a 54–57 percent savings by using the thin-client/server model over a comparable number of networked PCs. The savings were projected over a five-year period by comparing the costs of setting up and maintaining 15 PCs and 15 Windows terminal solutions using ICA clients and a WinFrame server.</p>
<p>
Leading research firms are seeing the impact that thin-client/server computing can make in extended enterprises. Gartner Group, Intelliquest, IDC, and Zona Research are all conducting comprehensive studies on the market potential and user and enterprise benefits of the thin-client/server computing solution.</p>
<p>
In summary, the thin-client/server architecture provides IS departments and professionals with an excellent solution for managing databases, file servers, and application servers in one location while providing a central point for user configurations and security. It provides access to different types of users, including local users, remote users, and telecommuters. In addition, IS professionals will be able to scale services from a small number of users on a LAN to thousands of users worldwide. Corporations currently deploying applications using Citrix’s WinFrame include AT&amp;T Wireless, Chevron, GE Capital Services, and Sears. In the case studies in Chapter 8, you’ll find even more companies that are taking advantage of thin-client/server computing using Citrix tech-nology, including LaSalle Partners, Omnes, Honeywell Europe S.A., Pyramid Breweries, Standard Forms, Anne E. Biedel &amp; Associates, Clarion Health, Mecon, Claimsnet.com, Pro Staff, Relo-Action, Bell Mobility, and Vodac. Organizations as varied as the Orange County Public Defender’s Office, Florida Water Services, Goodwill Industries of Southern Arizona, the Tulsa City-County Library, and Idaho State University are also benefiting from this technology.</p>
