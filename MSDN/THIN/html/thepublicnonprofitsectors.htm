<p>
IS departments in public sector and nonprofit organizations face the same issues as corporations do, only more so. Lack of funding, diminishing resources, and aging equipment plague these organizations. They truly need to be creative about doing more with less. Thin-client/server solutions enable these organizations to obtain and share information and thus to function much more efficiently. The case studies presented in this section include Florida Water Services, Goodwill Industries of Southern Arizona, and the Tulsa City-County Library. As with the previous case studies, thin-client/server solutions using WinFrame as an application server allowed these organizations to deploy applications that would otherwise have been out of their reach.</p>
