<h1><a name="changestothinclientserverlandscape"></a>Changes to the Thin-Client/Server Landscape</h1>
<p>
In this section, I’ll focus on Microsoft’s and Citrix Systems’ current products and coming attractions with regard to thin-client/server computing solutions built on Microsoft Windows NT Server. (Keep in mind that the following information was current at the time this book was being written and is therefore subject to change.)</p>
<p class=indent>
Citrix and Microsoft will be working together on thin-client/server system software.</p>
<p>
As you’ll recall from previous chapters, Citrix built WinFrame as a licensed extension to Windows NT Server version 3.51. The innovative WinFrame technology was recognized and licensed by Microsoft for use with its forthcoming multiuser version of Windows NT, code-named Hydra. The most current version of the WinFrame product released by Citrix, version 1.7, was released in September 1997.</p>
<p>
Under an agreement reached between Citrix and Microsoft, Citrix engineers are building the multiuser component of Hydra. The technology will be made available in a forthcoming release of a multiuser version of Windows NT Server version 4. Citrix Systems will continue to do the development work for Microsoft on future versions of the technology.</p>
<p>
Citrix will continue to develop, enhance, and market its thin-client/server software, code-named pICAsso, for use with multi-user versions of Windows NT Server. Citrix pICAsso will continue to provide all of the necessary management, security, and performance enhancements for a robust thin-client/server environment. You’ll be able to use this ICA-based thin-client/server software natively with many devices as well as with any device that runs a Java-enabled browser. ICA is optimized for both low-bandwidth and high-bandwidth situations and allows access to applications on a wide range of devices, regardless of operating system. ICA clients can be used with new and/or old PCs running any version of Microsoft Windows or MS-DOS, Windows-based terminals, Apple Macintosh computers, network computers, UNIX workstations, and handheld devices such as cellular phones, personal digital assistants (PDAs), and handheld PCs based on the Psion EPOC32 operating system.</p>
<p class=indent>
Citrix pICAsso will significantly enhance Microsoft multiuser products.</p>
<p>
Microsoft will ship its Hydra client with a rudimentary client protocol called T-Share that works only for devices built around a version of the Windows operating system, which could include either Microsoft Windows CE, Microsoft Windows 95, Microsoft Windows NT Workstation, or some variation thereof. (See Figure 9-2.) Microsoft also plans to make a 16-bit version of the Windows 3.x client available. The Hydra beta product’s ship date is undetermined as of this writing.</p>

<p>
In addition to the client software, pICAsso will include a valuable set of additional system services and tools for use with ICA thin-client/server devices. Citrix will continue to sell products that enhance the services available with either WinFrame or future versions of pICAsso, adding additional security and encryption as well as load balancing.</p>
