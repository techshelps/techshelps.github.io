<p>
In developing WinFrame and the ICA client, Citrix has optimized network performance for connections as low as 9600 baud for use over a cellular modem. Because ICA clients are sending only mouse clicks and keystrokes to the server and receiving only screen updates, ICA clients maximize the use of your bandwidth whether you’re on a LAN or using an analog or ISDN modem. </p>

<b>The thin-client/server computing model gives you the power of single-point control to extend applications over any connection to any client with increased performance and security.</b></p>

Ironically, it takes a while for users to understand how this system software works because application performance is something they take for granted. However, when you add the ICA client to an old 386 with 2 MB of RAM and demonstrate the use of the latest 32-bit version of your software, eyes light up.</p>
