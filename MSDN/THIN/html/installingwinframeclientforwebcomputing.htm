<p>
Web browsers typically support configurable MIME types, giving you the ability to define how the browser reacts when it receives a file with a certain file extension (the characters that appear after the dot in the filename). Typically, the browser defines helper or viewer applications for the different MIME types it encounters. To enable your browser to support ICA extensions, you need to configure the ICA MIME type and associated file extension as follows:</p>
<p>
<code>MIME type/subtype: <b>application/x-ica</b> <br>
File Extension: <b>.ICA</b> <br>
Viewer program: <b>WFICA32.EXE</b> (32-bit) or <b>WFICA16.EXE</b> <br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; (16-bit)</code></p>
<p>
When you install the WinFrame Client for Web Computing software, all of the browsers listed in the preceding section are automatically configured for ICA file support to both launch and embed applications. You can install the WinFrame Client from a diskette or by downloading it via the Internet or your intranet. You can include installation files on diskettes by using the WinFrame Client Creator, which is available with WinFrame Enterprise version 1.7.</p>
<p class=indent>
Create installation disks, or download the install files from the Web.</p>
<p>
If your browser is not automatically configured for ICA file support after you install the WinFrame Client for Web Computing software, you can manually configure the MIME type, file extension, and viewer program name using the configuration information provided above.</p>
