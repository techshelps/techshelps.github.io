<p>
Most applications require each concurrent user to own a legal license. Companies use different methods for enforcing licensing, such as special electronic keys, serial numbers, or just a written agreement. WinFrame has the unique advantage of allowing you to install applications for all users at one time. However, you must comply with product licensing requirements as you would if the application were installed on separate workstations.</p>
