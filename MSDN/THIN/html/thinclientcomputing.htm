<p>
One solution to the enterprise-wide application deployment challenge lies beyond, but still supports, the traditional client/server model. Thin-client/server technologies are creating a new, network-centric computing paradigm. The thin-client technology is experiencing explosive growth and attention, as each camp attempts to absolutely define thin-client computing. On one side is a group led by Netscape, Oracle, and Sun Microsystems that advocates Java-based thin clients downloading and running on network computers. The other side, championed by Microsoft and Intel, leverages traditional desktop applications originally intended to run on stand-alone desktop computers. The thin-client/server architecture brings together the technology of these two camps.</p>
