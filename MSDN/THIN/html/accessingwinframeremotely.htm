<p>
WinFrame can be accessed remotely via either a traditional re-mote node (a network emulation that causes the remote connection to emulate a LAN connection) or a direct dial-in (in which the user’s modem dials directly to a modem attached to the Win-Frame server). WinFrame supports Remote Access Service (RAS), but RAS is not required for a user to dial into a WinFrame server. To take advantage of the features of ICA, the user must be attached to a WinStation on the WinFrame server. Once the initial connection is made via remote node such as RAS, the user must initiate a remote control or an ICA session with the Remote Application Manager on the client hardware device.</p>
<p>
<b>Remote Access Services</b> RAS, Microsoft’s remote-node server product (included with Windows NT), runs a network transport stack via telephone lines, converting your serial port and modems into a network “extension cord.” RAS can use IPX/SPX, TCP/IP, or NetBEUI to give users access to servers running these protocols. RAS supports SLIP and PPP. The remote-node client software establishes a remote-node connection to a WinFrame server by making a PPP connection to RAS. The system administrator is able to configure the client and RAS to use the transport protocol that is needed. Once the remote network connection has been established, the administrator can access the WinFrame client to start a network remote-control session. The default WinFrame server installation allows you to install Microsoft RAS, or you can install it after you install WinFrame.</p>
<p class=indent>
You can use RAS to access the WinFrame server.</p>
<p>
Citrix has extended the RAS client support beyond that currently provided with Windows NT 3.51 to include extended compatibility with non–Microsoft network environments as well as older clients running 16-bit MS-DOS and Windows.</p>
<p>
To minimize both the number of steps a user must take to connect to an ICA session and the layers involved, WinFrame supports direct asynchronous dial-up. An asynchronous WinStation can be created with the WinStation Configuration utility to inform the ICA server that a modem is attached to a serial device and that a WinStation should be enabled. Users connecting to this WinStation use the ICA client to dial directly to the modem attached to the server and are presented with a logon prompt. Once a user is authenticated, either a Windows NT desktop on the WinFrame server or the first window of the published application appears.</p>
