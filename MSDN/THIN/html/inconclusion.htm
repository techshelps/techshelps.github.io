<p>
The thin-client/server architecture can bring the best of different computing models and architectures together. You can instantly provide access to virtually any business-critical application, including 16-bit and 32-bit Windows applications, across any type of network connection to any type of client. You get the power of single-point control for deploying, managing, and supporting applications, including enterprise-wide rollouts, updates, and additions. Users get the universal access to the applications they need, the exceptional performance they require, and the familiarity and ease of use they’re accustomed to. Plus, this technology is cost-effective and secure. IS administrators can optimize resources by providing thin-client/server solutions to task-based users via thin-client devices, or thin-client/server software solutions to knowledge workers and power users.</p>
