<p>
Citrix predicts that the thin-client/server technology will help to expand the markets for computing solutions. The company also predicts that the thin-client/server model will be deployed in situations with narrow bandwidth, that need thin or light clients, where server-based management is required, and that pose security problems with replication of databases. For a great example of how a thin-client/server solution is working in this context, refer to the case study on Anne E. Biedel &amp; Associates, a medical practice, in Chapter 8.</p>

Thin-client/server computing will help to make computing ubiquitous.</p>

Messenger or delivery services, law enforcement agencies, and travel agencies are a few of the organizations that could benefit from thin-client/server solutions. These types of organizations need devices that are small and reliable and that have few hardware and software components for support and maintenance. If you’ve recently returned a rental car or received a package or delivery, think about the devices used by these workers.</p>
