<p>
Educational institutions stand to benefit greatly by putting thin-client/server technology to use in almost all areas and at all levels. From the administration of local school districts to the instructional labs of universities, students, teachers, and administrators alike can deploy and use state-of-the-art applications. In my previous position as a product manager at Microsoft, I was given a server by Zenith Data Systems for use in demonstrating developer tools running on a WinFrame server. I was able to install WinFrame, Microsoft Office, Microsoft Visual Basic, and Microsoft Visual C++. The Microsoft Internet Information Server was installed and the applications made available on the Microsoft intranet via an ICA file that was e-mailed to my colleagues.</p>
<p>
Those who saw the demo were amazed at how easy it was to create Visual Basic or Visual C++ applications.</p>
<p>
After I left Microsoft, the server was sent to Idaho State University, Pocatello, Idaho, for use in its instructional lab to teach information systems classes that required Visual Basic as a programming language.</p>
