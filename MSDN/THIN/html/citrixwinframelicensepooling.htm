<p>
Citrix offers license pooling as a WinFrame feature. License pooling allows an administrator to pool WinFrame sessions on the same subnet. Groups of servers that are load balanced can share&nbsp; registered WinFrame licenses. It doesn’t matter how many licenses are on any particular machine or to which machine a user is connected. For example, if you have three WinFrame servers and each has a base license of 15, and two of the servers have User License Packs for 10 users, the three servers can support up to 65 (15 + 15 + 15 + 10 + 10) concurrent users in any combination.</p>
<p>
You can exploit license pooling further with the WinFrame load-balancing feature, which allows for applications to be published to a server farm and for the server with the lightest load to accept the next connection. (See the “Sizing Requirements” section near the end of Chapter 6 for more information on load balancing.)</p>
