<p>
The devices you can access are not limited to those discussed so far. You can also run thin-client/server sessions on a Macintosh computer using either the Insignia Net Client or the Citrix Java ICA client. In addition, you can use the Citrix Java ICA client to run ICA sessions on X Windows terminals connected to UNIX servers as well as dedicated UNIX workstations connected to a network. For that matter, you can use the Java ICA client on any other hardware with a Web browser that includes a Java Virtual Machine.</p>
<p>
Insignia Solutions licenses the ICA client for the NTGRIGUE Net Client for the Macintosh. For version 2.0 of this product, you need a Macintosh computer with a minimum of a 68030 processor, 8 MB of RAM, System 7.1 or 7.5.3, and either Mac TCP/IP or Open Transport. You’ll need to use TCP/IP either through an Ethernet or an Appletalk connection. For more information about Insignia Solutions, go to Insignia’s Web site at:</p>

<p class=indent>
ICA clients are available for use with the Macintosh, UNIX workstations, and X terminals.</p>
<p>
If you use the Citrix Java ICA client, the minimum requirements for your Macintosh computer will be those for running either Microsoft Internet Explorer or Netscape Navigator, with the appropriate Citrix add-ins. (See Chapter 7 for more information about Web computing.) For more information about the Citrix Java ICA client, go to Citrix’s Web site at:</p>

<p>
You can run thin-client/server sessions on X terminals with an ICA client connected to a UNIX session, or you can add the ICA client to a dedicated UNIX workstation. With any UNIX connectivity, the thin-client/server solution can be used to access productivity applications or e-mail. You might encounter scientists or engineers using high-end UNIX workstations for their research. When it comes to writing their papers, however, they would probably prefer to use Windows applications.</p>
<p>
Several of the manufacturers that sell the dedicated Windows-based terminals also market X terminals already set up to access Windows applications through a WinFrame thin-client/server scenario. For more information, see the manufacturers listed in the “Windows-Based Terminals” section on page 76.</p>
