<p>
The best way to fully understand where and how the thin-client/server computing model can fit within your company or organization is to see where and how the technology has already been applied. Companies currently taking advantage of thin-client/server computing using Citrix technology include LaSalle Partners, Omnes, Honeywell Europe S.A., Pyramid Breweries, Standard Forms, Anne E. Biedel &amp; Associates, Clarion Health, Mecon, Claimsnet.com, Pro Staff, ReloAction, Bell Mobility, and Vodac. Thin-client/server technology is also used in such organizations as the Orange County Public Defender’s Office, Florida Water Services, and Goodwill Industries of Southern Arizona, at the Tulsa City-County Library, and at educational institutions such as Idaho State University.</p>
<p>
In this chapter, we’ll examine how each of these companies, organizations, and schools uses the thin-client/server model. As you’ll see, the thin-client/server technology is versatile and is useful in a broad range of situations. The case studies in this chapter are drawn from the following general areas:
<ul type=disc>
<li>
Accounting and financial reporting<br><br></li>
<li>
Sales automation<br><br></li>
<li>
Health care services<br><br></li>
<li>
Thin-client/server use on the Web<br><br></li>
<li>
Human resources management<br><br></li>
<li>
Communications and remote computing<br><br></li>
<li>
Legal services<br><br></li>
<li>
The public and nonprofit sectors<br><br></li>
<li>
Education</li>
</ul>
<p>
So read on for a closer look at some of the innovative ways in which thin-client/server computing with Citrix WinFrame is currently being used. Each case study is set up in a similar manner: first, the presenting problems are introduced; second, the software and hardware used to solve the problems are listed; and finally, the overall solution is described and its results are assessed. The cases are presented in terms of the vertical problem that was addressed.</p>
