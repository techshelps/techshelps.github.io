<p>
People like to argue about their favorite network operating systems, especially the Novell NetWare and Windows NT devotees. This argument is like the beer commercial in which fans debate whether the beer in question “tastes great” or is “less filling.” Both parties are right. Each network operating system has its advantages and disadvantages. Many people say that NetWare makes a great file server, and most won’t argue with the fact that Windows NT is a great application server. And UNIX still makes a great SQL server. The trick is to integrate them to take advantage of your existing infrastructure.</p>
<p>
WinFrame easily integrates into most network environments. Because the underlying operating system is Windows NT Server, the system inherits all of the compatibility of Windows NT Server. Once you install WinFrame, the rest of the network sees the system as a Windows NT server.</p>
<p>
Project leaders often deploy a WinFrame solution initially with the intention of extending the life of a legacy application. Integration in this case, at a high level, involves how compatible the application is with Windows NT and how users access the application. For example, if you use a Windows 32-bit client application to access a UNIX-based database application, with a NetWare network you would need to ensure the client ran on the WinFrame server and then answer the following questions:
<ul type=disc>
<li>
Will users access the WinFrame server using TCP/IP or IPX?<br><br></li>
<li>
Do you want users to log on to WinFrame separately from NetWare or autolog on to NetWare?<br><br></li>
<li>
Do you want users to bypass the WinFrame logon altogether?<br><br></li>
<li>
Do you want users to bypass the WinFrame program manager and launch the application automatically and then log off as soon as they exit the program?</li>
</ul>
<p>
Integration can be complete or partial—it’s your call based on the environment you want to provide to the users.</p>
