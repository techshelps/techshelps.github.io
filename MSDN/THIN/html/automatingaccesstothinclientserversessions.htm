<p>
In some instances, the administrator might not want the users even to be aware of the client. It is possible to make this happen by setting up sessions and then automating their access. The Windows client comes with two executables: the application that provides the graphical tools for configuring the sessions, named WFCMGR32.EXE for the Win32 client and WFCMGR.EXE for the Win16 client; and a run-time application that actually starts the session, named WFCRUN32.EXE for the Win32 client and WFCRUN.EXE for the Win16 client. The session definitions are kept in the APPSRV.INI file. This file is laid out like most INI files, with headings and definitions. To start preconfigured sessions, the user needs only the run-time application and the APPSRV.INI file. For example, assume the following section is in a user’s APPSRV.INI:</p>
<p class=indent>
Create ICA files for distribution.</p>
<p>
<code>[USA] <br>
TransportDriver=TCP/IP <br>
Address=SERVER1CTX <br>
Compress=On PersistentCacheEnabled=On <br>
IconPath=C:\Program Files\Citrix\WinFrame <br>
Client\wfcmgr32.exe <br>
WinStationDriver=ICA 3.0 <br>
Username=user1 <br>
Domain=masterDomain <br>
Password=0008ff990a95690b94 <br>
ProgramGroup=WinFrame Client <br>
DesiredHRES=800 <br>
DesiredVRES=600</code></p>
<p>
The administrator could create a desktop icon for this section with the following command line:</p>
<p>
<code>C:\Program Files\Citrix\WinFrame Client\ wfcrun32.exe “USA”</code></p>
<p>
The user would simply click this icon, and the session would begin.</p>
<p>
The administrator could also use the Remote Application Manager to create an APPSRV.INI file and then distribute the file along with the WinFrame client application.</p>
<p>
As mentioned previously, the administrator could use the Win-Frame Application Configuration utility to create FILENAME.ICA files for specific applications. These applications could be accessed from a desktop icon as well.</p>
