<p>
When you install the WinFrame software, you’ll need to enter the serial number on your CD into the WinFrame Licensing manager to obtain a license number. You’ll supply this license number to Citrix to receive an activation code. The following types of licenses are available for WinFrame:
<ul type=disc>
<li>
<i>Base license<b> </b></i>This license lets you take advantage of the multiuser features of the WinFrame software. WinFrame Enterprise comes with 15 base licenses. You can install only one base license at a time. Additional licenses won’t work without the base license. If the base license is not installed, only one concurrent logon is supported.<br><br></li>
<li>
<i>WinFrame User License Pack </i>The User License Pack licenses allow for additional user connections to the server. Users can log on to a WinFrame session, known as a WinStation, only if licenses are available. The number of licenses must support the number of connections; users can’t log on to a WinStation if the number of licenses has been exceeded. You can purchase User License Packs and then add WinStations later. You can also pool licenses among like servers. (See the “Citrix WinFrame License Pooling” section on the next page for more details.)<br><br></li>
<li>
<i>WinFrame Load Balancing Option Pack </i>This option enables the load-balancing features of WinFrame. Win-Frame load-balanced farms can contain servers running WinFrame 1.7 and later; versions of WinFrame prior to 1.7 cannot participate in a load-balanced farm.</li>
</ul>
<p>
You use the WinFrame Licensing utility to add, activate, and maintain WinFrame licenses. You can enter the license information either during the install process or after installation. An administrator can always change the WinFrame licensing configuration. After installation, you’ll find WinFrame Licensing in the Administrative Tools group. After you enter the serial number from the WinFrame CD, the program appends eight characters to generate a unique license number. You’ll then use this license number to register the product and receive an activation code from Citrix. You’ll find the information for activating your software in the <i>Activation Guide </i>that comes with your software package.</p>
<p>
You have 35 days to register with Citrix Systems from the time you install the WinFrame software. After 35 days, you’ll be able to use the server only for a single connection. If you register immediately after the install, you shouldn’t experience any downtime.</p>
