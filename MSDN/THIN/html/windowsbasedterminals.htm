<p>
You can build a thin-client/server solution that works with almost any hardware device. However, one of the hardware devices specifically developed for this model of computing is the Windows-based terminal. The Windows-based terminal is designed to be part of a thin-client/server solution with the ICA client software built into the terminal’s ROM. In addition, a Windows-based ter-minal has small amounts of RAM and ROM (in the 2-MB to 4-MB range for each), does not process applications locally (neither Java Virtual Machine nor browser), and can include other embedded terminal emulation (such as 3270, 5250, VT220, and so on) without local processing.</p>
<p class=indent>
Windows-based terminals, with no local processing, are the thinnest of thin-client/server hardware devices.</p>
<p>
The basic Windows-based terminal today uses the ICA client software to find a WinFrame server or servers when it boots up. It sends mouse and keyboard input to the server and displays the video output from the server. All application processing occurs on the server. Any Java applets execute in a browser on the server.</p>
<p>
A Windows-based terminal includes the following hardware components (based on specifications for WinTerm terminals found at the Wyse Technology, Inc., Web site):
<ul type=disc>
<li>
Keyboard<br><br></li>
<li>
Monitor<br><br></li>
<li>
Serial or network interfaces<br><br></li>
<li>
High-speed serial ports<br><br></li>
<li>
Bidirectional parallel port</li>
</ul>
<p>
The Windows-based terminal connects to the network and is centrally managed. There are no options for disk storage.</p>
<p>
Windows-based terminals are the thinnest Windows desktop and are extremely well suited to the needs of any task-based workers.</p>
<p>
Users access only the applications for which they were granted permission by their IS department. Windows-based terminals in combination with WinFrame servers are particularly powerful solutions for organizations in which the workers depend heavily on one or two mission-critical applications, such as point-of-sale, telesales, data processing, banking, insurance, hospital, human resources management, real estate, and other such applications. The terminals are relatively simple devices with very few parts to worry about. All support is done at the server. By using terminals in a thin-client/server solution, small businesses can more easily outsource their IS functions at a reasonable cost to companies that specialize in thin-client/server solutions. The availability of outsourced IS functions enabled by thin-client/server solutions can accelerate the adoption of business solutions that boost productivity.</p>

Windows-based terminals can simplify IS functions.</p>
