<p>
Each application for MS-DOS and Windows needs its own configuration file; however, Windows NT centralizes program initialization variables and settings parameters in the Registry (a special-purpose operating system database). Again, even Windows NT 4.0 and 3.x have multiuser capabilities, since part of the Registry is user-specific and is referred to as a “user profile.”</p>
<p class=indent>
User profiles can specify machine settings.</p>
<p>
By using user profiles, an administrator can control each user’s desktop, environment, and access permissions whenever a user logs on to the domain from any workstation, whether virtual or real. To create a profile for a particular user, the system administrator must log on as the user or create a “default” user account. For example, if I want to change the wallpaper to circles for some but not all of my users, I create an account named “default” and log on as <i>default</i>. Then I change my wallpaper to circles and save the current environment as a profile named “circles.usr” or “circles.man.” After logging off, I log back on as the administrator and assign the appropriate users the profile “circles.man” or I copy “circles.usr” to a profile named “<i>username.usr</i>” (since a per-sonal profile should be unique to each user).</p>
<p>
The ability to create profiles is a huge improvement over the Windows 3.x and Windows for Workgroups days, but it has a major drawback: the profiles don’t allow the administrator to capture environment settings without being logged on to the environment. For example, if I want to change user <i>Jane’s </i>environment so that she has no wallpaper, there is no “switch” in the User Profile Editor to allow this. Likewise, I can’t remove icons from her desktop without either logging on as Jane or logging on as my default profile and changing my desktop (deleting the icons and so on) and then <i>resaving </i>the profile and assigning or copying it to <i>Jane’s </i>profile. The process is rather cumbersome.</p>
