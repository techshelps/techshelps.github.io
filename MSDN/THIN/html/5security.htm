Building a secure network operating system is not an easy task. Security features must be built into every component of the system; and like a chain, the network is only as secure as its weakest link. Security issues you need to consider when building a secure system environment include user account storage, user authentication, file system access, memory-management integrity, environment subsystems control, and the like. The main goal of network security is to protect all of these components from unauthorized access. Many hackers have a mission of gaining unauthorized access. I’m not sure whether they are bored, greedy, or just mean—or all three—but this is the way things are. You establish security by locking components to make unauthorized access difficult. Unfortunately, such a step can also cause authorized access to be difficult. The industry has to be vigilant about staying a step ahead of hackers. A well-planned and well- implemented computer security plan can help make authorized computer use easy and make unauthorized use, intentional or accidental damage, and theft of information difficult or impossible.
