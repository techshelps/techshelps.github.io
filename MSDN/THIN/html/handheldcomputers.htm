<p>
Handheld computers, wireless tablets, and Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs) comprise another category of device that can be con-nected to a thin-client/server infrastructure. Manufacturers such as Telxon; Wyse Technology, Inc.; and Psion have signed on to add the ICA protocol to their devices. Telxon will embed ICA into wireless “ruggedized” pen-based computers. For more information about Telxon, check their Web site at:</p>

Thin-client/server systems allow for small, mobile form factors.</p>

The Wyse WinTerm 2730 is a portable wireless terminal that works with a 2.4-GHz RF/LAN interface and a stylus. It has an 8.5-inch dual-scan color screen and is based on technology licensed from Cruise Technologies. It can be used in any number of settings for collecting and analyzing data—in schools, factories, and so on. In Chapter 8, you’ll learn how this device is being used in a medical practice to access and update patient records.</p>

Psion has added the ICA thin-client/software to its EPOC32 operating system used with the Psion 5 handheld computer. This device includes a keyboard and a number of built-in applications. With access to a thin-client/server infrastructure, users of this handheld computer can check their e-mail, browse the Web, or access databases while out of the office. Visit Psion’s Web site at www.psion.com.</p>

You can even access Windows applications using ICA built into the Psion 5 handheld computer.</p>
<p>
Handheld computers and PDAs can be used in a wide variety of applications where the user is typically on the go. Imagine Telxon wireless computers being used in restaurants. A waitperson could easily check what’s available and what’s not, what’s on special, and maybe even use the device to page security or medical personnel for an emergency. Or imagine the Psion device in the hands of a salesperson on the road. The salesperson could easily keep in touch with her central office, adding contact information and notes to a remote database.</p>
<p>
Portable devices in combination with a thin-client/server solution can provide powerful opportunities for enhancing your business.</p>
