<p>
I’ve covered a number of issues in this chapter—issues that will affect implementation and integration of a thin-client/server solution within your existing computing infrastructure and issues you need to be familiar with if you’re building a new computing infrastructure that utilizes thin-client/server technology. These issues include application licensing, application configuring and publishing, network integration, security, and accessing thin-client/server sessions.</p>
<p>
As you build your solutions around the application needs of your users, make sure that you’re aware of all licensing issues concerning the software that you intend to use. Look at the licensing agreements and note if they allow for concurrency; find out whether you need to purchase a license for each user or for each workstation. Be sure you check out the upgrade policies so that you make purchases that will save you money later on as well as keep your users on the most current software versions if you need them.</p>
<p>
Also, as you plan to deploy applications, determine how you want the users to see those applications. You have a choice of adding icons to the desktop for specific applications, allowing the user to see a full Windows desktop, or running applications from a Web page. If your users are doing task-specific jobs, you’ll publish only the applications you want them to see for the user profile they present.</p>
<p>
How about security? Well, you have many tools to help you with not only security through application publishing and Windows NT profiles and permissions but also tools that can lock down certain files and directories.</p>
<p>
The thin-client/server solution using WinFrame provides the IS professional with a large number of tools for deploying applications, securing data and applications, and achieving integration within an existing computing infrastructure.</p>
