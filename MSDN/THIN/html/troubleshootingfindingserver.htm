<p>
One issue that comes up when configuring clients is that the client can’t always find the server. In some instances, as when the client and the server are on different segments of the same network, the client is not always able to see the server by its name. When you’re in the Setup wizard for a session and you choose the server field, the client goes out over the network to look for available servers. The list you get is just what the client can see.</p>
<p>
You can remedy this situation in two ways. The first is to put the physical or IP address of the server into the server field. This is the preferred way if you are connecting over the Internet or if you connect to servers on many different subnets. If you always connect to the same segment, you can permanently enter the IP or IPX address into an address list in the client.</p>
<p class=indent>
You can find a WinFrame server by using an IP address instead of a server name.</p>
