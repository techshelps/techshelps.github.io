<h1><a name="thefutureofthinclientservercomputing"></a>The Future of Thin-Client/Server Computing</h1>
<p>
In the near future, thin-client/server computing will impact all kinds of organizations, with sophisticated computing solutions that were previously out of reach. These computing solutions will be quick to deploy because of the removal of human resource and hardware barriers in existing computing environments.</p>
<p>
With the availability of thin-client/server solutions, organizations will be better able to match the most appropriate computing resources with their employees’ job requirements. Thin-client/server software and hardware solutions allow for the strategic placement of computing resources. Full desktop systems can be deployed only where and when required, instead of everywhere at great cost. Thin-client/server hardware solutions, using Windows-based terminals, for example, can be allocated for specific task-based work. Full desktop workstations can be allocated for power users, who need powerful local processing for performing tasks such as CAD/CAM drawing, high-end graphics design, video production, or multimedia creation. Even for knowledge engineers with powerful local workstations, the thin-client/server solutions can be used to access mission-critical applications, such as e-mail or company-specific databases that are centrally managed by IS. In addition, the same mission-critical applications would be available for people working remotely. The net result would be optimization of funds, computing infrastructure, and human resources for the deployment, management, support, and training of the organization’s system and resources.</p>
<p class=indent>
Thin-client/server computing will allow deployment of hardware as needed.</p>
<p>
As more organizations benefit from thin-client/server solutions, other organizations will want to use these solutions. And as more organizations see solutions that yield better returns on their hardware and software investments, more software publishers and hardware companies will grow and invest in improvements.</p>
<p class=indent>
Thin-client/server computing will result in significant returns on investment.</p>
