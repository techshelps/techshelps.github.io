<p>
The growth of a system software vendor truly depends on the existence of great solutions for its chosen computing platform. In other venues, “killer applications” have helped bring computing devices to prominence—as was the case with Lotus 1-2-3 and the IBM PC. The thin-client/server technology using Citrix WinFrame is an enabling technology that is paving the way for existing solutions to be used in scenarios and venues that were not previously possible.</p>
<p>
To promote the thin-client/server computing model, Citrix Systems created the Citrix Business Alliance program. Members of the Citrix Business Alliance provide the technological building blocks for solutions that include high performance servers, flexible communications infrastructure, robust client/server development tools, and turnkey corporate applications. The program is for industry vendors that want to work with Citrix to develop innovative new markets for remote computing and Internet and intranet computing. Citrix Systems is committed to providing world class, cutting-edge solutions for enterprise customers.</p>
