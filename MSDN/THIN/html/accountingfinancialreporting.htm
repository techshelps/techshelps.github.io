<p>
Thin-client/server computing works extremely well for accounting and financial reporting functions within a company. Accounting and financial reporting systems require information from all areas of the company. Managers analyze this information and take action based on it. The smoother the data collection systems run, the quicker information can be consolidated, reports can be created, and the results can be distributed for management action. Although accounting is the common denominator for the companies in the case studies in this section, some of the companies also deploy applications not strictly related to accounting. For example, Lasalle Partners, the subject of the first case study, also deploys real estate management software.</p>
