<p>
With client/server applications, you can request exactly what you want. With file-server applications, you have a much lower degree of granularity; for example, even if you only select one record from one table in a file-server database, Microsoft Jet must read at least a 2K page. Also, by isolating all database files under the control of one database server and one physical machine, the server can provide advanced features that can’t be furnished by a file-server architecture. For example:
<ul>
<li>
<b>Online backup   </b>Use an automatic scheduler to back up your database without having to exclude users from the database.<br><br></li>
<li>
<b>Durable transactions   </b>Updates made within a transaction can always be recovered or rolled back if either the client or the server computers fail.<br><br></li>
<li>
<b>Better reliability and data protection   </b>If either a workstation or file server fails while a Microsoft Jet database (.mdb) file is being written to, the database may be damaged. You can usually recover a damaged database using the <b>Repair</b> method, but you must have all users close the database before doing so. This rarely happens with a server database such as Microsoft SQL Server.<br><br></li>
<li>
<b>Advanced hardware support   </b>Uninterruptable power supplies, hot swappable disk drives, and multiple processors can all be added to the server with no changes to the client workstations.</li>
</ul>
