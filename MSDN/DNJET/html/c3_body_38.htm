<p>
So far, only <b>Relation</b> objects created between two permanent tables that exist in the same database have been discussed. With Microsoft Jet, you can create relationships between tables and <b>QueryDef</b> objects, or between tables in a local database and tables in external databases.</p>
<p>
It’s not possible to create a cascading update or cascading delete relationship between a table and a <b>QueryDef</b> object. Nor is it possible to enforce referential integrity between a table and a query. Enforced referential integrity is valid only for relationships between tables. Creating a relationship between a table and a query has no effect on the structure of your database.</p>
<p>
The primary benefit of creating a relationship between a table and a query or between a local table and a linked table is for documentation purposes and for interactive use with a product such as Microsoft Access. Microsoft Access can make certain assumptions about the relationships between your tables if you have defined these non-enforceable relationships. For example, if you create a relationship between a table and a query, and then add that table and query to a new query in query Design view, Microsoft Access automatically draws in the join line between the table and the query.</p>
