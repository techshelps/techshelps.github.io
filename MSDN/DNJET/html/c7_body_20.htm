<p>
The first step in making your database replicable is to create a Design Master. You can create a Design Master by using any of the methods discussed in the “Implementing Database Replication” section earlier in this chapter.</p>
<p>
After you have created the Design Master, identify the objects in the database you don’t want replicated. In Microsoft Access, you can keep an object from being replicated by clearing the <b>Make Replicable</b> check box in the <b>Save As</b> dialog box when you save an object in the Design Master. You can also convert a local object to a replicable object by right-clicking the object in the Database window, clicking <b>Properties</b> on the shortcut menu, and then selecting the <b>Replicable</b> check box. All objects saved in a replica (not the Design Master) will automatically be local, nonreplicable objects.</p>
<p>
To create local objects programmatically, set their <b>KeepLocal</b> property to the string value <b>“T”</b> (the quotation marks are part of the string). You can only set the <b>KeepLocal</b> property of database objects before you create the Design Master. The <b>KeepLocal</b> property is read-write in nonreplicated databases and read-only in replicated databases. To create a local object in a database that has already been replicated, set the object’s <b>ReplicableBool</b> property to <b>False</b>. To make your database replicable, set its <b>ReplicableBool</b> property to <b>True</b>. For more information about making additional replicas of your database, see the “Making Additional Replicas” section later in this chapter.</p>
<p>
<b>Important   </b>The Microsoft Jet database engine does not allow you to protect a replicable database with a database password. Before you begin using replication, remove any database password protection from the database you will be making replicable. Permissions defined for user-level security do not interfere with replica synchronization. For more information about how to remove a database password and how to define user-level security, see Chapter&nbsp;10, “<a href="c10_body.htm">Managing Security</a>.”</p>
