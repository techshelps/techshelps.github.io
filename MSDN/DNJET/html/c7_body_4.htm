<p>
Windows&nbsp;95 or Windows&nbsp;NT Server or Workstation version&nbsp;4.0 Briefcase replication is perhaps the easiest way to implement replication. To use Briefcase replication, drag a Microsoft Access database file from a shared network folder to the My Briefcase icon on your laptop’s desktop. You can disconnect the laptop from the network and make changes to the data in the replica. When you are finished working on the files on the laptop computer, reconnect to the network, double-click the My Briefcase icon, and then click <b>Update All</b> on the <b>Briefcase</b> menu to automatically synchronize any changes between the database on your laptop and the Design Master on the network.</p>
<p>
When Briefcase replication is installed (through the Custom installation option in the Microsoft Access Setup program), it registers with the Windows&nbsp;95 or Windows&nbsp;NT Server or Workstation&nbsp;4.0 Briefcase a special class ID (CLSID) for Microsoft Jet&nbsp;3.5 .mdb files. When a file with the .mdb extension is dragged into Briefcase, the replication code converts the database into a replica. Before the conversion takes place, however, you are prompted to make a backup copy of the original database file. The backup copy has the same file name as the original, except that it has a .bak file extension. The copy is kept in the same folder as the original database file.</p>
<p>
The replication code then converts the database into a replicable form, leaves the Design Master at the source, and places a replica in the Briefcase. You also have the option of putting the Design Master in your Briefcase and leaving a replica on the desktop.</p>
<p>
You can take your replica with you into the field and then synchronize the changes made to your replica with the Design Master on the desktop or network. When you click <b>Update All</b> or <b>Update Selection</b> on the <b>Briefcase</b> menu, replication code merges the changes to the two members of the replica set. Unlike Microsoft Replication Manager, Briefcase replication does not have the ability to set a schedule for synchronizing other members of the replica set. Synchronization occurs only at the time the <b>Update</b> command is clicked and only between the current member and the specified member.</p>
<p>
There are some limitations to using the Briefcase for replicating your databases. Briefcase replication works only under Windows&nbsp;95 and Windows&nbsp;NT Server or Workstation&nbsp;4.0 and only if the <b>Briefcase Reconciler</b> option was selected when the Microsoft Access Setup program was run. There is no programmatic access available to the Briefcase itself, the Briefcase can’t distinguish between databases of different versions, and partial replicas can’t be created or synchronized by using the Briefcase. Finally, there is no way to schedule automatic synchronization among replicas by using the Briefcase.</p>
<p>
<b>Note   </b>If some users of your database need to continue using it in its nonreplicated form, make a copy of your database before converting it to a replicable database.</p>
