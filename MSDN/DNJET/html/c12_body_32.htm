<p>
The Desktop Database Drivers support updatable joins, meaning that updates made to the table created by the join are reflected in the base table and updates made to the base table are also reflected in the table created by the join. However, if you open a cursor on a query that is based on a one-to-many relationship, you may not be able to update its underlying tables by calling <b>SQLSetPos</b>. The following types of fields may not be modifiable:
<ul>
<li>
New records, if the “many” side’s join field does not appear in the SELECT list. To add new records, add the join field from the “many” side to your query.<br><br></li>
<li>
The join field from the “many” side, after data on the “one” side has been updated. Once you save the record, you can make changes to the “many” side’s join field.<br><br></li>
<li>
A blank field in the many-only table of an OUTER JOIN if the joined “one” side is also empty.<br><br></li>
<li>
A blank field on the “one” side of an OUTER JOIN. This can be done only on the many-only table.<br><br></li>
<li>
New records, if the entire unique key of an attached ODBC table is not output. To allow insertions, select all primary key fields of the tables.</li>
</ul>
