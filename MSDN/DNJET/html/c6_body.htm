<p>
Microsoft Jet supports the network environment with a variety of services designed to make your life as a developer easier. Microsoft Jet 3.5 boasts improved multiuser performance and increased <i>concurrency</i> (the simultaneous availability of the same sets of data and objects to multiple users).</p>
<p>
To implement multiuser applications that run smoothly using Microsoft Jet, you should be familiar with the engine’s multiuser model. Moving an existing single-user application to a multiuser environment is not always a simple port, and you should plan ahead and address the issues discussed in this chapter. A multiuser application should be designed as such from the ground up, with the database engine’s functionality in mind. This chapter guides you through these issues and shows you how to effectively use Microsoft Jet to manage resources and minimize <i>contention</i> for data and objects. (Contention occurs when two or more users are attempting to modify the same data or object.)</p>

<h5>Using the Code Examples in This Chapter</h5>
<p>
You can use the code examples in this chapter to help you understand the concepts discussed, or you can modify them and use them in your own applications.</p>
<p>
The code examples are located in the JetBook\Samples subfolder on the companion CD-ROM. The code examples for Microsoft Access&nbsp;97 are in JetSamples.mdb, and the corresponding code examples for Microsoft Visual Basic version 5.0 and other applications that support Visual Basic for Applications are referenced in JetSamples.vbp. Both JetSamples.mdb and JetSamples.vbp use tables and queries in NorthwindTables.mdb, also located in the JetBook\Samples subfolder.</p>
<p>
To use the code examples, copy the sample files to your hard disk. Be sure to copy NorthwindTables.mdb as well so that you can use the code examples to work with data.</p>
<p>
