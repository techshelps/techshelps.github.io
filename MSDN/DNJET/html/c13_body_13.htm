<p>
If Microsoft Jet tries to place a lock on a page in a shared database and a message that locking has failed is returned, the LockDelay setting determines how long it waits before it retries. If the time it takes to return the message exceeds the LockDelay setting, there is no delay. The default setting is 100 milliseconds. On systems that don’t manage lock retries themselves, such as Windows&nbsp;95 peer-to-peer networking, the LockDelay setting prevents Microsoft Jet from performing repeated retries over a short period of time. If you are using such a system, the default setting is usually sufficient to reduce the number of lock requests sent across the network, which frees up network bandwidth for other purposes. If your application or its users frequently lock a large number of records, you may want to try increasing this setting to further reduce the number of lock requests being sent across the network. If you are using a server-based networking system that manages lock retries itself, such as Windows&nbsp;NT Server or Novell NetWare, there is no need to change this setting.</p>
