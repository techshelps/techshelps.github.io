As we completed work on Microsoft Jet version&nbsp;3.5 we, the Microsoft Jet Database Engine Team, knew that “the Jet book” deserved, nay needed, to be updated. Comprehensive information needed to be made available to developers about new features, improvements, and the latest technologies.</p>
<p>
Many of those who contributed so much to writing the first edition of “the Jet book” had moved on to other challenges at Microsoft (or had retired), thus the experience in producing the book went with them. Though there was no lack of expertise on the current Microsoft Jet, Data Access Objects (DAO), and Microsoft Access teams, the members of these teams were busy wrapping up Microsoft Access&nbsp;97 and Microsoft Jet&nbsp;3.5, and they were already at work on the next versions. Bandwidth was at a premium. Nonetheless, everyone pitched in and <i>made</i> the time to publish this, the second edition of the <i>Microsoft Jet Database Engine Programmer’s Guide</i>. For this effort and dedication we want to extend our heartfelt thanks and appreciation.</p>
<p>
First, we want to thank the Office, Microsoft Access, C++, and Database&nbsp;&amp; Transaction Processing (DTP) user education teams for providing the writers, editors, production support, and project leadership necessary for completing this project. These were the folks who worked day to day on this project and made sure that everything that needed to be done was done. Our thanks to: David Shank and Mark Roberts who shouldered the lion’s share of the writing, with strong support from Robert Flake and Jim van de Erve; to Amy Blair and Dana Schmeller who edited everyone’s contributions, ensuring that what was written was consistent and accurate; to Emily Hylton, Kristine Haugseth, Maggie Sparkman, Debra Harrigan, Donna Johnston, and Jeff Gilbert who assisted Amy and Dana; to Bart McKeirnan and Kristin Lynn Bergsma for production support and art; to Robin Lyle for telling everyone when they needed to be done (scheduling) and making sure that nothing fell in between the cracks; to Tamra Myers for all of the code samples and sample databases, and for testing it all; to Sam Dawson for the index (just try to find something without it); to John Gronquist and Gregory Frederick for their help in CD-ROM production and testing, and all-around technical support; and to Byron Krystad for advice and moral support. Thanks to Beth Carter for helping to get the project rolling early on. And an extra and special thanks to Dana for taking on the role of project lead.</p>
<p>
And of course there was honorary user education team member Alyssa Henry who, in addition to her day job as an ActiveX™ Data Objects (ADO) program manager, rewrote Chapter&nbsp;11, “Programming with DAO in C++ and Java™.” Thank you, Alyssa.</p>
<p>
We also want to thank Casey Doyle and Maureen Zimmerman of Microsoft Press&reg;. Casey and Maureen guided us through the challenges of getting the book published and helped us sort out complicated contractual and production issues.</p>
<p>
And thanks to the original authors of the <i>Microsoft Jet Database Engine Programmer’s Guide</i>, Dan Haught, Jim Ferguson, Peter Bateman, Mark Bukovec, Joel Gilman, Jim Gordon, and Jim van de Erve for giving us a solid base to build upon.</p>
<p>
There were also a large number of reviewers who provided the technical expertise that the writers assimilated and cast on to the pages of the book. Without the contributions of these folks who shared their accumulated knowledge, this book would have been nearly impossible to write. They include: Mark Buettemeier, Richard Dickinson, Gregory Ellison, Frank Ai-Jun Fei, Michael Kaplan, Emily Kruglick, Ryan LaBrie, Jim Lewallen, Gretchen Loihle, Jim Lucey, Michael Mee, Kevin Mineweaser, Rick Nasci, Tad Orman, Mark Prentice, Cameron Price, Elena Sellers, Monte Slichter, James Sturms, Tanka Sunuwar, Rudy Torrico, Peter Tucker, Susan Vinson, Don Willits, and Charmain Wilson. Thank you very much for your contributions and your help.</p>
<p>
We must single out and thank Joel Gilman not only for his contributions as an original author and a reviewer, but especially for his laugh which was (and is) like cool water in a parched and dusty land.</p>
<p>
And last, but certainly not least, there are those who, though no longer a part of the Microsoft Jet team, nonetheless deserve acknowledgement for the parts they have played in making Microsoft Jet&nbsp;3.5 a success, and for their continued friendship: Matthew Bellew, Eric Christensen, Dennis Comfort, Theresa Daly, Nigel Ellis, Phillip Garding, Brad Hammond, Kimberly Harms, Steve Hecht, Charumathy Narayanan, Matt Senft, and Gordon Smith.</p>
<p>
Sincerely,</p>
<p>
The Microsoft Jet Database Engine Team (version&nbsp;3.5)</p>
