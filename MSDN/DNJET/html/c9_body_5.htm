<p>
When your client program is working with a server, one of the main bottlenecks is usually the network traffic that gets generated between your client application and the server application. A <i>round trip</i> is a conversation with the server in which Microsoft Jet asks the server for something and receives an answer. A well-written client/server application tries to minimize round trips. Indeed, Microsoft Jet itself does a lot to minimize round trips by caching results locally to avoid requesting the same information from the server multiple times. You can help Microsoft Jet minimize round trips by structuring your application in certain ways that are discussed throughout this chapter.</p>
