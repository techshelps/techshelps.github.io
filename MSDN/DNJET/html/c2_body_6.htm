<p>
The <b>Databases</b> collection contains all <b>Database</b> objects currently open within a <b>Workspace</b> object. In DAO, a <b>Database</b> object represents a currently open database. This can be a native Microsoft Jet database or an external database. You can have multiple databases open at one time, even databases of different types.</p>
<p>
In Visual Basic, after you open a database and return a reference to it by using the <b>OpenDatabase</b> method, you can refer to the database according to its position in the <b>Databases</b> collection. If you open only one database, then you can refer to that database in any of the following ways:</p>
<pre><FONT FACE="Courier New" SIZE="3">DBEngine.Workspaces(0).Databases(0)
DBEngine.Workspaces(0)(0)
DBEngine(0)(0)</font></pre>
<p>
If you’re working in Microsoft Access&nbsp;97, you can use either the <b>CurrentDb</b> function or the <b>DBEngine(0)(0)</b> syntax to return a reference to the database that is currently open in the Microsoft Access user interface. The <b>CurrentDb</b> function differs from the <b>DBEngine(0)(0)</b> syntax in that it creates another instance of the current database and returns a reference to that instance, and it refreshes all the collections in the current database. On the other hand, the <b>DBEngine(0)(0)</b> syntax doesn’t refresh any collections, so it may perform faster.</p>
<p>
If you switch from using the <b>CurrentDb</b> function to the <b>DBEngine(0)(0)</b> syntax, make sure that your code doesn’t depend on any collections being refreshed. If it does, you can refresh these individual collections separately.</p>
<p>
<b>Note   </b>If you specify a value for the <i>connect</i> argument of the <b>OpenDatabase</b> method, you must also specify a value for the preceding <i>read-only</i> argument.</p>
<p>

<p>
<b>Microsoft Access and Visual Basic Users   </b>In Microsoft Access versions 1.<i>x</i> and 2.0, several databases are automatically opened when you open your database through the Microsoft Access user interface. These include the various library databases that Microsoft Access uses to perform its own functions. The other databases that Microsoft Access opens are used internally by Microsoft Access and are not part of the <b>Databases</b> collection. In Microsoft Access&nbsp;97, library databases are identified by references to specific type libraries, but are not actually loaded until needed.</p>
<p>
Microsoft Access also creates a default <b>Workspace</b> object when you open a database. The user account that’s currently logged on to the database is the account used to create the default workspace.</p>
<p>
In Visual Basic, no databases are open in a workspace until you explicitly open them by using the <b>OpenDatabase</b> method&nbsp;— unless you use the <b>Data</b> control, which automatically opens the appropriate database for you when the form containing the <b>Data</b> control is loaded.</p>
