<p>
When you create a Design Master, any AutoNumber fields with a <b>NewValues</b> property set to Increment are changed to Random; however, the AutoNumber field’s <b>FieldSize</b> property isn’t changed. All existing AutoNumber fields in existing records retain their values, but new values for inserted records are random numbers with values between &nbsp;–&nbsp;2,000,000,000 and +2,000,000,000. Random AutoNumber fields are not meaningful because they aren’t in any particular order and the highest value doesn’t belong to the record inserted last. When you open a table with a random AutoNumber key, the records appear in the order of ascending random numbers, not in chronological order. With random AutoNumber fields it is possible&nbsp;— although highly unlikely&nbsp;— for records inserted in different replicas to be assigned the same value. If this happens, a unique key error would occur that would require user intervention to resolve. If you experience such problems, consider setting the AutoNumber field’s <b>FieldSize</b> property value to Replication ID or consider using the s_GUID field as the primary key. Because all numbers in the s_GUID field are unique, each record has a different ID.</p>
<p>
Before you convert your nonreplicable database into a replicated database, determine if any of your applications or users rely on the order and incremental nature of the AutoNumber field. If so, you can use an additional Date/Time field to provide sequential ordering information.</p>
<p>
If your database contains tables that don’t need to be made replicable, set the <b>KeepLocal</b> property to <b>True</b> for those tables. This will prevent the tables from ever being made replicable, and the AutoNumber fields in those tables will not be affected.</p>
