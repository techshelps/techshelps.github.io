<p>
As its name implies, a <b>QueryDef</b> object is the definition of a query, either saved permanently in a Microsoft Jet database, or created as a temporary object. A <b>QueryDef</b> object doesn’t contain any data or perform an action; it’s merely the set of instructions Microsoft Jet uses to select information or perform an action, such as the deletion or insertion of records in a database table.</p>
<p>
Not everything that can be stored in a <b>QueryDef</b> object is what is usually thought of as a “query.” In addition to SQL SELECT statements, which select, join, and order information from one or more tables, a <b>QueryDef</b> object can contain an SQL DELETE, INSERT, or CREATE TABLE statement.</p>
<p>
Some <b>QueryDef</b> objects return their results in the form of a set of records. These objects perform similarly to what are known as views in other relational database systems. You can create an SQL statement and save it as a permanent <b>QueryDef</b> object in a database, and then use that <b>QueryDef</b> object as if it were a table. You can update it or join it to another table or <b>QueryDef</b> object.</p>
<p>
Other <b>QueryDef</b> objects can perform an action, such as running an SQL DELETE statement, or modify the database structure, such as the CREATE TABLE statements used throughout this chapter. A special form of the <b>QueryDef</b> object, known as a <i>pass-through</i> query, is used to communicate directly with an ODBC database such as SQL&nbsp;Server or Oracle. The contents of a pass-through <b>QueryDef</b> object are not evaluated by Microsoft Jet, but are passed through to the ODBC database, which then interprets the text contained in the <b>SQL</b> property of the <b>QueryDef</b> object.</p>
<p>
<b>See Also   </b>For a full discussion of how to use the various forms of <b>QueryDef</b> objects and how to optimize their performance, see Chapter&nbsp;4, “<a href="c4_body.htm">Queries</a>.” For more information about creating and using pass-through queries, see Chapter&nbsp;9, “<a href="c9_body.htm">Developing Client/Server Applications</a>.”</p>
<p>
This section covers how to create and manipulate <b>QueryDef</b> objects in a database.</p>
<p>
Note that a <b>QueryDef</b> object can be created only in a native Microsoft Jet database. A <b>QueryDef</b> object can’t be stored in a FoxPro or SQL&nbsp;Server database, for example.</p>
<p>
There is no SQL DDL statement that can be used to create permanent <b>QueryDef</b> objects. All <b>QueryDef</b> objects must be created either interactively, through a product such as Microsoft Access, or programmatically by using DAO.</p>
