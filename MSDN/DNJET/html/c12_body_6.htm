ODBC Desktop Database Drivers 3.5 was released in October 1996. These drivers were double-byte character set (DBCS)-enabled, were better suited for use with Internet applications than previous versions, and accommodated the use of File data source names (DSNs). The Microsoft Access driver was released in a RISC version for use on Alpha platforms.</p>
<p>
<b>Note   </b>The version&nbsp;3.5 drivers were designed to work with ODBC&nbsp;2.<i>x</i>. Although they also work with ODBC&nbsp;3.0, they do not support all ODBC&nbsp;3.0 features. For more information about how these drivers work with ODBC&nbsp;3.0, see “Backward Compatibility and Standards Compliance” in Chapter&nbsp;17, “Programming Considerations,” in the <i>Microsoft ODBC&nbsp;3.0 Software Development Kit and Programmer’s Reference</i>.</p>
