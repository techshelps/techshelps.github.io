<p>
You can limit the number of records you select from a database by using a WHERE clause in your query. If the user is supplying the criteria for the WHERE clause, you can use a SELECT COUNT(*) statement with that WHERE clause to find out how many records will be returned, and then decide if you want prompt your user to limit the criteria they are using.</p>
<p>
For example, the starting version of the BookSales sample application (JetBook<BR>\Samples\BookSales\BookSales.vbp) loads books into the Books list box (on the BookList form) by returning all of the books, and then walking through the recordset using the <b>FindFirst</b> and <b>FindNext</b> methods to find the records that belong in the list box. Changing this to a WHERE clause as shown in the BookSalesOptimized sample application (JetBook\Samples\BookSalesOptimized\BookSalesOptimized.vbp) makes this 4.5&nbsp;times faster, even on this small set of 100 records.</p>
<p>
A sample SELECT statement with a WHERE clause looks like this:</p>
<pre><FONT FACE="Courier New" SIZE="3">SELECT au_id, au_lname, au_fname FROM authors WHERE state = 'CA' ORDER BY au_lname</font></pre>
<p>
This is a good way to structure the query if your application needs all three fields that are returned. It also illustrates the concept of limiting the number of returned records by specifying a WHERE clause. Note that the statement also orders the data before returning it by using an ORDER BY clause. Although Microsoft Jet does provide the ability to sort a recordset, for efficiency reasons, it’s always better to let the server do the sort.</p>
