<p>
Database replicas use the same security model as all Microsoft Jet databases: Users’ permissions on database objects are determined at the time they start Microsoft Jet and log on. As a developer, it’s up to you to make sure the same security information is available at each location where a replica is used.</p>
<p>
You can do this by making the identical workgroup information file available to users at each location where a replica is used. Although the workgroup information file cannot be replicated, it can be manually copied to each location.</p>
<p>
Another way to make the same workgroup information file available to all your users is to re-create the entries for users and groups at each location in the local workgroup information file by entering the same user and group names with their associated PIDs at each location. Modifications to permissions are considered design changes and can be made only in the Design Master replica.</p>
<p>
Some security permissions control certain aspects of database replication. For example, a user must have Administer permission on the database to:
<ul>
<li>
Convert a database into a replicable database.<br><br></li>
<li>
Change the setting of the <b>ReplicableBool</b> property, make a local object replicable, or make a replicable object local. You can perform these actions only in the Design Master replica.<br><br></li>
<li>
Transfer Design Master status to another replica You can perform this action in any replica in the set; however, you should never have more than one Design Master replica in a set at a time.</li>
</ul>
<p>
By default, Administer permission is granted to the Users group, the Admins group, and the creator of the database. If security is to be maintained, you must restrict this permission to selected users.</p>
