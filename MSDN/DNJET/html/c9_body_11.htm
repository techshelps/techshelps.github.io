<p>
Now that you’re familiar with some of the basic concepts involved in client/server design, you probably want to see how you can use Microsoft Jet to implement your application. This section provides additional details on how the engine works in client/server architectures.</p>
<p>
Some of the code examples in this section are from the BookSales and BookSalesOptimized sample applications, which are provided on the companion CD-ROM. The BookSales application performs a set of functions on a database, and the BookSalesOptimized application performs the same functions in a more efficient manner. For information about using these sample applications, see “Using the Code Examples in This Chapter” earlier in this chapter.</p>
<p>
<b>Note   </b>Although most of the techniques discussed in this section apply only to using Microsoft Jet <b>Workspace</b> objects, some also apply to using ODBCDirect <b>Workspace</b> objects. For information on using ODBCDirect <b>Workspace</b> objects, see “The ODBCDirect Workspace Object Model” later in this chapter.</p>
