<p>
Microsoft Jet adds new properties to your database when it becomes replicable: <b>ReplicableBool</b>, <b>Replicable</b>, <b>ReplicaID</b>, and <b>DesignMasterID</b>. The <b>ReplicableBool</b> property replaces the <b>Replicable</b> property used in prior versions of Microsoft Jet. The <b>Replicable</b> property is still available but is used only to maintain backward compatibility and should not be used. The <b>ReplicableBool</b> property is set to <b>True</b>, indicating the database is now replicable. After the property is set to <b>True</b>, however, it cannot be changed. Setting the property to <b>False</b> returns an error. The <b>ReplicaID</b> property is a 16-byte value that uniquely identifies the Design Master or replica.</p>
<p>
The <b>DesignMasterID</b> property can be used to make a replica the new Design Master for the replica set. This property is set for the Design Master when the database is initially made replicable. Under extreme circumstances&nbsp;— for example, the loss of the original Design Master&nbsp;— you can set the property for the current replica. However, setting this property for a replica, when there is already another Design Master, might partition your replica set into two irreconcilable sets and prevent any further synchronization of data. If you determine that it is necessary to set this property for a replica, first synchronize the replica with all other replicas in the set.</p>
<p>
<b>Caution   </b>Never create a second Design Master in a replica set. The existence of a second Design Master can result in the loss of data.</p>
<p>
There are two new properties that you can append and set on the individual tables, queries, forms, reports, macros, and modules in your database: <b>KeepLocal</b> and <b>ReplicableBool</b>. To prevent an object from being copied to other replicas in a replica set, you can set the <b>KeepLocal</b> property of the object to <b>“T”</b> prior to converting the database into a replicable form. After the database is converted, you can set the <b>ReplicableBool</b> property to <b>True</b> to make a local object replicable. For more information about these two properties, see the “Replicating Your Database” section earlier in this chapter.</p>
<p>
Microsoft Jet also adds the <b>ColGeneration</b> property to Memo (Long Text) and OLE Object (Long Binary) fields to identify the name of the field used to track generations for these fields.</p>
