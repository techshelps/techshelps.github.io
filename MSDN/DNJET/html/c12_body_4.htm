ODBC Desktop Database Drivers 2.0 was released in December 1994. These drivers were released for use with ODBC 2.0, which significantly expanded their ODBC functionality. The major change in version&nbsp;2.0 was that the Microsoft Jet database engine replaced the SIMBA query processor. There were many advantages to this:
<ul>
<li>
With the Microsoft Jet database engine, the Desktop Database Drivers integrated much more tightly with the Microsoft Jet installable ISAM drivers and Microsoft Access technology.<br><br></li>
<li>
The Microsoft Jet cursor model offered significant improvements over the SIMBA model, which used the ODBC Cursor Library to provide scrollable cursors. Microsoft Jet provided native support for scrollable cursors.<br><br></li>
<li>
Microsoft Jet provided native support for outer joins, updatable and heterogeneous joins, and transactions.<br><br></li>
<li>
The Microsoft Jet query optimizer, with enhancements such as Rushmore technology, dramatically increased driver performance.<br><br></li>
<li>
Microsoft Jet provided 32-bit versions of the drivers for Microsoft Windows&nbsp;NT.</li>
</ul>
