Several wizards are included on the companion CD-ROM. Two wizards for linking and importing data from Microsoft Exchange and Microsoft Outlook are included in the ExchWizard folder. To install these wizards, along with the Microsoft Exchange ISAM driver, run the Wzmapi80.exe file in the folder.</p>
<p>
Two wizards for use with replication are also included. The Partial Replica Wizard, which makes it easy to create partial replicas, is located in the PrtlReplWiz folder. The Replica to Regular Database Wizard, located in the ReplWizard folder, makes it easy to convert a Design Master to its original, nonreplicated state.</p>
