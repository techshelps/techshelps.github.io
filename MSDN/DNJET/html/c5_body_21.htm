<p>
You can delete an existing record in a table- or dynaset-type <b>Recordset</b> object by using the <b>Delete</b> method. You can’t delete records from a snapshot- or forward-only-type <b>Recordset </b>object. The following example deletes all orders prior to 10-1-94 from the Orders table in the NorthwindTables database. In this example, <code>strDbPath</code> is the path to the database:</p>
<pre><FONT FACE="Courier New" SIZE="3">Dim dbs As Database, rst As Recordset
Dim strCriteria As String

Set dbs = OpenDatabase(strDbPath)
Set rst = dbs.OpenRecordset(&quot;Orders&quot;, dbOpenDynaset)
strCriteria = &quot;OrderDate &lt; #10-1-94#&quot;
With rst
&#09;.FindFirst strCriteria
&#09;Do While Not .NoMatch
&#09;&#09;.Delete
&#09;&#09;.FindNext strCriteria
&#09;Loop
&#09;.Close
End With</font></pre>
<p>
When you use the <b>Delete</b> method, Microsoft Jet immediately deletes the current record without any warning or prompting. Deleting a record doesn’t automatically cause the next record to become the current record; to move to the next record, you must use the <b>MoveNext</b> method. Keep in mind, however, that after you’ve moved off the deleted record, you cannot move back to it.</p>
<p>
If you try to access a record after deleting it from a table-type <b>Recordset </b>object, you’ll get error 3167, “Record is deleted.” On a dynaset you’ll get error 3021, “No current record.”</p>
<p>
If you have a <b>Recordset </b>object clone positioned at the deleted record and try to read its value, you’ll get error 3167 regardless of the type of <b>Recordset </b>object. Trying to use a bookmark to move to a deleted record will also result in error 3167.</p>
