<p>
An additional type of <b>Recordset</b> object, the dynamic-type <b>Recordset</b> object, is available in ODBCDirect workspaces. Dynamic-type <b>Recordset</b> objects behave like dynaset-type <b>Recordset</b> objects, but they are updated dynamically as other users make modifications to the underlying tables. To create a dynamic-type <b>Recordset</b> object, specify the <b>dbOpenDynamic</b> constant for the <i>type</i> argument of the <b>OpenRecordset</b> method.</p>
<p>
Dynamic-type <b>Recordset</b> objects are available only if you’re using an ODBC driver that supplies its own cursors. Because not all ODBC drivers supply their own cursors, you need to determine whether yours does before you try to open a dynamic-type <b>Recordset</b> object. If your ODBC driver doesn’t supply its own cursors, then you should open a snapshot-type or forward-only-type <b>Recordset</b> object instead.</p>
<p>
<b>See Also   </b>For more information on cursors, see “Using Cursors in ODBCDirect Workspaces” later in this chapter.</p>
<p>
The advantage of using a dynamic-type <b>Recordset</b> object is that the recordset will immediately reflect any changes to the data, including added or deleted records. For example, if you open a dynamic-type <b>Recordset</b> object and another user edits a record in one of the underlying tables, that change will be reflected in the <b>Recordset</b> object you opened. In order to do this, however, DAO must constantly requery the data source, which may slow performance considerably. Therefore, avoid using dynamic-type <b>Recordset</b> objects except in situations where it’s crucial to have the most up-to-date data at all times.</p>
