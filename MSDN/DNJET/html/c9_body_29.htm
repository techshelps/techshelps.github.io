<p>
If your program can’t be modified to eliminate the use of Find methods, then understanding exactly how they work will help you make the best use of them. The Find methods are fairly efficient when the search criteria is a match against fields that are indexed on the server.</p>
<p>
Microsoft Jet recognizes these cases and executes a query on the server that returns primary keys for all the records that match the search criteria. If matching records are found, it then moves through the keys it has stored for the dynaset-type <b>Recordset</b> object until it finds a match. If the local recordset is small, this is a relatively quick operation.</p>
<p>
One result of this strategy is that unsuccessful Find operations will be as fast as the server allows. This isn’t something you’ll be able to take advantage of in all scenarios, but it may be useful in some.</p>
