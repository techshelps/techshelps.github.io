<p>
Introduced in the fall of 1995, Microsoft Jet&nbsp;3.0 offered new features and improved performance in an exclusive 32-bit implementation for use with the Microsoft Windows&nbsp;95 and Microsoft Windows&nbsp;NT&reg; operating systems. This version saw changes to the database format and the way the engine handles data, with the goal of making most operations substantially faster. Microsoft Jet&nbsp;3.0 also introduced database replication services that developers could use to create database replicas that could be used in different locations. The Jet database engine performed all the services necessary to create and synchronize replicas to keep data current and to resolve problems associated with record conflicts. In addition, version&nbsp;3.0 further expanded the DAO object model by adding additional objects, collections, properties, and methods.</p>
