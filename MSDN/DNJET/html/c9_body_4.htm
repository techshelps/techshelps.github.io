<p>
ODBC servers deal with sets of records. These are almost always the result of a SELECT statement that has been sent to the server, either explicitly by your program, or by Microsoft Jet on your behalf. Once the server has returned these records to the client, it doesn’t typically perform operations on that set of records again. For example, operations like finding a particular record, or even scrolling backwards to a previous record, are not supported by most servers. Microsoft Jet will make those operations work for you; however, these operations do come with a price attached as you’ll see in the following sections.</p>
