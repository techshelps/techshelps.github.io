<p>
The optimizer uses two sets of statistics when determining a join strategy on the base tables and on non-base-table inputs such as other <b>QueryDef</b> objects.</p>
<p>
For base-table inputs, the optimizer looks at:
<ul>
<li>
The number of records in the base table. This tells the optimizer how large the tables are, which affects which join strategy is used.<br><br></li>
<li>
The number of data pages in the base table. The more data pages that need to be read from disk, the more costly the query is.<br><br></li>
<li>
The location of the table. Is the table in a local ISAM format or is it located in an ODBC database? Each distinct ODBC server is given a number. This helps the optimizer and remote post-processor do their work.<br><br></li>
<li>
The indexes on the table. When looking at indexes, the optimizer is concerned with:<ul>
<li>
Selectivity. If a particular index returns only three matching values out of 100,000, it’s considered highly selective. A unique index is the most highly selective index available, because every value is distinct. It’s always best to use highly selective indexes.<br><br></li>
<li>
Number of index pages. As with data pages, the more index pages that must be read from disk, the more costly the query is.<br><br></li>
<li>
Whether <b>Null</b> values are allowed in the index. <b>Null</b> values in an index may rule out the use of an index-merge join.<br><br></li>
<li>
Whether duplicates are allowed in the index. Duplicates in an index affect its selectivity.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
For non-base-table inputs, the optimizer looks at:
<ul>
<li>
Record counts. As with base tables, the number of records in the input query affects which join strategy is chosen.<br><br></li>
<li>
Input costs. Because the input is another query, the cost of executing that query must be factored into the total cost.<p>
<b>Note   </b>The record count and input costs are estimates.</p>
</li>
<li>
Location of inputs. Each distinct ODBC server is given a number. This helps the remote post-processor do its work.<br><br></li>
<li>
Record ordering. An ordered input may be a candidate for a lookup join.</li>
</ul>
