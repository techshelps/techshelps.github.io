<p>
One advantage that Microsoft Visual&nbsp;C++ and Visual Basic developers have over Microsoft Access developers is that when their program starts, the <b>DBEngine</b> object isn’t yet initialized. This allows the program to set important properties such as the <b>SystemDB</b> property (which sets or returns the path for the current location of the workgroup information file), and the <b>DefaultUser</b> and <b>DefaultPassword</b> properties (which set the user name and password to use for default logon). In Microsoft Access, however, the <b>DBEngine</b> object is already initialized when you start, and none of these properties can be changed. Even in Visual Basic, you may want to open a database that uses a different workgroup information file, without having to start a new application through Automation to do so.</p>
<p>
There is a new object called a <b>PrivDBEngine</b> object, which is a new, uninitialized copy of the top-level <b>DBEngine</b> object, with its own objects and collections beneath it. You can use the <b>PrivDBEngine</b> object to open a database that uses a different workgroup information file, to determine whether a database is opened exclusively, and to determine whether you can open a database exclusively.</p>
<p>
To create a private <b>DBEngine</b> object, declare an object variable as type <b>PrivDBEngine</b>, and then use the <b>Set</b> statement with the <b>New</b> keyword, as shown in the following code:</p>
<pre><FONT FACE="Courier New" SIZE="3">Dim dbe As PrivDBEngine

Set dbe = New PrivDBEngine</font></pre>
