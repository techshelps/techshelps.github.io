<p>
Desktop Database Drivers 1.0 supported scrollable cursors through the ODBC Cursor Library. The Cursor Library implements the ODBC function <b>SQLExtendedFetch</b> by repeatedly calling <b>SQLFetch</b> to populate the Cursor Library cache one record (row) at a time. Scrolling is emulated when the application calls <b>SQLExtendedFetch</b> to reposition the cursor on data in the cache. Data is re-fetched from the driver only when necessary. Because the Cursor Library supports only static cursors, it cannot detect changes in the underlying data source.</p>
<p>
With version&nbsp;2.0 and later drivers, the Cursor Library is no longer necessary. The Desktop Database Drivers directly support <b>SQLExtendedFetch</b> and <b>SQLSetPos</b> through native Microsoft Jet cursors, which are much more efficient than the Cursor Library. While the Cursor Library can still be used, its use is discouraged. The Cursor Library incurs a lot of overhead in parsing the SELECT statement it uses to generate the data in its cache, performing a catalog lookup to update data, and creating a searched UPDATE statement with a WHERE clause to update the base table based on data in the temporary file. Microsoft Jet cursors perform direct updates, operating on the base table, that are much faster.
