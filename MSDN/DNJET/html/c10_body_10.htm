<p>
Because the Microsoft Jet security model relies on the existence of a workgroup information file to store user, group, and password information, your first step in securing your database is to create a workgroup information file unique to your application. This process can be accomplished only with Workgroup Administrator, which ships with Microsoft Access. The key point of this process is that it creates a unique SID for the Admins group. Using Workgroup Administrator (Wrkgadm.exe), follow these steps:</p>
<p>
<b><font face="Symbol"><span style="font-family:symbol">&#219;</span></font>&#09;To create a workgroup information file unique to your application</b>
<ol>
<li>
Exit Microsoft Access.<br><br></li>
<li>
Start the Workgroup Administrator program (Wrkgadm.exe). By default, Wrkgadm.exe is installed in the \Windows\System folder when you install Microsoft Access.<br><br></li>
<li>
Click <b>Create</b> to create a new workgroup information file.<br><br></li>
<li>
Specify a user name, an organization, and a unique workgroup ID, and then click <b>OK</b>.<p>
The workgroup ID can contain letters and numbers, and must be between 4 and 20 characters long. This value is used by the encryption program, along with the user name and organization name, to create an encrypted value unique to your workgroup.</p>
</li>
<li>
Specify the name and path for the new workgroup information file, and then click <b>OK</b>.<p>
Workgroup information files by default have an extension of .mdw, but this is not required. You can assign any extension.</p>
<p>
<b>Important   </b>Don’t overwrite your default System.mdw file (for Windows&nbsp;95 the default file is located in the System folder; for Windows&nbsp;NT Workstation it is located in the System32 folder). If you do so, you must log on by entering “Admin” for the user name and providing the appropriate password when opening all databases.</p>
</li>
<li>
A confirmation form displays the information you’ve entered so far. If the information is correct, click <b>OK</b> to create the workgroup information file. The new file automatically becomes the current workgroup information file for your installation of Microsoft Access. There is no need to “join” the new file.<p>
<b>Important   </b>Be sure to write this information down and store it in a safe place. If your new workgroup information file ever becomes corrupted or is lost, you will need this information to re-create it.</p>
</li>
