<p>
In addition to creating objects, you can look at existing objects and determine their structures. When you retrieve structures, you iterate (loop) through collections. For example, you can iterate through the <b>TableDefs</b> collection to find all the tables, and then iterate through a specific <b>TableDef</b> object’s <b>Fields</b> collection to find information about the table’s fields.</p>
<h5>Refreshing Collections</h5>
<p>
As objects are appended to and deleted from collections, DAO usually keeps track of the collection. However, there are situations when DAO doesn’t know the current state of a collection. This occurs when:
<ul>
<li>
Users are modifying a shared database’s object in a multiuser environment.<br><br></li>
<li>
SQL statements alter structures (for example, “DROP TABLE Customers”).<br><br></li>
<li>
Changes are made through a host program’s user interface. Note that this isn’t the case for applications that use DAO directly, such as Visual Basic and Microsoft Excel.</li>
</ul>
<p>
If you want to make sure that you’re looking at the most up-to-date version of a collection, <i>refresh</i> the collection. This is done by using the <b>Refresh</b> method of the collection. The syntax for the <b>Refresh</b> method is:</p>
<p>
<i>Collection</i>.<b>Refresh</b></p>
<p>
<i>Collection</i> is the name of the collection you want to refresh. For example, if your code needs a complete list of <b>TableDef</b> objects in the database, you may want to refresh the collection before using it. You can accomplish this with the following line of code, where <code>dbs</code> is a pointer to the database:</p>
<pre><FONT FACE="Courier New" SIZE="3">dbs.TableDefs.Refresh</font></pre>
<p>
Use the <b>Refresh</b> method only when necessary because it may take time to refill the collection.</p>
