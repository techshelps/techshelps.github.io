<p>
You use <b>Recordset</b> objects to manipulate data in a database at the record level. There are five types of <b>Recordset</b> objects: table-type <b>Recordset</b> objects, dynaset-type <b>Recordset</b> objects, snapshot-type <b>Recordset</b> objects, forward-only-type <b>Recordset</b> objects, and dynamic-type <b>Recordset</b> objects. For more information about the types of <b>Recordset</b> objects, see “Manipulating Data” later in this chapter.</p>
<p>
The <b>Recordset</b> object is somewhat different from other DAO objects discussed so far in that it exists only while your code or application is running. A <b>Recordset</b> object represents, in memory, a temporary set of records from one or more tables. <b>Recordset</b> objects are one of the most powerful objects in DAO because you can use them to programmatically access not only native Microsoft Jet tables, but any tables from ISAM data sources such as Microsoft FoxPro, or ODBC data sources such as Microsoft SQL&nbsp;Server. In addition, <b>Recordset</b> objects can be based on queries that join multiple tables from heterogeneous data sources.</p>
<p>
The <b>Recordsets</b> collection contains all <b>Recordset</b> objects open in the current <b>Database</b> object. Note that a <b>Recordset</b> object is an object that you explicitly open through code. For example, in Microsoft Access, when you are viewing a table through the user interface, this table isn’t a <b>Recordset</b> object.</p>
