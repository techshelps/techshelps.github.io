<p>
If you have installed the Microsoft Jet IISAM driver for Microsoft Exchange and Outlook, you can use DAO objects and methods to link or import data stored in Microsoft Exchange and Outlook folders to Microsoft Access tables. The Microsoft Exchange IISAM driver lets you access data stored remotely on a Microsoft Exchange server or data stored locally in offline folder (.ost), personal folder (.pst), or personal address book (.pab) files.</p>
<p>
To install the most current version of the driver, download and run Wzmapi80.exe from http://www.microsoft.com/AccessDev/AccWhite/ExchWiz.htm. The Wzmapi80.exe file will install and register the most current version of Msexch35.dll. It also installs new Microsoft Exchange and Outlook wizards that you can use from the Microsoft Access user interface to import and link Microsoft Exchange and Outlook data. The Microsoft Exchange and Outlook wizards work only in Microsoft Access&nbsp;97.</p>
<p>
<b>Note   </b>The Wzmapi80.exe file is also located in the ExchWizard folder on the companion CD-ROM.</p>
<p>
Using the Microsoft Exchange IISAM driver to access Microsoft Exchange and Outlook data is primarily useful for reading information from message folders, public folders, address books, and other items. You cannot modify any existing items. And, while it is possible to write new items to Microsoft Exchange and Outlook message stores, not all fields are available or updatable, which limits your ability to create some items. For more information about these issues, see the white paper “Accessing Microsoft Exchange and Microsoft Outlook Data Using Visual Basic,” located in the Papers folder on the companion CD-ROM.</p>
