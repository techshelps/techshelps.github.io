<p>
Routing and Remote Access Service (RRAS) includes functionality that allows implementation of third-party routing protocols. Plugins provide the interface to incorporate such routing protocols into the Routing and Remote Access Administrator user interface (UI), and are integrated through three objects: the host object, the plugin object, and the plugin control. The <i>host object</i> is implemented by the Routing and Remote Access Administrator and provides services to the plugins, the <i>plugin object</i> provides the basic information required to display the plugin, and the <i>plugin control</i> is a Microsoft®n ActiveX® control responsible for displaying detailed information in the right-hand pane and in any floating windows.</p>
<p>
These objects must be implemented in one DLL, and that DLL must expose <b>DllRegisterServer</b>. When the Routing and Remote Access Administrator is run on a remote machine, it will load the configuration DLL specified in the registry entry (described in Plugin Registry Settings) for the routing protocol, and call <b>DllRegisterServer</b>. When necessary, Routing and Remote Access Administrator will create the objects. For proper implementation the DLL should be installed in the path, in the local directory when Routing and Remote Access Administrator is run, or its absolute path must be specified in the registry.</p>
