<p>
The Routing Table Manager (RTM) is designed to be a central repository of routing information for all routing protocols that operate under Routing and Remote Access Service (RRAS). The RTM provides routing information to all interested components, such as routing protocols, management agents, and monitoring agents. The RTM also determines the best route to each destination network known to the routing protocols. It determines this route based on routing protocol priorities and on metrics associated with the routes. Note that the administrator is able to configure routing protocol priorities. The RTM then passes the best-route information on to the forwarders and back to the routing protocols.</p>
<p>
Each routing protocol calls <b>RtmRegisterClient</b> to register with the RTM. <b>RtmRegisterClient</b> returns a handle that will let the routing protocol add or delete route entries. <b>RtmRegisterClient</b> also allows the routing protocol to register an Event object with the RTM. The RTM will signal this event to notify the routing protocol of changes in best-route information. All other components can obtain information stored in the RTM through route enumeration.</p>
