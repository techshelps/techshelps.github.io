<p>
Just as the highly distributed, component-based services model of enterprise development suggests new ways of organizing the <i>teams</i> that develop these applications, it also suggests new approaches to the development <i>process</i> itself.</p>
<p>
Traditional, monolithic application development has typically followed a <i>waterfall process model</i>, in which approval milestones are prerequisites to the completion of one stage and the start of the next. This is not well-suited to the component-based nature of distributed enterprise applications because components are best developed in parallel, rather than sequentially. In addition, the waterfall process model is not flexible and responsive enough to lend itself well to the rapid prototype development tools and iterative user interface design of GUI-driven desktop systems development.</p>
<p>
The <i>milestone-based process model</i> presented in this chapter allows for significant task overlap and iterative development. It maximizes the advantages of the team model presented in this chapter by creating explicit team accountability. It sets priorities by assessing risk, and encourages rapid application delivery.</p>
<p>
This process model is presented in the following sections.</p>
