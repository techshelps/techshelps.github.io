<p>
A mixed cursor is a combination of a keyset-driven cursor and a dynamic cursor. It is used when the result set is too large to reasonably save keys for the entire result set. Mixed cursors are implemented by creating a keyset that is smaller than the entire result set but larger than the rowset (the set of rows returned in a single fetch by a block cursor).</p>
<p>
As long as the application scrolls within the keyset, the behavior is keyset-driven. When the application scrolls outside the keyset, the behavior is dynamic: the cursor fetches the requested rows and creates a new keyset. Note that after the new keyset is created, the cursor behavior reverts to keyset-driven within the keyset.</p>
<p>
For example, suppose a result set has 1,000 rows and uses a mixed cursor with a keyset size of 100 and a rowset size of 10. When the first rowset is fetched, the cursor creates a keyset consisting of the keys for the first 100 rows. It then returns the first 10 rows, as requested.</p>
<p>
Now suppose another application deletes rows 11 and 101. If the cursor attempts to retrieve row 11, it will encounter a hole because it has a key for the row but the row no longer exists. This is typical keyset-driven behavior. If the cursor attempts to retrieve row 101, the cursor will not detect that the row is missing because it does not have a key for the row. Instead, it will retrieve what was previously row 102.</p>
<h3>Considering the Mixed Cursor</h3>
<p>
The mixed cursor is difficult to use correctly because the sensitivity to data changes depends on the varying circumstances of keyset-driven and dynamic cursor behavior, as explained above. There is no particular implementing technology for a mixed cursor, and creating one is a difficult task.</p>
<p>
If your application needs scrollable access to a very large set of records, and you can programmatically handle the different modes of data sensitivity, the mixed cursor may work for you.</p>
