<p>
The <i>development model</i> is the "glue" that allows all the sub-models to work together, and provides a formal definition of the process and resources used to develop an application. Some of the questions this model answers are:</p>
<ul type=disc>
<li>
Who should work on what part of the overall development problem?</li>
<li>
In what order should sub-model tasks be performed (logical object design, usability testing, database design, programming, testing, and so on), and how should progress be measured?</li>
<li>
How many employees are assigned to the project, what are their skills, and what specialized activities should be employed to optimize the development efficiency and final quality of the deliverables?</li>
<li>
How should the project be managed and coordinated with other projects?</li>
<li>
How important is software reuse and componentization? (This influences coordination, the importance of standards, the time spent on design, and the value of a general-purpose architecture.)</li>
<li>
How should work in progress be shared and promoted for other developers and testers to use?</li>
<li>
How should the application be deployed into the final production environment?</li>
<li>
How will administration be managed?</li>
<li>
How will updates be deployed?</li>
</ul>
<p>
The development model itself is separated into two relatively independent sub-models, the development <i>process</i> model, which addresses issues of planning, scheduling, and milestones, and the development <i>role</i> model, which is concerned with the organization, coordination, and management of development teams.</p>
<h2>How the development model interacts with other models</h2>
<p>
As the Enterprise Application Model shows, the development model permeates all of the Enterprise sub-models, guiding the process of development among them and coordinating their requirements and deliverables.</p>
<p>
In this respect, there are no "typical" interactions, because you must account for every design and implementation decision in the development model.</p>
<h2>How the Internet affects the development model</h2>
<p>
Examples of the way the Internet has impacted the development model include:</p>
<ul type=disc>
<li>
A great increase in the importance of server-based (UI-less) logic.</li>
<li>
Increased complexity and resource requirements for testing and debugging complex, multi-user, distributed, continuously-running applications.</li>
<li>
An emphasis on the value of location-independent components, and all the processes involved in their development, coordination, and sharing.</li>
<li>
Extension of the developer/programmer roles to include the roles of author and publisher.</li>
<li>
The creation of a strong commercial demand for a universal, scalable, component-oriented enterprise application architecture.</li>
</ul>
