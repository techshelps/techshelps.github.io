<a name="idh_vedefbasicauthentication"></a><b>basic</b> <b>authentication</b></p>
<p class=indent>
A security mechanism using a standard HTTP mechanism in which user information is sent received as clear text. (The term clear text indicates data is transmitted as clearly readable text characters rather than binary bit-streamed information, which is not text-formatted.) Passwords and user names are encoded but not encrypted in this type of authentication.</p>

<p class=indent>
In source control, the process of sharing a file with another project and then separating it into two or more branches. Once a branch has been created, two files (the file in the project, and its counterpart in other projects) will have a shared history up to a certain point, and divergent histories after that time.</p>

<p class=dt>
<a name="idh_vedefbusinessobject"></a><b>business</b> <b>object</b></p>
<p class=indent>

<p class=indent>
