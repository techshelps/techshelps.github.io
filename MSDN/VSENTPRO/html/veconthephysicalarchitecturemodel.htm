<p>
The <i>physical model</i> defines where the physical resources of the application are deployed to support the requirements of the other enterprise sub-models, and the process through which the competing interests of the sub-models are resolved. The completed physical model of an enterprise application is the application’s architecture. Some of the questions this model answers include:</p>
<ul type=disc>
<li>
How will physical resources of computers, network bandwidth and protocols, databases, components, operating system and back-office services, and third party features be used to meet the overall needs of the business (such as scalability and robustness)?</li>
<li>
How will existing deployments migrate to desired deployments?</li>
<li>
How can resources be accessed most efficiently (for example, local machine versus the Internet)?</li>
<li>
How can usability and throughput performance requirements be met in execution environments that include slow LAN/WAN access times, intermittently disconnected network servers, and unreliable Internet connections? </li>
</ul>
<h2>How the physical model interacts with other models</h2>
<p>
As the diagram in the <a href="vecontheenterpriseapplicationmodel.htm">Enterprise Application Model</a> shows, the physical model directly interacts with the user model, the logical model, and the technology model. The following table characterizes these interactions and gives brief examples of each.</p>
<table border=1 cellpadding=5 cols=3 frame=below rules=rows>
<tr valign=top>
<td class=label width=25%><b>Sub-model</b></td>
<td class=label width=38%><b>How the physical model relates to it</b></td>
<td class=label width=37%><b>Example</b></td>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=25%>User model</td>
<td width=38%>Provides the means by which the application is made available to the user.</td>
<td width=37%>The physical architecture must be able to support the user’s desktop configuration and scale efficiently to the number of users and their processing requirements.</td>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=25%>Logical model</td>
<td width=38%>Constrains the extent to which logical constructs can be mapped to the physical infrastructure.</td>
<td width=37%>An application that provides online transaction processing must define components that can interface with a transaction management infrastructure.</td>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=25%>Technology model</td>
<td width=38%>Limits the technology that can be supported on the physical infrastructure.</td>
<td width=37%>An application deployed to the public on the Internet must use "least common denominator" technology for user interface elements that must run on a variety of platforms and browsers.</td>
</tr>
</table><br>
<p class=mini>
Since the development model permeates all of the Enterprise sub-models, there are no "typical" interactions because you must account for every design and implementation decision in the development model.</p>
<h2>How the Internet affects the physical model</h2>
<p>
Examples of the way the Internet has impacted the physical model include:</p>
<ul type=disc>
<li>
An enormous increase in the importance of using highly scalable architectures to support unknown or unlimited numbers of Internet users.</li>
<li>
A requirement to access application functionality (business logic) from many different client platforms.</li>
<li>
A great increase in the use of distributed, asynchronous resources.</li>
<li>
The enabling of new application types, including:<ul type=disc>
<li>
Simple informational (simple HTML)<br><br></li>
<li>
Active informational (interactive HTML/ActiveX™/Java)<br><br></li>
<li>
Traditional desktop-oriented application embedded in the Web</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
The availability of installation-free user interface (browser-based HTML).</li>
<li>
The need for corporate firewalls between internal LANs and the public Internet.</li>
<li>
On-demand, server-based, application installation (ActiveX components and Java applets).</li>
<li>
Packaging (.cab and .zip files) and digital signing of components.</li>
</ul>
