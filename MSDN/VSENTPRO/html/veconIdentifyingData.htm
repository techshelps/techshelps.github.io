Data describes a real-world information resource that is important to your application. Data describes the things, people, products, items, customers, assets, records, and — ultimately — data structures that your application finds useful to categorize, organize, and maintain.</p>
<p>
Identifying data is an iterative process. At first you may just know some vague, high-level details about how the application must handle its information. As you keep expanding your knowledge of the application's intended business processes, you keep filling in more details.</p>
<p>
As you document the data requirements for your application, the description for each item of data typically includes:</p>
<ul type=disc>
<li>
Name.</li>
<li>
General description (What is it?).</li>
<li>
Ownership (Who is responsible for it?).</li>
<li>
Data characteristics (How is it measured and how big or small can it be?).</li>
<li>
Logical events, processes, and relationships (How and when is it created, modified, and used?).</li>
</ul>
<p>
It's worth noting that data has many different characteristics. Part of the process of data design is to specify how to quantify each data item. Some typical data characteristics are:</p>
<ul type=disc>
<li>
Location attributes (address, country, galaxy, warehouse bin).</li>
<li>
Physical attributes (weight, dimension, volume, color, material, texture).</li>
<li>
Conceptual attributes (name, rank, serial number).</li>
<li>
Relational attributes (assemblies consist of subassemblies, authors write multiple books).</li>
<li>
Value attributes (currency, goodwill, esteem).</li>
</ul>
<p>
The process of identifying data requires interviews, analysis of existing data structures, document preparation, and peer reviews. The eventual result is a documented, conceptual view of your application's information that answers the data questions of "What, where, when, and why?" Generally, this is an early-stage exploration of how the various departments, organizations, and your application need to use data.</p>
