<h2><a name="odbcrow_status_array"></a>Row Status Array</h2>
<p>
In addition to data, <b>SQLFetch</b> and <b>SQLFetchScroll</b> can return an array that gives the status of each row in the rowset. This array is specified through the SQL_ATTR_ROW_STATUS_PTR statement attribute. This array is allocated by the application and must have as many elements as are specified by the SQL_ATTR_ROW_ARRAY_SIZE statement attribute. The values in the array are set by <b>SQLBulkOperations</b>, <b>SQLFetch</b>, <b>SQLFetchScroll</b>, and <b>SQLSetPos. </b>The values describe the status of the row and whether that status has changed since it was last fetched:</p>
<table border=1 cellpadding=5 cols=2 frame=below rules=rows width=587>
<tr valign=top>
<td class=label width=34%><b>Row status array value</b></td>
<td class=label width=66%><b>Description</b></td>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=34%>SQL_ROW_SUCCESS</td>
<td width=66%>The row was successfully fetched and has not changed since it was last fetched.</td>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=34%>SQL_ROW_<br>
SUCCESS_WITH_INFO</td>
<td width=66%>The row was successfully fetched and has not changed since it was last fetched. However, a warning was returned about the row.</td>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=34%>SQL_ROW_ERROR</td>
<td width=66%>An error occurred while fetching the row.</td>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=34%>SQL_ROW_UPDATED</td>
<td width=66%>The row was successfully fetched and has been updated since it was last fetched. If the row is fetched again, or refreshed by <b>SQLSetPos</b>, its status is changed to the new status.<p>
Some drivers cannot detect changes to data, and therefore cannot return this value. To determine whether a driver can detect updates to refetched rows, an application calls <b>SQLGetInfo</b> with the SQL_ROW_UPDATES option.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=34%>SQL_ROW_DELETED</td>
<td width=66%>The row has been deleted since it was last fetched.</td>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=34%>SQL_ROW_ADDED</td>
<td width=66%>The row was inserted by <b>SQLBulkOperations</b>. If the row is fetched again, or is refreshed by <b>SQLSetPos</b>, its status is SQL_ROW_SUCCESS.<p>
This value is not set by <b>SQLFetch</b> or <b>SQLFetchScroll</b>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=34%>SQL_ROW_NOROW</td>
<td width=66%>The rowset overlapped the end of the result set and no row was returned that corresponded to this element of the row status array.</td>
</tr>
