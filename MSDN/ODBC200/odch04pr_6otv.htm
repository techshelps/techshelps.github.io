<h1><a name="odbcenvironment__connection__and_statement_attributes"></a>Environment, Connection, and Statement Attributes</h1>
<p>
ODBC defines a number of attributes that are associated with environments, connections, or statements. </p>
<p>
Environment attributes affect the entire environment, such as whether connection pooling is enabled. Environment attributes are set with <b>SQLSetEnvAttr</b> and retrieved with <b>SQLGetEnvAttr</b>.</p>
<p>
Connection attributes affect each connection individually, such as how long a driver should wait while attempting to connect to a data source before timing out. Connection attributes are set with <b>SQLSetConnectAttr</b> and retrieved with <b>SQLGetConnectAttr</b>. For more information about connection attributes, see “<a href="odch06pr_0shf.htm">Connection Attributes</a>” in Chapter 6, “Connecting to a Data Source or Driver.”</p>
<p>
Statement attributes affect each statement individually, such as whether a statement should be executed asynchronously. Statement attributes are set with <b>SQLSetStmtAttr</b> and retrieved with <b>SQLGetStmtAttr</b>. A few statement attributes are read-only attributes and cannot be set. For example, the SQL_ATTR_ROW_NUMBER statement attribute, which is used to retrieve the number of the current row in the cursor, is read-only. For more information about statement attributes, see “<a href="odch09pr_6zzn.htm">Statement Attributes</a>” in Chapter 9, “Executing Statements.”</p>
<p>
In addition to attributes defined by ODBC, a driver can define its own connection and statement attributes. Driver-defined attributes must be registered with X/Open to ensure that two driver vendors do not assign the same integer value to different, proprietary attributes. For more information, see “<a href="odch17pr_7dbn.htm">Driver-Specific Data Types, Descriptor Types, Information Types, Diagnostic Types, and Attributes</a>” in Chapter 17, “Programming Considerations.”</p>
<p>
For a complete list of attributes, see <a href="odch21jpr_1gtu.htm">SQLSetEnvAttr</a>, <a href="odch21jpr_4zn6.htm">SQLSetConnectAttr</a>, and <a href="odch21kpr_77jm.htm">SQLSetStmtAttr</a>. Most attributes are also described in the description of the ODBC function that they affect.</p>
