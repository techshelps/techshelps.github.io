<h1><a name="odbcabout_drivers_and_data_sources"></a><sup></sup>About Drivers and Data Sources</h1>
<p>
<i>Drivers</i> are the components that process ODBC requests and return data to the application. If necessary, drivers modify an application’s request into a form that is understood by the data source. You must use the driver’s Setup program to add or delete a driver from your system.</p>
<p>
<i>Data sources</i> are the databases or files accessed by a driver. You use the ODBC Administrator to add, configure, and delete data sources from your system. The following types of data sources can be used:</p>
<table border=1 cellpadding=5 cols=2 frame=below rules=rows width=587>
<tr valign=top>
<td class=label width=49%><b>Data source</b></td>
<td class=label width=51%><b>Description</b></td>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=49%>User data sources</td>
<td width=51%>These are local to a computer, and can only be used by the current user. User DSNs are registered in the HKEY_CURRENT_USER registry subtree.</td>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=49%>System data sources</td>
<td width=51%>These are local to a computer, rather than dedicated to a user. The system, or any user having privileges, can use a data source set up with a system data source. System DSNs are registered in the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE registry subtree.</td>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=49%>File data sources</td>
<td width=51%>These are file-based sources that can be shared between all users that have the same drivers installed, and so have access to the database. These data sources need not be dedicated to a user or local to a computer. File data sources do not have a data source name, as user or system data sources do; they are identified by a file name with a DSN extension.</td>
</tr>
</table><br>
<p>
User and system data sources are collectively known as <i>machine</i> data sources because they are local to a computer.</p>
<p>
Each of these data sources has a tab in the ODBC Administrator that is dedicated to that type. For more information about data sources, see “<a href="odch03pr_8uyb.htm">Data Sources</a>” in Chapter 3, “ODBC Architecture,” in the <i>ODBC Programmer’s Reference</i>.</p>
