<h1><a name="odbcodbc_and_sql_92_scalar_functions"></a>ODBC and SQL92 Scalar Functions</h1>
<p>
The tables in this appendix include functions that have been added in ODBC 3.0 to align with SQL92. Those functions added for a particular type of scalar function, as defined in ODBC, are indicated in each section.</p>
<p>
ODBC and SQL92 classify their scalar functions differently. ODBC classifies scalar functions by argument type; SQL92 classifies them by return value. For example, the EXTRACT function is classified as a timedate function by ODBC, because the extract-field argument is a datetime keyword and the extract-source argument is a datetime or interval expression. SQL92, on the other hand, classifies EXTRACT as a numeric scalar function, because the return value is a numeric.</p>
<p>
An application can determine which scalar functions a driver supports by calling <b>SQLGetInfo</b>. Information types are included for both ODBC and SQL92 classifications of scalar functions. Because these classifications are different, the support for some scalar functions may be indicated in information types that do not correspond to ODBC and SQL92. For example, support for EXTRACT in ODBC is indicated by the SQL_TIMEDATE_FUNCTIONS information type; support for EXTRACT in SQL92, on the other hand, is indicated by the SQL_SQL92_NUMERIC_VALUE_FUNCTIONS information type.</p>
