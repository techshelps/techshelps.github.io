<h3><a name="odbcsqlsetpos_in_the_cursor_library"></a>SQLSetPos in the Cursor Library</h3>
<p>
The cursor library only supports the SQL_POSITION operation for the <i>Operation</i> argument in <b>SQLSetPos</b>. It only supports the SQL_LOCK_NO_CHANGE value for the <i>LockType</i> argument.</p>
<p>
If the driver does not support bulk operations, the cursor library returns SQLSTATE HYC00 (Driver not capable) when <b>SQLSetPos</b> is called with <i>RowNumber</i> equal to 0. Note that this driver behavior is not recommended. Support for bulk operations will be mandatory in the future.</p>
<p>
The cursor library does not support the SQL_UPDATE and SQL_DELETE operations in a call to <b>SQLSetPos</b>. The cursor library implements a positioned update or delete SQL statement by creating a searched update or delete statement with a WHERE clause that enumerates the values stored in its cache for each bound column. For more information, see “<a href="odappfpr_2t83.htm">Processing Positioned Update and Delete Statements</a>” earlier in this appendix.</p>
<p>
If the driver does not support static cursors, an application working with the cursor library should only call <b>SQLSetPos</b> on a rowset fetched by <b>SQLExtendedFetch</b> or <b>SQLFetchScroll</b>, not <b>SQLFetch</b>. The cursor library implements <b>SQLExtendedFetch</b> and <b>SQLFetchScroll</b> by making repeated calls of <b>SQLFetch</b> (with a rowset size of 1) in the driver. The cursor library passes calls to <b>SQLFetch</b>, on the other hand, through to the driver. If <b>SQLSetPos</b> is called on a multi-row rowset fetched by <b>SQLFetch</b> when the driver does not support static cursors, the call will fail because <b>SQLSetPos</b> does not work with forward-only cursors. This will occur even if an application has successfully called <b>SQLSetStmtAttr</b> to set SQL_ATTR_CURSOR_TYPE to SQL_CURSOR_STATIC, which the cursor library supports even if the driver does not support static cursors.</p>
