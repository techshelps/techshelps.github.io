<h2><a name="odbcfile_based_driver_diagnostic_example"></a>File-Based Driver Diagnostic Example</h2>
<p>
A file-based driver acts both as an ODBC driver and as a data source. It can therefore generate errors and warnings both as a component in an ODBC connection and as a data source. Because it also is the component that interfaces with the Driver Manager, it formats and returns arguments for <b>SQLGetDiagRec</b>.</p>
<p>
For example, if a Microsoft driver for dBASE could not allocate sufficient memory, it might return the following values from <b>SQLGetDiagRec</b>:</p>
<pre><code>SQLSTATE:&nbsp;&nbsp; "HY001"
Native Error: 42052
Diagnostic Msg: "[Microsoft][ODBC dBASE Driver]Unable to allocate sufficient memory."
</code></pre>
<p>
Because this error was not related to the data source, the driver only added prefixes to the diagnostic message for the vendor ([Microsoft]) and the driver ([ODBC dBASE Driver]).</p>
<p>
If the driver could not find the file EMPLOYEE.DBF, it might return the following values from <b>SQLGetDiagRec</b>:</p>
<pre><code>SQLSTATE:&nbsp;&nbsp; "42S02"
Native Error:&nbsp; -1305
Diagnostic Msg: "[Microsoft][ODBC dBASE Driver][dBASE]No such table or object"
</code></pre>
<p>
Because this error was related to the data source, the driver added the file format of the data source ([dBASE]) as a prefix to the diagnostic message. Because the driver was also the component that interfaced with the data source, it added prefixes for the vendor ([Microsoft]) and the driver ([ODBC dBASE Driver]).</p>
