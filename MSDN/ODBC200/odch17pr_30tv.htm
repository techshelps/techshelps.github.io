<h2><a name="odbcstandards_compliant_applications_and_drivers"></a>Standards-Compliant Applications and Drivers</h2>
<p>
A standards-compliant application or driver is one that conforms to the X/Open CAE Specification "Data Management: SQL Call-Level Interface (CLI)," and the ISO/IEC 9075-3:1995 (E) Call-Level Interface (SQL/CLI).</p>
<p>
ODBC 3.x guarantees that:
<ul type=disc>
<li>
An application written to the X/Open and ISO CLI specifications will work with an ODBC 3.x driver or a standards-compliant driver when it is compiled with the ODBC 3.x header files and linked with ODBC 3.x libraries, and when it gains access to the driver through the ODBC 3.x Driver Manager. <br><br></li>
<li>
A driver written to the X/Open and ISO CLI specifications will work with an ODBC 3.x application or a standards-compliant application when it is compiled with the ODBC 3.x header files and linked with ODBC 3.x libraries, and when the application gains access to the driver through the ODBC 3.x Driver Manager.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Standards-compliant applications and drivers are compiled with the ODBC_STD compile flag.</p>
<p>
Standards-compliant applications exhibit the following behavior:
<ul type=disc>
<li>
If a standards-compliant application calls <b>SQLAllocEnv</b> (which may occur because <b>SQLAllocEnv</b> is a valid function in the X/Open and ISO CLI), the call is mapped to <b>SQLAllocHandleStd</b> at compile time. As a result, at run time, the application calls <b>SQLAllocHandleStd</b>. During the course of processing this call, the Driver Manager sets the SQL_ATTR_ODBC_VERSION environment attribute to SQL_OV_ODBC3. A call to <b>SQLAllocHandleStd</b> is equivalent to a call to <b>SQLAllocHandle</b> with a <i>HandleType</i> of SQL_HANDLE_ENV and a call to <b>SQLSetEnvAttr</b> to set SQL_ATTR_ODBC_VERSION to SQL_OV_ODBC3.<br><br></li>
<li>
If a standards-compliant application calls <b>SQLBindParam</b> (which may occur because <b>SQLBindParam</b> is a valid function in the X/Open and ISO CLI), the ODBC 3.x Driver Manager maps the call to the equivalent call in <b>SQLBindParameter</b> (see "<a href="odappgpr_197r.htm">SQLBindParam Mapping</a>" in Appendix G, "Driver Guidelines for Backward Compatibility").<br><br></li>
<li>
To align with the ISO CLI, the ODBC 3.x header files contain aliases for information types used in calls to <b>SQLGetInfo</b>. A standards-compliant application can used these aliases instead of the ODBC 3.x information types. For more information, see the next section, "<a href="odch17pr_4zhv.htm">Header Files</a>."<br><br></li>
<li>
A standards-compliant application must verify that all features it supports are supported in the driver it will work with. Setting the SQL_ATTR_CURSOR_SCROLLABLE statement attribute to SQL_SCROLLABLE, and setting the SQL_ATTR_CURSOR_SENSITIVITY statement attribute to SQL_INSENSITIVE or SQL_SENSITIVE are capabilities that are available as optional features in the standards, but are not included in the ODBC 3.x Core level, so may not be supported by all ODBC 3.x drivers. If a standards-compliant application uses these capabilities, it should verify that the driver that it will work with supports them.</li>
</ul>
