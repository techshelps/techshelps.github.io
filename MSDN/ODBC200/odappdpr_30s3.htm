<h1><a name="odbcinterval_data_types"></a>Interval Data Types</h1>
<p>
An interval is defined as the difference between two dates and times. Intervals are expressed in one of two different ways. One is a <i>year-month</i> interval that expresses intervals in terms of years and an integral number of months. The other is a <i>day-time</i> interval that expresses intervals in terms of days, minutes, and seconds. These two types of intervals are distinct and cannot be mixed, because months may have differing numbers of days.</p>
<p>
An interval consists of a set of fields. There is an implied ordering among the fields. For example, in a year-to-month interval, the year comes first, followed by the month. Similarly, in a day-to-minute interval, the fields are in the order day, hour, and minute. The first field in an interval type is called the <i>leading</i> field, or the <i>high-order</i> field. The last field is called the <i>trailing</i> field. </p>
<p>
In all intervals, the leading field is not constrained by rules of the Gregorian calendar. For example, in an hour-to-minute interval, the hour field is not constrained to be between 0 and 23 (inclusive), as it normally is. The trailing fields subsequent to the leading field follow the usual constraints of the Gregorian calendar. For more information, see “<a href="odappdpr_7z1u.htm">Constraints of the Gregorian Calendar</a>,” later in this appendix.</p>
<p>
There are 13 interval SQL data types and 13 interval C data types. Each of the interval C data types uses the same structure, SQL_INTERVAL_STRUCT, to contain the interval data. (For more information, see the next section, “<a href="odappdpr_31t1.htm">C Interval Structure</a>.”) For more information on the SQL data types, see “<a href="odappdpr_8fcj.htm">SQL Data Types</a>” earlier in this appendix; for more information on the C data types, see “<a href="odappdpr_40j7.htm">C Data Types</a>.” </p>
