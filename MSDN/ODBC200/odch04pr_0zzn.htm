<h2><a name="odbcstatement_handles"></a>Statement Handles</h2>
<p>
A <i>statement</i> is most easily thought of as an SQL statement, such as <b>SELECT * FROM Employee</b>. However, a statement is more than just an SQL statement — it consists of all of the information associated with that SQL statement, such as any result sets created by the statement and parameters used in the execution of the statement. A statement does not even need to have an application-defined SQL statement. For example, when a catalog function such as <b>SQLTables</b> is executed on a statement, it executes a predefined SQL statement that returns a list of table names.</p>
<p>
Each statement is identified by a statement handle. A statement is associated with a single connection, and there can be multiple statements on that connection. Some drivers limit the number of active statements they support; the SQL_MAX_CONCURRENT_ACTIVITIES option in <b>SQLGetInfo</b> specifies how many active statements a driver supports on a single connection. A statement is defined to be “active” if it has results pending, where results are either a result set or the count of rows affected by an <b>INSERT</b>, <b>UPDATE</b>, or <b>DELETE</b> statement, or data is being sent with multiple calls to <b>SQLPutData</b>.</p>
<p>
Within a piece of code that implements ODBC (the Driver Manager or a driver), the statement handle identifies a structure that contains statement information, such as:
<ul type=disc>
<li>
The statement’s state<br><br></li>
<li>
The current statement-level diagnostics<br><br></li>
<li>
The addresses of the application variables bound to the statement’s parameters and result set columns<br><br></li>
<li>
The current settings of each statement attribute</li>
</ul>
<p>
Statement handles are used in most ODBC functions. Notably, they are used in the functions to bind parameters and result set columns (<b>SQLBindParameter</b> and <b>SQLBindCol</b>), prepare and execute statements (<b>SQLPrepare</b>, <b>SQLExecute</b>, and <b>SQLExecDirect</b>), retrieve metadata (<b>SQLColAttribute</b> and <b>SQLDescribeCol</b>), fetch results (<b>SQLFetch</b>), and retrieve diagnostics (<b>SQLGetDiagField</b> and <b>SQLGetDiagRec</b>). They are also used in catalog functions (<b>SQLColumns</b>, <b>SQLTables</b>, and so on) and a number of other functions.</p>
<p>
Statement handles are allocated with <b>SQLAllocHandle</b> and freed with <b>SQLFreeHandle</b>.</p>
