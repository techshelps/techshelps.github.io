<p class=label>
<b>Summary</b></p>
<p>
<b>SQLSetStmtAttr</b> sets attributes related to a statement.</p>
<p class=indent>
<B><b>Note</b></B> For more information about what the Driver Manager maps this function to when an ODBC 3.x application is working with an ODBC 2<i>.x</i> driver, see <a href="odch17pr_6mpf.htm">“Mapping Replacement Functions for Backward Compatibility of Applications</a>” in Chapter 17, “Programming Considerations.”</p>
<p class=label>
<b>Syntax</b></p>
<p>
SQLRETURN <b>SQLSetStmtAttr</b>(<br>
SQLHSTMT<i>StatementHandle</i>,<br>
SQLINTEGER<i>Attribute</i>,<br>
SQLPOINTER<i>ValuePtr</i>,<br>
SQLINTEGER<i>StringLength</i>);</p>
<p class=label>
<b>Arguments</b></p>
<p class=dt>
<i>StatementHandle</i></p>
<p class=indent>
[Input]<br>
Statement handle.</p>
<p class=dt>
<i>Attribute</i></p>
<p class=indent>
[Input]<br>
Option to set, listed in “Comments.”</p>
<p class=dt>
<i>ValuePtr</i></p>
<p class=indent>
[Input]<br>
Pointer to the value to be associated with <i>Attribute</i>. Depending on the value of <i>Attribute</i>, <i>ValuePtr</i> will be a 32-bit unsigned integer value or a pointer to a null-terminated character string, a binary buffer, or a driver-defined value. Note that if the <i>Attribute</i> argument is a driver-specific value, <i>ValuePtr</i> may be a signed integer.</p>
<p class=dt>
<i>StringLength</i></p>
<p class=indent>
[Input]<br>
If <i>Attribute</i> is an ODBC-defined attribute and <i>ValuePtr</i> points to a character string or a binary buffer, this argument should be the length of *<i>ValuePtr</i>. If <i>Attribute</i> is an ODBC-defined attribute and <i>ValuePtr</i> is an integer, <i>StringLength</i> is ignored.</p>
<p class=dt>
</p>
<p class=indent>
If <i>Attribute</i> is a driver-defined attribute, the application indicates the nature of the attribute to the Driver Manager by setting the <i>StringLength</i> argument. <i>StringLength</i> can have the following values:
<ul type=disc>
<li>
If <i>ValuePtr</i> is a pointer to a character string, then <i>StringLength</i> is the length of the string or SQL_NTS.<br><br></li>
<li>
If <i>ValuePtr</i> is a pointer to a binary buffer, then the application places the result of the SQL_LEN_BINARY_ATTR(<i>length</i>) macro in <i>StringLength</i>. This places a negative value in <i>StringLength</i>.<br><br></li>
<li>
If <i>ValuePtr</i> is a pointer to a value other than a character string or a binary string, then <i>StringLength</i> should have the value SQL_IS_POINTER. <br><br></li>
<li>
If <i>ValuePtr</i> contains a fixed-length value, then <i>StringLength</i> is either SQL_IS_INTEGER or SQL_IS_UINTEGER, as appropriate.</li>
</ul>
<p class=label>
<b>Returns</b></p>
<p>
SQL_SUCCESS, SQL_SUCCESS_WITH_INFO, SQL_ERROR, or SQL_INVALID_HANDLE.</p>
<p class=label>
<b>Diagnostics</b></p>
<p>
When <b>SQLSetStmtAttr</b> returns SQL_ERROR or SQL_SUCCESS_WITH_INFO, an associated SQLSTATE value may be obtained by calling <b>SQLGetDiagRec</b> with a <i>HandleType</i> of SQL_HANDLE_STMT and a <i>Handle</i> of <i>StatementHandle</i>. The following table lists the SQLSTATE values commonly returned by <b>SQLSetStmtAttr</b> and explains each one in the context of this function; the notation “(DM)” precedes the descriptions of SQLSTATEs returned by the Driver Manager. The return code associated with each SQLSTATE value is SQL_ERROR, unless noted otherwise.</p>

</table><br>
<p class=label>
<b>Comments</b></p>
<p>
Statement attributes for a statement remain in effect until they are changed by another call to <b>SQLSetStmtAttr</b> or the statement is dropped by calling <b>SQLFreeHandle</b>. Calling <b>SQLFreeStmt</b> with the SQL_CLOSE, SQL_UNBIND, or SQL_RESET_PARAMS options does not reset statement attributes.</p>
<p>
Some statement attributes support substitution of a similar value if the data source does not support the value specified in <i>ValuePtr</i>. In such cases, the driver returns SQL_SUCCESS_WITH_INFO and SQLSTATE 01S02 (Option value changed). For example, if <i>Attribute</i> is SQL_ATTR_CONCURRENCY, <i>ValuePtr</i> is SQL_CONCUR_ROWVER, and the data source does not support this, the driver substitutes SQL_CONCUR_VALUES and returns SQL_SUCCESS_WITH_INFO. To determine the substituted value, an application calls <b>SQLGetStmtAttr</b>.</p>
<p>
The format of information set with <i>ValuePtr</i> depends on the specified <i>Attribute</i>. <b>SQLSetStmtAttr</b> accepts attribute information in one of two different formats: a character string or a 32-bit integer value. The format of each is noted in the attribute’s description. This format applies to the information returned for each attribute in <b>SQLGetStmtAttr</b>. Character strings pointed to by the <i>ValuePtr</i> argument of <b>SQLSetStmtAttr</b> have a length of <i>StringLength</i>.</p>
<p class=indent>
<B><b>Note</b></B> The ability to set statement attributes at the connection level by calling <b>SQLSetConnectAttr</b> has been deprecated in ODBC 3.x. ODBC 3.x applications should never set statement attributes at the connection level. ODBC 3.x statement attributes cannot be set at the connection level, with the exception of the SQL_ATTR_METADATA_ID and SQL_ATTR_ASYNC_ENABLE attributes, which are both connection attributes and statement attributes, and can be set either at the connection level or the statement level.</p>
<p class=indent>
ODBC 3.x drivers need only support this functionality if they should work with ODBC 2.<i>x</i> applications that set ODBC 2.<i>x</i> statement options at the connection level. For more information, see “Setting Statement Options on the Connection Level" under "<a href="odappgpr_55nr.htm">SQLSetConnectOption Mapping</a>” in Appendix G, “Driver Guidelines for Backward Compatibility.”</p>
<h1>Statement Attributes that Set Descriptor Fields</h1>
<p>
Many statement attributes correspond to a header field of a descriptor. Setting these attributes actually results in the setting of the descriptor fields. Setting fields by a call to <b>SQLSetStmtAttr</b>, rather than <b>SQLSetDescField</b>, has the advantage that a descriptor handle does not have to be obtained for the function call.</p>
<p class=indent>
<B><b>Caution</b></B> Calling <b>SQLSetStmtAttr</b> for one statement can affect other statements. This occurs when the APD or ARD associated with the statement is explicitly allocated and is also associated with other statements. Because <b>SQLSetStmtAttr</b> modifies the APD or ARD, the modifications apply to all statements with which this descriptor is associated. If this is not the required behavior, the application should dissociate this descriptor from the other statements (by calling <b>SQLSetStmtAttr</b> to set the SQL_ATTR_APP_ROW_DESC or SQL_ATTR_APP_PARAM_DESC field to a different descriptor handle) before calling <b>SQLSetStmtAttr</b> again.</p>
<p>
When a descriptor field is set as a result of the corresponding statement attribute being set, the field is set only for the applicable descriptors that are currently associated with the statement identified by the <i>StatementHandle</i> argument, and the attribute setting does not affect any descriptors that may be associated with that statement in the future. When a descriptor field that is also a statement attribute is set by a call to <b>SQLSetDescField</b>, the corresponding statement attribute is set. If an explicitly allocated descriptor is dissociated from a statement, a statement attribute that corresponds to a header field will revert to the value of the field in the implicitly allocated descriptor.</p>
<p>
When a statement is allocated (see <a href="odch21bpr_689x.htm">SQLAllocHandle</a>), four descriptor handles are automatically allocated and associated with the statement. Explicitly allocated descriptor handles can be associated with the statement by calling <b>SQLAllocHandle</b> with an <i>fHandleType</i> of SQL_HANDLE_DESC to allocate a descriptor handle, and then calling <b>SQLSetStmtAttr</b> to associate the descriptor handle with the statement. </p>
<p>
The following statement attributes correspond to descriptor header fields.</p>

<h1>Statement Attributes</h1>
<p>
The currently defined attributes and the version of ODBC in which they were introduced are shown in the following table; it is expected that more will be defined by drivers to take advantage of different data sources. A range of attributes is reserved by ODBC; driver developers must reserve values for their own driver-specific use from X/Open. For more information, see “<a href="odch17pr_7dbn.htm">Driver-Specific Data Types, Descriptor Types, Information Types, Diagnostic Types, and Attributes</a>” in Chapter 17, “Programming Considerations.”</p>

<tr valign=top>
<td width=38%>SQL_ATTR_APP_PARAM_DESC<br>
(ODBC 3.0)</td>
<td width=62%>The handle to the APD for subsequent calls to <b>SQLExecute</b> and <b>SQLExecDirect</b> on the statement handle. The initial value of this attribute is the descriptor implicitly allocated when the statement was initially allocated. If the value of this attribute is set to SQL_NULL_DESC or the handle originally allocated for the descriptor, an explicitly allocated APD handle that was previously associated with the statement handle is dissociated from it, and the statement handle reverts to the implicitly allocated APD handle. <p>
This attribute cannot be set to a descriptor handle that was implicitly allocated for another statement or to another descriptor handle that was implicitly set on the same statement; implicitly allocated descriptor handles cannot be associated with more than one statement or descriptor handle.</p>

The initial value of this attribute is the descriptor implicitly allocated when the statement was initially allocated. If the value of this attribute is set to SQL_NULL_DESC or the handle originally allocated for the descriptor, an explicitly allocated ARD handle that was previously associated with the statement handle is dissociated from it, and the statement handle reverts to the implicitly allocated ARD handle. <p>
This attribute cannot be set to a descriptor handle that was implicitly allocated for another statement or to another descriptor handle that was implicitly set on the same statement; implicitly allocated descriptor handles cannot be associated with more than one statement or descriptor handle.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=38%>SQL_ATTR_ASYNC_ENABLE<br>
(ODBC 1.0)</td>
<td width=62%>An SQLUINTEGER value that specifies whether a function called with the specified statement is executed asynchronously:<p>
SQL_ASYNC_ENABLE_OFF = Off (the default)<br>
SQL_ASYNC_ENABLE_ON = On</p>
<p>
Once a function has been called asynchronously, only the original function, <b>SQLCancel</b>, <b>SQLGetDiagField</b>, or <b>SQLGetDiagRec</b> can be called on the statement, and only the original function, <b>SQLAllocHandle </b>(with a HandleType of SQL_HANDLE_STMT), <b>SQLGetDiagField</b>, <b>SQLGetDiagRec</b>, or <b>SQLGetFunctions</b> can be called on the connection associated with the statement, until the original function returns a code other than SQL_STILL_EXECUTING. Any other function called on the statement or the connection associated with the statement returns SQL_ERROR with an SQLSTATE of HY010 (Function sequence error). Functions can be called on other statements. For more information, see “<a href="odch09pr_5wdq.htm">Asynchronous Execution</a>” in Chapter 9, “Executing Statements.”</p>
<p>
For drivers with statement level asynchronous execution support, the statement attribute SQL_ATTR_ASYNC_ENABLE may be set. Its initial value is the same as the value of the connection level attribute with the same name at the time the statement handle was allocated. </p>
<p>
For drivers with connection-level, asynchronous-execution support, the statement attribute SQL_ATTR_ASYNC_ENABLE is read-only. Its value is the same as the value of the connection level attribute with the same name at the time the statement handle was allocated. Calling <b>SQLSetStmtAttr</b> to set SQL_ATTR_ASYNC_ENABLE when the SQL_ASYNC_MODE <i>InfoType</i> returns SQL_AM_CONNECTION returns SQLSTATE HYC00 (Optional feature not implemented). (See <b>SQLSetConnectAttr</b> for more information.)</p>
<p>
In general, applications should execute functions asynchronously only on single-thread operating systems. On multithread operating systems, applications should execute functions on separate threads, rather than executing them asynchronously on the same thread. No functionality is lost if drivers that only operate on multithread operating systems do not need to support asynchronous execution.</p>

(ODBC 2.0)</td>
<td colspan=2 width=62%>An SQLUINTEGER value that specifies the cursor concurrency:<p>
SQL_CONCUR_READ_ONLY = Cursor is read-only. No updates are allowed.</p>

SQL_CONCUR_LOCK = Cursor uses the lowest level of locking sufficient to ensure that the row can be updated.</p>
<p>
SQL_CONCUR_ROWVER = Cursor uses optimistic concurrency control, comparing row versions such as SQLBase ROWID or Sybase TIMESTAMP.</p>
<p>
SQL_CONCUR_VALUES = Cursor uses optimistic concurrency control, comparing values.</p>
<p>
The default value for SQL_ATTR_CONCURRENCY is SQL_CONCUR_READ_ONLY.</p>
<p>
This attribute cannot be specified for an open cursor. For more information, see “<a href="odch14pr_0qlv.htm">Concurrency Types</a>” in Chapter 14, “Transactions.”</p>
<p>
If the SQL_ATTR_CURSOR_TYPE <i>Attribute</i> is changed to a type that does not support the current value of SQL_ATTR_CONCURRENCY, the value of SQL_ATTR_CONCURRENCY will be changed at execution time, and a warning issued when <b>SQLExecDirect</b> or <b>SQLPrepare</b> is called.</p>
<p>
If the driver supports the <b>SELECT FOR UPDATE</b> statement, and such a statement is executed while the value of SQL_ATTR_CONCURRENCY is set to SQL_CONCUR_READ_ONLY, an error will be returned. If the value of SQL_ATTR_CONCURRENCY is changed to a value that the driver supports for some value of SQL_ATTR_CURSOR_TYPE, but not for the current value of SQL_ATTR_CURSOR_TYPE, the value of SQL_ATTR_CURSOR_TYPE will be changed at execution time, and SQLSTATE 01S02 (Option value changed) is issued when <b>SQLExecDirect</b> or <b>SQLPrepare</b> is called.</p>
<p>
If the specified concurrency is not supported by the data source, the driver substitutes a different concurrency and returns SQLSTATE 01S02 (Option value changed). For SQL_CONCUR_VALUES, the driver substitutes SQL_CONCUR_ROWVER, and vice versa. For SQL_CONCUR_LOCK, the driver substitutes, in order, SQL_CONCUR_ROWVER or SQL_CONCUR_VALUES. The validity of the substituted value is not checked until execution time.</p>
<p>

SQL_UNSPECIFIED = It is unspecified what the cursor type is and whether cursors on the statement handle make visible the changes made to a result set by another cursor. Cursors on the statement handle may make visible none, some, or all such changes. This is the default.</p>
<p>
SQL_INSENSITIVE = All cursors on the statement handle show the result set without reflecting any changes made to it by any other cursor. Insensitive cursors are read-only. This corresponds to a static cursor, which has a concurrency that is read-only.</p>

If <i>ValuePtr</i> is less than the length of the available data, <b>SQLFetch</b> or <b>SQLGetData</b> truncates the data and returns SQL_SUCCESS. If <i>ValuePtr</i> is 0 (the default), the driver attempts to return all available data.<p>
If the specified length is less than the minimum amount of data that the data source can return, or greater than the maximum amount of data that the data source can return, the driver substitutes that value and returns SQLSTATE 01S02 (Option value changed).</p>

The value of this attribute can be set on an open cursor; however, the setting may not take effect immediately, in which case the driver will return SQLSTATE 01S02 (Option value changed), and reset the attribute to its original value.</p>
<p>
This attribute is intended to reduce network traffic and should only be supported when the data source (as opposed to the driver) in a multiple-tier driver can implement it.

This attribute is intended to reduce network traffic. Conceptually, it is applied when the result set is created and limits the result set to the first <i>ValuePtr</i> rows. If the number of rows in the result set is greater than <i>ValuePtr</i>, the result set is truncated. </p>
<p>
SQL_ATTR_MAX_ROWS applies to all result sets on the <i>Statement</i>, including those returned by catalog functions. SQL_ATTR_MAX_ROWS establishes a maximum for the value of the cursor row count.</p>
<p>
A driver should not emulate SQL_ATTR_MAX_ROWS behavior for <b>SQLFetch</b> or <b>SQLFetchScroll</b> (if result set size limitations cannot be implemented at the data source) if it cannot guarantee that SQL_ATTR_MAX_ROWS will be implemented properly.</p>

If SQL_TRUE, the string argument of catalog functions are treated as identifiers. The case is not significant. For non-delimited strings, the driver removes any trailing spaces, and the string is folded to uppercase. For delimited strings, the driver removes any leading or trailing spaces, and takes whatever is between the delimiters literally. If one of these arguments is set to a null pointer, the function returns SQL_ERROR and SQLSTATE HY009 (Invalid use of null pointer). </p>
<p>
If SQL_FALSE, the string arguments of catalog functions are not treated as identifiers. The case is significant. They can either contain a string search pattern or not, depending on the argument.</p>

It is set to null by default.<p>
The bind offset is always added directly to the SQL_DESC_DATA_PTR, SQL_DESC_INDICATOR_PTR, and SQL_DESC_OCTET_LENGTH_PTR fields.

(ODBC 2.0)</td>
<td colspan=2 width=62%>An SQLUINTEGER value that specifies whether drivers that simulate positioned update and delete statements guarantee that such statements affect only one single row.<p>
To simulate positioned update and delete statements, most drivers construct a searched <b>UPDATE</b> or <b>DELETE</b> statement containing a <b>WHERE</b> clause that specifies the value of each column in the current row. Unless these columns make up a unique key, such a statement may affect more than one row.</p>
<p>
To guarantee that such statements affect only one row, the driver determines the columns in a unique key and adds these columns to the result set. If an application guarantees that the columns in the result set make up a unique key, the driver is not required to do so. This may reduce execution time.</p>
<p>
SQL_SC_NON_UNIQUE = The driver does not guarantee that simulated positioned update or delete statements will affect only one row; it is the application’s responsibility to do so. If a statement affects more than one row, <b>SQLExecute</b>, <b>SQLExecDirect</b>, or <b>SQLSetPos</b> returns SQLSTATE 01001 (Cursor operation conflict).</p>
<p>
SQL_SC_TRY_UNIQUE = The driver attempts to guarantee that simulated positioned update or delete statements affect only one row. The driver always executes such statements, even if they might affect more than one row, such as when there is no unique key. If a statement affects more than one row, <b>SQLExecute</b>, <b>SQLExecDirect</b>, or <b>SQLSetPos</b> returns SQLSTATE 01001 (Cursor operation conflict).</p>
<p>
SQL_SC_UNIQUE = The driver guarantees that simulated positioned update or delete statements affect only one row. If the driver cannot guarantee this for a given statement, <b>SQLExecDirect</b> or <b>SQLPrepare</b> returns an error.</p>
<p>
If the data source provides native SQL support for positioned update and delete statements, and the driver does not simulate cursors, SQL_SUCCESS is returned when SQL_SC_UNIQUE is requested for SQL_SIMULATE_CURSOR. SQL_SUCCESS_WITH_INFO is returned if SQL_SC_TRY_UNIQUE or SQL_SC_NON_UNIQUE is requested. If the data source provides the SQL_SC_TRY_UNIQUE level of support, and the driver does not, SQL_SUCCESS is returned for SQL_SC_TRY_UNIQUE and SQL_SUCCESS_WITH_INFO is returned for SQL_SC_NON_UNIQUE.</p>

If the specified cursor simulation type is not supported by the data source, the driver substitutes a different simulation type and returns SQLSTATE 01S02 (Option value changed). For SQL_SC_UNIQUE, the driver substitutes, in order, SQL_SC_TRY_UNIQUE or SQL_SC_NON_UNIQUE. For SQL_SC_TRY_UNIQUE, the driver substitutes SQL_SC_NON_UNIQUE.</p>

<p>
SQL_UB_VARIABLE = An application will use bookmarks with a cursor, and the driver will provide variable-length bookmarks if they are supported. SQL_UB_FIXED is deprecated in ODBC 3.x. ODBC 3.x applications should always use variable-length bookmarks, even when working with ODBC 2.<i>x</i> drivers (which supported only 4-byte, fixed-length bookmarks). This is because a fixed-length bookmark is just a special case of a variable-length bookmark. When working with an ODBC 2.<i>x</i> driver, the Driver Manager maps SQL_UB_VARIABLE to SQL_UB_FIXED.</p>
<p>
To use bookmarks with a cursor, the application must specify this attribute with the SQL_UB_VARIABLE value before opening the cursor.</p>
