<h3><a name="odbcmixed_cursors"></a>Mixed Cursors</h3>
<p>
A mixed cursor is a combination of a keyset-driven cursor and a dynamic cursor. It is used when the result set is too large to reasonably save keys for the entire result set. Mixed cursors are implemented by creating a keyset that is smaller than the entire result set but larger than the rowset.</p>
<p>
As long as the application scrolls within the keyset, the behavior is keyset-driven. When the application scrolls outside the keyset, the behavior is dynamic: The cursor fetches the requested rows and creates a new keyset. Note that after the new keyset is created, the behavior reverts to keyset-driven within that keyset.</p>
<p>
For example, suppose a result set has 1,000 rows and uses a mixed cursor with a keyset size of 100 and a rowset size of 10. When the first rowset is fetched, the cursor creates a keyset consisting of the keys for the first 100 rows. It then returns the first 10 rows, as requested.</p>
<p>
Now suppose another application deletes rows 11 and 101. If the cursor attempts to retrieve row 11, it will encounter a hole because it has a key for this row but no row exists; this is keyset-driven behavior. If the cursor attempts to retrieve row 101, the cursor will not detect that the row is missing because it does not have a key for the row. Instead, it will retrieve what was previously row 102. This is dynamic cursor behavior.</p>
<p>
A mixed cursor is equivalent to a keyset-driven cursor when the keyset size is equal to the result set size. A mixed cursor is equivalent to a dynamic cursor when the keyset size is equal to 1.</p>
