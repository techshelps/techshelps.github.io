<p class=label>
<b>Conformance</b></p>
<p>
Version Introduced:ODBC 1.0<br>
Standards Compliance:Deprecated</p>
<p class=label>
<b>Summary</b></p>
<p>
<b>SQLExtendedFetch</b> fetches the specified rowset of data from the result set and returns data for all bound columns. Rowsets can be specified at an absolute or relative position or by bookmark.</p>
<p class=indent>
<B><b>Note</b></B> In ODBC 3.x, <b>SQLExtendedFetch</b> has been replaced by <b>SQLFetchScroll</b>. ODBC 3.x applications should not call <b>SQLExtendedFetch</b>; instead they should call <b>SQLFetchScroll</b>. The Driver Manager maps <b>SQLFetchScroll</b> to <b>SQLExtendedFetch</b> when working with an ODBC 2.<i>x</i> driver. ODBC 3.x drivers should support <b>SQLExtendedFetch</b> if they want to work with ODBC 2<i>.x</i> applications that call it. For more information, see “Comments” and “<a href="odappgpr_5drt.htm">Block Cursors, Scrollable Cursors, and Backward Compatibility</a>” in Appendix G, “Driver Guidelines for Backward Compatibility.”</p>
<p class=label>
<b>Syntax</b></p>
<p>
SQLRETURN <b>SQLExtendedFetch</b>(<br>
SQLHSTMT<i>StatementHandle</i>,<br>
SQLUSMALLINT<i>FetchOrientation</i>,<br>
SQLINTEGER<i>FetchOffset</i>,<br>
SQLUINTEGER *<i>RowCountPtr</i>,<br>
SQLUSMALLINT *<i>RowStatusArray</i>);</p>
<p class=label>
<b>Arguments</b></p>
<p class=dt>
<i>StatementHandle</i></p>
<p class=indent>
[Input]<br>
Statement handle.</p>
<p class=dt>
<i>FetchOrientation</i></p>
<p class=indent>
[Input]<br>
Type of fetch. This is the same as <i>FetchOrientation</i> in <b>SQLFetchScroll</b>.</p>
<p class=dt>
<i>FetchOffset</i></p>
<p class=indent>
[Input]<br>
Number of the row to fetch. This is the same as <i>FetchOffset</i> in <b>SQLFetchScroll</b> with one exception. When <i>FetchOrientation</i> is SQL_FETCH_BOOKMARK, <i>FetchOffset</i> is a fixed-length bookmark, not an offset from a bookmark. In other words, <b>SQLExtendedFetch</b> retrieves the bookmark from this argument, not the SQL_ATTR_FETCH_BOOKMARK_PTR statement attribute. It does not support variable-length bookmarks and does not support fetching a rowset at an offset (other than 0) from a bookmark.</p>
<p class=dt>
<i>RowCountPtr</i></p>
<p class=indent>
[Output]<br>
Pointer to a buffer in which to return the number of rows actually fetched. This buffer is used in the same manner as the buffer specified by the SQL_ATTR_ROWS_FETCHED_PTR statement attribute. This buffer is used only by <b>SQLExtendedFetch</b>. It is not used by <b>SQLFetch</b> or <b>SQLFetchScroll</b>.</p>
<p class=dt>
<i>RowStatusArray</i></p>
<p class=indent>
[Output]<br>
Pointer to an array in which to return the status of each row. This array is used in the same manner as the array specified by the SQL_ATTR_ROW_STATUS_PTR statement attribute.</p>
<p class=tl>
However, the address of this array is not stored in the SQL_DESC_STATUS_ARRAY_PTR field in the IRD. Furthermore, this array is used only by <b>SQLExtendedFetch</b> and by <b>SQLBulkOperations</b> with an <i>Operation</i> of SQL_ADD or <b>SQLSetPos</b> when it is called after <b>SQLExtendedFetch</b>. It is not used by <b>SQLFetch</b> or <b>SQLFetchScroll</b> and it is not used by <b>SQLBulkOperations</b> or <b>SQLSetPos</b> when they are called after <b>SQLFetch</b> or <b>SQLFetchScroll</b>. It is also not used when <b>SQLBulkOperations</b> with an <i>Operation</i> of SQL_ADD is called before any fetch function is called. In other words, it is used only in statement state S7. It is not used in statement states S5 or S6. For more information, see “<a href="odappbpr_99f7.htm">Statement Transitions</a>” in Appendix B, “ODBC State Transition Tables.”</P><p class=tl>
Applications should provide a valid pointer in the <i>RowStatusArray</i> argument; if not, the behavior of <b>SQLExtendedFetch</b> and the behavior of calls to <b>SQLBulkOperations</b> or <b>SQLSetPos</b> after a cursor has been positioned by <b>SQLExtendedFetch</b> are undefined.</P><p class=label>
<b>Returns</b></p>
<p>
SQL_SUCCESS, SQL_SUCCESS_WITH_INFO, SQL_NO_DATA, SQL_STILL_EXECUTING, SQL_ERROR, or SQL_INVALID_HANDLE.</p>
<p class=label>
<b>Diagnostics</b></p>
<p>
When <b>SQLExtendedFetch</b> returns either SQL_ERROR or SQL_SUCCESS_WITH_INFO, an associated SQLSTATE value can be obtained by calling <b>SQLError</b>. The following table lists the SQLSTATE values commonly returned by <b>SQLExtendedFetch</b> and explains each one in the context of this function; the notation “(DM)” precedes the descriptions of SQLSTATEs returned by the Driver Manager. The return code associated with each SQLSTATE value is SQL_ERROR, unless noted otherwise. If an error occurs on a single column, <b>SQLGetDiagField</b> can be called with a <i>DiagIdentifier</i> of SQL_DIAG_COLUMN_NUMBER to determine the column the error occurred on; and <b>SQLGetDiagField</b> can be called with a <i>DiagIdentifier</i> of SQL_DIAG_ROW_NUMBER to determine the row containing that column.</p>

<b>Comments</b></p>
<p>
The behavior of <b>SQLExtendedFetch</b> is identical to that of <b>SQLFetchScroll</b> with the following exceptions:
<ul type=disc>
<li>
<b>SQLExtendedFetch</b> and <b>SQLFetchScroll</b> use different methods to return the number of rows fetched. <b>SQLExtendedFetch</b> returns the number of rows fetched in <i>*RowCountPtr</i>; <b>SQLFetchScroll</b> returns the number of rows fetched directly to the buffer pointed to by SQL_ATTR_ROWS_FETCHED_PTR. For more information, see the <i>RowCountPtr</i> argument.<br><br></li>
<li>
<b>SQLExtendedFetch</b> and <b>SQLFetchScroll</b> return the status of each row in different arrays. For more information, see the <i>RowStatusArray</i> argument.<br><br></li>
<li>
<b>SQLExtendedFetch</b> and <b>SQLFetchScroll</b> use different methods to retrieve the bookmark when <i>FetchOrientation</i> is SQL_FETCH_BOOKMARK. <b>SQLExtendedFetch</b> does not support variable-length bookmarks or fetching rowsets at an offset other than 0 from a bookmark. For more information, see the <i>FetchOffset</i> argument.<br><br></li>
<li>
<b>SQLExtendedFetch</b> and <b>SQLFetchScroll</b> use different rowset sizes. <b>SQLExtendedFetch</b> uses the value of the SQL_ROWSET_SIZE statement attribute and <b>SQLFetchScroll</b> uses the value of the SQL_ATTR_ROW_ARRAY_SIZE statement attribute.<br><br></li>
<li>
<b>SQLExtendedFetch</b> has slightly different error handling semantics than <b>SQLFetchScroll</b>. For more information, see “Error Handling” in the “Comments” section of <a href="odch21epr_5m24.htm">SQLFetchScroll</a>.<br><br></li>
<li>
<b>SQLExtendedFetch</b> does not support binding offsets (the SQL_ATTR_ROW_BIND_OFFSET_PTR statement attribute).<br><br></li>
<li>
Calls to <b>SQLExtendedFetch</b> cannot be mixed with calls to <b>SQLFetch</b> or <b>SQLFetchScroll</b> and, if <b>SQLBulkOperations</b> is called before any fetch function is called, <b>SQLExtendedFetch</b> cannot be called until the cursor is closed and reopened. That is, <b>SQLExtendedFetch</b> can only be called in statement state S7. For more information, see “<a href="odappbpr_99f7.htm">Statement Transitions</a>” in Appendix B, “ODBC State Transition Tables.”</li>
</ul>
<p>
When an application calls <b>SQLFetchScroll</b> while using an ODBC 2<i>.x</i> driver, the Driver Manager maps this call to <b>SQLExtendedFetch</b>. For more information, see “SQLFetchScroll and ODBC 2<i>.x</i> Drivers” in <a href="odch21epr_5m24.htm">SQLFetchScroll</a>.</p>
<p>
In ODBC 2.<i>x</i>, <b>SQLExtendedFetch</b> was called to fetch multiple rows, and <b>SQLFetch</b> was called to fetch a single row. In ODBC 3.x, on the other hand, <b>SQLFetch</b> can be called to fetch multiple rows.</p>
