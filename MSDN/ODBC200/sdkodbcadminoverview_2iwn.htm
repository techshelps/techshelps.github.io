<h1><a name="odbcconnection_pooling_overview"></a><sup></sup>Connection Pooling</h1>
<p>
Connection pooling enables an application to use a connection from a pool of connections that do not need to be re-established for each use. You can use the <b>Connection Pooling </b>tab in the ODBC Administrator to alter the connection retry wait time and connection timeout period for any selected driver. You can also use it to enable and disable performance monitoring.</p>
<p>
When the ODBC Driver Manager detects that a database server is unavailable, it waits for a certain amount of time before it attempts to connect again. You can adjust the waiting time by setting the Retry Wait Time value in seconds in the dialog box for a specific driver. You can set the connection timeout period in the same way.</p>
<p>
For more information about connection pooling, see “<a href="odch06pr_2dev.htm">Connection Pooling</a>” in Chapter 6 of the <i>ODBC Programmer’s Reference</i>.</p>
<h3>Performance Monitoring</h3>
<p>
Performance monitoring tracks connection performance by recording a variety of statistics. These statistics can be customized by the developer to include such items as:
<ul type=disc>
<li>
The number of connections made to data sources per second.<br><br></li>
<li>
The number of disconnections made from data sources per second.<br><br></li>
<li>
The number of connections to the pool per second.<br><br></li>
<li>
The number of disconnections from the pool per second.<br><br></li>
<li>
Connections currently active.<br><br></li>
<li>
The current number of connections being used by applications.<br><br></li>
<li>
Connections currently free.<br><br></li>
<li>
The current number of connections available for connection requests.</li>
</ul>
<p>
You must specify your own monitoring parameters. Samples for performance monitoring have been included with this version of ODBC.</p>
