<h1><a name="odbcallocating_the_environment_handle"></a>Allocating the Environment Handle</h1>
<p>
The first task for any ODBC application is to load the Driver Manager; how this is done is operating-system dependent. For example, on a computer running Windows NT Server, Windows NT Workstation, or Windows 95, the application either links to the Driver Manager library or calls LoadLibrary to load the Driver Manager DLL.</p>
<p>
The next task, which must be done before an application can call any other ODBC function, is to initialize the ODBC environment and allocate an environment handle. To do this:
<ol>
<li>
The application declares a variable of type SQLHENV. It then calls <b>SQLAllocHandle</b> and passes the address of this variable and the SQL_HANDLE_ENV option. For example:<pre><code>SQLHENV henv1;

SQLAllocHandle(SQL_HANDLE_ENV, SQL_NULL_HANDLE, &amp;henv1);
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
The Driver Manager allocates a structure in which to store information about the environment, and returns the environment handle in the variable.</li>
</ol>
<p>
The Driver Manager does not call <b>SQLAllocHandle</b> in the driver at this time because it does not know which driver to call. It delays calling <b>SQLAllocHandle</b> in the driver until the application calls a function to connect to a data source. For more information, see “<a href="odch06pr_06r7.htm">Driver Manager’s Role in the Connection Process</a>,” later in this chapter.</p>
<p>
When the application has finished using ODBC, it frees the environment handle with <b>SQLFreeHandle</b>. After freeing the environment, it is an application programming error to use the environment’s handle in a call to an ODBC function; doing so has undefined but probably fatal consequences.</p>
<p>
When <b>SQLFreeHandle</b> is called, the driver releases the structure used to store information about the environment. Note that <b>SQLFreeHandle</b> cannot be called for an environment handle until after all connection handles on that environment handle have been freed.</p>
<p>
For more information about the environment handle, see “<a href="odch04pr_9ktv.htm">Environment Handles</a>” in Chapter 4, “ODBC Fundamentals.”</p>
