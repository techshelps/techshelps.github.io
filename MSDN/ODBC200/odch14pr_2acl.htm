<h3><a name="odbcauto_commit_mode"></a>Auto-Commit Mode</h3>
<p>
<i>In auto-commit mode,</i> every database operation is a transaction that is committed when performed. This mode is suitable for many real-world transactions that consist of a single SQL statement. It is unnecessary to delimit or specify completion of these transactions. In databases without transaction support, auto-commit mode is the only supported mode. In such databases, statements are committed when they are executed and there is no way to roll them back; they are therefore always in auto-commit mode.</p>
<p>
If the underlying DBMS does not support auto-commit mode transactions, the driver can emulate them by manually committing each SQL statement as it is executed.</p>
<p>
If a batch of SQL statements is executed in auto-commit mode, it is data source&nbsp;–&nbsp;specific when the statements in the batch are committed. They can be committed as they are executed or as a whole after the entire batch has been executed. Some data sources may support both of these behaviors and may provide a way of selecting one or the others. In particular, if an error occurs in the middle of the batch, it is data source&nbsp;–&nbsp;specific whether the already-executed statements are committed or rolled back. Thus, interoperable applications that use batches and require them to be committed or rolled back as a whole should only execute batches in manual-commit mode.</p>
