<h2><a name="odbcdeleting_rows_in_the_rowset_with_sqlsetpos"></a>Deleting Rows in the Rowset with SQLSetPos</h2>
<p>
The delete operation of <b>SQLSetPos</b> makes the data source delete one or more selected rows of a table. To delete rows with <b>SQLSetPos</b>, the application calls <b>SQLSetPos</b> with <i>Operation</i> set to SQL_DELETE and <i>RowNumber</i> set to the number of the row to delete. If <i>RowNumber</i> is 0, all rows in the rowset are deleted. </p>
<p>
After <b>SQLSetPos</b> returns, the deleted row is the current row, and its status is SQL_ROW_DELETED. The row cannot be used in any further positioned operations, such as calls to <b>SQLGetData</b> or <b>SQLSetPos</b>.</p>
<p>
When deleting all rows of the rowset (<i>RowNumber</i> is equal to 0), the application can prevent the driver from deleting certain rows by using the row operation array, in the same way as for the update operation of <b>SQLSetPos</b> (see “<a href="odch12pr_8bar.htm">Updating Rows in the Rowset with SQLSetPos</a>” earlier in this chapter).</p>
<p>
Every row that is deleted should be a row that exists in the result set. If the application buffers were filled by fetching and if a row status array has been maintained, its values at each of these row positions should not be SQL_ROW_DELETED, SQL_ROW_ERROR, or SQL_ROW_NOROW.</p>
