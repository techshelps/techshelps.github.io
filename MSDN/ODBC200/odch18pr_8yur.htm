<h1><a name="odbcinstalling_odbc_components"></a>Overview of Installing ODBC Components</h1>
<p>
This chapter describes how ODBC components are installed and removed. Because driver developers always install an ODBC component (their driver), they need to read this chapter. Application developers need to read this chapter only if they will ship ODBC components with their application. ODBC components are defined to be the Driver Manager, drivers, translators, the installer DLL, the cursor library, and any related files. For the purposes of this chapter, ODBC applications are not considered to be ODBC components.</p>
<p class=indent>
<B><b>Note&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</b></B>This chapter is specific to Windows platforms. How ODBC components are installed on other platforms is platform-specific.</p>
<p>
ODBC components are installed and removed on a component-by-component basis, not a file-by-file basis. For example, if a translator consists of the translator itself and a number of data files, these files are installed and removed as a group; they must not be installed and removed on a file-by-file basis. The reason for this is to make sure that only complete components exist on the system.</p>
<p>
For purposes of installing and removing components, the following are defined to be ODBC components:
<ul type=disc>
<li>
<b>Core components</b>. The Driver Manager, cursor library, installer DLL, and any other related files make up the core components and must be installed and removed as a group.<br><br></li>
<li>
<b>Drivers</b>. Each driver is a separate component.<br><br></li>
<li>
<b>Translators</b>. Each translator is a separate component.</li>
</ul>
