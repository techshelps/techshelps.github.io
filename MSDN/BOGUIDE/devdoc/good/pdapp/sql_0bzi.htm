<p>
Microsoft SQL Server version 6.5 enhances present cursor functionality by supporting updates on tables that do not have a unique index and cursors that automatically close when a transaction commits. SQL Server 6.5 allows Data Definition Language statements (for example, CREATE and DROP statements) within a transaction. The DBCC DBREINDEX statement allows one or more indexes for a table to be rebuilt.</p>
<p>
Many improvements in SQL Server 6.5 are designed to ease the development process and provide you with greater programming options. Some of these improvements are: 
<ul>
<li>
A 32-bit DB-Library for Visual Basic OLE custom control.</li>
<li>
Enhancements to DB-Library for C including support for enlisting in MS DTC transactions using the new <b>dbenlisttrans</b> and <b>dbenlistxatrans</b> functions, and the ability to open cursors on stored procedures using dynamic parameters.</li>
<li>
Additional Open Data Services (ODS) functionality including bound session support by using the new <b>srv_getbindtoken</b> function.</li>
<li>
Embedded SQL for C functionality including ANSI compatibility.</li>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<p>
SQL Server provides support for extended stored procedures, allowing SQL Server to dynamically load and execute a function within a dynamic-link library (DLL) in a manner similar to that of a stored procedure. Actions outside of SQL Server can be triggered, and external information can be returned to SQL Server for manipulation.</p>
<p>
SQL Server 6.5 now supports distributed, atomic transactions between two or more SQL Server systems. SQL Server 6.5 also adds new Transact-SQL capabilities such as CUBE and ROLLUP operators, row-level locking during certain transactions, and bound connections. </p>
<p>
For a complete description of the enhancements contained in Microsoft SQL Server version 6.5, see the SQL Server documentation.</p>
