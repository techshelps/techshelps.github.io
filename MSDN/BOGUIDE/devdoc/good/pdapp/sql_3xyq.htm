<p>
Microsoft® SQL Server is a powerful Structured Query Language (SQL) database server. With local area network (LAN) software, SQL Server allows clients running the Microsoft® Windows NT®, Windows® 3.<i>x</i>, Windows 95, or MS-DOS® operating systems to access its services. Developers can write applications for SQL Server by programming with the Microsoft Open Database Connectivity (ODBC) call-level application programming interface (API). ODBC enables Windows-based, Windows NT-based, and Windows 95-based applications to access multiple data sources, including a wide range of relational databases such as SQL Server and local indexed sequential access method (ISAM) data. SQL Server also supports the proprietary Microsoft DB-Library for C and Microsoft DB-Library for Visual Basic APIs. In most cases, ODBC and DB-Library are equally useful for developing SQL Server client applications, with the following distinctions. ODBC enables applications to access more data sources. DB-Library provides support for MS-DOS, and some specialized support for SQL Server, such as bulk copy.</p>
<p>
Microsoft Open Data Services (ODS) is a server-based API that developers can use to create effective server applications. Applications created with ODS can interact with SQL Server database clients and servers, and with any other elements of a network environment that the developer defines.</p>
<p>
Additionally, developers can use Transact-SQL to work with SQL Server data. Transact-SQL provides statements for creating and manipulating database objects, and for inserting, updating, and selecting data. </p>
<p>
The following sections present an overview of the Microsoft SQL Server programming tools and highlight development issues that are important to create effective SQL Server applications.</p>
