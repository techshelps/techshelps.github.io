<p>
Microsoft Systems Management Server (SMS) provides a command-line utility, SMSADDIN.EXE, to assist ISVs with registering their applications for launching from the SMS Administrator console. </p>
<p>
You use SMSADDIN.EXE interactively to create and test the application's registry data, then save that data in a Add-in Tool Definition (.ATD) file. When used interactively, SMSADDIN.EXE displays a window in which you can enter all the required registry information.</p>
<p>
After creating the .ATD file, you modify the application's setup program to run SMSADDIN.EXE in unattended mode, passing the .ATD file. When run during setup, SMSADDIN.EXE checks the syntax of the .ATD file and writes the registry silently.</p>
<p>
You can also use SMSADDIN.EXE to unregister applications.</p>
<p>
SMS also provides sample code that adds or deletes applications the same way as SMSADDIN.EXE. ISVs can build this code into their setup programs as an alternative to running SMSADDIN.EXE from setup.</p>
