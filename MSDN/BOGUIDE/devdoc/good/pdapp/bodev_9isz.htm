<h1><a name="_bkopr_programming_requirements_and_recommendations"></a>Programming Requirements and Recommendations</h1>
<p>
This section presents an overview of how to design applications that cleanly integrate with the Microsoft® BackOffice® components and perform efficiently in a Microsoft® Windows® client/server environment. The requirements and recommendations presented in this section enable you to ensure that your application takes advantage of the features provided by the BackOffice components.</p>
<p>
<b>Note</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;You are not required to implement all of these recommendations in your application to obtain the Designed for Microsoft BackOffice logo (located at <A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/backoffice/designed">http://www.microsoft.com/backoffice/designed</A> on the Internet); however, it is suggested that you seriously consider using the guidelines, which may become requirements in the future.</p>
<p>
<b>Server Application Requirements and Recommendations</b></p>
<p>
The <i>requirements</i> for your server application are: 
<ul>
<li>
To run as a Microsoft® Windows NT® Server service.</li>
<li>
To be network-independent.</li>
<li>
To support the Windows NT Unified Logon.</li>
<li>
To be installable using Microsoft® Systems Management Server (SMS).</li>
</ul>
<p>
The <i>recommendations</i> for your application are: 
<ul>
<li>
To support Automation (formerly known as OLE Automation).</li>
<li>
To support remote administration.</li>
<li>
To support long file names and the universal naming convention (UNC).</li>
<li>
To integrate with Microsoft® Internet Information Server.</li>
<li>
To support other recommendations such as messaging server applications, Mailbox-Agent objects, Mailbox-Gateway objects, and Open Data Services (ODS).</li>
</ul>
<p>
<b>Client Requirements and Recommendations</b></p>
<p>
The <i>requirements</i> for your client application are:
<ul>
<li>
To execute as a 16-bit Windows operating system interface-based client.</li>
<li>
To provide client/server connectivity (such as correct messaging, SQL Server, or SNA APIs and functions).</li>
<li>
To be installable through SMS.</li>
</ul>
<p>
The <i>recommendations</i> for a client application are:
<ul>
<li>
To be developed as a 32-bit Windows operating system interface-based client.</li>
<li>
To address MAPI design issues. </li>
<li>
To address database connection issues, such as using ODBC/DRDA drivers to access host data; using stored triggers, procedures, and cursors; using Open Data Services (ODS); using SQL Distributed Management Objects (SQL-DMOs); and using integrated security concepts with SQL Server.</li>
</ul>
