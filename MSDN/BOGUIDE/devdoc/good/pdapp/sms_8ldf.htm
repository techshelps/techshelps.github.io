<h2><a name="_bkopr_resource_only_dlls_for_custom_graphics"></a>Resource-only DLLs for Custom Graphics</h2>
<p>
Using resource-only DLLs, you can control the graphics displayed by the Microsoft Systems Management Server (SMS) Administrator for architectures and objects within the Sites, Machine Groups, and Query Results windows. You can also control the graphics for the properties within machine properties windows. The two types of graphics are architecture bitmaps and machine property icons.</p>
<p>
<b>Architecture Bitmaps</b></p>
<p>
For each object of each architecture, the SMS Administrator displays a 16-by-16-pixel bitmap that represents that specific object within that specific architecture. These architecture bitmaps are displayed in the Sites, Machine Groups, and Query Results windows.</p>
<p>
Using a resource-only DLL, you can override the default graphics for existing architectures and objects or add custom graphics for new types of architectures or objects. If a new architecture or new type of object is added to the SMS inventory and no resource-only DLL is provided, the default graphic is displayed.</p>
<p>
A mask bitmap explicitly specifies the pixels to display with the highlight color (if the object is selected) or the background window color (if the object is not selected). The SMS system generates a mask bitmap for each architecture bitmap. However, you can also specify a mask bitmap. The mask bitmap is white where you want the highlight color or background window color to show through the bitmap, and black where you want the bitmap to show.</p>
<p>
<b>Machine Property Icons</b></p>
<p>
Machine property windows are used to display the properties of an inventoried object. The properties are organized into groups, and the groups contain attributes. The user can view the attributes by group by selecting the group to view in the Properties pane; the attributes for the group are then displayed in the right pane. Each group has a graphic that represents that particular group within that particular architecture.</p>
<p>
Using a resource-only DLL, you can override the default graphics for existing groups or add custom graphics for new types of groups. If a new group is added to the SMS inventory and no resource-only DLL is provided, the default graphic is displayed.</p>
