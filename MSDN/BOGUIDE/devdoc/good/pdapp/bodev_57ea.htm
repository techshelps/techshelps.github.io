</object><a href=JavaScript:alink_1.Click()>Microsoft Systems Management Server (SMS)</a> is a centralized management tool that allows you to monitor, administer, and control personal computers and servers throughout your entire corporate network. It has four primary functions:
<ul>
<li>
Hardware and software inventory</li>
<li>
Automated software distribution and installation</li>
<li>
Remote systems troubleshooting and control</li>
<li>
Network application management</li>
</ul>
<p>
Using the Microsoft® Systems Management Server component of the Platform SDK you can develop applications that can access hardware and software inventory throughout your network and show you what is located where. You can centrally manage, install, and control applications running on desktops and servers by accessing software distribution and installation information.</p>
<p>
By creating and customizing SMS inventory, administrator, and network monitor extensions, you can identify network characteristics and uniquely define user interfaces. You can even remotely control the mouse, screen, or keyboard of any personal computer running the Microsoft MS-DOS or Windows operating system. </p>
<p>
Improvements in Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.2 provide a new ISV application launching facility, support for local settings and localized servers, and a faster, multithreaded dataloader. Windows NT Remote Control fully conforms to the Windows NT Security Model and WinSock is now a supported remote control protocol. Systems Management Server 1.2 also supports SNMP trap forwarding and receiving. In addition, inventory now runs as a service on Windows NT clients.</p>
<p>
By taking advantage of the functionality of SMS through the Systems Management Server component of the Platform SDK, you can develop applications that completely manage and administer all aspects of your network.</p>
