<h2><a name="_bkopr_lua_concepts"></a>LUA Concepts</h2>
<p>
The Windows LUA for Microsoft SNA Server provides one common API to port applications from various operating environments to Microsoft Windows NT and Windows version 3.<i>x</i>. The LUA verbs (both Request Unit Interface [RUI] and Session Level Interface [SLI]), routines, and information contained in the Microsoft SNA Server SDK represent an evolving Windows LUA that is based on IBM ES for OS/2 version 1.0. The SDK also includes a set of Windows enhancements for application development.</p>
<p>
An application accesses the LUA through either the RUI or SLI verbs and routines. Each verb, defined by a structure called the verb control block (VCB), supplies parameters to the LUA, which performs the desired function and returns parameters to the application.</p>
<p>
By design, the LUA is asynchronous and uses semaphores for notification messages. While semaphores work extremely well for the Windows NT and OS/2 systems, the Windows enhancements built into the Windows LUA also allow for asynchronous support for Windows version 3<i>.x</i>-based applications in the LUA interface. The Windows LUA provides the following entry points for both RUI and SLI verbs: <b>RUI</b>, <b>SLI</b>, <b>WinRUI</b>, and <b>WinSLI</b>. <b>WinRUI</b> and <b>WinSLI</b> provide asynchronous message notification for all Windows-based RUI and SLI verbs, while <b>RUI</b> and <b>SLI</b> provide support for event notification. Windows 3.<i>x</i>-based applications use <b>WinRUI</b> and <b>WinSLI</b> for asynchronous message notification.</p>
<p>
The only Windows extensions required for the Windows LUA are for initialization (<b>WinRUIStartup </b>or<b> WinSLIStartup</b>) and termination (<b>WinRUICleanup </b>or<b> WinSLICleanup</b>) purposes. Depending on your application, other Windows extensions may be useful to you, but are not required. </p>
<p>
Several LUA calls and Windows enhancements are of particular importance and should be reviewed before using Microsoft SNA Server:
<ul>
<li>
<b>WinRUI/WinSLI</b>, which provide asynchronous notification for all Windows-based RUI and SLI verbs.</li>
<li>
<b>WinRUIStartup/WinSLIStartup</b>,<b> </b>which allow an application to specify the version of the Windows LUA required and to retrieve details about the specific LUA implementation.</li>
<li>
<b>WinRUICleanup/WinSLICleanup</b>,<b> </b>which terminate and deregister an application from a Windows LUA implementation.</li>
<li>
 <b>RUI/SLI</b>,<b> </b>which provide event notification for all RUI and SLI verbs.</li>
</ul>
