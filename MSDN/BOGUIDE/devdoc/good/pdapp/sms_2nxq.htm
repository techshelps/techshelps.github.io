<h2><a name="_bkopr_overview_of_installation"></a>Overview of Installation</h2>
<p>
The installation of software in the Microsoft Systems Management Server (SMS) environment starts with the collection of inventory information from computers throughout the organization. This hardware and software inventory information is stored in the SMS database and used to plan and control the installation process. </p>
<p>
SMS distributes software throughout an organization in the form of packages. These packages define the components to be installed, the supported platforms, and various configuration options for the software.</p>
<p>
SMS installs software by using jobs that target specific sets of computers and define the mechanics of the distribution through the SMS hierarchy. A job defines a set of computers called distribution servers, which act as staging points in the hierarchy for packages. After a package is present on the distribution servers, the job is sent as a control file to the target clients, where it is executed by a component of the SMS client code called the Package Command Manager (PCM).</p>

<h5><img src="../../images/wedge.gif" border=0>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a name="_bkopr_to_install_software_in_an_sms_environment_use_the_following_general_procedure"></a>To install software in an SMS environment, use the following general procedure</h5>
<ol>
<li>
Create a setup or installation program.</li>
<li>
Create a PDF.</li>
<li>
Create a package directory.</li>
<li>
Import the software package into the SMS environment.</li>
<li>
Use an SMS job to install the package.</li>
<li>
Write a package command status MIF file in the Windows directory.</li>
</ol>
<p>
The same rules apply when maintaining packages. </p>
<p>
Removing software requires a deinstallation program, which can be a command-line switch on your main setup program. A package command status MIF file must also be written in the Windows directory.</p>
