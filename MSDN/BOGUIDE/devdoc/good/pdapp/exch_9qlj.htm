<h3><a name="_bkopr_about_backboning"></a>About Backboning</h3>
<p>
Backboning is the process of transmitting messages between two similar messaging systems using an intermediate system of a different type. The goal of backboning is to send messages between Microsoft Exchange Server sites in different organizations as easily as you do between two users at the same site. Because of the necessity of integrating different messaging systems, backboning is an important feature that should be offered by all Microsoft Exchange Server gateway applications. </p>
