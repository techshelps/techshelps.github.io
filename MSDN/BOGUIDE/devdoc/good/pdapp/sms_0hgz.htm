<h2><a name="_bkopr_about_filters_and_tokens"></a>About Filters and Tokens</h2>
<p>
Filters define the criteria used to select the objects that are retrieved from a Microsoft Systems Management Server (SMS) site database. Functionally, one or more filters can be set on a particular container before the container is populated by your application. </p>
<p>
There are two classes of filters:
<ul>
<li>
<i>Transient</i> filters, which are created by your application and that exist only for the lifetime of the process that created them.</li>
<li>
<i>Persistent</i> filters within a filter container, which have been added to the site database. Persistent filters can be loaded by other processes, can contain scalars that are used to label the filter within the site database, and cannot be deleted from the SMS site database using the SMS API. </li>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<p>
To assist you in configuring a filter, the SMS API provides you with the ability to add tokens to the filter. Within a filter, multiple tokens can be connected and joined using the logical operators, <b>AND</b> or <b>OR</b>. There are two types of token: <i>expression</i> and <i>control</i>.</p>
<p>
An expression token defines how to search for objects that have a specified relationship to a determined value for a given attribute. An expression token consists of an attribute, a relational operator, and a comparison value. The relational operator (such as "is equal to" or "is like") defines how the specified value should be compared with the actual value stored for the given attribute.</p>
<p>
A control token can be a logical operator or parentheses. A logical operator connects two expression tokens, two subclauses, or a combination of an expression and a subclause. A logical operator defines the relationship between two adjacent expressions or subclauses.</p>
