<p>
For Microsoft® Systems Management Server (SMS), the site server must be installed on a Windows NT Server domain controller or backup domain controller. The server must have a hard disk formatted for NTFS with at least 100 MB of available space; 500 MB is recommended. The server must also have at least 28 MB of RAM. At least 32 MB of RAM is recommended for production environments. </p>
<p>
Microsoft SQL Server must be installed, running, and properly configured before you install SMS. Increase the memory option for the SQL Server configuration to at least 8 MB and increase the open objects option to 5000. If SQL Server is installed on a computer different from the SMS site server, create the site database device and transaction log device on separate devices (for example, SMSDATA and SMSLOG); each should be at least 5 MB.</p>
<p>
Any other system requirements your application may have are additional to those criteria required for SMS and SQL Server; you must address these accordingly. </p>
<p>
For information about setting up SQL Server to support SMS, see the <i>Microsoft Systems Management Server Administrator's Guide</i>.</p>
<p>
<b>Note</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;The preceding system requirements are based on the assumption that Microsoft SMS is installed and running on top of Windows NT Server. They do not include any specific requirements for SQL Server. These requirements incorporate general Windows NT Server requirements but may vary depending on your specific system environment.</p>
