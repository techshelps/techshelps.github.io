<h3><a name="_bkopr_location_transparency"></a>Location Transparency</h3>
<p>
One of the features of distributed COM is location transparency. Client applications are not required to confirm or monitor whether objects are running. Many applications are written without concern as to whether the objects used run within their process, in a different process on the same machine, or in a process on a separate machine. With proper administration, distributed COM allows new applications to take advantage of networking features, but also allows existing applications—thousands of them—to interact with new applications and with each other across networks.</p>
