<h2><a name="_bkopr_developing_client_applications"></a>Developing Client Applications</h2>
<p>
Development of client applications within the Microsoft Exchange Server environment is accomplished by either extending the Microsoft Exchange Client, or by creating stand-alone client applications.</p>
<p>
You can build Microsoft Exchange Server client extensions that add functionality to the Viewer, such as new pull-down menus or function keys.</p>
<p>
Other possibilities for extension development include: 
<ul>
<li>
Custom event handling to launch applications.</li>
<li>
Subclassing the Viewer window and adding an additional pane. </li>
<li>
Replacing the advanced search criteria window with a custom search criteria window.</li>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<p>
You can also develop your own client application. Most client applications interact with Microsoft Exchange Server by retrieving data from the information store, placing information in a public folder, or manipulating messages to be sent or posted. Your application can perform actions similar to those of the existing Microsoft Exchange Client, or it can supply new functionality.</p>
<p>
An example of a unique client application is the Microsoft® Schedule+ client that is provided with Microsoft Exchange Server, as well as with the Microsoft® Windows NT® and Windows® 95 operating systems. Schedule+ enables users to schedule group meetings, manage their daily appointment schedules, track projects and tasks, maintain lists of contacts, and perform many other time- and resource-management tasks. The characteristics of the Schedule+ client are founded on the functionality and features of Automation and can be customized using the Schedule+ Automation interface.</p>
