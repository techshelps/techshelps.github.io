<h2><a name="_bkopr_windows_nt_server"></a>Windows NT Server</h2>
<p>
Microsoft® Windows NT® Server provides the connectivity, reliability, base services, and administrative tools necessary to deliver critical business information across a distributed network of computers. Its scale ranges from the small network to the enterprise, providing basic file and print services while also supporting mission-critical databases, electronic messaging, host connectivity, and distributed systems management. It combines the comprehensive file and print services of Novell NetWare with the application capabilities of UNIX in one multipurpose network operating system.</p>
<p>
Improvements in Windows NT Server version 4.0 deliver better performance scalability on multiprocessor systems. New application programming interfaces (APIs) for server application developers and better server performance deliver improved throughput and scalability for server applications. In addition, a set of encryption APIs allow developers to create applications that work securely over non-secure networks, such as the Internet.</p>
<p>
As the network foundation for Microsoft BackOffice, Windows NT Server supports numerous turnkey business solutions—from general accounting to manufacturing management and inventory control systems. Windows NT Server has a wide range of protocols and services designed to facilitate the integration of technologies into one easily manageable system. It is engineered to support every popular client operating system, such as Microsoft® MS-DOS®, Microsoft® Windows®, Microsoft® Windows® 95, Windows NT, OS/2, Macintosh, and UNIX.</p>
