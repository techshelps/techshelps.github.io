<h2><a name="_bkopr_proxy_server"></a>Proxy Server</h2>
<p>
Microsoft® Proxy Server tightly integrates with the Windows NT Server platform and Internet Information Server to deliver high-performance Internet access to every desktop in your organization in an easy, secure, and cost-effective way. By sharing a single, secure gateway, Proxy Server eliminates the need to share one dedicated machine for the Internet among multiple users, or to run multiple Internet lines into the organization to provide each desktop with a separate connection.</p>
<p>
Proxy Server supports a wide range of applications and protocols, including those with live, streaming audio and video (such as RealAudio and VDOLive), LDAP, IRC, SMTP, and Microsoft SQL Server, providing transparent access from any desktop. Its caching capability stores frequently accessed Internet data on your LAN where users can access it as quickly as other information on the local network. The Auto Dial tool in Proxy Server automatically connects to your Internet service provider (ISP) whenever a user needs information not already stored in the local cache.</p>
