<h2><a name="_bkopr_sql_server"></a>SQL Server</h2>
<p>
Microsoft® SQL Server is a scalable, high-performance database management system designed specifically for distributed client/server computing. A comprehensive distributed management framework lets you centrally manage all the database servers in your organization. With advanced Windows-based management tools and powerful server-based job scheduling, you can control multiple servers and automate remote operations in a distributed environment. Using the SQL Server component of the Platform SDK, you can access SQL Server features such as data replication, management tools, and an open system architecture to develop effective and unique information solutions. </p>
<p>
Many features accessible using the SQL Server component of the Platform SDK are tightly integrated with the Windows NT Server platform. As part of the Microsoft BackOffice family of server software, SQL Server works with other BackOffice components and applications to offer powerful client/server solutions. Highlights of the SQL Server component of the Platform SDK include:
<ul>
<li>
A powerful structured query language database server for multiple platforms.</li>
<li>
Several programming libraries such as DB-Library for C and DB-Library for Visual Basic for interacting with SQL Server.</li>
<li>
The Microsoft Open Database Connectivity call-level application programming interface (API), which allows clients from different platforms to access multiple SQL Server data sources.</li>
<li>
The Microsoft Open Data Services server-based API, which allows developers to create effective server applications.</li>
<li>
Broad Transact-SQL communication support.</li>
</ul>
