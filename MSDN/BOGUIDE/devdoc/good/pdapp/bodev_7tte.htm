<h2><a name="_bkopr_microsoft_sql_server"></a>Microsoft SQL Server</h2>
<p>
Microsoft® SQL Server requires a computer with at least 16 MB of RAM. If the server will be configured to participate in data replication as either a distribution or a combined publication/distribution server, it must have at least 32 MB of memory, with at least 16 MB available to SQL Server. </p>
<p>
<b>Note</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;The preceding system requirements are only for SQL Server and do not represent requirements for other BackOffice components that are frequently integrated with SQL Server, such as Microsoft Systems Management Server or Internet Information Server.</p>
<p>
SQL Server requires a minimum of 60 MB of available hard disk space. Additional memory and disk space may be required, depending on how SQL Server is deployed. The following formula will help you calculate the additional recommended disk space:</p>
<p>
<i>additional_space</i>=<i>1.2</i>(<i>dataset</i>)</p>
<p>
The size of the additional disk space required is approximately 120 percent of the estimated size of the dataset.</p>
<p>
The following formula will help you estimate the additional recommended system memory:</p>
<p>
<i>additional_memory</i>=<i>1.08(dataset)</i>+<i>1.04</i>(<i>users</i>)</p>
<p>
In this formula, <i>additional_memory</i> is the amount of memory recommended in addition to the minimum of 16 MB. The variable <i>dataset</i> is the estimated size of the dataset, and <i>users</i> is the number of users accessing the server. In other words, the amount of additional memory recommended is 8 percent more than the estimated dataset size, plus 1 MB for every 25 users accessing the server.</p>
<p>
<b>Note</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;The preceding system requirements are based on the assumption that Microsoft SQL Server is installed and running on top of Windows NT Server. These requirements incorporate general Windows NT Server requirements but may vary depending on your specific system environment.</p>
