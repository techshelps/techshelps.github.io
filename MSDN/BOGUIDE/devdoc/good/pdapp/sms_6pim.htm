<p>
The Microsoft Systems Management Server (SMS) MIF Form Generator and the SMS MIF Entry utility let users at SMS clients add new groups to their computers' inventories. MIF forms, designed using the SMS MIF Form Generator, set up the structure of the group: its name, class, and attributes. After they are designed, you can distribute the forms to SMS clients, where users complete the forms by using the MIF Entry utility. The SMS system then collects the MIF files generated by the users who completed the forms, and adds the groups included in the MIF files to the inventory of the users' computers in the site database. </p>
<p>
For example, you can use the SMS MIF Form Generator to create a form for an Employee Information group that stores user information such as full name, location, room number, phone number, employee identifier, division, and so on.</p>
