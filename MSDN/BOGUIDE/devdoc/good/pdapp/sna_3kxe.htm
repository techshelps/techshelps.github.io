<p>
There are several other operational and administrative tasks that CPI-C performs that are relevant to proper incorporation of CPI-C calls in your application. The following issues are important: 
<ul>
<li>
CPI-C maintains a set of internal values called <i>characteristics</i> for each conversation. Some characteristics affect the overall operation of the conversation, such as the conversation type. Others affect the behavior of specific calls, such as the receive type.</li>
<li>
The information required for two CPI-C programs to communicate is stored in memory as a table, called the <i>side information table</i>. This table is maintained by the system administrator and contains entries for information such as the <i>Partner LU Name</i> and <i>Security User ID</i> and <i>Password</i>.</li>
<li>
Design optimization and fulfillment of the requirements for developing applications in a Windows version 3.<i>x</i>, Windows NT Server, or OS/2 Client or Server environment.</li>
</ul>
