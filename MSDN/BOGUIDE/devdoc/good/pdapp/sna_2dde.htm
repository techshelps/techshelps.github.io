<p>
Microsoft® Windows® Common Programming Interface for Communications (CPI-C) was developed to provide one common API to port applications from various operating environments to Microsoft® Windows NT® and Microsoft Windows version 3.<i>x</i> operating systems. The CPI-C information contained in the Microsoft® SNA Server SDK represents an evolving Windows CPI-C that is composed of CPI-C version 1.2 and a set of Windows extensions that provide asynchronous call completion and support multiple application instances.</p>
<p>
CPI-C version 1.0 was introduced to provide a mechanism for two applications to effectively communicate using the concept of conversation. A <i>conversation </i>is the logical connection between two programs that allows the programs to communicate with each other. Programs using CPI-C converse by making program calls. CPI-C version 1.1 was extended to include four new areas of function: support for resource recovery (not supported in Windows CPI-C), automatic parameter conversion, support for communicating with non–CPI-C programs, and local/remote transparency. Built upon CPI-C version 1.1, X/Open CPI-C provided support for nonblocking calls, the ability to accept multiple conversations, support for data conversion (beyond parameters), and support for security parameters.</p>
<p>
CPI-C version 1.2 consolidated CPI-C version 1.1 and X/Open CPI-C by providing functionality in all the areas described above. Windows CPI-C further adds to this functionality by providing a set of extensions for asynchronous communication in addition to the full complement of supported features in CPI-C version 1.2 (with the exception of resource recovery).</p>
<p>
CPI-C concepts are closely related to many of the concepts relevant to APPC programming and application development (for example, transaction programs and Windows extensions) and a greater understanding of CPI-C can be gleaned from these concepts. However, several development issues are unique to CPI-C. These issues are presented in the following topics.</p>
<p>
For more information about these topics, see the Microsoft SNA Server documentation in the "Internet, Networking, and Distributed Services" section of the Microsoft Platform SDK.</p>
