<p>
With Microsoft Exchange Server, you can develop forms-based applications using MAPI forms interfaces. These interfaces give you the ability to define custom forms, install them in forms libraries, and supply them to users of Microsoft Exchange Server. You can also develop forms with the Microsoft Exchange Forms Designer, which in turn calls the MAPI forms interfaces. Any MAPI-compliant forms application can run in the Microsoft Exchange Server environment and use functionality such as the organization form library, folder forms libraries, and conflict-resolution capability. </p>
