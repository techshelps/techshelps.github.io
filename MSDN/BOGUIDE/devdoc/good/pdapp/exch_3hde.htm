<h1><a name="_bkopr_the_architecture_of_microsoft_exchange_server"></a>The Architecture of Microsoft Exchange Server</h1>
<p>
Microsoft® Exchange Server is based on a client/server architecture. While Microsoft Exchange Server systems can have many different physical configurations, a typical installation will have some components located on a computer running Microsoft Exchange Server, others located on a computer running the Microsoft Exchange Client, and possibly others located on another computer running a server application of Microsoft Exchange Server.</p>
<p>
Before deciding on the design of your client or server application, it is important to understand the basic categories of Microsoft Exchange Server architecture. These categories are:
<ul>
<li>
Microsoft Exchange Client components</li>
<li>
Microsoft Exchange Server components</li>
<li>
Directory</li>
<li>
Information store</li>
<li>
Gateways</li>
<li>
Messaging</li>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<p>
For detailed information about Microsoft Exchange Server architecture, see the Microsoft Exchange Server documentation in the "Database and Messaging Services" section of the Microsoft Platform SDK.</p>
