<h2><a name="_bkopr_about_appc_file_transfer_protocol"></a>About APPC File Transfer Protocol</h2>
<p>
The APPC File Transfer Protocol (AFTP) API is a set of C routines that provides APPC file transfer capabilities. This API makes file transfer programming easier by allowing you to access routines that will interact with any AFTP server. The AFTP API adheres to the AFTP line flow standards, which means that all AFTP client applications send the same set of line flows over a network to an AFTP server.</p>
<p>
The following topics describe constants, conventions, and functions used in the AFTP API, and highlight those issues and techniques that are not standard to C programming. For more information about these topics, see the Microsoft SNA Server documentation in the "Internet, Networking, and Distributed Services" section of the Microsoft Platform SDK.</p>
