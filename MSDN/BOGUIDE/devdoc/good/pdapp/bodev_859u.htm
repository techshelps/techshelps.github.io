Using the Microsoft® SNA Server component of the Platform SDK, you can develop applications that:
<ul>
<li>
Employ a variety of data link protocols for communicating between PC client computers and IBM mainframe and AS/400 computers. Suitable data link protocols include:<p class=indent1>
Token-ring or Ethernet DLC connections</p>
<p class=indent1>
Leased or switched telephone line connections</p>
<p class=indent1>
Public or private packet-switched X.25 connections</p>
<p class=indent1>
Coax or twisted-pair connections by way of IBM 3x74 cluster controller</p>
<p class=indent1>
Twinaxial connections to an AS/400</p>
<p class=indent1>
Hardware connections directly to the mainframe channel</p>
</li>
<li>
Use SNA primary unit (PU) and logical unit (LU) protocols such as PU 2.0, PU 2.1, APPN LEN node, DSPU and TN3270; and LU types 0, 1, 2, 3, and 6.2 for communicating with IBM mainframes and AS/400 computers.</li>
<li>
Manipulate distributed SNA APIs such as:<p class=indent1>
APPC (Advanced Program-to-Program Communications) or CPI-C (Common Programming Interface for Communications) for peer-to-peer applications using LU type 6.2.</p>
<p class=indent1>
CSV (Common Service Verb) for EBCDIC to ASCII conversion and communication with NetView.</p>
<p class=indent1>
LUA (Logical Unit Application) for direct access to LU types 0, 1, 2, and 3 data streams.</p>
<p class=indent1>
EHLLAPI for interfacing with 3270 or 5250 applications.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Improvements in Microsoft SNA Server version 3.0 include a redesigned setup program to provide a common user interface with other Microsoft BackOffice and Office applications. Customers now have the option of using Microsoft Systems Management Server to complete unattended and remote installations of SNA Server and SNA Server clients. SNA Explorer replaces the current SNA Server Administrator tool, and communications between SNA Server 3.0 and its clients can be optionally encrypted on a per-user basis.</p>
<p>
SNA Server 3.0 supports up to 5,000 users running up to 15,000 sessions. SNA Print Server provides server-based 3270 and 5250 printer emulation. IBM mainframe security systems are supported and SNA Server uses Windows NT Server's RPC security feature. Automated logon to 5250 and APPC applications is also included. The SNA Server-based Shared Folders Service allows PCs with no SNA client software installed to access AS/400 shared folders files. The TN5250 Service enables any TN5250 emulator to connect to the AS/400 through SNA Server without installing TCP/IP on the AS/400. In addition, the TN3287 Service supports printing with a TN3270 emulator.</p>
