The Microsoft® Exchange Server component of the Platform SDK provides tools that allow you to enhance Microsoft Exchange Server clients to better meet your corporate needs. You can create unique Microsoft Exchange Server clients that satisfy specific messaging requirements, such as collecting e-mail administration information, presenting unusual views of message contents, or providing enhanced client functionality. </p>
<p>
By developing a powerful Microsoft Exchange Client, you can provide a single interface for sending, sharing, accessing, and managing information across multiple platforms and operating systems. Microsoft has provided the Microsoft Exchange Forms Designer to create custom views for displaying information. These forms and views can be combined with public folders to create workgroup software applications. Developers can customize these applications even further with the Microsoft® Visual Basic® programming system or the Microsoft® Visual C++® development system. </p>
<p>
Improvements in Microsoft Exchange Server version 5.0 provide the communications and collaboration support required for the Internet and the intranet. Based on both Internet and other open standards, Microsoft Exchange Server 5.0 delivers advanced messaging, collaboration, scheduling, and groupware capabilities. It provides complete open Internet standards support, including POP3, HTTP, HTML, NNTP, LDAP, and SSL. In addition, it includes Active Server support, providing a foundation for building Web-based groupware applications.</p>
<p>
The modular client/server architecture in Microsoft Exchange Server provides all the components for distributed enterprise-wide messaging and workgroup software. Special server-based rules can be configured and designed to automatically process incoming messages. Use the Microsoft Exchange Server component of the Platform SDK to integrate your business communications into the BackOffice family of server products and create powerful client/server solutions.</p>
