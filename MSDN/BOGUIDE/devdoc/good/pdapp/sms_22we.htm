<p>
Microsoft Systems Management Server (SMS) provides support for launching ISV applications from a <b>Tools</b> menu in the SMS Administrator console in a context-specific manner. (The term context refers to the internal class name of the SMS multiple document interface (MDI) window that has the focus.) </p>
<p>
Launching an application from the SMS Administrator requires adding data about the application under the following key in the Windows NT registry: </p>
<p>
<b>SOFTWARE\Microsoft\SMS\Applications</b></p>
<p>
This key is located under both <b>HKEY_CURRENT_USER</b> and <b>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE</b>. Applications registered under <b>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE</b> are available to all SMS users; applications registered under <b>HKEY_CURRENT_USER</b> are available only to the user who registered the application.</p>
<p>
The registered data defines the characteristics of the application by specifying the command description, command name, command-line arguments, and so on. </p>
<p>
SMS provides a command-line utility, SMSADDIN.EXE, that creates or removes the required registry settings based on command-line arguments and a data file. </p>
<p>
SMS supports ISV application launching for several contexts. Applications registered in the General context are always available from the <b>Tools</b> menu regardless of the current context. Applications registered in a specific context are only available when that context is active (that is, when that context's corresponding MDI window has the focus). You can register applications in more than one context. </p>
<p>
Registered applications are displayed in the <b>Tools</b> menu in the SMS Administrator console. When the user selects an application from the <b>Tools</b> menu, SMS forms a command line from the application's registry data and passes the command line to the underlying operating system for execution. </p>
