<p>
A package definition file (PDF) is an ASCII text file that contains predefined Workstation, Sharing, and Inventory property settings the system uses for a package. A PDF follows the standard initialization file format containing keys (the key names are enclosed within square brackets and separated by spaces), where each key contains one or more entries. A PDF has specific keys and entries that are used by the system to set the properties of a package.</p>
<p>
Important keys include:
<ul>
<li>
The <b>[PDF]</b> key, which identifies the file as a package definition file. </li>
<li>
The <b>[Package Definition]</b> key, which defines the overall properties of the package.</li>
<li>
For the setup variations specified in the SetupVariation entry in the <b>[Package Definition]</b> key, the PDF must have a key that defines each variation.</li>
<li>
The <b>[Setup Package for Sharing]</b> key, which defines the Sharing properties of the package.</li>
<li>
The <b>[Program Item Properties <i>Index</i>]</b> key, which specifies the program item properties for network applications contained in the package. Each program item will be defined in the package's Sharing property.</li>
<li>
The <b>[Setup Package for Inventory]</b> key, which defines the Inventory properties of the package.</li>
<li>
For the files specified in the PackageDetectionRule entry in the <b>[Setup Package for Inventory]</b> key, the PDF must have a key that defines each file. Each file corresponds to a key that defines the attributes of the file and has the form of <b>[File<i> index</i>]</b>. </li>
<li>
The inventory rules for a package must define that package uniquely among all other packages that may be installed on a machine. You can use a <i>prodspec</i>.INI file in conjunction with the Inventory section of the PDF to increase the accuracy of package recognition. A <i>prodspec</i>.INI file uses the standard .INI file format and contains sections and keys that, taken together, uniquely define a specific version of a product.</li>
</ul>
