<h2><a name="_bkopr_development_tasks_using_db_library_for_visual_basic"></a>Development Tasks Using DB-Library for Visual Basic</h2>
<p>
In general, developing any application using Visual Basic involves two processes:
<ul>
<li>
Providing a user interface that requests information from and conveys information to the person using the application.</li>
<li>
Supplying the programming code that performs a set of tasks in response to specific user actions.</li>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<p>
These two processes are strongly interdependent. When the user of the application initiates an action with a particular screen object, Visual Basic responds by invoking the Basic code contained in whatever event procedure is associated with that screen object. User interaction with SQL Server occurs when the Visual Basic code for an event procedure contains functions and routines from DB-Library for Visual Basic.</p>
<p>
Unless your DB-Library for Visual Basic application is very simple, multiple forms should be used to divide your application into logical parts. Applications created using DB-Library for Visual Basic can be large and complex, and can manage several SQL Server processes. Dividing applications into forms and modules that control the various processes makes it easier to maintain and change the applications.</p>
<p>
When developing a DB-Library for Visual Basic application, you typically include several required DB-Library for Visual Basic files (VBSQL.VBX or VBSQL.OCX custom control, and VBSQL.BAS files) in your Visual Basic project to provide declarations and functionality. </p>
<p>
For detailed information about issues related to application development using DB-Library for Visual Basic, see the Microsoft SQL Server Programmer's Toolkit documentation in the "Database and Messaging Services" section of the Platform SDK.</p>
