<p>
You can extend the inventory beyond the architectures already defined in the Microsoft Systems Management Server (SMS) system by adding objects with new (custom) architectures. A custom architecture can store information about objects that have little or no relationship to the predefined SMS architectures.</p>
<p>
To add an object with a custom architecture to the inventory, you use a Management Information Format (MIF) file. In the MIF file you include the properties of the object and define the structure of the architecture. The structure of the architecture is defined by the attributes you include in the Identification and Architecture groups, and by the other groups and attributes that you choose to include in the MIF file.</p>
