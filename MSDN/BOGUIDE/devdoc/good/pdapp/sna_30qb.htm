<p>
In the SNA Server environment, Common Service Verbs (CSVs) are a set of programming functions you can use to incorporate conversion, logging, tracing, and transfer services into your applications. The Microsoft Windows CSVs represent an evolving set of CSVs that is composed of IBM Extended Services for OS/2 version 1.0 (IBM ES for OS/2 version 1.0). Additionally, a significant component of Windows CSVs is a set of Windows extensions that allow for registering and deregistering the application and that provide an asynchronous entry point for <b>TRANSFER_MS_DATA</b>.</p>
<p>
Several Windows extensions are of particular importance and should be reviewed before using Windows CSVs:
<ul>
<li>
<b>WinAsyncCSV</b> provides an asynchronous entry point for <b>TRANSFER_MS_DATA</b> only. </li>
<li>
<b>WinCSVStartup</b> allows an application to specify the required version of Windows CSVs and to retrieve details of the specific CSV implementation.<p>
This function must be called by an application before issuing any further Windows CSV calls to register itself with a Windows CSV implementation.
</li>
<li>
<b>WinCSVCleanup</b> terminates and deregisters an application from a Windows CSV implementation.<p>
This function must be called by an application when it finishes to deregister itself from the Windows CSV implementation.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<p>
These extensions have been designed for Microsoft Windows 3.<i>x</i> and later versions and provide support for maximum Windows programming compatibility and optimum application performance in both 16-bit and 32-bit operating system environments. <b>WinCSVCleanup</b> terminates and deregisters an application from a Windows CSV implementation. <b>WinAsyncCSV</b> provides an asynchronous entry point for <b>TRANSFER_MS_DATA</b>. Finally, <b>WinCSVStartup</b> allows an application to specify the version of Windows CSV required and to retrieve details of the specific Windows CSV implementation. </p>
