<p>
Developers can write applications for Microsoft® SQL Server by programming with DB-Library for C, the C-language version of the communication library for SQL Server, or with DB-Library for Visual Basic, the Microsoft® Visual Basic® version of the communication library for SQL Server. </p>
<p>
DB-Library for C is an API that consists of C functions and macros that allow an application to interact with SQL Server. Included are functions that send Transact-SQL statements to SQL Server and functions that process the results of those statements. Additionally, DB-Library for C includes functions for error handling and data conversion.</p>
<p>
DB-Library for C offers a rich set of functions you can access to:
<ul>
<li>
Open connections.</li>
<li>
Format queries.</li>
<li>
Send query batches to the server and retrieve the resulting data.</li>
<li>
Use scrollable cursors.</li>
<li>
Bulk-copy data from files or program variables to and from the server.</li>
<li>
Execute stored procedures or remote stored procedures.</li>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<p>
DB-Library for Visual Basic is a set of functions and routines for building front-end applications for the Microsoft® Windows® 3.<i>x</i> and Windows 95 operating systems that interact with Microsoft SQL Server. DB-Library for Visual Basic is built on and is a subset of the SQL Server DB-Library for C. </p>
<p>
The following topics present an overview of DB-Library for C and DB-Library for Visual Basic, highlighting issues to consider when using either library to develop applications for SQL Server. </p>
