<h1><a name="_bkopr_transact_sql"></a>Transact-SQL</h1>
<p>
Transact-SQL is an enhanced version of Structured Query Language (SQL) used to perform transactions and operations with relational database systems. Originally developed by IBM, SQL has been adapted for many relational database management systems (DBMSs) and has been approved as the official relational query language standard by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI). Transact-SQL is compliant with many ANSI SQL standards and also provides important additional capabilities and functions to assist you in creating efficient Microsoft SQL Server applications.</p>
<p>
With Transact-SQL, you can retrieve data from a database, create databases and database objects, add data, modify existing data, and perform other complex functions. You can also change the server configuration, modify database or session settings, and control data and access statements. Many of these capabilities are implemented by using one of three SQL categories: Data Definition Language (DDL), Data Manipulation Language (DML), and Data Control Language (DCL).</p>
<p>
Microsoft SQL Server continues to adhere to industry standards, and provides improved ANSI SQL support and language enhancements that include declarative referential integrity (DRI) and powerful server-based cursor support, which far exceed the ANSI standard. SQL Server version 6.<i>x</i> enhances several existing Transact-SQL language statements and builds upon its existing tools and system procedures.</p>
<p>
Transact-SQL commands are executed within the utilities provided by Microsoft, as well as in third-party applications that support Embedded SQL. Microsoft provides you with several utilities in which Transact-SQL statements and procedures can be executed:
<ul>
<li>
<b>isql</b>. Provides a query interface you can use to perform system administration tasks from a server or a workstation. You can also use isql to create scripts for automating tasks.</li>
<li>
<b>ISQL/w</b>. Provides a graphical query interface in which you can enter Transact-SQL statements and system-stored procedures. ISQL/w also provides a graphical way to analyze queries.</li>
<li>
<b>SQL Enterprise Manager</b>. Provides easy, enterprise-wide management from a server or a workstation of SQL Server and SQL Server objects.</li>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<p>
The <i>Microsoft SQL Server Transact-SQL Reference</i> contains information about all Transact-SQL statements, server-supplied stored procedures, and utilities. Syntax, limitations and restrictions, examples, and references to topics of similar interest are provided. For information about writing client applications that interact with the utilities, see the Microsoft SQL Server Programmer's Toolkit documentation in the "Database and Messaging Services" section of the Platform SDK.</p>
