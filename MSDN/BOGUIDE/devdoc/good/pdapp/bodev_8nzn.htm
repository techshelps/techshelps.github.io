<h2><a name="_bkopr_client_recommendations"></a>Client Recommendations</h2>
<p>
This section describes the recommendations your client application should attempt to satisfy to be an effective Microsoft BackOffice application. These recommendations are provided as a guide during the development of your application and stress important programming concepts that may become requirements. A 32-bit Windows operating system interface-based client allows you to fully utilize all of the functionality inherent within the BackOffice environment. Using MAPI allows clients to completely integrate with MAPI-compliant messaging applications and servers such as Microsoft Exchange Server. Finally, an important programming method is to use the appropriate database techniques for manipulating and retrieving data from ODBC-compliant databases such as SQL Server.</p>
