<p>
A Microsoft Exchange Server information store contains messages, forms, documents, and other information created by users and applications. It provides each user with a server-based mailbox and stores public folder contents.</p>
<p>
MAPI functions and methods are used to work with Microsoft Exchange Server information stores. The important development tasks that are performed when working with information stores include locating and opening an information store, opening a public information store, and determining the type of information store.</p>
<p>
As a developer, you should become familiar with the information store's structure and interface as well as with its relationship to other Microsoft Exchange Server components. Some examples of important development issues are:
<ul>
<li>
<b>Managing folders</b>. You can customize and manipulate public, private, and personal folders by programming with MAPI and using features such as ACLs, rules, and folder replication.</li>
<li>
<b>Handling messages</b>. Messages are MAPI objects that are transmitted from one client application to another through the MAPI spooler and service providers by way of a messaging system. Every message supports many properties; which describe the message, its contents, transmission options, and recipients. </li>
<li>
<b>Granting privileged access</b>. Applications may need to dynamically access multiple mailboxes. These applications, called privileged services<i>,</i> must be granted special privileges by a Microsoft Exchange Server administrator.</li>
<li>
<b>Backing up and restoring data</b>. Functions for backing up and restoring data in the Microsoft Exchange Server directory and information store are provided in the Microsoft Exchange Server SDK. These functions perform backups online, which means that there is no need to stop the directory or information store service to back up directory or information store data.</li>
<li>
<b>Providing event notification</b>. Event notification is the communication of information between two MAPI objects. One object registers an interest in learning of a change or error, called an event, that may take place in another object. After the event occurs, the first object is informed or notified. </li>
</ul>
<p>
