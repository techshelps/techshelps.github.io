<H3>User Profiles</H3><P CLASS="t">User profiles are useful for configuring or managing custom desktops on a Microsoft network (that is, one that uses Microsoft products for networking functionality). A user who logs on from different computers at different times can see the same desktop at every logon. Any changes the user makes to the profile appear the next time the user logs on.</P>
<P CLASS="t">In Windows&nbsp;NT Workstation, a user's computing environment is determined primarily by the user profile. Windows&nbsp;NT security requires a user profile for each account that has access to the system. User profiles are created by default when a Windows&nbsp;NT user logs on for the first time. You can also create and modify user profiles on a computer running Windows&nbsp;NT Server. To do so, select System from the Control Panel, and select the User Profile tab.</P>
<P CLASS="t">In Windows&nbsp;95, user profiles are not created by default; they must be enabled by an administrator. For information on setting up User Profiles for Windows&nbsp;95 computers on a Windows&nbsp;NT Network, see Chapter 15, "User Profiles and System Policies," in the <I>Windows&nbsp;95 Resource Kit</I>. Also, to take advantage of user profiles from a computer running Windows&nbsp;95, you must specify Client for Microsoft Networks as the Primary Network Logon client.</P>
<P CLASS="t">Profiles for computers running Windows&nbsp;NT Workstation or Windows&nbsp;NT Server are stored in the "Profile Path" directory on a Windows&nbsp;NT server. The "Profile Path" directory can be found in the user's account in User Manager for Domains. Windows&nbsp;95 does not use this directory. Windows&nbsp;95 profiles are stored in the home directory.</P>
<P CLASS="t">If a user works at a computer running Windows&nbsp;NT Workstation part of the time and at a computer running Windows&nbsp;95 other times, that user can have two different profiles, one for each operating system. Changes to the settings for one operating system will not affect the settings for the other operating system. (Also, the profiles used by Windows&nbsp;NT Workstation 3.51 and Windows&nbsp;NT Workstation 4.0 differ, reflecting the differences in the interfaces. Users who move between versions of Windows&nbsp;NT Workstation will have different profiles for the two versions of the operating system.) </P>
<P CLASS="t">Because these operating systems use different profiles, some elements of the user environment are easier to control in a mixed environment by creating logon scripts.</P></BODY></HTML>
