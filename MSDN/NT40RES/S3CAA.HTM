<H3>Minimal Security</H3><P CLASS="t">You might not be concerned with security if the computer is not used to store or access sensitive data or if it is in a very secure location. For example, if the computer is in the home office of a sole proprietor of a business, or if it is used as a test machine in the locked lab of a software development company, then security precautions might be unnecessarily cumbersome. Windows&nbsp;NT allows you to make the system fully accessible, with no protections at all, if that is what your setup requires.</P>
<H4><A NAME="sec0"></A>Physical Security Considerations</H4><P CLASS="t">Take the precautions you would with any piece of valuable equipment to protect against casual theft. This step can include locking the room the computer is in when no one is there to keep an eye on it, or using a locked cable to attach the unit to a wall. You might also want to establish procedures for moving or repairing the computer so that the computer or its components cannot be taken under false pretenses.</P>
<P CLASS="t">Use a surge protector or power conditioner to protect the computer and its peripherals from power spikes. Also, perform regular disk scans and defragmentation to isolate bad sectors and to maintain the highest possible disk performance. </P>
<H4><A NAME="sec1"></A>Minimal Software Security Considerations</H4><P CLASS="t">For minimal security, none of the Windows&nbsp;NT security features are used. In fact, you can allow automatic logon to the Administrator account (or any other user account) by following the directions in Chapter 25 "Configuration Management and the Registry." This allows anyone with physical access to the computer to turn it on and immediately have full access to the computer's resources. </P>
<P CLASS="t">By default, access is limited to certain files. For minimal security, give the Everyone group full access to all files.</P>
<P CLASS="t">You should still take precautions against viruses, because they can disable programs you want to use or use the minimally secure computer as a vector to infect other computer systems. </P></BODY></HTML>
