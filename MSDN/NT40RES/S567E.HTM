<H3>Test Lab </H3><P CLASS="t">The test lab is used to test the deployment process. It can also be used to test the configurations you have chosen for various groups of computers in your organization, including any applications. </P>
<P CLASS="t">Set aside a physical space for this lab, and acquire a mix of computers that accurately reflects your organization's computing environment. Be sure there are computers to represent every kind of hardware used in the computers to which you will deploy Windows&nbsp;NT Workstation – for example, if your organization uses five different models of computer, from two different manufacturers, include all five models in the lab. If you are currently running Windows for Workgroups on some computers and another operating system on others, make sure that both operating systems are represented in the lab. Likewise, make sure that the peripherals used with the computers to which you will deploy Windows&nbsp;NT Workstation are present in the lab. In addition, try to duplicate variables such as free disk space.</P>
<P CLASS="t">If your organization uses portable computers that dial in from remote locations, or if you use additional servers or mainframe computers for business data, give the lab computers full access to the network and an analog phone line.</P>
<P CLASS="t">You'll also want to make sure you have enough disk space on a test server to implement the rollout. </P>
<P CLASS="t">Test Windows&nbsp;NT Workstation 4.0 features in the lab with all of the applications used in your organization, before performing the pilot installation. Maintain a complete list of any problems found in the testing lab.</P></BODY></HTML>
