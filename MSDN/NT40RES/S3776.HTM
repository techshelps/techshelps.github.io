<H2>Monitoring Disk Sets</H2><P CLASS="t">JBJBTwo heads are better than one. In fact, when it comes to disks, the more heads the better, if you can keep them all busy. Because each physical disk typically has its own head stack assembly, and the heads work simultaneously, performance on disk sets can be significantly better on than single disks. However, some disk configurations are designed for data security, with performance as a secondary concern.</P>
<P CLASS="t">The Windows NT 4.0 Workstation Disk Administrator supports many different disk configurations, including<I> volume sets</I>, which are logical combinations of multiple physical disks. Performance Monitor and other monitoring tools can be set up to measure and help you tune performance on volume sets.</P>
<P></P>
<P CLASS="t"><B>Note</B></P>
<P>Whenever you combine noncontiguous physical disk space into a logical partition, the Disk Administrator adds Ftdisk.sys, a fault tolerant driver, to your disk driver stack and starts the FTDISK service. To see if FTDISK is started in your computer, check the Devices Control Panel.</P>

<P CLASS="t">There are three main strategies for combining physical disks. The terms introduced here are used throughout this section:</P>
