<H3>Client Application Creates a Print Job</H3><P CLASS="t">A user on a client system runs an application that composes text and/or graphics to create a print job. The application may interact with a printer driver to create output in a printer language such as PCL, PostScript, or HP-GL/2.</P>

Transfer that file to a different client system, and print it to a different printer on a different print server, and there it continues to fail.</LI></UL><UL><LI>What you see on the screen is not the output that you get.</LI></UL><UL><LI>The problem is limited to one particular user or the users in a specific group; one particular client operating system; a particular vendor's printer driver (or a particular version of the printer driver); a particular font or fonts from a particular vendor; certain extended ASCII characters; a particular graphic object, a particular graphic file format (such as EPS, BMP, or TIF); jobs created by a particular application or version of that application; color or shading; incorrect resolution (dots per inch); or the print job is missing line feeds or form feeds.</LI></UL><UL><LI>A different driver works fine.</LI></UL><P></P>
<P CLASS="t">If the problem persists when you send a simple textprint job from several clients' systems, the problem is likely caused by another printing process. </P></BODY></HTML>
