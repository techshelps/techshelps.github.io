<H1>Chapter 32 - Networking Name Resolution and Registration</H1><P CLASS="t">Administration of Microsoft TCP/IP and related services splits roughly into two functional areas:</P>
<UL><LI><I>Client Configuration Options.</I> Every computer on a TCP/IP internetwork must be given a unique computer name and IP address. The IP address identifies both the computer and the subnetwork to which it is attached. When the computer is moved to a different subnetwork, the IP address must be changed to reflect the new subnetwork ID.</LI><LI><I>Name Resolution Services.</I> People use "friendly" names to connect to computers; programs use IP addresses. TCP/IP internetworks require a <I>name resolution service</I> that converts computer names to IP addresses and IP addresses to computer names.</LI></UL><P CLASS="t">This chapter is intended for the administrator of small peer-to-peer workstation subnet, or single workstation environments, that connect to Internet or TCP/IP network resources. This information in this chapter is required knowledge for the following chapter "Using LMHOSTS Files".</P></BODY></HTML>
