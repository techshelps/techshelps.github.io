<H3>Testing the UPS </H3><P CLASS="t">When the UPS service is started, it verifies the settings in the UPS dialog box by ensuring that the signal polarity on the CTS and DCD pins is opposite to that specified as the failure condition in the <B>UPS</B> dialog box. For example, if the <B>UPS</B> dialog box specifies that the UPS device supports a Power Failure Signal (CTS pin) with a positive signal, the UPS service checks to make sure that this pin is not already asserted positive (which would not happen unless you had started the system during a power failure). </P>
<P CLASS="t">This has some important implications. With an online UPS, the UPS device might shut itself off immediately if the configuration is incorrect. With a standby UPS, an incorrect configuration typically shuts the UPS device off as soon as a power failure is detected, effectively circumventing the purpose of the UPS. This is why it is important to configure and test your UPS device to ensure that it operates correctly.</P>
<P CLASS="t">On x86-based computers, there is one other reason that it is important to test your UPS. During startup, Windows&nbsp;NT sends a detection signal to each port in order to recognize hardware attached to that port. Some UPS units using serial monitoring implementations respond to the detection signal by turning off. If this happens, use the <B>/NoSerialMice</B> switch in the Boot.ini file to prevent the system from sending this signal to the COM port to which your UPS unit is connected. </P>
<P CLASS="t">You can use multiple /NoSerialMice switches. The format is:</P>
<P CLASS="spacing"><BR></P>
<PRE>/NoSerialMice=[COM<I>x</I> | COM<I>x</I>,COM<I>y</I>,COM<I>z</I>,...] 
</PRE>
<UL><LI>If <B>/NoSerialMice</B> is specified without parameters, serial mouse detection is disabled on all the serial ports.</LI></UL><UL><LI>If <B>/NoSerialMice=COM</B><B><I>x</I></B> is specified, serial mouse detection is only disabled on COM<I>x</I>.</LI></UL><UL><LI>If <B>/NoSerialMice=COM</B><B><I>x</I></B><B>,COM</B><B><I>y</I></B><B>,COM</B><B><I>z</I></B><B> ...</B> is specified, serial mouse detection is disabled on each of the specified ports. </LI></UL><P></P>
<P CLASS="t">To ensure that the computer is protected from power failures, you can test it by simulating a power failure (that is, by disconnecting the main power supply to the UPS device). Your computer and peripherals connected to the UPS device should remain operational, and messages should be displayed and events logged. Wait until the UPS battery reaches a low level to verify that a graceful shutdown occurs. Restore the main power to the UPS device, and check the event log to ensure that all actions were logged and that there were no errors.</P>

<P CLASS="t"><B>Note</B></P>
<P>Before you begin any UPS tests, make sure that your UPS has sufficient charge built up to run all of the devices connected to it for at least the duration of the test.</P>
