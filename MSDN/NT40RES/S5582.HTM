The new Performance Monitor counters let you monitor devices that use TAPI.</P>
<P CLASS="t">The telephony counters are listed in Performance Monitor under the Telephony object. Counters include numbers of telephone devices, telephone lines, active lines, incoming and outgoing calls, and the number of applications using the telephone device.</P></BODY></HTML>
