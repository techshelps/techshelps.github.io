<H3>Viewing Specific Logged Events</H3><P CLASS="t">After you select a log to view in Event Viewer, you can:</P>
<UL><LI>View descriptions and additional details that the event source logs.</LI></UL><UL><LI>Sort events from oldest to newest or from newest to oldest.</LI></UL><UL><LI>Filter events so that only events with specific characteristics are displayed.</LI></UL><UL><LI>Search for events based on specific characteristics or event descriptions.</LI></UL><P></P>
<H4><A NAME="sec0"></A>Viewing Details About Events</H4><P CLASS="t">For many events, you can view more information than is displayed in Event Viewer by double-clicking the event.</P>
<P CLASS="t">The <B>Event Detail</B> dialog box shows a text description of the selected event and any available binary data for the selected event. This information is generated by the application that was the source of the event record. Because the data appears in hexadecimal format, its meaning can be interpreted only by a support technician familiar with the source application. Not all events generate such data. For more information, see "Viewing Event Details" in Event Viewer Help. </P>
<P CLASS="t">To control the types of security events that are audited, click <B>Audit</B> on the <B>Policies</B> menu in User Manager. To control the auditing of file and folders access, click <B>Auditing</B> on the <B>Security</B> tab in the <B>Windows&nbsp;NT Explorer Properties</B> dialog box. </P>
<H4><A NAME="sec1"></A>Sorting Events</H4><P CLASS="t">By default, Event Viewer lists events by date and time of occurrence  from the newest event to the oldest. To change the order from oldest to newest, click <B>Oldest First</B> on the <B>View</B> menu. If the <B>Save Settings On Exit</B> command on the <B>Options</B> menu is checked when you quit, the current sort order is used the next time you start Event Viewer.</P>
<P CLASS="t">When a log is archived, the sort order affects the order in which event records are archived in a text format or comma-delimited text format file; sort order does not affect the order of event records archived in log file format. For more information, see "Using Archived Log Files" later in this chapter.</P>
<P CLASS="t">For information on how to specify the sort order, see "Sorting Events" in Event Viewer Help. </P>
<H4><A NAME="sec2"></A>Filtering Events</H4><P CLASS="t">By default, Event Viewer lists all events recorded in the selected log. To view a subset of events that have specific characteristics, click <B>Filter Events</B> on the <B>View</B> menu. When filtering is on, a check mark appears by the <B>Filter</B> command on the <B>View</B> menu and "(Filtered)" appears on the title bar. If <B>Save Settings On Exit</B> on the <B>Options</B> menu is checked when you quit Event Viewer, the filters remain in effect the next time you start Event Viewer.</P>
<P CLASS="t">Filtering has no effect on the actual contents of the log: It changes only the view. All events are logged continuously, whether the filter is active or not. If you archive a log from a filtered view, all records are saved, even if you select a text format or comma-delimited text format file. For more information on archiving, see "Using Event Viewer with Archived Log Files" later in this chapter.</P>
<P CLASS="t">The following table describes the options available in the <B>Filter</B> dialog box</P>
