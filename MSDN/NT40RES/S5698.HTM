<H3>Determine Pilot Rollout Logistics</H3><P CLASS="t">Although it is a test, the first pilot rollout sets the tone and presents an example of the final rollout. You need to be completely prepared for all aspects of the rollout. This requires that you determine the time it will take for installation, the personnel and tools needed to facilitate the process, and the overall schedule. </P>
<P CLASS="t">The installation and planning teams should create a checklist for the pilot rollout. The checklist should cover, in detail, the following general topics: </P>
<UL><LI>Who will perform the deployment? </LI></UL><P>In addition to the installation team members, be sure to assign a system administrator with full rights on the server, including the right to administer mail or database server passwords. </P>
<UL><LI>Who are the pilot users? </LI></UL><P>Choose a pilot user group or department that is willing and able to accommodate the rollout. This group, ranging from 15 to 50 persons, should be representative of your overall user base. Try not to select a department that is attempting to meet a schedule deadline during the rollout, or a group that is traditionally slow in adopting new technology. </P>
<UL><LI>What installation process will be used? Does the deployment methodology meet automation goals?</LI></UL><UL><LI>What new software or tools must be purchased, and on what schedule?</LI></UL><UL><LI>Has a verified backup been performed for each of the target computers?</LI></UL><UL><LI>Have passwords been reset for CMOS, the network, and applications?</LI></UL><UL><LI>Have virus checking and disk defragmentation been performed?</LI></UL><UL><LI>What is the schedule for pilot installations? </LI></UL><P>When determining the installation time for the pilot rollout, base the projections on how long it takes for installation of an individual computer; remember to schedule the downtime for each user. </P>
<UL><LI>How many systems will be installed per day? </LI></UL><P>Start with a conservative estimate and then increase or decrease the number, based on your experiences with the initial installations.</P>
<UL><LI>At what time of day should the installations occur? </LI></UL><P>You may want to schedule installations to occur on weekdays after normal business hours or on weekends.</P>
<P></P>
<P CLASS="t">As you develop the checklist of logistics, consider your goals for the pilot rollout and the factors that define its success. For example, you might set a percentage for successful upgrades or for automated installations that, if achieved, would indicate that the rollout had been successful. Or you might set a threshold of end-user downtime. If downtime stays below this threshold, another indicator of success has been met. Document these goals and criteria, so that teams can monitor performance against them during the rollout.</P></BODY></HTML>
