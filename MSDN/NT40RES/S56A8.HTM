<H3>About Sysdiff</H3><P CLASS="t">To pre-install applications that do not support a scripted installation, you must use <B>sysdiff</B>. You can also use <B>sysdiff</B> to install other applications.</P>
<P CLASS="t">To use <B>sysdiff</B>, first create a snapsho<I>t</I> of a reference system. Then install the applications you want to distribute. After you've installed the applications, create a difference file<I>.</I> The information in the difference file includes all the binary files for the applications, as well as the initialization file settings and registry settings for the applications.</P>
<P CLASS="t">A command in the $OEM$\Cmdlines.txt file is used to apply the difference file to new installations of Windows&nbsp;NT Workstation. Or, the difference file can be applied to a computer that is already running Windows&nbsp;NT Workstation 4.0 by issuing the same command from the command line.</P>
<P CLASS="t">Because the difference file includes all the files and all the initialization and registry settings for the applications, it can be a very large package, depending on the number and complexity of the applications you have added. Applying such a large package can increase the time required for setup considerably. As an alternative, you can create an information file (INF) from the difference file, which contains only registry and initialization file directives. The command that creates the INF also creates a directory tree within the $OEM$ directory structure, that contains all the files contained in the difference file package. These files are then copied along with other files required by setup during the early phases of setup, and are in place when the INF is invoked from the $OEM$\Cmdlines.txt file.</P></BODY></HTML>
