<H2>Using a RISC-based Computer's Boot Menu</H2><P CLASS="t">This section describes using the firmware menus on a RISC-based computer to change environment information in the NVRAM. There are three types of RISC-based computers: Alpha, MIPS, and PowerPC. The examples in this section are for an Alpha AXP-based computer, running firmware version 3.5-11. Menus for other versions of the firmware might be different. Menus and processing on MIPS-based computers and PPC-based computers are similar.</P>
<P CLASS="t">When you start an Alpha-based computer, you see the <B>Boot</B> menu, which looks like this:</P>
