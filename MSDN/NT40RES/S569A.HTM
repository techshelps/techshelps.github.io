<H3>Develop the Support Plan</H3><P CLASS="t">The support plan must be ready the first day you begin performing Windows&nbsp;NT Workstation 4.0 installations. Because the quality of support available during the pilot rollout will be seen as an indicator of the quality of the rollout as a whole, it is important that you plan carefully to make sure effective support is available.</P>
<P CLASS="t">Staff the support team for your pilot rollout with some of your best technicians, and dedicate their time solely to the pilot group for the first few weeks. The assigned technicians should carry pagers or be available by phone at all times, to give immediate assistance to users. Make sure the users have the names and phone numbers of persons to contact for assistance, as well as a short list of the top questions and answers, and troubleshooting tips.</P>
<P CLASS="t">To help your users help themselves, edit Windows&nbsp;NT Workstation 4.0 Help with organization-specific information on applications or features they will be using with Windows&nbsp;NT Workstation. Doing so requires placing an Oem.cnt file and your custom help file in the user's Windows directory. For information about Oem.cnt and the format of Windows&nbsp;NT Workstation 4.0 help files, see the <I>Win32 Software Development Kit for Windows&nbsp;95 and Windows&nbsp;NT</I>.</P></BODY></HTML>
