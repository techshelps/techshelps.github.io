<H3>Security</H3><P CLASS="t">Windows&nbsp;NT Workstation was designed with built-in security features. For example, the secure logon screen, invoked by pressing ctrl+alt+del, prevents Trojan Horse programs from simulating an operating system's logon screen and capturing user names and passwords.</P>
<P CLASS="t">Windows 95 was also designed with built-in security, but its security is less restrictive. For example, Windows 95 lets you log in to the local computer without a user account. (To log into a Windows&nbsp;NT computer you must enter a user name and password that already exists on the machine.)</P>
<P CLASS="t">The Windows&nbsp;NT file system, NTFS, provides a range of file protections, which can be set on a per-file or per-directory basis, and user permissions that can be set on a per-user or per-group basis. In addition, NTFS enables an administrator to protect portions of the registry from intentional or inadvertent changes to system settings.</P>
<P CLASS="t">Windows 95 supports share-level and user-level security for peer resource sharing which are measurably less restrictive than the file-level user permissions in Windows&nbsp;NT. Share-level security requires that anyone wanting access to the share must supply the correct password. With user-level security, a request to access a shared resource is passed through a security provider (either a Windows&nbsp;NT Server or NetWare server, utilizing system policies) which grants or denies the request.</P>
<P CLASS="t">The two systems have a notable difference in user permissions:</P>
<UL><LI>On Windows 95, if a user belongs to a group that has access to a resosurce, the user has access to the resource, even if the user belongs to another group that does not have access.</LI></UL><UL><LI>On Windows&nbsp;NT 4.0, if a user belongs to a group that does not have access to a resource, the user does not have access, even if the user belongs to another group that does have access.</LI></UL><P></P>
<P CLASS="t">For most effective security, critical resources should always be shared from Windows&nbsp;NT computers.</P>
<P CLASS="t">Each user's Recycle bin on a Windows&nbsp;NT Workstation computer is secure, provided the bin is on an NTFS drive or partition. Windows 95 doesn't support NTFS.</P>
<P CLASS="t">For more information about security in Windows&nbsp;NT see Chapter 6, "Windows&nbsp;NT Workstation Security." For more information about security in Windows 95, see the <I>Windows 95 Resource Kit.</I></P></BODY></HTML>
