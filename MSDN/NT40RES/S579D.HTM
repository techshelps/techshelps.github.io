<H3>Universal Printer Driver</H3><P CLASS="t">The Universal printer driver (Unidriver) is sometimes referred to as the <I>raster</I> <I>driver</I> because it supports raster graphics printing. The Unidriver can carry out requests on most types of printers. Each print device vendor provides a device-specific minidriver (called a <I>characterization file</I>) that works with the Unidriver to communicate with its print devices.</P>
<P CLASS="t">This driver includes support for 24-bit color, scaleable TrueType fonts, device fonts, compression-run length encoding (RLE), and Tag Image File Format (TIFF) version 4.0. It also includes mechanisms that provide for smaller, more efficient bitmaps. These mechanisms include ignoring whitespace and supporting <I>rules</I>. (Hewlett-Packard LaserJet and compatible print devices use rules to print repeating elements on a page—such as bullets in a list—by repeating the information from a single bit of source code.)</P>
<P CLASS="t">The Universal printer driver consists of the following component files: </P>
<UL><LI>Rasdd.dll is the printer graphics driver for printer languages based on raster (bitmap) images, including PCL, and most dot matrix printer languages.</LI></UL><UL><LI>Rasddui.dll is the printer interface driver.</LI></UL><UL><LI>Raster minidriver is the characterization data file. The filename for this component depends on the print device or printer family. Check the documentation that accompanies your print device.</LI></UL><P></P>
<P></P>
<P CLASS="t">The Windows&nbsp;NT Universal driver is a generic, text only (TTY) driver. It prints only text, and it prints it in the native font of the print device, regardless of any formatting in the original document.</P></BODY></HTML>
