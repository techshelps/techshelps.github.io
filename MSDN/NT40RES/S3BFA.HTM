<H2>Troubleshooting Startup Problems on x86-based Computers</H2><P CLASS="t">There are several things that can prevent a computer from successfully completing startup. The first step in figuring out what may be causing a problem is to determine whether the problem is occurring before the operating system takes control. If you do not see the boot loader screen on an x86-based computer, the problem may be due to a hardware failure, the Master Boot Record, Partition Tables, or the Partition Boot Sector, which might be damaged.</P>
<P CLASS="t">There are several ways such damage can happen, including viruses. On x86-based computers, viruses use BIOS interrupt (INT) 13 calls to install themselves, so they are operating-system independent. Windows NT traps BIOS INT 13 calls while it is running, but cannot protect itself when the computer is started from an MS-DOS bootable floppy disk or is dual-booted by using MS-DOS. The Knowledge Base contains several articles about protecting your computer from viruses and recovering from problems with viruses.</P>
<P CLASS="t">If the problem occurs after selecting Windows NT from the boot loader screen, files that are needed by the operating system might be missing or corrupt. </P>
<P CLASS="t">If you have installed new hardware or new drivers, they could be causing the problem.</P></BODY></HTML>
