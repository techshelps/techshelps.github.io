<H3>Physical Security Considerations</H3><P CLASS="t">The physical security considerations described for minimal and standard security configurations also apply here. In addition, you might want to examine the physical link provided by your computer network, and in some cases use controls built in to certain hardware platforms to restrict who can turn on the computer.</P>
<H4><A NAME="sec0"></A>Networks and Security</H4><P CLASS="t">When you put a computer on a network, you add an access route to the computer, and you'll want that route to be secure. User validation and protections on files and other objects are sufficient for standard-level security, but for high-level security you'll need to make sure the network itself is secure, or in some cases isolate the computer completely.</P>
<P CLASS="t">The two risks from network connections are other network users and unauthorized network taps. If everyone on the network has the security clearance needed to access your secure computer, you will probably prefer to include the computer in the network to make it easier for these people to access data on the computer. </P>
<P CLASS="t">If the network is entirely contained in a secure building, the risk of unauthorized taps is minimized or eliminated. If the cabling must pass through unsecured areas, use optical fiber links rather than twisted pair to foil attempts to tap the wire and collect transmitted data.</P>
<P CLASS="t">If your installation needs access to the Internet, be aware of the security issues involved in providing access to—and from—the Internet community. Chapter 2, "Server Security on the Internet," in the <I>Windows&nbsp;NT</I> <I>Server Internet Guide </I>contains information on using network topology to provide security. </P>
<H4><A NAME="sec1"></A>Controlling Access to the Computer</H4><P CLASS="t">No computer will ever be completely secure if people other the than authorized user can physically access it. For maximum security on a computer that is not physically secure (locked safely away), follow all or some of the following security measures: </P>
<UL><LI>If the computer has a floppy disk drive, set the Boot.ini time-out to 0. This disables the floppy disk drive on startup. If the computer doesn't require a floppy disk drive, remove it.</LI></UL><UL><LI>The CPU should have a case that cannot be opened without a key. The key should be stored safely away from the computer.</LI></UL><UL><LI>The entire hard disk should be NTFS.</LI></UL><UL><LI>If the computer doesn't require network access, remove the network card.</LI></UL><P></P>
<H4><A NAME="sec2"></A>Controlling Access to the Power Switch</H4><P CLASS="t">You might choose to keep unauthorized users away from the power or reset switches on the computer, particularly if your computer's rights policy denies them the right to shut down the computer. The most secure computers (other than those in locked and guarded rooms) expose only the computer's keyboard, monitor, mouse, and (when appropriate) printer to users. The CPU and removable media drives can be locked away where only specifically authorized personnel can access them.</P>
<P CLASS="t">On many hardware platforms, the system can be protected using a <I>power-on password. </I>A power-on password prevents unauthorized personnel from starting an operating system other than Windows&nbsp;NT, which would compromise system security. Power-on passwords are a function of the computer hardware, not the operating system software. Therefore the procedure for setting up the power-on password depends on the type of computer and is available in the vendor's documentation supplied with the system.</P></BODY></HTML>
