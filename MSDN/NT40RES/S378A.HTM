<H2>Applications and the Cache</H2><P CLASS="t">Cache bottlenecks on workstations are uncommon. More often, the Performance Monitor cache counter values are used as indicators of application behavior. Although some large database applications, such as the Microsoft SQL Server, bypass the cache and do their own caching, most use the file system cache.</P>
<P CLASS="t">Data requested by an application is first mapped into the cache and then copied from there. Data changed by applications is written from the cache to disk by the Lazy Writer system thread or by a write-through call from the application. Thus, watching the cache is like watching your application I/O.</P>
<P CLASS="t">Remember, however, that if an application uses the cache infrequently, cache activity will have an insignificant effect on the system, the disks, and on memory.</P></BODY></HTML>
