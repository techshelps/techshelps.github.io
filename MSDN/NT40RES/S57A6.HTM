<H3>16-Bit Windows Network Clients</H3><P CLASS="t">There is little difference between the different versions of the 16-bit Windows platforms. They all support printing from MS-DOS-based applications and from Windows-based applications by using the 16-bit printer driver installed on the computer. They typically send jobs to a Windows&nbsp;NT print server by using one of the following MS Network client redirectors:</P>
<UL><LI>LAN Manager </LI></UL><UL><LI>Microsoft Network Client 3.0 for Windows</LI></UL><UL><LI>Windows for Workgroups built-in redirector</LI></UL><P></P>
<P CLASS="t">The MS-Network redirectors send jobs by using the following protocols:</P>
<UL><LI>NetBEUI</LI></UL><UL><LI>NWLink</LI></UL><UL><LI>TCP/IP</LI></UL><P></P>
<P CLASS="t">The Windows&nbsp;NT print server receives the job through the Windows&nbsp;NT Server service, which typically does not alter the print job. 16-bit Windows clients might also run third-party software for sending jobs to other print servers, such as LPR software for sending print jobs to UNIX print servers. This software is often able to send jobs to Windows&nbsp;NT as well. </P></BODY></HTML>
