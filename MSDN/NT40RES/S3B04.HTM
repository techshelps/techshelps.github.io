<H1>Appendix C - Port Reference for MS TCP/IP </H1><P CLASS="t">In TCP/IP, a <I>port</I> is the mechanism that allows a computer to simultaneously support multiple communication sessions with computers and programs on the network. A port is basically a refinement of an IP address; a computer that receives a packet from the network can further refine the destination of the packet by using a unique port number that is determined when the connection is established. A number of "well known" ports have reserved numbers that correspond to predetermined functions.</P>
<P CLASS="t">This appendix describes the Windows&nbsp;NT Server and Windows&nbsp;NT Workstation default port assignments for TCP/IP and User Datagram Protocol (UDP). The Services file controls port assignments used by Windows&nbsp;NT Server and Windows&nbsp;NT Workstation. The Services file is located in the \systemroot\Winnt\System32\Drivers\Etc\Services directory. </P></BODY></HTML>
