<H3>The Registry Hierarchy</H3><P CLASS="t">The Registry is structured as a set of subtrees of keys that contain per-computer and per-user databases. The per-computer information includes information about hardware and software installed on the computer. The per-user information includes the information in user profiles, such as desktop settings, individual preferences for certain software, and personal printer and network settings. In versions of Windows for MS-DOS, per-computer information was saved in the Win.ini and System.ini files, but it was not possible to save separate information for individual users.</P>
<P CLASS="t">In the Windows&nbsp;NT Registry, each individual key can contain data items called <I>value entries</I> and can also contain additional <I>subkeys.</I> In the Registry structure, keys are analogous to directories, and the value entries are analogous to files.</P>
<P CLASS="t">Figure 23.5 shows the subtrees of the Windows NT Registry.</P>

<P>Figure 23.5    The subtrees of the Windows&nbsp;NT Registry</P>
<P CLASS="t">Each of these subtrees is described in detail later in this chapter. Each of the root key names begins with "HKEY_" to indicate to software developers that this is a <I>handle</I> that can be used by a program. A handle is a value used to uniquely identify a resource so that a program can access it. </P>
