<H3>The $OEM$\<I>drive_letter</I> Directories </H3><P CLASS="t">The $OEM$\<I>drive_letter</I> directories are used to hold files that are to be copied by the Setup program to corresponding drives on the destination computers. For example, files in the $OEM$\C directory will be copied to drive C on the destination computer during text mode setup.</P>
<P CLASS="t">Place files for applications that you want to install along with Windows&nbsp;NT Workstation in subdirectories of the $OEM$\<I>drive_letter</I> directories on the distribution sharepoint. The files in these subdirectories must have short filenames. To rename them with long filenames after they have been copied to the destination computer, list them in a file named $$rename.txt, in the same directory.</P>
<P CLASS="t">Applications included in the $OEM$\<I>drive_letter</I> directories must support a scripted (silent) installation; to include applications that require interactive installation, use the <B>sysdiff</B> utility.</P>
<P CLASS="t">Setup uses commands specified in the $OEM$\Cmdlines.txt file to install applications or copy files that are available in subdirectories of $OEM$\<I>drive_letter</I> on the distribution sharepoint. You can use these commands to invoke a Win95-style INF file, run the<B> sysdiff </B>command, or perform other actions. </P>
<P CLASS="t">For example, to install MS Office on the C drive, in the \MSOffice directory, place the files in $OEM$\C\MSOffice. Then specify the command to install the application in the $OEM$\Cmdlines.txt file.</P>
<P CLASS="t">You can also place files that you only want copied (but not "installed") in subdirectories of $OEM$\<I>drive_letter</I>. For example, if you have written help files that cover policies and procedures used in your organization, you can place them in a subdirectory of $OEM$\C. Then use a command in the $OEM$\Cmdlines.txt file to copy them to the destination computers.</P></BODY></HTML>
