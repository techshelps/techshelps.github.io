<H3>Dot-Matrix Printer Fonts</H3><P CLASS="t">Dot-matrix printers support device fonts and printable screen fonts. Usually, a dot-matrix printer includes only a limited range of internal device fonts. Typically, fixed-spacing fonts are supplied in a variety of characters-per-inch (CPI) sizes and are conventionally named "<I>typeface</I> <I>xx</I>CPI," where <I>typeface </I>is the typeface name and <I>xx</I> is the number of characters per inch. Distinguishing a device font on a dot matrix printer is usually as easy as checking for the CPI designation at the end of the font name, such as Courier 10 CPI. </P>
<P CLASS="t">Through the Universal printer driver, dot-matrix printers can also support TrueType. When you use TrueType fonts on a dot-matrix printer, Windows&nbsp;NT sends a rasterized graphics image to the printer.</P>
<P CLASS="t">Dot-matrix printers do not provide landscape device fonts, but vector and TrueType screen fonts can be printed in any resolution or orientation. Dot-matrix device fonts are faster but less flexible than screen fonts. </P>
<P CLASS="t">Dot-matrix printers are typically distinguished as either 9-pin or 24-pin printers (but not limited to these):</P>
<UL><LI>9-pin dot-matrix printers such as the Epson 9-pin and IBM Proprinter series usually print in a 1.67:1 aspect ratio. The Windows&nbsp;NT Epson 9-pin driver supports resolutions of 120x72 (1.67:1 aspect ratio), 120x144 (1:1.2), and 240x144 (1.67:1). </LI></UL><UL><LI>24-pin dot-matrix printers such as the Epson 24-pin and IBM Proprinter 24 series can print in 120x180 resolution (1:1.5 aspect ratio), 180x180 (1:1), and 360x180 (2:1). Some others, such as the NEC 24-pin, provide a 360x360 resolution. The 180x180 resolution is usually best for printing raster screen fonts. In 180x180 resolution, these printers can print 1:1 aspect ratio screen fonts, such as the E set (96x96 dpi) and the F set (120x120 dpi). E set fonts will be available at about 50 percent, and F set fonts at 75 percent of normal point sizes. A true 180x180 dpi screen font set is available by special order from Epson of America. </LI></UL><P></P>
<P CLASS="t">Some 24-pin dot-matrix printers, such as the Epson and NEC printers, also support font cards or cartridges. You can use these fonts if the Windows&nbsp;NT driver for that printer supports them. To use a font card or cartridge, see "Font Cartridges" later in this chapter.</P></BODY></HTML>
