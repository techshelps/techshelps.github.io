<H2>Auditing Security Events</H2><P CLASS="t">Windows&nbsp;NT includes auditing features you can use to collect information about how your system is being used. These features also allow you to monitor events related to system security, to identify any security breaches, and to determine the extent and location of any damage. The level of audited events is adjustable to suit the needs of your organization. Some organizations need little auditing information, whereas others would be willing to trade some performance and disk space for detailed information they could use to analyze their system.</P>
<P></P>
<P CLASS="t"><B>Note</B></P>
<P>Remember that when you enable auditing, there is a small performance overhead for each audit check the system performs. </P>
<P></P>
<P CLASS="t">Windows&nbsp;NT can track events related to the operating system itself and to individual applications. Each application can define its own auditable events. Definitions of these events are added to the Registry when the application is installed on your Windows&nbsp;NT computer.</P>
<P CLASS="t">Audit events are identified to the system by the event source module name (which corresponds to a specific event type in the Registry) and an event ID. </P>
<P CLASS="t">In addition to listing events by event ID, the security log in Event Viewer lists them by category. The following categories of events are displayed in the Security Log. (Those in parentheses are found in the <B>Audit Policy</B> dialog box of User Manager.)</P>
