<H1>Chapter 30 - Microsoft TCP/IP and Related Services for Windows&nbsp;NT</H1><P CLASS="t">The Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) suite is a standard set of networking protocols that govern how data passes between networked computers. With TCP/IP you can communicate with Windows&nbsp;NT platforms, with devices that use other Microsoft networking products, and with non-Microsoft systems (such as UNIX systems). TCP/IP is the primary protocol of the Internet and the World Wide Web. It is also the primary protocol for many private <I>internetworks</I>, which are networks that connect local area networks (LANs) together.</P>
<P CLASS="t">For procedural information about installing and configuring TCP/IP under Windows&nbsp;NT, see the online Help. For more detailed information about TCP/IP and its integration with Windows&nbsp;NT and other networking products, see the <I>Microsoft Windows&nbsp;NT Server Resource Kit Networking Guide</I>.</P></BODY></HTML>
