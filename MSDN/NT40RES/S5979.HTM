<H3>Example 3: Requesting Read and Write Access as Object Owner</H3><P CLASS="t">In this example, FredMgr is denied access to a file, but because he is the owner of the file he can change permissions so that he does have access. Windows&nbsp;NT knows by reading FredMgr's access token that he is a member of the Mgrs group. Processing of the ACL will stop as soon as Windows&nbsp;NT sees that NoAccess (None) is assigned to the Mgrs group, even though the other two ACEs allow Read, Write, and Execute access for FredMgr. </P>
<P><img src="xwr_e13.gif"></P>
<P CLASS="t">However, after failing to gain access by means of the discretionary ACL, Windows&nbsp;NT notices that FredMgr is the owner of the object. Because of this, he is granted ReadControl and WRITE_DAC automatically. Because this is all the access he is asking for, his request is granted. </P>
<P CLASS="t">If FredMgr had asked for any other access in addition to ReadControl and WRITE_DAC, the request would be denied even though Fred is the object's owner. In this case, FredMgr receives the following message:</P>
<P CLASS="spacing"><BR></P>
<PRE>G:\FILE2.TXT
You do not have permission to open this file. 
See the owner of the file or an administrator to obtain permission.
</PRE>
<P CLASS="t">In this case, because FredMgr is the owner, he can change his own permissions to grant himself appropriate access to the file.</P></BODY></HTML>
