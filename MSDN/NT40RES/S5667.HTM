<H3>Hardware Requirements</H3><P CLASS="t">When choosing where to deploy Windows&nbsp;95 and Windows&nbsp;NT Workstation, you must make sure that destination computers meet the hardware requirements for the operating system they will be using. Also, make sure that the operating system provides support for all of the hardware devices (such as video cards, network adapters, etc.) being used on the destination computer. In many cases, your existing hardware inventory will determine where each operating system is deployed. </P>
<P CLASS="t">Windows&nbsp;95 is designed to have less demanding hardware requirements, and will work very well with existing hardware. You can run Windows&nbsp;95 on a computer with the following minimum hardware configuration:</P>
<UL><LI>386DX or higher processor</LI></UL><UL><LI>4 MB of memory (8 MB recommended)</LI></UL><UL><LI>35–40 MB of free hard disk space</LI></UL><UL><LI>VGA or higher resolution graphics card</LI></UL><P></P>
<P CLASS="t">Windows&nbsp;NT Workstation 4.0 has higher hardware requirements for Intel-based platforms:</P>
<UL><LI>486/33 or higher processor</LI></UL><UL><LI>12 MB of memory (16 MB recommended)</LI></UL><UL><LI>120 MB of free disk space</LI></UL><UL><LI>CD-ROM drive (or access to CD-ROM drive over the network)</LI></UL><UL><LI>VGA or higher resolution graphics card</LI></UL><P></P>
<P CLASS="t">Windows&nbsp;NT Workstation also supports symmetric multiprocessing (SMP) configurations and RISC-based platforms such as MIPS, Alpha, and the PowerPC. </P>
<P CLASS="t">Windows&nbsp;95 provides a broader set of device driver support. Check the Windows&nbsp;NT Hardware Compatibility List (HCL) to ensure that Windows&nbsp;NT drivers exist for all of your devices.</P></BODY></HTML>
