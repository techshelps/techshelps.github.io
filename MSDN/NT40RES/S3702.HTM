<H3>Logging Current Activity</H3><P CLASS="t"><I>Logging</I> is recording information on the current activity of selected objects and computers for later viewing. You can also collect data from multiple systems into a single <I>log file</I>. Log files contain detailed data for detecting performance problems or other detailed analysis. For capacity planning, it lets you view trends over a long period, and append or relog files. You can chart, report, or export log file data to compare files or examine patterns.</P>
<P></P>
<P CLASS="t"><B>Important</B></P>
<P>Opening a log that is collecting data will stop the log and clear all counter settings. You can't peek at the log from chart or report view because the views share the same data source. Changing Data From affects all views, even the running log.</P>
<P>To peek at a running log, start a second copy of Performance Monitor, and set Data From to the running log. You can chart or report on all data logged until the time you open it. Newly collected data will not be added to your snapshot of the log file.</P>
<P></P>
<H4><A NAME="sec0"></A>Setting Logging Options</H4><P CLASS="t">Log view has a display area for listing objects and their corresponding computers you selected with the <B>Add To Log</B> command on the <B>Edit</B> menu. All counters and instances are logged for a selected object.</P>
<P CLASS="t">Choose the <B>Log</B> command on the <B>Options</B> menu to fill in or change the information shown in the gray boxes in the Log view, to start or stop logging, and to change the method used for updating the log values.</P>
<P CLASS="t">The Log view displays a list of objects and computers along with the current file size and the following items that you can specify in the <B>Log Options</B> dialog box:</P>
<UL><LI>Complete path and name of the log file</LI></UL><UL><LI>Log Interval in seconds, from 1 to 3600 seconds (1 hour)</LI></UL><UL><LI>Status, either Collecting or Closed</LI></UL><P></P>
<P CLASS="t">After you start logging, a log symbol with the changing total file size appears on the right side of the status bar and remains there in all four views.</P>
<P CLASS="t">Notice also that when a remote computer from which you are logging data shuts down, a bookmark comment is added to the log file. Another bookmark comment is added when that computer later reconnects and logging starts again.</P>
<P CLASS="t">For specific instructions on how to change log options or start or stop logging, see the "Working with Information from Log Files" topic in Performance Monitor Help.</P>
<P CLASS="t">For specific instructions on adding selections for logging or saving your log selection settings, see the "Adding to a Log" topic in Performance Monitor Help.</P>
<H4><A NAME="sec1"></A>Adding Bookmarks</H4><P CLASS="t">Log files become more usable when you add <I>bookmarks </I>at various points while logging. With bookmarks you can highlight major points of interest or describe the circumstances under which the file was created and then easily return to these locations when you work with the log file. The <B>Bookmark</B> command becomes available when you start logging.</P>
<P CLASS="t">To add a bookmark, click <B>Bookmark</B> on the <B>Options</B> menu or click the <B>Bookmark</B> button on the toolbar.</P></BODY></HTML>
