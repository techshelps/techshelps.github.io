<H1>Chapter 6 - Windows&nbsp;NT Security</H1><P CLASS="t"><I>Computer security</I> refers to the protection of all components—hardware, software, and stored data—of a computer or a group of computers from damage, theft, or unauthorized use. A computer security plan that is well thought out, implemented, and monitored makes authorized computer use easy and unauthorized use or accidental damage difficult or impossible. </P>
<P CLASS="t">Microsoft included security as part of the initial design specifications for Windows&nbsp;NT, and it is pervasive in the operating system. The security model includes components to control who accesses which objects (such as files and shared printers), which actions an individual can take on an object, and which events are audited.</P>
<P CLASS="t">This chapter provides an overview of both the security features and the Windows&nbsp;NT security model itself. It describes the components that make up the model, and explains how Windows&nbsp;NT tracks each user and each securable object. It shows how Windows&nbsp;NT validates access requests and how it audits activities performed on protected objects.</P>
<P CLASS="t">This chapter also describes three levels of security—minimal, standard, and high-level—with recommendations for both assessing your needs and for implementing the most appropriate security measures for your organization. It concludes with a section describing C2 security.</P></BODY></HTML>
