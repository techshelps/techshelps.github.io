<H3>Registry Incompatibility</H3><P CLASS="t">The registries in Windows&nbsp;NT and Windows 95 use different file formats and are structured differently, rendering the two incompatible for migrating system and application settings. For example, although both systems support roaming user profiles (desktop settings that follow users, by means of their user accounts, from computer to computer), users accessing both Windows 95 and Windows&nbsp;NT computers need two user profiles. Changes made to one will not affect the other. For more information, see Chapter 3, "Managing User Work Environments," in <I>Microsoft Windows&nbsp;NT 4.0 Server Concepts and Planning</I>.</P></BODY></HTML>
