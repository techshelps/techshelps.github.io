<H3><A NAME="sec0"></A>Computer Administration/Configuration Tools</H3><UL><LI>SrvInstW is a wizard for installing and deleting services and device drivers. This is a GUI form of the Instsrv.exe application that now also has increased functionality for detailing service parameters.</LI></UL><H3><A NAME="sec1"></A>Computer Diagnostic Tools</H3><UL><LI>Remote Kill is a service with both GUI and command-line clients. It enables a user to enumerate and kill a process on a remote computer. It also combines some of the functionality of Tlist.exe and Kill.exe.</LI></UL><UL><LI>ShowAcls is a utility that enumerates the access rights for files, folders, and trees. It also allows masking to enumerate only specific ACLs.</LI></UL><P></P>
<H3><A NAME="sec2"></A>Desktop Tools</H3><UL><LI>Desktop Themes from the Windows 95 Plus Pack are included now along with several new Windows NT-specific themes. These themes include a variety of visual, sound, and symbolic components that can enhance the look and feel of your Windows NT 4.0 desktop. Each desktop theme includes a background wallpaper, a screen saver, a color scheme, and a set of sounds, cursors, icons, and fonts.</LI></UL><UL><LI>MultiDesk, Multidsk.exe, is a desktop switching program for Windows NT 4.0. It customizes the desktop wallpaper and colors, and separates executing programs into new desk spaces.</LI></UL><P></P>
<H3><A NAME="sec3"></A>Disk/Fault Tolerance Tools</H3><UL><LI>DiskProbe, Dskprobe.exe, is a sector editor for Windows NT Workstation and Windows NT Server that enables a user with local Administrator rights to edit, save, and copy data directly on the physical hard drive that is not accessible in any other way.</LI></UL><UL><LI>DiskMap produces a detailed report on the configuration of the hard disk that you specify. It provides information from the Registry about disk characteristics and geometry, the Master Boot Record, and the Partition Table for all the partitions on the disk.</LI></UL><P></P>
<H3><A NAME="sec4"></A>File Tools</H3><UL><LI>ForFiles is a utility that enables batch processing of files in a folder or tree. You can run a command or give arguments to certain files. For example, you can run the <B>type</B> command on all files in a tree with the *.txt extension.

<H3><A NAME="sec6"></A>Network/Server Administration Tools</H3><UL><LI>Remote Console is a client/server application that enables you to run a command-line session remotely, within which you may launch any other application. Few tools besides Remote Console run applications remotely. REMOTE is not a service, but simply redirects standard input and output, so console programs that take control of the video memory and the keyboard do not work with REMOTE. Along with RCMD and RSH, Remote Console offers you a new way to run consoles remotely and to take control of a CMD session.</LI></UL><P></P>
