<H3>[operating systems] Section</H3><P CLASS="t">This section contains the list of available operating systems. Each entry includes the path to the boot partition for the operating system, the string to display in the boot loader screen, and optional parameters. There is an example of the use of this section of the Boot.ini file in the section titled "Boot Loader Screen (x86-based Computers)," presented earlier in this chapter.</P>
<P CLASS="t">The Boot.ini file supports starting of multiple versions of Windows&nbsp;NT operating systems, as well as starting one other operating system. The other operating systems that can be included in the Boot.ini file are Windows&nbsp;95, MS-DOS, and OS/2. The section "Configuring the Computer for Dual-booting and Triple-booting," presented earlier in this chapter, contains more information about the other operating systems.</P></BODY></HTML>
