<H3>Monitor the Systems Management Server Job Status</H3><P CLASS="t">Monitor the status of the job by selecting that job in the Job Properties dialog box, clicking on the Status button, and viewing the Sending and Working columns in the Job Status dialog box. </P>
<P CLASS="t">After the job has had a chance to propagate, you can check on details of the job. In the small network you have set up in the lab, this could take as little as 30 minutes. In your production network, you'll need to allow more time. To view the details of the job, select Details from the Job Status dialog box. The Job Status Details dialog box appears.</P>
<P CLASS="t">When the Status column changes to Complete, the job has been distributed. The total duration of the job depends on a number of factors, including the parameters set for the job and the behavior of your users (who must log on to accept the Systems Management Server Package). </P>
<P CLASS="t">For more information on jobs, see Chapter 11, "Jobs," in the <I>Systems Management Server Administrator's Guide</I>.</P></BODY></HTML>
