<H3>Server Printing</H3><P CLASS="t">The second way to set up printing is to have one Windows&nbsp;NT Workstation function as print server. One computer in the LAN creates the printer and shares it with other computers.</P>
<P CLASS="t">Windows&nbsp;NT Workstation can support a small (maximum 10 connections) local area network (LAN) for printing. Because it is not designed to provide server functions, Windows&nbsp;NT Workstation has the following limitations that you need to understand in order to get satisfactory network printing performance.</P>
<P>    1.    Services for Macintosh and File and Print Services for NetWare are not available with Windows&nbsp;NT Workstation. Consequently, Macintosh computers and NetWare network clients can't print to a print device served by a Windows&nbsp;NT Workstation.</P>
<P>    2.    Spooling is given a lower priority on Windows&nbsp;NT 4.0 Workstation than on Windows&nbsp;NT 4.0 Server. This means that a Windows&nbsp;NT Workstation functioning as a print server will print somewhat slower than a Windows&nbsp;NT Server. Also, if the print server is also used as someone's work machine, that person may find his or her applications running a little sluggishly while someone is printing.</P>
<P>    3.    You are limited to 10 connections, and they must be within the same LAN.</P>
<P></P>
<P CLASS="t">In this scenario, printer driver settings are controlled by the print server computer. A single queue appears on every computer connected to the printer, letting each user see where his or her print job is in relation to others waiting to print. Error messages, therefore, appear on everyone's computer, so that anyone can know to refill the paper tray, clear the paper jam, or plug the printer back in. This method also allows you to have a single administrative log if you audit your printing events. </P></BODY></HTML>
