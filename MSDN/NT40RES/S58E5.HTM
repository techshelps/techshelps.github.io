<H3>Security</H3><P CLASS="t">Windows&nbsp;NT has a uniform security architecture designed to provide a safe environment to run mission-critical applications as judged by government security standards. Windows 3.5 has been evaluated by the United States National Computer Security Center as meeting the requirements of C2 level security. Windows NT 4.0 with networking is currently undergoing this evaluation.  </P>
<P CLASS="t">Windows NT 3.51 is being evaluated in the UK and Germany for a F-C2&nbsp;/&nbsp;E3 security rating. Windows&nbsp;NT&nbsp;4.0 will be subject to the same standards.  </P>
<P CLASS="t">The Windows&nbsp;NT&nbsp;4.0 architectural changes do not affect the integral security subsystem or the Security Reference Monitor in the Executive. They are not expected to affect the U.S. or European security evaluations of Windows&nbsp;NT&nbsp;4.0.</P>
