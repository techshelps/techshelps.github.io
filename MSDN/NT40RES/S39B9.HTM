<H1>Chapter 3 - Deploying Windows NT Workstation on an Existing Client-Server Network</H1><P CLASS="t">There are several methods for upgrading your existing network clients to Windows&nbsp;NT Workstation 4.0.</P>
<UL><LI>Microsoft Systems Management Server provides the most control, speed, security, and flexibility.</LI></UL><UL><LI>On smaller LANs, users or technicians can run unattended setup from individual computers, using an answer file. Control of the process is shared with the users or technicians who initiate the unattended setup.</LI></UL><UL><LI>Administrators can modify logon scripts so that unattended setup runs automatically when a user logs on to the network. </LI></UL><UL><LI>Administrators can create a batch (.bat) file to run unattended setup from individual desktops. They can then send the batch file as an embedded link in e-mail, and the users can run the batch file at their convenience. </LI></UL><P></P>
<P CLASS="t">"Pull" installations are those in which the user performs the upgrade, using tools provided by the administrator. "Push" installations are those in which the upgrade is performed for the user by the administrator or technicians, either directly or through software such as Systems Management Server. The choice of which type to use depends on several factors, including the corporate culture, the willingness of users to perform the upgrade, and scheduling. For example, if you need all the computers in a department to be upgraded on a certain day, a push installation might be required, since some users might be out of the office that day, or simply might not have a chance to perform the upgrade that day. Push installations can often be done outside regular business hours to minimize the disruption of the users' workday. In many cases, you can ask users to perform an upgrade within a certain time period, after which the upgrade will be mandatory and will be performed for them. This approach is especially easy with Systems Management Server. This chapter discusses how you can use Systems Management Server to deploy Windows&nbsp;NT Workstation 4.0 throughout an existing client-server network.</P></BODY></HTML>
