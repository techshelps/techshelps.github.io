<H3>Deleting Serial Ports</H3><P CLASS="t">You can configure communication ports as described in the previous section. You might also need to delete one or more COM ports. Communication ports should be deleted by using the Ports option in Control Panel. </P>
<H4><A NAME="sec0"></A>To delete a COM port by using Control Panel</H4><P> <FONT FACE="symbol">·</FONT>    In Control Panel, double-click Ports. In the <B>Ports</B> dialog box, select the port you want to delete, then click <B>Delete</B>.</P>
<P></P>
<P CLASS="t">Sometimes, if you use Control Panel to delete a COM port that was created manually, the process leaves unwanted data in the Registry. If the deleted COM port is generating error events in the Event Log, you can remove the port directly from the Registry. </P>
<H4><A NAME="sec1"></A>To delete a COM port by using a Registry editor</H4><P>    1.    In a Registry editor, locate the <I>Serialxxxxx</I> subkey for the port in the following Registry path: </P>
<P>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System<BR>    \CurrentControlSet<BR>        \Services<BR>            \Serial<BR>                \Parameters</P>
<P></P>
<P></P>
<P>Tip</P>
<P>To identify the <I>Serialxxxxx</I> subkey for the COM port, double-click the <B>DosDevices</B> value entry for a <I>Serialxxxxx</I> subkey. The value entry identifies the port by number, such as COM3.</P>
<P></P>
<P>    2.    Delete the <I>Serialxxxxx</I> subkey for the COM port. In <B>Regedt32</B> or <B>Regedit</B>, from the <B>Edit</B> menu, click <B>Delete</B>.</P>
<P></P>
<P CLASS="t">If the communication port is active and detected by the Hardware Recognizer, the port reappears in the Control Panel <B>Ports</B> list when the system is restarted. If you do not want a built-in serial port to be active in Windows&nbsp;NT, you must disable the hardware by using a tool such as the computer's CMOS setup program.</P>
