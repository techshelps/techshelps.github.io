<H3>Network Protocols </H3><P CLASS="t">For best performance, all networking protocols and services in Windows&nbsp;NT Workstation are completely 32-bit. These include TCP/IP, support for the Internet, Dial-Up networking, NetBEUI, peer-to-peer networking, Client Services for NetWare (with support for NetWare NDS networks), and more. Organizations can enjoy the following benefits from this rich set of integrated networking support:</P>
<UL><LI>Easy installation and integration with existing network systems.</LI></UL><UL><LI>Faster data I/O across the network <FONT FACE="Symbol">¾</FONT> ideal for taking advantage of client-server applications.</LI></UL><UL><LI>Greater stability than real-mode redirectors.</LI></UL><UL><LI>More than one redirector can be run at one time, thereby enabling access to servers for multiple networks without having to reload the operating system for a new network client. For example, a Microsoft Windows&nbsp;NT Workstation client can access both NetWare servers and existing mainframe servers at the same time.</LI></UL><UL><LI>Seamless networking in the Windows&nbsp;NT Workstation 4.0 user interface; users can browse the server for multiple networks in Network Neighborhood, all within the same name space — users don't need to know which type of network they are browsing.</LI></UL><P></P>
<H4><A NAME="sec0"></A>TCP/IP</H4><P CLASS="t">To provide the best network interoperability over WANs and network routers, include TCP/IP in your ideal configuration. The 32-bit TCP/IP stack included with Windows&nbsp;NT Workstation incorporates both SLIP and PPP. Microsoft TCP/IP, in combination with Windows&nbsp;NT Workstation, provides a scalable solution for enterprise networks that include a mix of system types. </P>
<P CLASS="t">When TCP/IP is used as the enterprise networking protocol, an IP addressing scheme is needed for your organization. If your servers run Windows&nbsp;NT Server, you can use Dynamic Host Control Protocol (DHCP) and Windows Internet Naming Service (WINS) for easy TCP/IP address management. With DHCP, administrators can centrally define global and subnet TCP/IP parameters for interconnected networks. The DHCP service dynamically configures the IP address and subnet mask of each workstation. For name resolution on TCP/IP internetworks, use WINS Servers or LMHosts files.</P>
<P CLASS="t">Windows&nbsp;NT Workstation allows users to run with more than a single IP address at the same time when using Remote Access Services.</P>
<P CLASS="t">When TCP/IP is used as a transport protocol with Windows&nbsp;NT Workstation, computers can communicate with other kinds of systems such as UNIX workstations and servers, or an IP configured printer, without additional networking software. </P>
<H4><A NAME="sec1"></A>NetBEUI (NetBIOS Extended User Interface)</H4><P CLASS="t">NetBEUI is a small, efficient, and fast protocol tuned for small LANs. It is designed to support department-sized LANs consisting of 20 to 200 workstations. NetBEUI does not support traffic across routers, but provides for both connectionless and connection-oriented traffic on a single network segment. NetBEUI is self-configuring and self-tuning. It can be installed and bound to a network card automatically when Windows&nbsp;NT is installed.</P>
<H4><A NAME="sec2"></A>NWLink IPX/SPX</H4><P CLASS="t">Windows NT includes the NWLink protocol, which is an implementation of the internetworking packet exchange (IPX) and sequenced packet exchange (SPX) transport protocols used by NetWare. NWLink NetBIOS is a Microsoft-enhanced implementation of Novell NetBIOS, and transmits Novell NetBIOS packets between a NetWare server running Novell NetBIOS and a Windows&nbsp;NT computer, or between two Windows&nbsp;NT computers.</P>
<P CLASS="t">The Microsoft implementations of the IPX, SPX, and Novell NetBIOS protocols can seamlessly coexist with other protocols on the same network adapter card. </P>
<P CLASS="t">For instructions on configuring NWLink, see Help.</P>
<H4><A NAME="sec3"></A>DLC (Data Link Control)</H4><P CLASS="t">The DLC protocol provided with Windows&nbsp;NT is used primarily to access IBM mainframe computers, rather than for general networking on Windows&nbsp;NT. For example, Microsoft SNA Server for Windows&nbsp;NT uses the DLC protocol device driver when communicating with mainframes on the token ring interface. DLC is also used to connect to printers that are connected directly to a LAN, rather than to a specific computer.</P>
<P CLASS="t">Windows&nbsp;NT DLC allows Windows&nbsp;NT computers to connect to IBM mainframes using 3270 emulators. You can also connect to IBM AS/400 computers using 5250 emulators. DLC works with either token ring or ethernet media access control (MAC) drivers.</P>
<P CLASS="t">The DLC protocol works with Windows&nbsp;NT-based programs and with MS-DOS-based and 16-bit Windows-based programs.</P>
<H4><A NAME="sec4"></A>AppleTalk Protocol</H4><P CLASS="t">The AppleTalk protocol is used to deliver data to a network destination when a Windows&nbsp;NT Server computer configured with Windows&nbsp;NT Services for Macintosh is available on the network. This makes it possible for PCs and Apple Macintosh workstations to share files and printers.</P>
<P CLASS="t">The AppleTalk protocol is also used by software application developers who are creating cross-platform applications for Windows&nbsp;NT and the Macintosh. When used for transferring files across Ethernet or for remote debugging in this way, Windows&nbsp;NT Server Services for Macintosh is not required on the network.</P>
<H4><A NAME="sec5"></A>Other 32-Bit Network Protocols</H4><P CLASS="t">If you are using another type of network, contact your network vendor regarding the availability of 32-bit, protected-mode network client software. Solutions are available for Banyan Vines networks, and several vendors distribute NFS (network file system) solutions for better integration with UNIX-based systems. </P></BODY></HTML>
