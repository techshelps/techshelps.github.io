<H3>Using Logon Scripts</H3><P CLASS="t">Logon scripts are batch files or executable files that run automatically when a user logs on. They can be used when logging on to a computer running any of the following operating systems: </P>
<UL><LI>Windows&nbsp;NT Workstation</LI></UL><UL><LI>Windows&nbsp;NT Server</LI></UL><UL><LI>Windows&nbsp;95</LI></UL><UL><LI>MS-DOS</LI></UL><P></P>
<P CLASS="t">Logon scripts can configure users' working environments by making network connections and starting applications. You might want to use logon scripts to manage part of the user environment (such as network connections) without managing or dictating the entire environment. Or, you can use logon scripts to create common network connections for multiple users. If you are using LAN&nbsp;Manager 2.x logon scripts, you can continue using them after upgrading to Windows&nbsp;NT Workstation or Windows&nbsp;95.</P>
<P></P>
<P CLASS="t"><B>Note</B></P>
<P>It is important that logon scripts are in place for every user if you are planning to use a system management software such as Microsoft's Systems Management Server. Logon scripts are modified by the management software in order to take inventory of all the computers on the network.</P>
<P></P>
<P CLASS="t">You can assign a different logon script for each user, or create logon scripts for use by multiple users. To assign a user a logon script, designate the path name of the logon script file in the user's account information on the domain controller. Then, whenever that user logs on, the logon script is downloaded and run.</P>
<P CLASS="t">A logon script is always downloaded from the server that validates a user's logon request. To ensure that logon scripts always work for users, logon scripts for all user accounts in a domain should be maintained on every primary domain controller (PDC) and backup domain controller (BDC) in the domain.</P></BODY></HTML>
