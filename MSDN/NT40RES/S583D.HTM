<H2>Performance Data Log Service</H2><P CLASS="t">Performance Data Log Service (PerfLog) is an new tool that logs data from performance counters to a tab-separated or comma-separated variable file. It lets you choose which performance counters you want to log, and it will start new log files automatically at intervals you select. </P>
<P CLASS="t">PerfLog is included on the Windows&nbsp;NT Resource Kit 4.0 CD in the Performance Tools group (\PerfTool\MeasTool\Perflog.exe).</P>
<P CLASS="t">PerfLog logs performance data to a comma-separated or tab-separated text file for later use as input to spreadsheets, databases, and other applications, as well as to Performance Monitor. Unlike Performance Monitor logs, which store data in a compact, multi-dimensional C-language data format, PerfLog logs can be used as direct input without reformatting.</P>
<P CLASS="t">PerfLog uses the same objects and counters as Performance Monitor, but it lets you select which counters you want to log for each instance of an object. You can also select the level of detail you need on an instance and let PerfLog select a set of counters for you.</P>
<P CLASS="t">For more information on PerfLog, see Rktools.hlp.</P></BODY></HTML>
