<H3>Upgrading from Windows&nbsp;95 to Windows&nbsp;NT Workstation</H3><P CLASS="t">Differences in the system registries and hardware device support preclude a software upgrade path from Windows&nbsp;95 to Windows&nbsp;NT Workstation 4.0. Microsoft plans to provide a Windows&nbsp;95–to–Windows&nbsp;NT Workstation upgrade path in the release following Windows&nbsp;NT Workstation 4.0. </P>
<P CLASS="t">To install Windows&nbsp;NT Workstation on a computer that is currently running Windows&nbsp;95, you must perform a fresh installation, rather than upgrading Windows&nbsp;95 with system settings intact. Applications will also need to be re-installed.</P>
<P CLASS="t">Customers planning to upgrade Windows&nbsp;95 must use the following manual upgrade path:</P>
<P>    1.    Check to see if all Windows&nbsp;95 devices and applications are supported by Windows&nbsp;NT Workstation 4.0.</P>
<P>    2.    Install Windows&nbsp;NT Workstation 4.0 into a separate directory on your hard drive. This will create a "dual boot" system.</P>
<P>    3.    Re-install all applications.</P>
<P>    4.    (Optional) Manually delete the Windows&nbsp;95 directory.</P>
<P></P>
<P CLASS="t">You can upgrade to Windows&nbsp;NT Workstation version 4.0 from any of the following operating systems, keeping applications and system settings as you do so:</P>
<UL><LI>Any previous version of Windows&nbsp;NT (versions 3.1, 3.5, and 3.51)</LI></UL><UL><LI>MS-DOS</LI></UL><UL><LI>Windows 3.1 </LI></UL><UL><LI>Windows for Workgroups 3.11</LI></UL><P></P></BODY></HTML>
