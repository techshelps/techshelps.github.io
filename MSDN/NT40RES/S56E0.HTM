<H3>POSIX Compliance</H3><P CLASS="t">POSIX compliance permits UNIX programs to be ported to Windows&nbsp;NT. Windows&nbsp;NT is fully compliant with the Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers (IEEE) standard 1003.1, which is a standard for file naming and identification. </P>
<P CLASS="t">The following POSIX-compliant features are included in the NTFS file system:</P>
<UL><LI><I>Case-sensitive naming</I>. Under POSIX, README.TXT, Readme.txt, and readme.txt are all different files. </LI></UL><UL><LI><I>Hard links</I>. A file can be given more than one name. This allows two different filenames, which can be located in different folders, to point to the same data.</LI></UL><UL><LI><I>Additional time stamps</I>. These show when the file was last accessed or modified.</LI></UL><P></P>
<P CLASS="t"><B>Caution   </B>You must use POSIX-based programs to manage filenames that differ only in case. </P>
<P CLASS="t">Using POSIX-based programs, you can create case-sensitive filenames, where two or more filenames can differ only in case (for example, annm.doc and AnnM.Doc).</P>
<P CLASS="t">While the Windows&nbsp;NT file systems support both case-preservation and case-sensitivity, you cannot use standard commands to manage filenames that differ only in case. (Standard commands include those used at the command-line — such as <B>copy</B>, <B>del</B>, and <B>move</B> — and their My Computer and Windows&nbsp;NT Explorer equivalents.) For example, if you type the following at the command prompt:</P>
<P CLASS="spacing"><BR></P>
<PRE>del AnnM.Doc</PRE>
<P CLASS="t">both annm.doc and AnnM.Doc are deleted.</P>
<P CLASS="t">For more information about POSIX, see Chapter 29, "POSIX Compatibility."</P></BODY></HTML>
