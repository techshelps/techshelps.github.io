<H3>STOP Screens During Installation</H3><P CLASS="t">When you attempt to install Windows&nbsp;NT on a new computer, an unsuccessful installation can result in a STOP screen. When a STOP screen appears, first check the compatibility of the computer and its peripheral hardware. To do this, refer to the latest Windows&nbsp;NT Hardware Compatibility List (HCL). Computers and associated hardware that appear in the HCL were tested to determine how well they work with Windows&nbsp;NT. These computers have gone through rigorous component and compatibility testing by Microsoft. The HCL is available in the Windows&nbsp;NT Resource Kit and is updated frequently with newly tested hardware.</P>
<P CLASS="t">If the hardware you are using is not included on the Windows&nbsp;NT HCL, contact the hardware manufacturer as a first-line resource for available information, newly tested hardware, and/or BIOS and firmware revisions. It may also help to reduce hardware components to a minimum to pinpoint installation conflicts.</P></BODY></HTML>
