<H3>Interprocess Communication</H3><P CLASS="t">The OS/2 subsystem implements all OS/2 IPC mechanisms (semaphores, pipes, shared memory, queues, and signals).</P>
<H4><A NAME="sec0"></A>Named Pipes</H4><P CLASS="t">The OS/2 subsystem implements named pipes on top of the Windows&nbsp;NT named-pipe file system. These are supported transparently between Win32, MS-DOS, Win16, and OS/2 applications, both locally and remotely. Microsoft LAN&nbsp;Manager 2<I>.x</I> named pipe functionality is supported in its entirety.</P>
<H4><A NAME="sec1"></A>Anonymous Pipes</H4><P CLASS="t">Anonymous pipes, including inheritance, are fully supported. They are integrated into the OS/2 file handle space.</P>
<H4><A NAME="sec2"></A>Shared Memory</H4><P CLASS="t">The full functionality of OS/2 1<I>.x</I> shared memory, including Get and Give semantics, is implemented using Windows&nbsp;NT shared memory features. The discardable segments property is ignored. (It is invisible to the OS/2 application.)</P>
<H4><A NAME="sec3"></A>Semaphores</H4><P CLASS="t">The OS/2 subsystem supports the full range of OS/2 1<I>.x</I> semaphore APIs, including RAM semaphores in private and shared memory, system semaphores, and fast-safe RAM semaphores. Association of semaphores with timers and named pipes is fully supported. The OS/2 subsystem uses a combination of the Windows&nbsp;NT semaphore object and the Windows&nbsp;NT event object to implement an OS/2 semaphore.</P>
<H4><A NAME="sec4"></A>Queues</H4><P CLASS="t">OS/2 1<I>.x</I> queues are fully supported, using shared memory between OS/2 processes and OS/2 semaphores as required.</P>
<H4><A NAME="sec5"></A>Signals</H4><P CLASS="t">OS/2 signals are fully supported, using Windows&nbsp;NT APIs to manipulate thread context. The OS/2 subsystem controls the address space of OS/2 processes and uses it to manipulate the register content and the stack of thread 1 of the process to be signaled.</P>
