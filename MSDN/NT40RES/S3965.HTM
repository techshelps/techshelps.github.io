<H2>Decide on the Preferred Client Configuration</H2><P CLASS="t">With the planning and installation teams assembled and educated about Windows&nbsp;NT Workstation 4.0 capabilities, determine the preferred network configuration and preferred feature set for these client computers. The teams will use this configuration for evaluation and testing, prior to full implementation of Windows&nbsp;NT Workstation 4.0 in your organization.</P>
<P CLASS="t">Starting with the ideal configuration, which uses the most functional and best-performing client software, evaluate each feature against your organization's needs and environment to determine whether the feature is appropriate and compatible. </P>
<P CLASS="t">You may want different configurations for different groups. For example, the marketing group might need different features and applications than the human resources. If you are considering different configuration alternatives, repeat the evaluation for each configuration.</P>
<P CLASS="t">The following sections describe feature options and decisions to evaluate in specifying the network client configuration.</P></BODY></HTML>
