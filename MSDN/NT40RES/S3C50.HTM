<H2>Compatibility with Windows 95</H2><P CLASS="t">It would be impossible to satisfy the broad range of home and business computer needs, as well as technology constraints, with a single operating system. For example, "complete reliability" and "real-mode device driver support" are mutually exclusive features that cannot be built into a single operating system. In response to these challenges, Microsoft's strategy is to provide a family of operating systems. Using both Windows 95 and Windows&nbsp;NT in a single network environment, today's corporation gets the best of flexibility, reliability, compatibility, and security.</P></BODY></HTML>
