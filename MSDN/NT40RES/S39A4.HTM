<H2>Answer Files (Unattend.txt)</H2><P CLASS="t">You can make unattended answer files for the various setup configurations used in your organization, and then customize them with UDFs as needed. For example, you can make one answer file for each geographic location, or for each division. To tailor the information to individual users, create a UDF with a section for each user or computer that specifies the user name and computer name. Each user can then receive a tailored installation by specifying both the answer file and the UDF in the <B>winnt</B> or <B>winnt32</B> command. </P>
<P CLASS="t">Answer files and UDFs are text files with specific section names and keys. For a description of these sections and keys, and the customizations you can perform through these files, see Appendix A, "Answer Files and UDFs."</P>
