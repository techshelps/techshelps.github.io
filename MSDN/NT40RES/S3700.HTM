<H3>Creating Reports</H3><P CLASS="t">The <I>Report</I> view lets you display constantly changing counter and instance values for selected objects. Values appear in columns for each instance. You can adjust report intervals, print snapshots, and export data. Reports of averaged counters show the average value during the Time Window interval. Reports of instantaneous counters show the value at the end of the Time Window interval.</P>
<P CLASS="t">For specific instructions on using the Report view, opening an existing report settings file, or creating a new blank report file, see the "Working with Reports" topic in Performance Monitor Help.</P>
