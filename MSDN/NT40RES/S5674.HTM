<H3>Systems Management Server </H3><P CLASS="t">The best overall method of remote administration is a systems management program such as Microsoft's Systems Management Server (SMS). With SMS you can manage Windows&nbsp;NT Workstation and Windows&nbsp;95 clients in much the same manner. Each computer on the network must be configured as an SMS client in order to enable remote administration. Logon scripts must be in place on each computer to be automatically included in the SMS database<FONT FACE="Symbol">¾</FONT>otherwise you will have to configure each workstation manually. Windows&nbsp;NT diagnostics and Server Manager functionality are included in SMS for remote administration of Windows&nbsp;NT Workstations and Servers. For more information, see your Systems Management Server documentation. </P>
<P CLASS="t">The alternatives for remote administration are to manage Windows&nbsp;95 clients from computers running Windows&nbsp;95, and manage Windows&nbsp;NT Workstation clients from computer running Windows&nbsp;NT Server. For Windows&nbsp;95 clients, see Chapter 16, "Remote Administration," in <I>The Windows&nbsp;95 Resource Kit</I>.</P>
<P CLASS="t">Server Manager, included with Windows&nbsp;NT Server, is automatically configured for all computers on the network running Windows&nbsp;NT Workstation. Server Manager cannot view or modify computer properties, shared directories, or services on a Windows&nbsp;95 client. However, it can list the Windows&nbsp;95 clients on the network. For information on using the Server Manager application, see <I>Windows</I>&nbsp;<I>NT Server Concepts and Planning</I>.</P>
<P CLASS="t">Remote Control Agent and Help Desk Options for SMS must be configured on each Windows&nbsp;95 Client to allow remote administration. </P></BODY></HTML>
