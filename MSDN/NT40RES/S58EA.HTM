<H2>Windows&nbsp;NT Architectural Modules</H2><P CLASS="t">Windows&nbsp;NT has a <I>modular </I>architecture, meaning that it comprises separate and distinct components, each having sole responsibility for its functions. This chapter introduces the modules in Windows NT 4.0 and then provides a detailed description of each, from the lowest level, nearest to the hardware, to the highest, nearest to the user applications.</P>
<P CLASS="t">Windows&nbsp;NT&nbsp;4.0 architecture is divided into two main sections: <I>user mode</I> and <I>kernel mode</I>:</P>
<UL><LI>Kernel mode is a highly privileged mode of operation in which the code has direct access to all hardware and all memory, including the address spaces of all user-mode processes. The part of Windows NT 4.0 running in kernel mode is called the <I>Windows NT Executive</I>. It includes the Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL), the Microkernel, and the Windows NT Executive Service modules.</LI></UL><UL><LI>User mode is a less privileged processor mode with no direct access to hardware. Code running in user mode acts directly only in its own address space. It uses well-defined operating system application program interfaces (APIs) to request system services. The environment and integral subsystems run in user mode.</LI></UL><P></P>
<P CLASS="t">Figure 5.3 shows the new Windows&nbsp;NT&nbsp;4.0 architecture.</P>

<P CLASS="t"><B>Note</B></P>
<P>In earlier documentation, the terms kernel and microkernel were used interchangeably. In this document, <I>kernel </I>refers to the entire Windows&nbsp;NT Executive. The <I>Microkernel</I> is a component of the Windows NT Executive. <I>Kernel mode</I> refers to a highly privileged processing mode.</P>
