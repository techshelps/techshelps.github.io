<H2>Sending a Batch File as an Embedded Link in an e-mail Message</H2><P CLASS="t">This option is only useful in a small LAN with users who have sufficient expertise to comfortably initiate the upgrade. Users who are given responsibility for their upgrades can introduce variables (such as when each upgrade takes place or what options are included) that can disrupt your planned deployment. To avoid unnecessary stress on the network, send only about 25 setup batch files at one time. Monitor the users who have been given the option to upgrade to keep track of which workstations are upgraded. The files must be kept in place until all users have performed the upgrade. In some cases, you might need to remind users to perform the upgrade so that you can go on to the next group of users, or remove the installation files from the distribution sharepoint.</P></BODY></HTML>
