<H2>Changing the System Environment Variables</H2><P CLASS="t">Windows&nbsp;NT requires certain information to find programs, to allocate memory space for some programs to run, and to control various programs. This information — called the system and user environment variables — can be viewed using the System option in Control Panel in the <B>Environment Variables</B> tab. These environment variables are similar to those that can be set in the MS-DOS operating system, such as PATH and TEMP.</P>
<P CLASS="t">The system environment variables are defined by Windows&nbsp;NT Workstation and Windows&nbsp;NT Server and are the same no matter who is logged on at the computer. If you are logged on as a member of the Administrators group, you can add new variables or change the values. </P>
<P CLASS="t">The user environment variables can be different for each user of a particular computer. They include any environment variables you want to define or variables defined by your applications, such as the path where application files are located. </P>
<P CLASS="t">After you change any environment variables in the <B>Environment Variables</B> tab in the <B>System Properties</B> dialog box and click <B>OK</B>, Windows&nbsp;NT saves the new values in the registry so they are available automatically the next time you start your computer. </P>
<P></P>
<P CLASS="t">If any conflict exists between environment variables, Windows&nbsp;NT Workstation and Windows&nbsp;NT Server resolve the conflict in this way:</P>
<UL><LI>System environment variables are set first.</LI></UL><UL><LI>User environment variables defined in the <B>System</B> dialog box are set next and override system variables.</LI></UL><UL><LI>Variables defined in Autoexec.bat are set last, but do not override system or environmental variables.</LI></UL><P></P>
<P></P>
<P CLASS="t"><B>Note</B></P>
<P>Path settings, unlike other environmental variables, are cumulative. The full path (what you see when you type <B>path </B>at the command prompt) is created by appending the path contained in Autoexec.bat to the paths defined in the System option in Control Panel. </P>
