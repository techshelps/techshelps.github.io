<H3>Process and Thread Priority</H3><P CLASS="t">Process Explode displays the base priority class of active processes and the dynamic priorities of active threads. You can use Process Explode to change the base priority class of processes.</P>
<P></P>
<P CLASS="t"><B>Note</B></P>
<P>You can see, but not change, the dynamic priorities of threads. The Process Explode Thread Priority box has clickable option buttons, but they are for display only; clicking them has no effect.</P>
<P></P>
<P CLASS="t">To display or change the base priority class of a process, select the process from the drop-down list in the first column. All process data in the dialog box changes to show the values for the process you selected. The base priority class of the process is displayed and can be changed in the Base Priority box at the top of the second column.</P>
<P CLASS="t">Process Explode displays three base priority classes: Idle, Normal, and High. Processes running at Real-Time priority appear in Process Explode as High. Process Explode does not let you set a process to Real-Time priority class.</P>
<P CLASS="t">To display the dynamic priority of a thread, select its process from the drop-down list in the first column. Then select the thread by its number from the list box half-way down the first column. All thread data in Process Explode changes to show values for that thread. The thread's dynamic priority is shown in the Thread Priority box at the bottom of the first column.</P></BODY></HTML>
