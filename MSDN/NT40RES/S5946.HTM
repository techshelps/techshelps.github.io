<H3>scsi(W)disk(X)rdisk(Y)partition(Z)</H3><P CLASS="t">The scsi() syntax is used for both RISC-based and x86-based computers, and is used in all versions of Windows&nbsp;NT. Using the scsi() syntax indicates that Windows&nbsp;NT needs to load a SCSI device driver and use that driver to access the boot partition. </P>
<P></P>
<P CLASS="t"><B>Note</B></P>
<P>The term scsi() syntax refers to the scsi(W)disk(X)rdisk(Y)partition(Z) form of the ARC pathname.</P>
<P></P>
<P CLASS="t">On an x86-based computer, the device driver is Ntbootdd.sys, which can be found in the root of the system disk (usually C:). It is a copy of the device driver for the disk controller in use. On a RISC-based computer, the driver is built into the firmware, as required by the RISC standards, so no file is required. </P>
<P CLASS="t">The W, X, Y and Z parameters have the following meaning when using the scsi() syntax:</P>
<P CLASS="term1"><B>W </B></P>
<P CLASS="dt1">is the ordinal number of the controller as identified by the Ntbootdd.sys driver.</P>
<P CLASS="term1"><B>X </B></P>
<P CLASS="dt1">is the SCSI ID of the target disk.</P>
<P CLASS="term1"><B>Y </B></P>
<P CLASS="dt1">is the SCSI logical unit number (LUN) of the disk that contains the boot partition. Y will almost always be 0.</P>
<P CLASS="term1"><B>Z </B></P>
<P CLASS="dt1">is the partition number. All partitions receive a number except for type 5 (Extended) and type 0 (unused) partitions. These numbers start at 1, as opposed to all other entries, which start with 0.</P>
<P></P>
<P CLASS="t">When using scsi() syntax, the value of W depends upon Ntbootdd.SYS. Each SCSI device driver used in Windows&nbsp;NT has its own method of ordering controllers, although the controller order corresponds to the order that the BIOS on the controllers loads (if they are being loaded). </P>
<P CLASS="t">Additionally, if you have more than one SCSI controller, and they use different device drivers, you should only count the controllers that are controlled by Ntbootdd.sys when determining the value of the W parameter. For instance, if you have an Adaptec 2940 (which uses Aic78xx.sys) and an Adaptec 1542 (which uses Aha154x.sys), W will always be 0. What changes is the Ntbootdd.sys file:</P>
<UL><LI>If you are loading Windows&nbsp;NT from a disk on the Adaptec 2940, Ntbootdd.sys will be a copy of Aic78xx.sys.</LI></UL><UL><LI>If you are loading Windows&nbsp;NT from a disk on the Adaptec 1542, Ntbootdd.sys will be a copy of Aha154x.sys. </LI></UL><P></P></BODY></HTML>
