<H2>Debugging Terms</H2><P CLASS="t">This section defines some common terms and procedures you need when you debug kernel STOP errors.</P>
<H3><A NAME="sec0"></A>Kernel STOP Error, Blue Screen, or Trap</H3><P CLASS="t">When Windows&nbsp;NT encounters hardware problems, inconsistencies within data necessary for its operation, or other similar errors, the operating system processes the error based upon the information entered in the <B>Recovery</B> dialog box. For information about the <B>Recovery</B> dialog box, see "Creating a Memory Dump File," later in this chapter.</P>
<P CLASS="t">If the user did not select <B>Automatically reboot</B> in the <B>Recovery</B> dialog box, Windows&nbsp;NT displays a blue screen containing error information, then stops.</P>
<P></P>
<P CLASS="t">Knowledge Base articles and other Windows&nbsp;NT documentation sometimes refer to this type of error as <I>blue screen</I>, <I>kernel error</I>, or even <I>trap</I>. This chapter uses the term <I>kernel STOP error</I>. However, if the context specifically refers to Windows&nbsp;NT stopping with the blue screen displayed, the term <I>blue screen</I> is used instead. The term <I>trap</I> is used in this chapter to mean that the kernel has detected an error and might write a memory dump file as part of its processing of the error.</P>
<H3><A NAME="sec1"></A>Symbols and Symbol Trees</H3><P CLASS="t">Usually, when code is compiled, one of two versions of the executable file can be created: a debug (also known as <I>checked</I>) version, or a nondebug (also known as <I>free</I>) version. The checked version contains extra code that enables a developer to debug problems, but this means a larger and possibly slower executable file. The free version of the executable file is smaller and runs at a normal speed, but cannot be debugged. </P>
<P CLASS="t">Windows&nbsp;NT combines the speed and smaller size of free versions with the debugging capabilities of the checked versions. All executable files, drivers, dynamic-link libraries, and other program files in Windows&nbsp;NT are the free versions. However, each program file has a corresponding symbol file, which contains the debug code that is normally part of the checked file. These symbol files are on the Windows&nbsp;NT Server product CD, in the Support\Debug\<I>Platform</I>\Symbols directories, where <I>Platform</I> is I386, Alpha, MIPS, or PowerPC. Within each Symbols directory, there is one directory for each type of file (such as .exe, .dll, and .sys). This structure is referred to as a <I>symbol tree</I>. Table 39.1 describes directories that exist in a standard symbol tree.</P>

<P CLASS="t">All of the utilities used to debug Windows&nbsp;NT or interpret memory dump files require a symbol tree containing the symbol files for the version of Windows&nbsp;NT you were running at the time of the kernel STOP error. With some utilities, you need the \Symbols directory to be on your hard drive, in the <I>\Systemroot</I> directory. With other utilities, you can specify the path to the \Symbols directory as a command-line option or in a dialog box. </P>
<H3><A NAME="sec2"></A>Target Computer</H3><P CLASS="t">The term <I>target computer</I> refers to the computer on which the kernel STOP error occurs. This computer is the one that needs to be debugged. It can be a computer located within a few feet of the computer on which you run the debugger, or it can be a computer that you dial in to by using a modem. </P>
<H3><A NAME="sec3"></A>Host Computer</H3><P CLASS="t">The term <I>host computer</I> refers to the computer on which you run the debugger. This computer should run a version of Windows&nbsp;NT that is at least as recent as the one on the target computer. </P></BODY></HTML>
