<H3>TrueType and Windows&nbsp;NT</H3><P CLASS="t">Windows&nbsp;NT includes support for TrueType, an outline font technology. Instead of being composed of bitmaps (such as raster fonts) or lines (such as vector fonts), TrueType fonts are <I>glyph shapes</I> that are described by their outlines. A glyph outline consists of a series of contours. A simple glyph might have only one contour. More complex glyphs can have two or more contours. Figure 7.1 shows three glyphs with one, two, and three contours respectively. </P>

<P CLASS="t"><B>Note</B></P>
<P>Windows&nbsp;NT supports all TrueType fonts that are supported by Windows&nbsp;3.1.</P>
<P></P>
<P CLASS="t">TrueType fonts have many benefits over other kinds of Windows&nbsp;NT fonts:</P>
<UL><LI>What you see is really what you get, because Windows&nbsp;NT can use the same font for both screen and printer. You don't have to think about whether you have a specific point size for a particular printer or for your display.</LI></UL><UL><LI>You can scale and rotate TrueType fonts. TrueType fonts look good in all sizes and on all output devices that Windows&nbsp;NT supports. </LI></UL><UL><LI>Your document will look the same when printed on different printers. And any printer that uses a Windows&nbsp;NT Universal driver can print TrueType fonts.</LI></UL><UL><LI>Your document will look the same as you move it across platforms. For example, the text you format in Microsoft Word for Windows will look the same if you open the document in Microsoft Word for the Macintosh.</LI></UL><UL><LI>Each TrueType typeface requires only a .ttf file to create fonts in all point sizes at all resolutions for all output devices. (Many raster font products include one font size per file. The raster fonts included with Windows&nbsp;NT are included within a single file.)</LI></UL><UL><LI>TrueType fonts are integrated with the operating environment. For this reason, all Windows&nbsp;NT–based applications can use TrueType fonts in the same way they use other Windows&nbsp;NT raster fonts. </LI></UL><P></P>
<P CLASS="t">The TrueType fonts installed with Windows&nbsp;NT are Arial, Courier New, Lucida Console, Times New Roman, Symbol, and Wingdings in regular, bold, bold italic, and italic.</P>
<P></P>
<P CLASS="t"><B>Note</B></P>
<P>Windows&nbsp;NT 4.0 supports and ships on CD a set of Far East TrueType fonts. Users can install to view or print Far East documents and Web pages. The fonts are not installed by default.</P>
<P></P>
<H4><A NAME="sec0"></A>How TrueType Works</H4><P CLASS="t">TrueType fonts are stored as a collection of points and <I>hints</I> that define the character outlines. Hints are algorithms that distort the scaled font outlines to improve how the bitmaps look at specific resolutions and sizes. When a Windows&nbsp;NT application requests a font, TrueType uses the outline and the hints to render a bitmap in the size requested. </P>
<P CLASS="t">For each Windows&nbsp;NT session, the first time you select a TrueType font size, a bitmap is rendered for display or printing. Windows&nbsp;NT stores the rendered bitmaps in a font cache. Each subsequent time the font is used during that Windows&nbsp;NT session, display or printing performance improve.</P>
<P CLASS="t">The Windows&nbsp;NT Universal printer driver, PostScript printer driver, and plotter driver all support TrueType fonts. Any printer that works with these printer drivers will support TrueType fonts automatically. For more information about these printer drivers, see Chapter 7, "Printing."</P>
<H4><A NAME="sec1"></A>Using TrueType Fonts in Windows&nbsp;NT–based Applications</H4><P CLASS="t">TrueType fonts give you a broad range of fonts to use with your application. In many applications, TrueType fonts appear in the <B>Fonts</B> dialog box with a TT logo beside the typeface name. Typefaces that are device fonts have a printer icon beside their names in the list.</P>
<P><img src="xwr_g05.gif"></P>
<P CLASS="t">With TrueType fonts, you can specify any desired size; you're not limited to a list  of raster or vector font sizes.</P>
<P CLASS="t">To make your life easier, you can specify that you want to use only TrueType fonts in the applications on your computer. This will ensure that type styles in your documents will print on any dot-matrix, HPPCL, or PostScript printer and that your documents can easily be moved to other platforms.</P>
<H5 CLASS="h4"><A NAME="sec2"></A>To specify that you want to use only TrueType fonts</H5><P>    1.    Double-click the Fonts folder in the Control Panel window to display the <B>Fonts</B> dialog box.</P>
<P>    2.    Click <B>Options</B> on the <B>View</B> menu.</P>
<P>    3.    Click the TrueType Fonts tab.</P>
<P>    4.    Check the Show Only TrueType Fonts In The Programs On My Computer box to add a check mark.</P>
<P>    5.    Click <B>OK</B>.</P>
<P></P>
<P CLASS="t">Windows&nbsp;NT does not automatically change fonts in documents that were produced with earlier font technologies. To update old documents to use TrueType fonts, you must update them manually. You might also contact your application vendor to see if there are new utilities available that will assist automatic upgrading of documents to use TrueType fonts.</P>
<P></P>
<P CLASS="t"><B>Note</B></P>
<P>TrueType fonts use a different character spacing (called <I>ABC widths</I>) from the spacing used for raster fonts. Applications that use this spacing will be able to space characters more accurately, especially for bold and italic text. However, because of this change in spacing, text can sometimes be adversely affected in applications written for Windows 3.0 or earlier versions. For example, the end of a highlighted text line might look odd on screen.</P>
<P></P>
<H4><A NAME="sec3"></A>Using Adobe Type 1 Fonts</H4><P CLASS="t">Adobe Type 1 fonts are the font technology native to PostScript printers. Like TrueType fonts, Type 1 fonts contain instructions to generate outlines of characters; the outlines are scaleable and rotatable. Type 1 fonts are a popular font technology in the desktop publishing industry. These fonts are designed to be downloaded to a PostScript printer, which can interpret their instructions and thereby produce hardcopy output. Although you can print Type 1 fonts, you cannot directly view them on screen. For this reason, Adobe created an application called Adobe Type Manager (ATM), which reads Type 1 font files and creates equivalent raster screen fonts for several platforms.</P>
<P CLASS="t">Windows&nbsp;NT supports Type 1 fonts in two ways: It lets you install Type 1 fonts for use on your PostScript printer, and it provides a font converter that achieves the same goal as ATM by reading Type 1 fonts and creating equivalent TrueType fonts for viewing on screen.</P>
<P CLASS="t">The Windows&nbsp;NT 4.0 Type 1 font converter achieves a high level of compatibility with ATM 2.5. If you format a document using Type 1 fonts on a computer running Windows for Workgroups 3.11 and ATM 2.5, and then load the same document under Windows&nbsp;NT 4.0 with the same set of Type 1 fonts converted to TrueType fonts, you will see the same character spacing and line breaks and the same output on your printer.</P>
<P CLASS="t">With the Type 1 installation process, you have the following options:</P>
<UL><LI><B>Convert Type 1 Font to TrueType</B> If you select this option, Windows&nbsp;NT will read the font outline instructions that make up the Type 1 font, convert them into TrueType, and write this equivalent TrueType font to your hard disk.</LI></UL><UL><LI><B>Install Type 1 Font Files for use on a PostScript printer</B>. If you select this option, Windows&nbsp;NT can send the Type 1 font to a PostScript printer. If you choose this option as well as the option described in the preceding paragraph, Windows&nbsp;NT will use the converted TrueType font for screen display and download the Type 1 font when you print.</LI></UL><UL><LI><B>Copy Type 1 Font Files to Windows Directory</B>. If you choose to install the Type 1 font for use on a PostScript printer, this option lets you copy it to the local computer's \<I>systemroot</I>\SYSTEM directory.</LI></UL><P></P>
<H4><A NAME="sec4"></A>Legal Issues Regarding TrueType Fonts</H4><P CLASS="t">There are several legal issues to be aware of when converting TrueType fonts:</P>
<UL><LI>With Windows&nbsp;NT 4.0, you can legally convert Type 1 fonts to TrueType fonts only if the third-party font vendor grants permission.</LI></UL><P>Windows&nbsp;NT contains a database of the copyright strings that third-party vendors embed within their fonts. If you try to convert a Type 1 font and the font converter does not find a recognized third-party vendor's copyright string in the font, it warns that you might not have permission to convert this font. You are then advised to contact the third-party vendor to obtain permission to convert the Type 1 font. </P>
<P>Although none of the third-party vendors that Microsoft contacted refused to allow conversion of their fonts, some vendors did not respond to the request. Those third-party vendors are not listed in the copyright string database, and their fonts will always produce a warning message.</P>
<P></P>
<P CLASS="t"><B>Note</B></P>
<P>The copyright strings that third-party vendors embed within their fonts were never meant to be machine-readable. For this reason, the copyright strings in different fonts from the same vendor sometimes contain different punctuation marks or extra space characters, and so on. Most of these variations are represented in the copyright string database, but they can sometimes cause the font converter to reject a font, even though the third-party vendor has given its permission to convert it.</P>
<P></P>
<UL><LI>The converted TrueType font is bound by the copyright restrictions that apply to the original Type 1 font. For example, if your Type 1 license does not permit you to use the Type 1 font on more than one computer at a time, then you are not permitted to use the converted TrueType font on more than one computer at a time.</LI></UL><UL><LI>Converted TrueType fonts are only licensed for Windows&nbsp;NT 4.0. It is a copyright violation to copy converted fonts to other platforms, including Windows&nbsp;NT 3.<I>x</I>, Windows 95, or Windows For Workgroups 3.11.</LI></UL><P></P>
<P CLASS="t">In addition to the legal restrictions, there is a practical reason for not copying converted TrueType fonts to other platforms: Converted fonts are tuned to use features of the Windows&nbsp;NT 4.0 TrueType rasterizer that don't exist on other platforms' TrueType rasterizers. So, using converted fonts on other platforms will produce poor results. This is not a bug; it is an incentive to avoid illegal font copying.</P>
<P></P>
<P CLASS="t"><B>Note</B></P>
<P>All TrueType fonts behave the same way under Windows&nbsp;NT whether they were originally created as TrueType or were converted from Type 1 fonts.</P>
<P></P>
<H4><A NAME="sec5"></A>Disk Space, Memory Use, and Speed</H4><P CLASS="t">Fonts are resource intensive. Windows&nbsp;NT has been tested to load up to several thousand TrueType fonts at once. The more fonts used in a document, the more you can expect performance to be affected. </P></BODY></HTML>
