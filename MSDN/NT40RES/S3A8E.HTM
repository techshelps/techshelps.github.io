<H3>Dial-Up Networking Internet Configuration</H3><P CLASS="t">Dial-Up Networking is used to connect to an Internet service provider (ISP) or other online service over a phone line or ISDN line. Windows&nbsp;NT Dial-Up Networking clients support the PPP protocol and the SLIP protocol. Most ISPs use these protocols, which enables Windows&nbsp;NT Workstation clients to connect to virtually all ISPs. Some ISPs support the Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol (PPTP) and X.25 WAN protocols.</P>
<P CLASS="t">To connect to an ISP and use the Internet, you must configure Dial-Up Networking on your computer. Windows&nbsp;NT Dial-Up Networking steps you through the procedures to connect to the Internet. </P>
<P CLASS="t">To install Dial-Up Networking, double-click <B>Dial-Up Networking</B> in My Computer. Follow the instructions on-screen to complete Dial-Up Networking installation. For detailed instructions on installing Dial-Up Networking, see online Help.</P>
<H4><A NAME="sec0"></A>Configuring Dial-Up Networking Entries for Internet Use</H4><P CLASS="t">To call an Internet service provider, you must create an entry in Dial-Up Networking. The Windows&nbsp;NT Dial-Up Networking wizard steps you through creating the first entry. This section explains how to manually configure a Dial-Up Networking entry to work with an ISP.</P>
<H5 CLASS="h4"><A NAME="sec1"></A>Modifying an Entry</H5><P CLASS="t">Double-click <B>Dial-Up Networking</B> in <B>My Computer</B>; or, click <B>Start</B>, point to <B>Programs</B>, point to <B>Accessories</B>, then click <B>Dial-Up Networking</B>. The first time Dial-Up Networking is started, the Dial-Up Networking wizard steps you through creating the first entry; otherwise, click <B>New</B>. Provide all the information requested by the Dial-Up Networking wizard. See the sections below for additional information about Internet configuration.</P>
<H5 CLASS="h4"><A NAME="sec2"></A>PPP or SLIP Settings</H5><P CLASS="t">An Internet service provider must provide either PPP connections or SLIP connections to operate with Windows&nbsp;NT Dial-Up Networking.</P>
<H5 CLASS="h4"><A NAME="sec3"></A>To configure an entry for a PPP connection</H5><P>    1.    Double-click <B>Dial-Up Networking</B>. Select a Phonebook entry to dial. Click <B>More</B> and select <B>Edit entry and modem properties</B>.</P>
<P>    2.    On the <B>Server</B> tab, in the <B>Dial-up server type</B> box, select <B>PPP</B>.</P>
<P>    3.    The <B>TCP/IP</B> and <B>NetBEUI</B> check boxes are automatically selected. Clear the <B>IPX</B> check box if it is selected. The <B>Enable PPP LCP extensions</B> (RFC 1570) check box enables newer PPP features and should be cleared only if you are unable to establish a connection while this setting is enabled. The <B>Enable software compression</B> check box should be selected.</P>
<P>    4.    Click <B>TCP/IP Settings</B>.</P>
<P>    5.    If your Internet service provider has assigned an IP address for your use, enter that number in the <B>Specify an IP address</B> box. If no number was assigned or if you know the server assigns IP addresses, select the <B>Server assigned IP address</B> check box.</P>
<P>    6.    If your Internet service provider has assigned primary and secondary DNS and/or WINS server IP addresses for your use, enter those numbers in the <B>Specify name server addresses </B>box. If no numbers were assigned or if you know the server assigns name server addresses, select the <B>Server assigned name server addresses</B> check box.</P>
<P>    7.    Leave the <B>Use default gateway on remote network </B>and <B>Use IP header compression boxes </B>selected.</P>
<P></P>
<P CLASS="t">Depending on your Internet service provider, you might need to make some modifications to your security settings, as described in the next section.</P>
<H5 CLASS="h4"><A NAME="sec4"></A>To configure an entry for a SLIP connection</H5><P>    1.    Double-click <B>Dial-Up Networking</B>. Select a Phonebook entry to dial. Click <B>More</B> and select <B>Edit entry and modem properties</B>.</P>
<P>    2.    On the <B>Server</B> tab, in the <B>Dial-up server type</B> box, select <B>SLIP</B>.</P>
<P>    3.    The <B>TCP/IP </B>check box is automatically selected.</P>
<P>    4.    Click <B>TCP/IP Settings</B>.</P>
<P>    5.    Enter the IP address provided by your ISP in the <B>IP address</B> box. </P>
<P>    6.    Enter the primary and secondary DNS server IP addresses and the primary and secondary WINS server IP addresses in the <B>Name server addresses </B>box. </P>
<P>    7.    Leave the <B>Use default gateway on remote network </B>and <B>Force IP header compression</B> check boxes<B> </B>selected. Select a frame size in the <B>Frame size</B> box if indicated by your ISP, otherwise leave the default setting.</P>

<P CLASS="t">Depending on your Internet service provider, you might need to make some modifications to your security settings, as described in the next section.</P>
<H5 CLASS="h4"><A NAME="sec5"></A>Security Settings</H5><P CLASS="t">When you connect to the Internet service provider, some form of logon or authentication occurs. Your Internet service provider should tell you the logon sequence for its servers. You use the <B>Script </B>tab to configure Dial-Up Networking for logging on to the Internet service provider.</P>
<H5 CLASS="h4"><A NAME="sec6"></A>To configure an entry for authentication on the remote server</H5><P>    1.    Click the <B>Dial-Up Networking</B> icon. Select a Phonebook entry to dial. Click <B>More </B>and select <B>Edit entry and modem properties</B>.</P>
<P>    2.    On the <B>Security</B> tab, select the authentication method specified by your Internet service provider. </P>
<P>Many Internet service providers require a clear-text terminal logon. If in doubt, select the <B>Accept any authentication including clear text </B>check box.</P>
<P>If you select <B>Accept any authentication including clear text</B>, you must also know the sequence of logon for your ISP, and any required commands. </P>
<P>    3.    If your Internet service provider has a well-defined logon sequence, you can create a script in the Switch.inf file that provides the required commands automatically at logon. You create and activate a script on the <B>Script</B> tab.</P>
<P>    4.    After you have selected the security and script settings, click <B>OK</B>. Click <B>OK</B> again to complete security configurations.</P>
