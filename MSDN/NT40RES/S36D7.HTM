<H1>Chapter 9 - The Art of Performance Monitoring</H1><P CLASS="t">Detecting the source of a performance problem isn't always a straightforward task. Sometimes it requires that you try different tools, running each in several ways, examining computer performance, and repeating the tests in a rigorous, scientific manner.</P>
<P CLASS="t">Problems can appear intermittently or be camouflaged by some greater or lesser matter. The following graph is an example of what you might see.</P>

<P CLASS="t">This is a Performance Monitor graph of processor and disk use over a 61-second interval. The white line represents disk activity; the black line represents processor activity. If you viewed just the first half of the interval, you would conclude that you have a <I>disk bottleneck</I>; the second half might lead you to believe you have a <I>processor bottleneck</I>. When the data is logged over time, you find that the processor is actually the problem—but you'd never know it from a one-minute glance.</P>
<P CLASS="t">This part of the Windows&nbsp;NT 4.0 Workstation Resource Guide is designed to help you tune and optimize Windows&nbsp;NT&nbsp;4.0 Workstation. The remainder of the chapter includes some history and important information about Windows&nbsp;NT Workstation that affect how you monitor it.</P>

<P CLASS="t">The following materials might be of interest as well:</P>
<UL><LI>Chapter 5 of this book, "Windows&nbsp;NT&nbsp;4.0 Workstation Architecture," explains the organization of the Windows&nbsp;NT Workstation operating system. It's good background for understanding scheduling of processes, thread priorities, and changes in the architecture of the graphics subsystem that you'll be monitoring.</LI><LI>Chapter 17 of this book, "Disk and File System Basics," provides the hardware background for the chapter on detecting disk bottlenecks.</LI><LI>The Win32 Software Development Kit describes how to monitor and optimize your own applications and how to create extensible counters for Performance Monitor.</LI><LI>The Windows&nbsp;NT&nbsp;Server Networking Guide describes the architecture of the Windows&nbsp;NT 4.0 Server and network and includes some information about network bottlenecks and capacity planning.</LI><LI>The Windows&nbsp;NT&nbsp;Server Concepts and Planning Guide includes a clear and concise overview of performance monitoring with lots of useful tips and examples.</LI></UL></BODY></HTML>
