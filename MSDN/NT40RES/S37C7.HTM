<H2>Viewing the Registry of a Remote Computer</H2><P CLASS="t">In the same way that you can use Event Viewer or User Manager to view details of another computer, you can use Registry Editor to view and change the contents of another computer's Registry if the Server service on the remote computer is running.</P>
<P CLASS="t">The ability to view a computer's configuration remotely means that the system administrator can examine a user's startup parameters, desktop configuration, and other parameters. So you, as the administrator, can provide troubleshooting or other support assistance over the telephone while you view settings on the other computer from your own workstation.</P>
