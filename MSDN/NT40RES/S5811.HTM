<H3>Upgrading from Windows 95 to Windows&nbsp;NT 4.0</H3><P CLASS="t">Because of differences in their respective registries and in hardware device support, no automatic upgrade path from Windows 95 to Windows&nbsp;NT Workstation currently exists. An upgrade path is planned for the next release of Windows&nbsp;NT Workstation.</P>
<P CLASS="t">You can manually upgrade from Windows 95 to Windows&nbsp;NT by installing Windows&nbsp;NT in a separate directory. No system or application settings will be migrated, and you will need to reinstall each application after Windows&nbsp;NT is installed. You should then delete the Windows 95 directory, although this step is optional.</P>
<P CLASS="t">A dual boot (giving the user a choice of operating systems on startup) is not recommended and is not supported. Windows&nbsp;NT does not support all the device drivers that Windows 95 does. A few Windows 95 device drivers require direct access the hardware, such as sound cards, video, scanners, hard disk, and so on. In Windows&nbsp;NT, only the Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL) of the microkernel has access to the hardware. Where the application vendor has not provided the necessary driver for Windows&nbsp;NT, those device drivers aren't supported. Windows&nbsp;NT also does not support Virtual Device Drivers (VXDs), such as multimedia titles, games, and memory management applications.</P>
<P CLASS="t">Both Windows&nbsp;NT and Windows 95 support long filenames. </P>
