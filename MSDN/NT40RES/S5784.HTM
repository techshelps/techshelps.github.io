<H2>Benefits of Using TCP/IP</H2><P CLASS="t">Microsoft TCP/IP for Windows&nbsp;NT Server and Windows&nbsp;NT Workstation offers the following advantages:</P>
<UL><LI>A standard, routable networking protocol that is the most complete and accepted protocol available. All modern operating systems offer TCP/IP support, and most large networks rely on TCP/IP for much of their network traffic.</LI></UL><UL><LI>A technology for connecting dissimilar systems. Many standard connectivity utilities are available to access and transfer data between dissimilar systems, including File Transfer Protocol (FTP) and Terminal Emulation Protocol (Telnet). Several of these standard utilities are included with Windows&nbsp;NT.</LI></UL><UL><LI>The enabling technology necessary to connect Windows&nbsp;NT to the global Internet. TCP/IP, Point to Point Protocol (PPP), Point to Point Tunneling Protocol (PPTP), and Windows Sockets provide the foundation needed to connect and use Internet services.</LI></UL><UL><LI>A robust, scaleable, cross-platform, client-server framework. Microsoft TCP/IP supports the Windows Sockets interface, which is a Windows-based implementation of the widely used Berkeley Sockets interface for network programming.</LI></UL><P></P></BODY></HTML>
