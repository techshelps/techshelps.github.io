<H3>STOP Screens After Installation</H3><P CLASS="t">Even in a complex and robust operating system such as Windows&nbsp;NT, catastrophic problems sometimes cause the system to stop responding or trap (display a STOP screen). In Windows&nbsp;NT, a driver or file system can generate a kernel STOP message by introducing an unhandled error (exception) in the code or by performing some illegal operation.</P>
<P CLASS="t">Some problems can be resolved through troubleshooting procedures such as verifying instructions, reinstalling key components, and verifying file dates. Diagnostic tools—such as Winmsdp, Microsoft Network Monitor, Network General Sniffer, and Microsoft Resource Kit utilities—may help isolate and resolve issues.</P>
<P CLASS="t">Debugging is especially helpful when a specific message is displayed or when a problem repeats often. In these cases, it is possible to pinpoint the failing code in a driver or application by using a debugger. For debugging, it is important to capture the exact text of the message. Also, it is critically important to record the exact steps involved in repeating the failure. This information can help you isolate a complex problem and help to develop a viable workaround or a program replacement. For problems occurring within Windows&nbsp;NT code, contact the Microsoft Support Network to find out if a service pack is available to correct the problem.</P></BODY></HTML>
