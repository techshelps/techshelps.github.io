<H3>PostScript Printer Fonts</H3><P CLASS="t">Adobe Type 1 PostScript fonts are scalable outlines that can be printed at any size. PostScript outline fonts can also be rotated to any angle and can be printed in both portrait and landscape modes. However, font size limits are often imposed by applications. A common PostScript font size limit in an application is 127 points.</P>
<P CLASS="t">Most PostScript printers include either the standard Apple LaserWriter Plus set of 35 scalable fonts or the earlier Apple LaserWriter set of 17 fonts. </P>
<P CLASS="t">Type 1 fonts are installed in the Fonts icon in Control Panel. When you install the font, Windows&nbsp;NT gives you the option of creating an equivalent TrueType font for use as a screen font.</P>
<P CLASS="t">PostScript printers can print Windows&nbsp;NT raster screen fonts, vector screen fonts, TrueType fonts, or Type 1 fonts.</P>
<H4><A NAME="sec0"></A>LaserWriter Plus Typefaces</H4><P CLASS="t">The LaserWriter Plus standard font set includes 11 typefaces, including the following 8, which are available in roman, bold, italic, and bold italic:</P>
<UL><LI>AvantGarde Gothic</LI></UL><UL><LI>Helvetica</LI></UL><UL><LI>ITC Bookman</LI></UL><UL><LI>Palatino</LI></UL><UL><LI>Courier</LI></UL><UL><LI>Helvetica Narrow</LI></UL><UL><LI>New Century Schoolbook</LI></UL><UL><LI>Times</LI></UL><P></P>
<P CLASS="t">The other three typefaces are Symbol, Zapf Chancery, and Zapf Dingbats. The Symbol typeface contains mathematical and scientific symbols; Zapf Chancery is a calligraphic font; and Zapf Dingbats contains decorative bullet characters and embellishments. These typefaces are available only in roman style. </P>
<H4><A NAME="sec1"></A>PostScript Printers and TrueType</H4><P CLASS="t">TrueType fonts are treated as downloaded fonts by the PostScript driver. When you use TrueType fonts on a PostScript printer, scaling and hints are always performed in the computer. Scan conversion can be done in the computer or in the printer, depending on the point size. At smaller point sizes, TrueType performs scan conversion in the computer; at larger point sizes, scan conversion is done in the printer.</P>
<H4><A NAME="sec2"></A>Substituting PostScript Fonts</H4><P CLASS="t">You can map a TrueType font to a PostScript font by editing the <I>Font Substitution Table</I>. This is helpful to view TrueType as a screen font and to get PostScript for the printout font. This will increase printing speed, but the results on the display might not be exactly the same as the printed output. </P>
<P CLASS="t">Alternatively, you can edit the Font Substitution Table to download TrueType fonts as soft fonts to the printer so that the printed output matches the screen display. In this case, the selected TrueType fonts will be sent to the printer as soft fonts. Repeat these steps until you have selected printer fonts to use in place of all the TrueType fonts in your document. </P>
<P></P>
<P></P>
<P CLASS="t">The changes you make in the Font Substitution Table affect only the fonts that are printed. The fonts that appear on the screen will not change; the original TrueType fonts are still used to display TrueType text in your document. </P>
<H5 CLASS="h4"><A NAME="sec3"></A>To edit the Font Substitution Table</H5><P>    1.    Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Printers.</P>
<P>    2.    Click to select the printer.</P>
<P>    3.    Click <B>Properties</B> on the <B>File</B> menu.</P>
<P>    4.    Click the Device Settings tab.</P>
<P>    5.    Double-click Font Substitution Table.</P>
<P>    6.    Click to select the TrueType font from the Font Substitution Table.</P>
<P>    7.    Click to select the substitution font, or click Download as Soft Font from the Change Setting list.</P>
<P>    8.    Click <B>OK</B>.</P>
<P></P>
<H4><A NAME="sec4"></A>PostScript Downloadable Outline Fonts</H4><P CLASS="t">PostScript printers also accept downloadable outline fonts, which can be scaled to any size and printed in both portrait and landscape orientations. Downloadable PostScript fonts are available from several suppliers, including Adobe, Agfa, Bitstream, and Monotype.</P>
<P CLASS="t">Although PostScript downloadable outlines can be scaled to any size, Windows&nbsp;NT raster screen fonts cannot. If you specify a PostScript font size that does not have a corresponding screen font, Windows&nbsp;NT substitutes another screen font. This results in a little loss in display quality but no loss in print quality. </P></BODY></HTML>
