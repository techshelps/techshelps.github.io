<H1>Chapter 24 - Registry Editor and Registry Administration</H1><P CLASS="t">Windows&nbsp;NT&nbsp;4.0 includes two tools for viewing and editing the Registry, both called Registry Editor. The traditional tool, <B>Regedt32.exe</B>, is featured in this chapter. The new tool, <B>Regedit.exe</B>, written for Windows&nbsp;95, has many of the same functions as <B>Regedt32</B> and uses the Windows&nbsp;NT Explorer interface. Both tools are installed automatically when you install Windows&nbsp;NT on any computer.</P>
<P CLASS="t">You can use either Registry editor to add, delete, or modify Registry entries. This chapter describes the Registry editors and how to use them, with an emphasis on protecting the Registry contents and using Registry editors to monitor and maintain the system configuration on remote computers. </P>
<P CLASS="t">The following topics are included in this chapter:</P>
<UL><LI>Using Registry editors and Windows&nbsp;NT Diagnostics (<B>Winmsd.exe</B>)</LI></UL><UL><LI>Viewing the Registry of a remote computer</LI></UL><UL><LI>Editing Registry value entries</LI></UL><UL><LI>Maintaining the Registry </LI></UL><P></P>
<P CLASS="t">It is recommended that, wherever possible, you make changes to the system configuration by using Control Panel or the applications in the Administrative Tools (Common) group.</P>
<P></P>
<P CLASS="t"><B>Caution   </B>You can impair or disable Windows&nbsp;NT with incorrect changes or accidental deletions if you (or other users) use Registry Editor to change the system configuration. Wherever possible, you should use the Control Panel, Windows&nbsp;NT Diagnostics, and Administrative Tools in Windows&nbsp;NT to change the Registry. Registry Editor should be used only as a last resort.</P>
<P CLASS="t">To protect the system configuration, administrators can restrict users' access to the Registry, as described in "Maintaining Registry Security," later in this chapter.</P>
