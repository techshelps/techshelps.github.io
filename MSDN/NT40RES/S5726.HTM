<H3>Adding User-Defined Special Groups by Using #SG</H3><P CLASS="t">You can group resources such as printers, or computers that belong to groups on the intranet, for easy reference, browsing, or broadcasting, by using the #SG keyword to define a special group in the LMHOSTS file. Special groups are limited to a total of 25 members. (If you are using WINS, they can also be defined by using the WINS Manager.) </P>
<P CLASS="t">Specify the name just as you would a domain name except that the keyword portion of the entry is #SG. For example:</P>
<P CLASS="spacing"><BR></P>
<PRE>102.54.94.99     printsrvsg        #SG:mycompany     #Specialgroup of computers
</PRE>
<P CLASS="t">The preceding example results in a special group being created. In some cases you may want to just specify the name of a special group without specifying an IP address. This can be done by giving the name of the group preceded by #SG. For example:</P>
<P CLASS="spacing"><BR></P>
<PRE>printsrvsg        #SG:mycompany     #Specialgroup of computers
</PRE>
<P CLASS="t">Addresses entered by using the LMHOSTS file become permanent addresses in the special group and can be removed only by using the WINS Manager.</P></BODY></HTML>
