<H3>Server-Based Setup</H3><P CLASS="t">The term server-based setup refers to running the operating system from the server, rather than locally, on the client computer's hard disk. When server-based setup is used, the client computer starts with only the files needed to connect to the network and access the operating system files on the server.</P>
<P CLASS="t">Windows&nbsp;NT Workstation does not support server-based setup, due to reliability and security implementations of the operating system. However, Windows&nbsp;95 can be installed on a server to run as a shared copy on client computers. The benefits of a shared installation include the following:</P>
<UL><LI>Little or no hard disk space is required on the local computer.</LI></UL><UL><LI>Updating drivers for multiple computers is easier.</LI></UL><UL><LI>The workstation is more secure and operation is safer for novice users because network logon is required and access to system files is limited. (However, you can also use system policies to enforce the same restrictions for local installations) </LI></UL><P></P>
<P CLASS="t">There are also some disadvantages to running operating systems from the server:</P>
<UL><LI>A shared configuration means more network traffic. </LI></UL><UL><LI>Larger servers are required. </LI></UL><UL><LI>Performance is better when the operating system is installed on the local hard disk.</LI></UL><UL><LI>The server must be available for the operating system to work.</LI></UL><P></P></BODY></HTML>
