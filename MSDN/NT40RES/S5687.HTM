<H3>Remote Access Service (RAS)</H3><P CLASS="t">Windows&nbsp;NT Remote Access Service (RAS) client software gives the user access to server-based dial-in packages such as Windows&nbsp;NT Server Remote Access Service, Novell NetWare Connect, and Shiva NetModem. Once the connection is made from the RAS client to the server-based dial-in package, users at remote sites can use the network as if their computers were directly connected to the network. RAS can also be used to connect to remote client computers that have inbound modems.</P>
<P CLASS="t">With some additional configuration of protocols and software on the client computer, RAS provides additional security for remote dial-up connections. The Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) and Serial Line Internet Protocol (SLIP) are supported in RAS.</P>
<P CLASS="t">Remote Access Service contains the following components:</P>
<UL><LI>Remote Access client, which allows a computer to dial in to a remote access server and use the resource on a LAN. This component can be installed on a Windows&nbsp;NT Workstation computer.</LI></UL><UL><LI>Remote dial-in functionality, which allows one inbound remote connection at a time. This component can be installed on a computer running Windows&nbsp;NT Workstation 4.0 that has a modem configured for inbound calls. </LI></UL><UL><LI>PPP, which is a set of industry-standard framing and authentication protocols. Computers running Windows&nbsp;NT Workstation 4.0 can dial into remote networks through any server that complies with the PPP standard.</LI></UL><UL><LI>SLIP, which is an older protocol that does not support authentication as part of the protocol. SLIP connections typically rely on text-based logon sessions. Encryption and automatic network parameter negotiations are not supported.</LI></UL><P></P></BODY></HTML>
