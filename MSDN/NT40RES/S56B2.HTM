<H3>Creating the UDF </H3><P CLASS="t">The first section of the UDF is the [UniqueIds] section. This section lists all uniqueness ids that are supported by this database. The left hand side is a uniqueness ID. The uniqueness ID can be any string but must not contain the star (*), space ( ), comma (,), or equals (=) character. The right hand side is a list of sections, each of which should match the name of a section in the answer file. The format is as follows:</P>
<P CLASS="spacing"><BR></P>
<PRE>[UniqueIds]<BR>id1 = section1,section2<BR>id2 = section1,section2<BR>id3 = section1,section3,section4<BR></PRE>
<P CLASS="t">For example, if you were using computernames for the uniqueness IDs, this section might look like this:</P>
<P CLASS="spacing"><BR></P>
<PRE>[UniqueIds]<BR>janeayer = UserData,Unattended<BR>emilybr = UserData,Unattended<BR>jconrad = UserData,KeyboardDrivers, PointingDeviceDrivers<BR></PRE>
<P CLASS="t">Following the [UniqueIds] section are the sections referenced in [UniqueIds]. These section names can take either of two forms: They can be exactly like the section name in the answer file (for example, [Unattended]); or, the section name can be preceded with the uniqueness ID and a colon (for example, [janeayer:UserData]). This allows you to create specialized replacement sections for each computer name. </P>
<P CLASS="t">If both a general section (such as [Unattended]) and an ID-specific section (such as [jconrad:Unattended]) are available, Setup will use the section for the uniqueness ID specified in the <B>winnt</B> or <B>winnt32</B> command line.</P>
<P CLASS="t">The sections in the UDF can contain any keys and values that the same-named sections could contain in the answer file. During setup, each key specified in a referenced section overrides the value for the same key in the answer file. Values are substituted as follows.</P>
<UL><LI>If a key is specified in the answer file but not in the UDF section referenced by the uniqueness ID, the value specified in the answer file is used.</LI></UL><UL><LI>If a key is specified in the UDF section referenced by the uniqueness ID, the value specified in the UDF is used.</LI></UL><UL><LI>If a key is specified in the answer file, and it appears in the UDF section referenced by the uniqueness ID with no value to the right of the equals sign, the default value will be used. This is equivalent to commenting out the key in the answer file. </LI></UL><UL><LI>If a key is specified in the UDF, but the value is left blank, no value will be used for that key. This might result in the user being prompted for the information.</LI></UL><UL><LI>If a section or key is used in the UDF, but there is no section by that name in the answer file, the section will be created and used by Setup. </LI></UL><UL><LI>If a section is referenced in the [UniqueIds] section but does not exist, the user will be prompted to insert a floppy with a valid uniqueness database on it.</LI></UL><P></P></BODY></HTML>
