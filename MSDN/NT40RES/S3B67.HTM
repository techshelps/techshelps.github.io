<H2>Restoring Disk Information</H2><P CLASS="t">If you have backed up the Registry, Master Boot Records, and Partition Boot Sectors, as recommended earlier in this chapter, you can recover from many disk and startup problems without having to reinstall Windows&nbsp;NT. This section describes using the floppy disks and tools to restart your computer and restore information.</P>
<P CLASS="t">One important thing that you can learn from testing is the best recovery procedure to use in a particular situation. For example, there are several methods that you can use to replace a Partition Boot Sector. You also want to learn when to use the Windows&nbsp;NT startup floppy disk to restart your computer, and when you have to use the repair process and the Emergency Repair Disk to replace files in order to start. </P></BODY></HTML>
