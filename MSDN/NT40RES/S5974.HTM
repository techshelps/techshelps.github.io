<H3>Access Control Lists and Access Control Entries</H3><P CLASS="t">Each ACL is made up of <I>access control entries</I> (ACEs), which specify access or auditing permissions to that object for one user or group. There are three ACE types—two for discretionary access control and one for system security.</P>
<P CLASS="t">The discretionary ACEs are AccessAllowed and AccessDenied. Respectively, these explicitly grant and deny access to a user or group of users. The first AccessDenied ACE denies the user access to the resource, and no further processing of ACEs occurs.</P>
<P></P>
<P CLASS="t"><B>Note</B></P>
<P>There is an important distinction between a discretionary ACL that is empty (one that has no ACEs in it) and an object without any discretionary ACL. In the case of an empty discretionary ACL, no accesses are explicitly granted, so access is implicitly denied. For an object that has no ACL at all, there is no protection assigned to the object, so any access request is granted.</P>
<P></P>
<P CLASS="t">SystemAudit is a system security ACE which is used to keep a log of security events (such as who accesses which files) and to generate and log security audit messages.</P></BODY></HTML>
