<H2>Tuning the Cache</H2><P CLASS="t">This is going to be a short section, because there is not much you can do to tune the Windows&nbsp;NT file system cache. The tuning mechanisms are built into the Virtual Memory Manager to save you time for more important things. Nonetheless, there are a few things you can do to make the most of the cache:</P>
<UL><LI>Localize your application's data references. This will improve its cache performance and minimize its working set so it uses less space in memory. </LI></UL><UL><LI>If you are running Windows&nbsp;NT Server, you can direct the Virtual Memory Manager to give the cache higher priority for space than the working sets of processes. In the Control Panel, double-click the Network icon. On the Services tab, double-click Server. To favor the cache, click Maximize Throughput for File Sharing. To favor working sets click, Maximize Throughput for Network Applications.</LI></UL><UL><LI>Change the way work is distributed among workstations. Try dedicating a single computer to memory-intensive applications such as CAD/CAM and large database processors.</LI></UL><UL><LI>Add memory. When memory is scarce, the cache is squeezed and cannot do its job. After the new memory is installed, the Virtual Memory Manager takes care of expanding the cache to use the new memory.</LI></UL><P CLASS="t"></P></BODY></HTML>
