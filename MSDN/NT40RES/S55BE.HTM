<H3>Cache Flushing</H3><P CLASS="t">Pages are removed from the cache by <I>flushing</I>, that is, any changes are written back to disk, and the page is deleted. Two threads in the system process—the lazy writer thread and the mapped page writer thread—periodically flush unused pages to disk. The cache is also flushed when Virtual Memory Manager needs to shrink the cache because of memory constraints.</P>
<P CLASS="t">Applications can also request that a page copied from the cache be written back to disk. With <I>write-through caching</I>, the disk file is updated immediately; with <I>write-back caching</I> (the default), the Virtual Memory Manager waits until a batch of modifications has accumulated and writes them together.</P></BODY></HTML>
