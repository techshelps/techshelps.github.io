<H2>Maintaining the Registry </H2><P CLASS="t">Windows&nbsp;NT enforces access control on Registry files, so it is difficult for users to accidentally or intentionally damage or delete hives on a running system. While the system is running, hive files are reserved by the system for exclusive access on all file systems. If the Windows&nbsp;NT <I>Systemroot</I> is not on an NTFS volume, the Registry can be tampered with—specifically, users can remove keys for user profiles that are not currently loaded. With NTFS, such tampering can be prevented.</P>
<P CLASS="t">You should plan how to protect the Registry for each computer at your site that runs Windows&nbsp;NT. This section describes how to ensure that you will have working Registry files under most conditions.</P>
<P CLASS="t">For more details about how to ensure recoverability under all conditions, see "Making Sure the System Always Starts" in Chapter&nbsp;25, "Configuration Management and the Registry."</P></BODY></HTML>
