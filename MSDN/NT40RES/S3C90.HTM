<H2>Security Information about Users</H2><P CLASS="t">Users are identified to the system by a unique <I>security ID</I> (SID). Security IDs are unique, and there is no possibility of having two identical security IDs.</P>
<P CLASS="t">For example, suppose Sally, who has a Windows&nbsp;NT account, leaves her job at a company but later returns to a different job at the same company. When Sally leaves, the administrator deletes her account, and Windows&nbsp;NT no longer accepts her security ID as valid. When Sally returns, the administrator creates a new account, and Windows&nbsp;NT generates a new security ID for that account. The new security ID does not match the old one, so nothing from the old account is transferred to the new account. </P>
<P CLASS="t">When a user logs on, Windows&nbsp;NT creates a <I>security access token</I>. This includes a security ID for the user, security IDs for the groups to which the user belongs, plus other information such as the user's name and the groups to which that user belongs. In addition, every process that runs on behalf of this user will have a copy of his or her access token. For example, when Sally starts Notepad, the Notepad process receives a copy of Sally's access token.</P>
<P CLASS="t">Figure 6.2 illustrates the contents of an access token.</P>

<P CLASS="t">Windows NT refers to the security IDs within a user's access token when he or she tries to access an object. The security IDs are compared with the list of access permissions for the object to ensure that the user has sufficient permission to access the object.</P></BODY></HTML>
