<H3>Finding a Key in the Registry</H3><P CLASS="t">A Registry key might be in a different place in the tree structure of your computer's Registry than where it is described in this chapter, depending on whether a computer is running Windows&nbsp;NT Workstation or Windows&nbsp;NT Server, and on other factors as well. </P>
<P></P>
<P CLASS="t">You can search for a specific key name in the Registry tree. Key names appear in the left pane of the Registry Editor window. The search begins from the currently selected key. A search beginning from a predefined key searches all its descendent keys.</P>
<P CLASS="t">Each search is local to the subtree where the search begins. That is, if you search in the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE subtree window, the search does not include keys found under any other subtree.</P>
<H4><A NAME="sec0"></A>To search for a key by using Regedt32</H4><P>From the View menu, click Find Key.</P>
<P>In the <B>Find What</B> box of the <B>Find Key</B> dialog box, type the name of the key that you want to find.</P>
<UL><LI>If you want to restrict the scope of the search or define the search direction, select the <B>Match Whole Word Only</B> box, the <B>Match Case</B> option, or select <B>Up</B> or <B>Down</B> in the <B>Direction</B> box.</LI><LI>To see the next occurrence of the key name you specified, click <B>Find Next</B>.</LI></UL><P>Click <B>Find</B>.</P>
<P></P>
<P CLASS="t">Key names are not unique. To be sure you find the key you want, it's a good idea to search for additional occurrences of a specific key name.</P>
<P></P>
<P CLASS="t"><B>Tip</B></P>
<P>Some key names include spaces, underscores, or a continuous string (such as KeyboardPort/PointerPort). To ensure that you find the key you want, search for a portion of the name, and make sure that the <B>Match Whole Word Only</B> check box in the <B>Find</B> dialog box is cleared .</P>
<P></P>
<P CLASS="t">To find specific keys or value entries related to specific topics, you can also use Regentry.hlp, the Registry Help file on the <I>Windows&nbsp;NT Workstation Resource Kit</I> CD.</P>
<P CLASS="t">In <B>Regedt32</B>, you can search only for keys and subkeys of the Registry. <B>Regedit</B>, however, has an expanded search capability: you can search for value entries and values as well as keys and subkeys. In addition, you determine the level at which <B>Regedit</B> searches. This can expedite a search for a subkey by preventing <B>Regedit</B> from looking at every value entry.</P>
<H4><A NAME="sec1"></A>To search for a key by using Regedt32</H4><P>From the <B>Edit</B> menu, click <B>Find</B>.</P>
<P>In the <B>Find</B> dialog box, enter the name of the key, subkey, value entry, or value you want to find. Use the check boxes to limit or expand your search. Click <B>OK</B>.</P>
<P>To see the next occurrence of the entry, from the <B>Edit</B> menu, click <B>Find Next</B> or press F3.</P></BODY></HTML>
