<H3>Test Performance and Capabilities</H3><P CLASS="t">In addition to the technicians responsible for conducting the pilot installation, extra technicians should be assigned to measure, observe, and test the installation. As this information is gathered and analyzed, areas for improvement or automation become apparent. Consequently, these extra technicians help ensure the success of both the pilot and final rollouts by making the installation more efficient. In addition, after Windows&nbsp;NT Workstation 4.0 is installed, these technicians can test system capabilities, such as remote administration, for proper operation. </P>
<P CLASS="t">Make sure that all computers are "up and running" as expected. Make note of possible improvements to the installation, training, or support, where appropriate. Monitor the client computers for performance, stability, and functionality. Make sure the deployed installations match the lab configurations.</P>
<P CLASS="t">Continue to monitor the pilot installation for a week to make sure that everything continues to run smoothly.</P></BODY></HTML>
