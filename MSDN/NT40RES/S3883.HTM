<H1>Chapter 5 - Windows&nbsp;NT 4.0 Workstation Architecture</H1><P CLASS="t">When you first look at Microsoft Windows&nbsp;NT 4.0, you'll notice the popular, functional interface introduced with Microsoft Windows 95. But, beneath that pretty face is the robust, preemptive multitasking, 32-bit operating system Microsoft designed for high-end users. This version was founded upon the same design principles as previous versions, and it maintains their most important advances.</P>
<P CLASS="t">Windows&nbsp;NT 4.0 continues to be compatible with many other operating systems, file systems, and networks. It runs on both complex instruction set computers (CISC) and reduced instruction set computers (RISC). Windows&nbsp;NT also supports high-performance computing by providing kernel support for symmetric multiprocessing.</P>
<P CLASS="t">The major architectural change in this version of Windows&nbsp;NT is the move of  the Window Manager, Graphics Device Interface (GDI), and higher-level device drivers from the Win32 environment subsystem into the Windows&nbsp;NT Executive as an executive service. The first section of this chapter describes that change. </P>
<P CLASS="t">Other changes include:</P>
<UL><LI>Support for Distributed Component Object Model (DCOM) applications. For more information on DCOM see "Distributed Applications and Windows NT" in Chapter 1 of the <I>Windows&nbsp;NT&nbsp;4.0 Server Networking Guide</I> and "Sharing DCOM Applications" in Chapter 4 of <I>Windows&nbsp;NT&nbsp;4.0 Concepts and Planning</I>.</LI></UL><UL><LI>Support for DirectDraw&trade;, DirectSound&trade;, and DirectPlay&trade;, components of DirectX&trade;, the Windows 95 high-performance interface for games and other interface intensive applications. For more information, see "DirectX" later in this chapter.</LI></UL><P></P>
<P CLASS="t">This chapter provides an overview of the architecture. Other chapters in this book provide details about particular components such as the Windows&nbsp;NT security model, integrated networking features and connectivity options, Windows&nbsp;NT file systems, and the printing system.</P></BODY></HTML>
