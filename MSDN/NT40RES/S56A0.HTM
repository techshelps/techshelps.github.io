<H3>Create a Template for the Rollout Database</H3><P CLASS="t">Use a central database to track the progress of each computer involved in the deployment, and to document any areas requiring further action. </P>
<P CLASS="t">If you are using Systems Management Server for the deployment, the status of each computer involved in the deployment is automatically maintained in an SQL database. Information from this database can be incorporated into reports or other databases as needed.</P>
<P CLASS="t">If you are not using Systems Management Server for the deployment, create a template for the database before the full deployment. Populate the database with configuration information for every computer and user in the organization, and place the template on the server.</P>
<P CLASS="t">During final deployment, the installation team compiles the data for each computer and user, indicating whether any additional work is needed. The team can then use the template to track open items following the rollout, and to measure actual progress against original objectives.</P></BODY></HTML>
