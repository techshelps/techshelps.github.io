<H2>Monitoring Windows NT Security Events</H2><P CLASS="t">You enable auditing from the <B>User Manager Auditing Policy </B>dialog box. Through auditing, you can track Windows&nbsp;NT Workstation security events. You can specify that an audit entry is to be written to the security event log whenever certain actions are performed or files are accessed. The audit entry shows the action performed, the user who performed it, and the date and time of the action. You can audit both successful and failed attempts at actions, so the audit trail can show who actually performed actions on the network and who tried to perform actions that are not permitted. </P>
<P CLASS="t">Events are not audited by default. If you have Administrator permission, you can specify what types of system events are audited through User Manager. The Audit policy determines the amount and type of security logging Windows&nbsp;NT Workstation performs. For file and object access, you can then specify which files and printer to monitor, which types of file and object access to monitor, and for which users or groups. For example, when <B>File and Object Access</B> auditing is enabled, you can use the <B>Security </B>tab in a file or folder's <B>Properties</B> dialog box (accessed through Windows&nbsp;NT Explorer) to specify which files are audited and what type of file access is audited for those files.</P>
<P></P>
<P CLASS="t"><B>Note</B></P>
<P>You can audit file and folder access on only Windows&nbsp;NT File System (NTFS) drives.</P>
<P></P>
<P CLASS="t">Because the security log is limited in size, select the events to be audited carefully, and consider the amount of disk space you are willing to devote to the security log. The maximum size of the security log is defined in Event Viewer.</P>
<P></P>
<P CLASS="t"><B>Note</B></P>
<P>When administering domains, the Audit policy applies to the security log of the primary and backup domain controllers in the domain because they share the same Audit policy. When administering a computer running Windows&nbsp;NT Workstation or a computer running Windows&nbsp;NT Server as a member server, this policy applies only to the security log of that computer.</P>
<P></P>
<P CLASS="t">The following table describes the types of events that can be audited.</P>
