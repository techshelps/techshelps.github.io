<H2>Cache Hits and Misses</H2><P CLASS="t">The simplest way to judge the effectiveness of the cache is to examine the percentage of cache <I>hits</I>, that is, how often data sought in the cache is found there. Cache <I>misses,</I> however<I>,</I> are even more important. When data is not found in the cache, or elsewhere in memory, the file system must make a time-consuming search of the disk. An application with a miss rate of 10% (a hit rate of 90%) requires twice as much disk I/O as an application with a miss rate of 5%.</P>
<P CLASS="t">Also, especially on a workstation, you must keep cache rates in perspective. On a system where cache reads are minimal, the hit-and-miss rates are not a significant performance factor. However, when running I/O-intensive applications such as databases, the cache hit-and-miss rates are an important performance measure of the computer and the application.</P></BODY></HTML>
