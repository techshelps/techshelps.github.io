<H3>DirectX</H3><P CLASS="t">Introduced with Windows 95, DirectX is a high-performance application program interface that hides hardware and operating system characteristics from the application. DirectX is designed to provide high-speed, real-time response to the user interface.</P>
<P CLASS="t">Windows&nbsp;NT&nbsp;4.0 now includes three DirectX components: DirectDraw, DirectSound, and DirectPlay for Windows&nbsp;NT 4.0 let you run games and other applications designed for DirectX on Windows&nbsp;95 on Windows&nbsp;NT&nbsp;4.0 Workstation and Server.</P>
<P CLASS="t">DirectX for Windows&nbsp;NT&nbsp;4.0 supports the application entry points called by programs designed for DirectX in Windows&nbsp;95. The functions are implemented differently in Windows&nbsp;NT than in Windows 95, but they allow you to run the DirectX-based programs on a Windows&nbsp;NT&nbsp;4.0 workstation or server without changes.</P>
<P CLASS="t">The goal for incorporating DirectX in Windows NT was to provide the best possible graphics performance without compromising the robustness of the system. For example, in Windows&nbsp;NT, DirectX functions never communicate directly with hardware; all graphics functions are mediated by the GDI.</P>

<H4><A NAME="sec0"></A>DirectDraw</H4><P CLASS="t">DirectDraw for Windows&nbsp;NT&nbsp;4.0 supports a 32-bit application program interface for accelerated drawing. DirectDraw also can emulate functions by breaking them down into simpler tasks for the hardware, much as GDI does for its clients. </P>
<P CLASS="t">Unlike DirectX for Windows 95, DirectDraw for Windows&nbsp;NT&nbsp;does not communicate directly with the driver or with any hardware. All DirectDraw functions are implemented in Windows&nbsp;NT&nbsp;4.0 but are mediated by the GDI.</P>
<H4><A NAME="sec1"></A>DirectSound</H4><P CLASS="t">For Windows&nbsp;NT&nbsp;4.0, DirectSound provides all application entry points for DirectX sound functions. However these functions are emulated and are not in accelerated form. </P>
<H4><A NAME="sec2"></A>DirectPlay</H4><P CLASS="t">DirectPlay is a DirectX DLL that simplifies communications between computers, allowing DirectX programs to be run over the network, using a modem, even modem-to-modem. The communications method is hidden from the application and optimized to have minimal effect on the real-time performance of the interface. </P>
<P CLASS="t">DirectPlay for Windows&nbsp;NT&nbsp;4.0 supports TCP/IP and Novell IPX network protocols on a local area network as well as point-to-point modem connections using TAPI, the Windows Telephony API.</P>
