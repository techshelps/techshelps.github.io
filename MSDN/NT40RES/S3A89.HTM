<H2>Connecting to the Internet</H2><P CLASS="t">Windows&nbsp;NT Workstation includes all the software you need to connect to and use the Internet. These components enable you to access the Internet:</P>
<UL><LI>The Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) network protocol in Windows&nbsp;NT version 4.0.</LI></UL><P>The TCP/IP network protocol is used by virtually all computers on the Internet.</P>
<UL><LI>Windows&nbsp;NT Workstation Dial-Up Networking.</LI></UL><P>Dial-Up Networking is used to connect to an Internet service provider (ISP) or other online service over a modem and phone line or by using an Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) card and ISDN line.</P>
<P></P>
<P>You can install Dial-Up Networking and the TCP/IP protocol by using the Networks option in Control Panel. For more information, see "TCP/IP Internet Configuration" and "Dial-Up Networking Internet Configuration" in this chapter or the corresponding topics in online Help or the <I>Windows&nbsp;NT Server</I> <I>Networking Supplement</I>. </P>
<P>There are two methods used to connect clients to the Internet: </P>
<UL><LI>By using Point to Point Protocol (PPP).</LI></UL><UL><LI>By using Serial Line Internet Protocol (SLIP).</LI></UL><P>The most popular and more robust method is PPP. The Microsoft Network (MSN) acts as a PPP provider, connecting users who have MSN accounts to the Internet. See the procedure in the next section for an example of how to connect to MSN.</P>
<P></P>
<P CLASS="t">In addition to the Windows&nbsp;NT Workstation software listed above, before you connect to the Internet, you need the following items:</P>
<UL><LI>A modem and telephone line or ISDN card and ISDN line.</LI></UL><UL><LI>An account with an Internet service provider .</LI></UL><P>An Internet service provider is a company that gives remote users access to the Internet.
