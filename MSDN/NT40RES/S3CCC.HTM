<H2>C2 Security</H2><P CLASS="t">The National Computer Security Center (NCSC) is the United States government agency responsible for performing software product security evaluations. These evaluations are carried out against a set of requirements outlined in the NCSC publication <I>Department of Defense Trusted Computer System Evaluation Criteria</I>, which is commonly referred to as the "Orange Book."</P>
<P CLASS="t">Windows&nbsp;NT has been successfully evaluated by the NCSC at the C2 security level as defined in the Orange Book, which covers the base operating system.</P>
<P CLASS="t">In addition, Windows&nbsp;NT is currently under evaluation for its networking component of a secure system in compliance to the NCSC's "Red Book." The Red Book is an interpretation of the Orange Book as applies to network security.</P>
<P CLASS="t">Some of the most important requirements of C2-level security are the following:</P>
<UL><LI>The owner of a resource (such as a file) must be able to control access to the resource. </LI></UL><UL><LI>The operating system must protect objects so that they are not randomly reused by other processes. For example, the system protects memory so that its contents cannot be read after it is freed by a process. In addition, when a file is deleted, users must not be able to access the data from that file.</LI></UL><UL><LI>Each user must identify himself or herself by typing a unique logon name and password before being allowed access to the system. The system must be able to use this unique identification to track the activities of the user.</LI></UL><UL><LI>System administrators must be able to audit security-related events. Access to this audit data must be limited to authorized administrators.</LI></UL><UL><LI>The system must protect itself from external interference or tampering, such as modification of the running system or of system files stored on disk.</LI></UL><P></P></BODY></HTML>
