<H2>Using Event Logs to Troubleshoot Problems</H2><P CLASS="t">Careful monitoring of event logs can help you predict and identify the sources of system problems. For example, if log warnings show that a disk driver can only read or write to a sector after several retries, the sector will likely go bad eventually. Logs can also confirm problems with application software: If an application crashes, an application event log can provide a record of activity leading up to the event. </P>
<P CLASS="t">The following are suggestions to help you use event logs to diagnose problems:</P>
<UL><LI>Archive logs in log format. The binary data associated with an event is discarded if you archive data in text or comma-delimited format.</LI></UL><UL><LI>If you suspect a hardware component is the origin of system problems, filter the system log to show only those events generated by the component.</LI></UL><UL><LI>If a particular event seems related to system problems, try searching the event log to find other instances of the same event or to judge the frequency of an error.</LI></UL><UL><LI>Note Event IDs. These numbers match a text description in a source message file. This number can be used by product-support representatives to understand what occurred in the system. </LI></UL><P></P></BODY></HTML>
