<H2>Debugging Overview</H2><P CLASS="t">There are three approaches you can take to finding the cause of kernel STOP errors:</P>
<UL><LI>Set up a remote debug session with the Microsoft Support Network. This process is needed if a memory dump file cannot be generated or if the target computer halts with a STOP screen. The connection process involves configuring your target computer for a connection (modem to modem) to a host computer located at Microsoft. </LI></UL><UL><LI>Set up a local debug session with Microsoft Support Network by using a Remote Access Service (RAS) server. This process is needed if a memory dump file cannot be generated or if the target computer halts with a STOP screen. The connection process involves using a null modem cable to configure both your target computer and your host computer. The host is then networked to a RAS server and the debugging information is sent to Microsoft over an asynchronous connection. You can also analyze the debugging information at your host computer.</LI></UL><UL><LI>Set up your target computer to write the contents of its RAM to a memory dump file when a kernel STOP error occurs. You can then use the dump analysis utilities to analyze the memory dump, or send the memory dump file to technical support personnel for their analysis.</LI></UL><P></P></BODY></HTML>
