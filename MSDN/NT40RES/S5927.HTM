<H3>SCSI Hard Disks</H3><P CLASS="t">If your SCSI controller can be configured to perform translation, you can create a boot partition or system partition that is within the first 1 or 4 GB of the disk, depending upon the translation used by the controller. To create the largest possible system and boot partitions, enable translation and recreate the partitions on the disk. If translation was not already enabled, you will need to low-level format the hard disk before recreating the partitions. Check with your hardware manufacturer for specific advice and details.</P>
<P CLASS="t">Once Windows&nbsp;NT has been initialized, it uses its SCSI disk device drivers to directly interact with the disk without using the BIOS INT 13 interface. Therefore, the Starting and Ending Head, Sector, and Cylinder fields are not important after the computer has completed startup.</P></BODY></HTML>
