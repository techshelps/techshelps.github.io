<H2>Configuring the Computer for Dual-booting and Triple-booting</H2><P CLASS="t">This section describes how to start up multiple operating systems and contains procedures for configuring your computer to do so.</P>
<P CLASS="t">Each operating system uses one or more file systems to organize data within volumes. Some operating systems can use the same file systems and some can not. For example, MS-DOS, Windows&nbsp;95, and Windows&nbsp;NT can each use FAT volumes; Windows&nbsp;NT and Unix each use file systems that are unusable by the other. Operating systems that use the same file systems can share volumes, meaning that a user can access files on these volumes when running any of the operating systems.</P>
<P></P>
<P CLASS="t"><B>Note</B></P>
<P>Create an Emergency Repair Disk for your Windows&nbsp;NT installation by using the Repair Disk utility (Rdisk.exe) in the <I>%systemroot%\</I>System32 folder before you install other operating systems on the computer. You should also have a Windows&nbsp;NT startup floppy disk that you know works to start your computer. For more information about these disks, see Chapter 20, "Preparing for and Performing Recovery."</P>
