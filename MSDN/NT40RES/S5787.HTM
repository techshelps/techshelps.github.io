<H3>Using TCP/IP for Scalability</H3><P CLASS="t">TCP/IP delivers a scalable internetworking technology widely supported by hardware and software vendors.</P>
<P CLASS="t">When TCP/IP is used as the enterprise-networking protocol, the Windows-based networking solutions from Microsoft can be used on an existing internetwork to provide client and server support for TCP/IP and connectivity utilities. These solutions include</P>
<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows&nbsp;NT Workstation, with enhancements to support wide area networks (WAN), TCP/IP printing, FTP, Telnet, DHCP, WINS, and DNS client software, Windows Sockets, and extended LMHOSTS file.</LI></UL><UL><LI>Microsoft Windows&nbsp;NT Server, with the same enhancements as Windows&nbsp;NT Workstation, plus Internet Information Server, DHCP Server, WINS Server, and DNS Server software.</LI></UL><UL><LI>Microsoft Windows&nbsp;95, with enhancements to support wide area networks (WAN), DHCP, WINS, and DNS client software, extended LMHOSTS file, and Windows Sockets.</LI></UL><UL><LI>Microsoft TCP/IP-32 for Windows for Workgroups, with Windows Sockets support, can be used to provide access for Windows for Workgroups computers to Windows&nbsp;NT, LAN Manager, and other TCP/IP systems. Microsoft TCP/IP-32 includes DHCP, WINS and DNS client software.</LI></UL><UL><LI>Microsoft LAN Manager — including both client and server support for Windows Sockets — and MS-DOS–based connectivity utilities. The Microsoft Network Client 2.0 software on the Windows&nbsp;NT Server compact disc includes new Microsoft TCP/IP support with DHCP and WINS clients.</LI></UL><P></P>

<P CLASS="t">As shown in Figure 30.2, the current version of TCP/IP for Windows&nbsp;NT also supports IP routing in systems with multiple network adapters attached to separate physical networks (<I>multihomed systems</I>).</P>
