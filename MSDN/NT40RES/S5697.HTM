<H3>Test the Rollout</H3><P CLASS="t">Test the deployment method you choose in the lab before performing the pilot rollout. This will help you compose a complete checklist to use during rollout and will help you identify potential problems. To perform the test, the planning and installation teams will need to perform the following steps:</P>
<P>    1.    Install Windows&nbsp;NT Workstation 4.0 source files on a distribution server. This can be a dedicated server in the lab, or one of the servers used in daily operations in your organization. Make setup choices based on your preferred client configuration tested in the lab. </P>
<P>    2.    Create and test an automated installation by creating an unattended answer file, using Setup Manager, to predefine answers for Setup. Document the key parts of the setup file that vary depending on which computers are receiving the installation.</P>
<P>    3.    Determine and test how you will deploy Windows&nbsp;NT Workstation from the server, without having to touch the client computers. Your options include the following:</P>
<UL><LI>Use management software such as Microsoft Systems Management Server.</LI></UL><UL><LI>For smaller LANs, use Unattended Setup in conjunction with Setup Manager.</LI></UL><UL><LI>Modify the login scripts on the server. </LI></UL><UL><LI>Send a setup script (batch file) that runs Windows&nbsp;NT Workstation 4.0.</LI></UL><UL><LI>Send Setup as an embedded link in an electronic mail message.</LI></UL><P>    4.    Install Windows&nbsp;NT Workstation on one or more computers in the lab, using the files on the distribution server and your chosen method of deployment.</P>
<P>    5.    Document the process for the rest of the installation team. </P>
