<H3>Name Resolution with Host Files</H3><P CLASS="t">For computers located on remote subnets where WINS is not used, the HOSTS and LMHOSTS files provide mappings for names to IP addresses. This name-resolution method was used on internetworks before DNS and WINS were developed. The HOSTS file can be used as a local DNS equivalent; the LMHOSTS file can be used as a local WINS equivalent.</P>
<P></P>
<P CLASS="t"><B>Note</B></P>
<P>Sample versions of LMHOSTS and HOSTS files are added to the Windows&nbsp;NT \<I>systemroot</I>\System32\drivers\Etc directory when you install Microsoft TCP/IP.</P>
<P></P>
<H4><A NAME="sec0"></A>HOSTS</H4><P CLASS="t">Microsoft TCP/IP can be configured to search HOSTS (the local host table file) for mappings of remote host names to IP addresses. The HOSTS file format is the same as the format for host tables in the 4.3 Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD) UNIX <I>/etc/hosts</I> file. For example, the entry for a computer with an address of 192.102.73.6 and a host name of mfg1.widgets.com looks like this:</P>
<P CLASS="spacing"><BR></P>
<PRE>192.102.73.6        mfg1.widgets.com
</PRE>
<P CLASS="t">You can create the file by using a text editor — for example, Notepad — to create, and change the HOSTS file because it is a simple text file. (An example of the HOSTS format is provided in the file named HOSTS.sam in the Windows NT %<I>systemroot%</I>\System32\Drivers\Etc directory. This is only an example file; do not use this file as the primary HOSTS file.)Edit the sample HOSTS file (created when you install TCP/IP) to include remote host names and IP addresses for each computer with which you will communicate.</P>
<H4><A NAME="sec1"></A>LMHOSTS</H4><P CLASS="t">The LMHOSTS file is a local text file that maps IP addresses to NetBIOS computer names. It contains entries for Windows-networking computers located outside the local subnet. The LMHOSTS file is read when WINS or broadcast name resolution fails; resolved entries are stored in a local cache for later access.</P>
<P CLASS="t">For example, the LMHOSTS table file entry for a computer with an address of 192.45.36.5 and a computer name of mrp2 looks like this:</P>
<P CLASS="spacing"><BR></P>
<PRE>192.45.36.5        mrp2
</PRE>

<P CLASS="t">The LMHOSTS file is typically used for small-scale networks that do not have servers. For more information about the LMHOSTS file, see "Using LMHOSTS Files" chapter in this book.</P>
