<H1>Chapter 2 - Customizing Setup</H1><P CLASS="t">You can customize the installation of Windows&nbsp;NT Workstation that you distribute to your users. Customization can be as simple as specifying which features in the retail product you want to use. Or, you can include applications or additional files, such as corporate-specific help files, along with the installation of Windows&nbsp;NT Workstation. You can even tailor the customized setup so that different computers get different configurations. And with Unattended Setup, you can supply answers to all the prompts the user would normally need to respond to during setup. Even the computername and username for each computer can be supplied via Unattended Setup.</P>
<P CLASS="t">This chapter is loosely organized according to the features you will most likely need to implement, and the order in which you would perform the tasks. It does not parallel the order of the setup process.</P></BODY></HTML>
