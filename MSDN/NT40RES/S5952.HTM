<H3>Starting Up by Using the Windows&nbsp;NT Startup Floppy Disk</H3><P CLASS="t">Using the Windows&nbsp;NT startup floppy disk enables you to start up Windows&nbsp;NT so that you can troubleshoot the problem, recover from the problem, or just get the computer running again. Being able to restart the computer also enables you to finish the work that you need to get done now, and troubleshoot the problem later.</P>
<P CLASS="t">In a way, the Windows&nbsp;NT startup floppy disk is a troubleshooting tool. If you cannot start the computer by using the hard disk, and you can start by using the Windows&nbsp;NT startup floppy disk, the problem is probably one of the following:</P>
<UL><LI>There are problems with the disk that contains the system partition, and the boot partition is on another disk.</LI></UL><UL><LI>Something is wrong with the system partition itself, the Partition Boot Sector for the system partition, or the files on the system partition that are needed to start Windows&nbsp;NT. </LI></UL><UL><LI>On an x86-based computer, you are reconfiguring your disks, and your first hard disk does not have a system partition yet.</LI></UL><P></P></BODY></HTML>
