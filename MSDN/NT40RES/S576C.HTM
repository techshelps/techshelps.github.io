<P CLASS="t">Despite the large queue, this chart makes it evident that a single process, represented by the tall, white bar, is using much more than its share of the processor—nearly 80% on average. If multiple processes were at work, no single bar would be so tall and there would be multiple bars at nearly the same height.</P></BODY></HTML>
