<H3>Networking Windows&nbsp;NT Workstation and Windows&nbsp;95 </H3><P CLASS="t">When determining ideal client configurations for a mixed environment of Windows&nbsp;NT Workstation and Windows&nbsp;95, consider what types of networks these systems will need to support. Both Windows&nbsp;NT Workstation and Windows&nbsp;95 provide network and protocol support for the following:</P>
<UL><LI>Client services for NetWare</LI></UL><UL><LI>Remote networking </LI></UL><UL><LI>TCP/IP, including PPP, SLIP, DHCP, and WINS</LI></UL><UL><LI>NetBEUI Protocol</LI></UL><UL><LI>NWLink IPX/SPX Compatible Transport</LI></UL><UL><LI>Windows Sockets Standard used by popular Internet applications</LI></UL><UL><LI>OSF, DCE, and RPC available for advanced client-server applications and used extensively by Windows&nbsp;NT</LI></UL><UL><LI>Peer-to-peer networking</LI></UL><UL><LI>Internet connectivity</LI></UL><P></P>
<P CLASS="t">The networking implementation for Windows&nbsp;95 is slightly different than that for Windows&nbsp;NT Workstation. In order to support all Microsoft networking products that use the Server Message Block (SMB) protocol, install the Client for Microsoft Networks redirector (Vredir.vxd). This allows Windows&nbsp;95 computers to connect to computers running any of the following networking software:</P>
<UL><LI>Windows&nbsp;95</LI></UL><UL><LI>Windows&nbsp;NT</LI></UL><UL><LI>Windows for Workgroups</LI></UL><UL><LI>LAN Manager</LI></UL><UL><LI>Workgroup Add-on for MS-DOS</LI></UL><P></P>
<P CLASS="t">Refer to Chapter 1, "Decide on the Preferred Client Configuration" for more information on network protocol support and configuration.</P>
<H4><A NAME="sec0"></A>Network Connections</H4><P CLASS="t">In Windows&nbsp;NT Workstation, a user can always connect to any network resource he or she has permission to access. If the current logon session is for a different account, the user can fill in his or her domain name and username in the Connect As text box in the Connect Network Drive dialog box. </P>
<P CLASS="t">In Windows&nbsp;95, this "connect as" feature is not available. To connect to a network resource from Windows&nbsp;95, the user must log on with an account that has access to that resource.</P>
<P CLASS="t">In either operating system, the <B>net view</B> command can also be used to map a network drive. For syntax and usage, use the <B>net help</B> command.</P>
<H4><A NAME="sec1"></A>Persistent Connections</H4><P CLASS="t">In Windows&nbsp;NT Workstation, persistent network connections are enabled by default. To disable persistent connections, clear the "Reconnect at Logon" checkbox in the Connect Network Drive dialog box.</P>
<P CLASS="t">In Windows&nbsp;95, Quick Logon is enabled by default. This network logon option restores the mapping of drive letters to network resources, without actually establishing a session for each persistent network connection. If you want to establish sessions for persistent connections during logon, you can enable Logon and Restore Network Connections. For information on how to do so, see chapter 8, "Windows&nbsp;95 on Microsoft Networks," of the <I>Windows&nbsp;95 Resource Kit</I>.</P>
<P CLASS="t">For persistent connections from Windows&nbsp;95, select the "Reconnect at logon" checkbox.</P>
<H4><A NAME="sec2"></A>Resource Sharing</H4><P CLASS="t">Windows&nbsp;NT operating systems allow users to set security permissions on directories, individual files, printers, and other resources. Windows&nbsp;95 does not support security on individual files.</P>
<P CLASS="t">Before a user can share a resource on a computer running Windows&nbsp;95, the computer must be configured for share-level or user-level security. Also, File and Printer Sharing services must be installed, using the Network option in Control Panel. The Printers dialog box is used to set access rights to printers in a similar manner.</P>
<P CLASS="t">For computers to share resources such as printers, volumes, CD-ROM drives, and directories, all the computers must be running a common protocol. </P></BODY></HTML>
