<P><B>access permission</B></P>
<P>A rule associated with an object (usually a directory, file, or printer) to regulate which users can have access to the object and in what manner. <I>See also</I> user right.</P>
<P><B>access privileges</B></P>
<P>Permissions set by Macintosh users that allow them to view and make changes to folders on a server. By setting access privileges (called permissions when set on the computer running Windows NT Server) you control which Macintoshes can use folders in a volume. Services for Macintosh translates access privileges set by Macintosh users to the equivalent Windows NT permissions.</P>
<P><B>account</B></P>
<P><I>See</I> user account; group account.</P>
<P><B>account lockout</B></P>
<P>A Windows NT Server security feature that locks a user account if a number of failed logon attempts occur within a specified amount of time, based on account policy lockout settings. (Locked accounts cannot log on.) <I>See also</I> password parameters.</P>
<P><B>account policy</B></P>
<P>Controls the way passwords must be used by all user accounts of a domain, or of an individual computer. Specifics include minimum password length, how often a user must change his or her password, and how often users can reuse old passwords. Account policy can be set for all user accounts in a domain when administering a domain, and for all user accounts of a single workstation or member server when administering a computer.</P>
<P><B>ACK</B></P>
<P>Short for acknowledgment. The transmission control protocol (TCP) requires that the recipient of data packets acknowledge successful receipt of data.  Such acknowledgments (ACKs) generate additional network traffic, diminishing the rate at which data passes in favor of reliability.  To reduce the impact on performance, most hosts send an acknowledgment for every other segment or when a specified time interval has passed.</P>
<P><B>Active</B></P>
<P>The window or icon that you are currently using or that is currently selected. Windows&nbsp;NT always applies the next keystroke or command you choose to the active window. If a window is active, its title bar changes color to differentiate it from other windows. If an icon is active, its label changes color.</P>

<P><B>ARP reply packet</B></P>
<P>All ARP-enabled systems on the local IP network detect ARP request packets, and the system that owns the IP address in question replies by sending its physical address to the requester in an ARP reply packet.  The physical/IP address is then stored in the ARP cache of the requesting system for subsequent use. <I>See also</I> ARP; ARP request packet; IP; MAC address.</P>
<P><B>ARP request packet</B></P>
<P>If two systems are to communicate across a TCP/IP network, the system sending the packet must map the IP address of the final destination to the physical address of the final destination. This physical address is also referred to as a MAC address, a unique 48-bit number assigned to the network interface card by the manufacturer. IP acquires this physical address by broadcasting a special inquiry packet (an ARP request packet) containing the IP address of the destination system. <I>See also</I> ARP; IP; MAC; MAC address.</P>

<P>Also called a text file, a text-only file, or an ASCII text file, refers to a file in the universally recognized text format called ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange). An ASCII file contains characters, spaces, punctuation, carriage returns, and sometimes tabs and an end-of-file marker, but it contains no formatting information. This generic format is useful for transferring files between programs that could not otherwise understand each other's documents. <I>See also</I> text file. </P>
<P><B>AS/400</B></P>
<P>A type of IBM minicomputer.</P>

<P><B>backup set</B></P>
<P>A collection of files from one drive that is backed up during a single backup operation.</P>
<P><B>backup set catalog</B></P>
<P>At the end of each backup set, Windows NT Backup stores a summary of file and/or directory information in a backup set catalog. Catalog information includes the number of tapes in a set of tapes as well as the date they were created and the dates of each file in the catalog. Catalogs are created for each backup set and are stored on the last tape in the set. <I>See also</I> backup set.</P>

<P><B>backup types:</B></P>
<P><B>copy backup</B></P>
<P>Copies all selected files, but does not mark each file as having been backed up.  Copying is useful if you want to back up files between normal and incremental backups, because copying will not invalidate these other backup operations.</P>
<P><B>daily backup</B></P>
<P>Copies all selected files that have been modified the day the daily backup is performed.</P>
<P><B>differential backup</B></P>
<P>Copies those files created or changed since the last normal (or incremental) backup. It does not mark files as having been backed up.</P>
<P><B>incremental backup</B></P>
<P>Backs up only those files created or changed since the last normal (or incremental) backup. It marks files as having been backed up.</P>
<P><B>normal backup</B></P>
<P>Copies all selected files and marks each as having been backed up. Normal backups give you the ability to restore files quickly because files on the last tape are the most current.</P>
<P><B>bandwidth</B></P>
<P>In communications, the difference between the highest and lowest frequencies in a given range. For example, a telephone line accommodates a bandwidth of 3000 Hz, the difference between the lowest (300Hz) and highest (3300 Hz) frequencies it can carry.

<P><B>bridge</B></P>
<P>Connects multiple networks, subnets, or rings into one large logical network. A bridge maintains a table of node addresses and based on this, forwards packets to a specific subnet, reducing traffic on other subnets. In a bridged network, there can be only one path to any destination (otherwise packets would circle the network, causing network storms). A bridge is more sophisticated than a repeater, but not as sophisticated as a router. <I>See also</I> packet; repeater; router; subnet.</P>
<P><B>broadcast datagrams</B></P>
<P>An IP datagram sent to all hosts on the subnet. <I>See also</I> datagram; Internet Protocol (IP); subnet.</P>

<P><B>brouter</B></P>
<P>Combines elements of the bridge and the router. Usually, a brouter acts as a router for one transport protocol (such as TCP/IP), sending packets of that format along detailed routes to their destinations. The brouter also acts as a bridge for all other types of packets (such as IPX), just passing them on, as long as they are not local to the LAN segment from which they originated. <I>See also</I> bridge; packet; router.</P>
<P><B>browse</B></P>
<P>To view available network resources by looking through lists of folders, files, user accounts, groups, domains, or computers. Browsing allows users on a Windows NT network to see what domains and computers are accessible from their local computer. <I>See also</I> Windows NT browser system.</P>

<P><B>built-in groups</B></P>
<P>Are default groups provided with Windows&nbsp;NT Workstation and Windows&nbsp;NT Server which have been granted useful collections of rights and built-in abilities. In most cases, a built-in group provides all the capabilities needed by a particular user. For example, if a domain user account belongs to the built-in Administrators group, logging on with that account gives a user administrative capabilities over the domain and the servers of the domain. To provide a needed set of capabilities to a user account, assign it to the appropriate built-in group. <I>See also</I> groups, User Manager, User Manager for Domains.</P>

<P><B>change log</B></P>
<P>An inventory of the most recent changes made to the directory database such as new or changed passwords, new or changed user and group accounts, and any changes to associated group memberships and user rights. Change logs provide fault tolerance, so if your system crashes before a write completes, Windows NT can complete the write the next time you boot. This log holds only a certain number of changes, however, so when a new change is added, the oldest change is deleted. <I>See also</I> directory database; fault tolerance.</P>
<P><B>CHAP</B></P>
<P>Acronym for Challenge Handshake Authentication Protocol, used by Microsoft RAS to negotiate the most secure form of encrypted authentication supported by both server and client. <I>See also</I> encryption.</P>
