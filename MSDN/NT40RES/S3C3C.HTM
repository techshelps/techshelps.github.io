<H2>Backup Utilities</H2><H3><A NAME="sec0"></A>AT: Enables You to Schedule Windows&nbsp;NT Backup </H3><P CLASS="t">The Windows&nbsp;NT Backup utility, Ntbackup.exe, does not include functionality for schedule unattended backups. However, by using the Schedule service with the command line capabilities of Ntbackup, you can set up unattended backups.</P>
<P CLASS="t">The following procedure shows how to use the Schedule service and Ntbackup to schedule an unattended backup of the entire C drive of a computer with an installed tape device. With minor modifications, these steps could also allow for scheduling unattended backups from a computer on a network to a computer with an installed tape device or other configurations.</P>
<H4><A NAME="sec1"></A>To schedule unattended backup</H4><P>    1.    Start the Schedule service on the computer with the tape device already installed. This can be done by using the Services option in Control Panel, clicking <B>Schedule</B>, and clicking <B>Start</B>. Alternatively, you can configure the Schedule service to start every time Windows&nbsp;NT starts by clicking <B>Startup</B> and setting the <B>Startup Type</B> to <B>Automatic</B>. </P>
<P>    2.    Using any text editor, such as Notepad, create a command file such as Mybackup.cmd to perform the commands to backup the files.</P>
<P>This example:</P>
<P CLASS="spacing"><BR></P>
<PRE>ntbackup backup c: /D "My Backup Files" /B /L "c:\backup.log"
</PRE>
<P>does the following:</P>
<UL><LI>Backs up all files on the C drive.</LI></UL><UL><LI>Replaces any files currently on the tape.</LI></UL><UL><LI>Labels the backup set "My Backup Files." </LI></UL><UL><LI>Backs up the local registry.</LI></UL><UL><LI>Logs all backup information to C:\Backup.log.</LI></UL><P>    3.    Using the AT command, schedule the command file (Mybackup.cmd) to run when desired. The following AT command schedules Mybackup.cmd to execute at 11:00 P.M. every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday:</P>
<P CLASS="spacing"><BR></P>
<PRE>AT 23:00 /every:M,W,F MYBACKUP.CMD
</PRE>
<P CLASS="t">When there is no tape in the drive and you use the AT command without the interactive switch to run Windows&nbsp;NT Backup, the backup encounters an error or is unable to accept the command line. As a result, Windows&nbsp;NT Backup stops responding. You cannot run Windows&nbsp;NT Backup again until you restart Windows&nbsp;NT. </P>
<P CLASS="t">Use the /INTERACTIVE switch with the AT command to open the interactive desktop. This way, if any errors occur, you will be able to correct them and continue, or quit Windows&nbsp;NT Backup.</P>
<P CLASS="t">For information about AT options, type <B>AT /?</B> at a command prompt or search the online Command Reference for AT. For additional information on available Ntbackup options, use the <B>Help </B>menu when running Ntbackup.exe. </P>
