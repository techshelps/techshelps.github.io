<H3>Using More Than One Windows Operating System</H3><P CLASS="t">Windows&nbsp;95, Windows 3.1, or Windows 3.11 can reside on the same computer as Windows&nbsp;NT. Windows&nbsp;NT can be installed in the same folder as Windows 3.1 or Windows 3.11 because Windows&nbsp;NT puts all of its important files in the system32 folder. Windows&nbsp;NT only uses the %<I>systemroot</I>% folder for legacy ini files that it maintains for 16-bit application programs and backwards compatibility. So, all of the Windows 3.1 or Windows 3.11 files will be either in the %<I>systemroot</I>% folder or in the %<I>systemroot</I>%\System folder. This organization allows the two operating systems to co-exist in the same folder. </P>
<P CLASS="t">You can also install Windows&nbsp;NT into a different folder. Windows 3.1 or Windows 3.11 still co-exist with Windows&nbsp;NT, but you do not get the option to migrate ini and program manager settings from Windows 3.1 or Windows 3.11.</P>
<P CLASS="t">If you install Windows&nbsp;95 and Windows&nbsp;NT on the same disk, you must install them in different folders.</P>
<P CLASS="t">You can also install different versions of the Windows&nbsp;NT operating system on your hard disk, as long as you install them on different folders. If you are going to log into a domain, each instance of Windows&nbsp;NT must have a different computer name, which you specify during Windows&nbsp;NT Setup. You should ask your network administrator for the computer name to use before running Windows&nbsp;NT Setup.</P>
<P CLASS="t">When you install multiple Windows operating systems on the same computer, you need to install Windows-based application programs by using each operating system. For example, if you install both Windows&nbsp;95 and Windows&nbsp;NT 4.0, you need to install application programs when you are running Windows&nbsp;NT 4.0 and when you are running Windows&nbsp;95. If you have more than one version of Windows&nbsp;NT installed, you also need to install the application programs when running each version. To install Windows-based application programs when running Windows&nbsp;NT 4.0, you must log on with a user ID that has administrative privileges.</P></BODY></HTML>
