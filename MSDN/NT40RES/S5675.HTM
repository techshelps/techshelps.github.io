<H3>Performance Monitor</H3><P CLASS="t">Performance Monitor, included with Windows&nbsp;NT Workstation and Windows&nbsp;NT Server, is a graphical tool for measuring the performance of Windows&nbsp;NT computers on the network. </P>
<P CLASS="t">Windows&nbsp;95 includes a similar tool, System Monitor. These tools are used by administrators to identify bottlenecks or potential problems.</P>
<P CLASS="t">You can use Performance Monitor to monitor the activity on any computer on the network that is running either Windows&nbsp;NT Workstation or Windows&nbsp;NT Server. However, Performance Monitor cannot view the activity on a computer running Windows&nbsp;95. Likewise, System Monitor can be used to monitor the activity on any computer on the network that is running Windows&nbsp;95, but it will not view the activity on a computer running Windows&nbsp;NT Workstation or Windows&nbsp;NT Server. A network administrator should have access to a computer running Windows&nbsp;95, in order to use System Monitor, as well as the computer running Windows&nbsp;NT Workstation or Windows&nbsp;NT Server, in order to use Performance Monitor.</P></BODY></HTML>
