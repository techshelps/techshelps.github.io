<H2>System Policy</H2><P CLASS="t">On computers running Windows&nbsp;NT Workstation or Windows&nbsp;NT Server, the contents of the user profile are taken from the user portion of the Windows&nbsp;NT Registry. Another portion of the registry, the local computer portion, contains configuration settings that can be managed, along with user profiles, using System Policy Editor. With this tool, you create a system policy to control user work environments and actions, and to enforce system configuration for all computers running Windows&nbsp;NT Workstation and Windows&nbsp;NT Server.</P>
<P CLASS="t">With system policy, you can control some aspects of user work environments without enforcing the restrictions of a mandatory user profile. You can restrict what users can do from the desktop; such as restrict certain options in Control Panel, customize parts of the desktop, or configure network settings.</P>
<P CLASS="t">To enforce system policy on your network, you need at least one computer on your network running Windows NT Server, configured as a primary domain controller (PDC). For information on enforcing system policy on your network, see Chapter 3, "Managing User Work Environments" in Windows NT Server version 4.0 <I>Concepts and Planning</I>.</P></BODY></HTML>
