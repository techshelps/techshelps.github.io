<H3>Printer Fonts for HP Printers</H3><P CLASS="t">The TrueType fonts shipped with Windows&nbsp;NT print on all printers. You can add other fonts described in the following sections.</P>
<H4><A NAME="sec0"></A>HP LaserJet Printer Fonts</H4><P CLASS="t">In Windows&nbsp;NT, all HPPCL (LaserJet) printers are supported by the Hppcl.dll or Hppcl5ms.dll minidrivers. Additional LaserJet III scalable outline fonts are available from Hewlett-Packard as cartridges or downloadable soft fonts. With the HPPCL drivers in Windows&nbsp;NT, downloadable outline fonts can be installed with the Font Installer.</P>
<H4><A NAME="sec1"></A>HP DeskJet Printer Fonts</H4><P CLASS="t">The HP DeskJet Printers are ink-jet printers. The Windows&nbsp;NT driver for the Hewlett-Packard DeskJet printer family supports Windows&nbsp;NT vector screen fonts, DeskJet internal fonts, soft fonts, and TrueType. DeskJet printers can print at resolutions of 75, 150, 300, and 600 dpi. Without font cartridges, the DeskJet includes only the built-in Courier and LinePrinter fonts. You can add font cartridges. For instructions, see "Font Cartridges" earlierMESMES in this chapter. At this time, font cartridges for DeskJet printers are available only from Hewlett-Packard.</P>
<P CLASS="t">DeskJet soft fonts are installed with the Font Installer. To use downloadable fonts on the DeskJet printers, you must install either HP22707A or HP22707B RAM cartridges. If you install more than one cartridge, be sure to specify the total amount of RAM required when setting printer memory. For more information about setting printer memory, see "Specifying Virtual Printer Memory" laterMESMES in this chapter.</P>
<P CLASS="t">DeskJet internal, downloadable, and cartridge fonts will not work in landscape orientation. This is a hardware, not a driver, limitation. For landscape mode, print with Windows&nbsp;NT vector screen fonts such as Modern or Roman.</P>
<H4><A NAME="sec2"></A>HP PaintJet Printer Fonts</H4><P CLASS="t">The HP PaintJet is a color ink-jet printer. The Hewlett-Packard PaintJet driver in Windows&nbsp;NT composes a full page at a time in 180x180 dpi resolution and outputs each page to the PaintJet as a large bitmap. This produces the highest possible quality of output but results in large spool files. For improved printing speed, you can select the <B>Print Directly To The Printer</B> option on the Scheduling tab of the <B>Printer</B> <B>Properties</B> dialog box. This option prevents the creation of spool files.</P>
<P></P>
<P CLASS="t"><B>Note</B></P>
<P>Be aware that in the event of a disruption during printing, a spool file enables you to resume printing with no loss of data. Without spooling, you'll need to resend the document to the printer.</P>
<P></P>
<P CLASS="t">The PaintJet driver supports the printing of PaintJet internal fonts, Windows&nbsp;NT raster and vector screen fonts, PaintJet soft fonts, and TrueType. The same considerations apply for printing raster screen fonts on the PaintJet as for using the 24-pin dot matrix printers in 180x180 dpi resolution (see "Dot Matrix Printer Fonts," earlier in this chapterMESMES). PaintJet soft fonts are not downloadable fonts. They are used internally by the driver, which places them as necessary into the full-page bitmap during page composition. The font itself is never sent to the printer. </P>
<P CLASS="t">You can install PaintJet soft fonts, which have a .pjf filename extension, the same as downloadable soft fonts. For instructions, see "Downloadable FontsMESMES" earlier in this chapter. Windows&nbsp;NT supports PaintJet soft fonts for Courier 10-CPI and Letter Gothic 12-CPI and 18-CPI. Additional soft fonts can be obtained from Hewlett-Packard. Scalable PaintJet soft fonts are also available from Hewlett-Packard in the HP Color PrintKit.</P></BODY></HTML>
