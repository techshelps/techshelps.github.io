<P CLASS="t">If you have a computer running Windows NT Server on your network, user profiles can be stored on a server so that user profiles can follow users to any computer running the Windows&nbsp;NT version 4.0 platform on the network. These are called roaming user profiles. You can also assign mandatory user profiles to prevent users from changing any desktop settings.</P>
