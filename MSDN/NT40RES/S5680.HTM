<H3>User Interface</H3><P CLASS="t">Use the new Windows&nbsp;NT Workstation 4.0 user interface to provide ease of use and maximum functionality in accessing Windows&nbsp;NT Workstation 4.0 features. Because this interface is the same as that for Windows&nbsp;95, users can move easily between the two operating systems. The new interface offers significantly more functionality and efficiency, and is installed by default.</P>
<P CLASS="t">However, if a rapid migration is required, and training is not immediately available, you might prefer to use the Windows 3.x Program Manager Interface. To do so, install the Windows 3.x File Manager and Program Manager. </P></BODY></HTML>
