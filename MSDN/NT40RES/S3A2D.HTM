<P CLASS="t">To preserve existing settings when upgrading from an earlier version of Windows&nbsp;NT Workstation, add the following line to the [Unattended] section:</P>
<P CLASS="spacing"><BR></P>
<PRE>NtUpgrade = manual | yes | no | single

<P CLASS="t">Where:</P>
<P CLASS="term1"><B>manual</B></P>
<P CLASS="dt1">indicates that the user is to be prompted as to whether the existing installation is to be completely replaced, or upgraded with system settings intact. If the user chooses to replace the existing version, he or she will also be prompted to specify a directory in which to install Windows&nbsp;NT Workstation 4.0.

<P CLASS="t">As another example, if BitsPerPel = 16 and all other values are set to 0, then the card will be configured in 640x480, 64 K colors, and 60 Hz (again, as long as that mode exists).</P>
<P CLASS="t">Normally, the user is prompted to test the video settings. For an unattended installation, you might want the settings to be stored without testing. To specify whether the settings should be stored without testing, add the following line to the [Display] section:</P>
