<H3>Answer Files (Unattend.txt) </H3><P CLASS="t">Answer files are text files that provide the answers to some or all of the prompts that the end user would otherwise need to respond to during Setup. The answer file is specified with the <B>/u</B> option to the <B>winnt </B>or <B>winnt32</B> command. </P>
<P CLASS="t">The simplest way to use this feature is to specify in the answer file those features of the Windows&nbsp;NT Workstation retail product that you want to include in the installation. However, you can also use the answer file to display company information during GUI-mode setup, to specify a keyboard layout, to join a domain or workgroup, and to install device drivers, protocols, or network adapters.</P>
<P CLASS="t">A sample answer file, Unatttend.txt, is included on the Windows&nbsp;NT Workstation 4.0 product CD. Using this file as a template, you can create one or more answer files to customize your installation of Windows&nbsp;NT Workstation. For a general discussion of answer files see "Answer Files (Unattend.txt)," later in this chapter. See Appendix A, "Answer Files and UDFs," for a discussion of the sections and syntax you can use in your answer files.</P>

<P CLASS="t"><B>Note</B></P>
<P>The options available in Unattend.txt have changed since earlier versions of Windows&nbsp;NT Workstation. </P>
