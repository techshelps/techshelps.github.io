<H3>Automating Installation</H3><P CLASS="t">Automating the installation is a key step in reducing the cost of migration. The method of setup automation will depend upon the existing network infrastructure, the number and variety of computers to be upgraded, and the schedule for deployment, among other factors. Based on these criteria, the following options can help you smoothly deploy Windows&nbsp;NT Workstation:</P>
<P><I></I></P>
<UL><LI>Use Setup Manager to create unattended answer files.</LI></UL><P>By creating an unattended answer file with predetermined answers for installation questions, the installation process can run from start to finish with limited or no user intervention.</P>
<P><I></I></P>
<UL><LI>Use management software such as Microsoft's Systems Management Server.</LI></UL><P>Management software allows you to "push" the installation from the server, so that you can install Windows&nbsp;NT Workstation 4.0 on an individual personal computer without ever touching the computer. This allows a small Installation team to deploy Windows&nbsp;NT Workstation to a large number of computers in a short period of time. In addition, this method requires little or no work on the part of the end users, allowing them to stay focused on productive work for the organization. Relieving the end users of the installation task also eliminates a potential source of installation errors.</P>
<P>This method is only possible with a system management program such as Microsoft Systems Management Server. If you plan to use system management software in automating the installation, make sure this has been acquired and tested. </P>
<P>Since you can use Systems Management Server to gather the detailed information about the resources already in use on your network, you might want to begin using it during the earliest stages of the deployment process. You can then use it later to simplify the pilot and final rollouts.</P>
<UL><LI>Modify login scripts, or send embedded setup scripts in e-mail.</LI></UL><P>You can automate the installation process by editing the login script for the user, or sending a link in electronic mail to a batch file that runs Windows&nbsp;NT Workstation 4.0 Setup. In these cases, the user only needs to log on or double-click an icon to start the installation. </P>
<UL><LI>Use the Sysdiff utility.</LI></UL><P>The Sysdiff utility allows you to record the variations between a standard retail installation of Windows&nbsp;NT Workstation and a customized version. If the difference file created by Sysdiff is available during setup, the Setup program applies the differences automatically.</P>
<P>Use Sysdiff to include applications in your customized installation of Windows&nbsp;NT Workstation. The Sysdiff utility is discussed in Chapter 2, "Customizing Setup."</P>
<UL><LI>Use third-party solutions (including OEM pre-installation).</LI></UL><P>Your organization may choose a third party solution for deploying Windows&nbsp;NT Workstation. These include custom solutions made available through a Microsoft Solution Provider, or pre-installation of the operating system by an Original Equipment Manufacturer. </P>

<H4><A NAME="sec0"></A>Unattended Answer Files for Windows&nbsp;NT Workstation 4.0 Setup</H4><P CLASS="t">Unattended answer files allow you to predefine responses to prompts that appear during Windows&nbsp;NT Workstation 4.0 Setup. If you need to conduct a similar installation more than five times, this is a good option. Begin planning for unattended installations while you are specifying the preferred client configuration. Make sure that you document each feature needed, so that you can automate the selection of these features. The chapters that follow provide detailed information on using unattended mode setup to deploy Windows&nbsp;NT Workstation, with or without an existing client-server network. Answer files are discussed in Chapter 2, "Customizing Setup."</P>
<H4><A NAME="sec1"></A>"Push" Installations for Windows&nbsp;NT Workstation 4.0 Setup</H4><P CLASS="t">You need to understand and plan in advance how the push installation process will work for a given computer. There are several alternatives for remotely initiating the installation, ranging from the use of a system management program to sending a setup script as an embedded link in electronic mail. You will want to consider how to push the installation for each computer and make sure that the client computers are configured to support this process.</P>
<P CLASS="t">For organizations with 50 or more computers, being physically present to install each client computer is not cost effective. An administrative software solution such as Microsoft's Systems Management Server can save you money and increase productivity. When using administrative software tools, additional client-side software may be needed. Be sure to include this software in the installation plan.</P>
