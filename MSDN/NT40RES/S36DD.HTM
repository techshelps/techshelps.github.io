<H3>System Processes</H3><P CLASS="t">Processes, which include both user applications and Windows NT services, can become bottlenecks. While investigating processor, disk, or memory use, chart use by process, and then start and stop the processes to see how your system responds. </P>
<P CLASS="t">Performance Monitor and Task Manager both show counts of running processes, including user programs and Windows&nbsp;NT services:</P>
<UL><LI>Task Manager is useful for short term monitoring. It lets you stop and restart applications and system services.</LI></UL><UL><LI>Performance Monitor includes more detailed counters and lets you log process data over time in chart or report format, set alerts on each process's use of resources, and monitor processes on remote computers. </LI></UL><P></P>
<P CLASS="t">Many of the tools on the Windows&nbsp;NT Resource Kit 4.0 CD also monitor processes in detail, including Process Viewer (PViewer.exe) and Process Monitor (PMon.exe). For more information, see Chapter 11, "Performance Monitoring Tools," and Rktools.hlp.</P>
<P></P>
<P CLASS="t"><B>Note</B></P>
<P>The Services Control Panel also displays Windows&nbsp;NT services and lets you start and stop them. The Services Control Panel shows all Windows&nbsp;NT services, regardless of the process in which they run. However, it lists services by service name whereas Performance Monitor and Task Manager display the names of executable files.</P>
<P>For a list of the default services and a description of each, see Windows NT Help in the Services Control Panel. Click Start, click Help, and type <B>Default Services</B>.</P>
<P></P>
<H4><A NAME="sec0"></A>Task Manager</H4><P CLASS="t">In Task Manager, select the Processes tab. It displays a table of active processes. From the <B>View</B> menu, click <B>Select</B> <B>Columns</B> to add additional measures of the processor time, memory use, process priority, handle and thread counts, and the process ID.</P>
<P><img src="xwr_h02.gif"></P>
<H4><A NAME="sec1"></A>Performance Monitor</H4><P CLASS="t">In Performance Monitor, select the Process object from the <B>Add To</B> dialog box. All active applications and services appear in the Instances box.</P>
<P><img src="xwr_h03.gif"></P>
<P CLASS="t">The following table lists processes commonly running on Windows&nbsp;NT&nbsp;4.0 Servers and Workstations without a network connection. It shows them as they appear in Performance Monitor and in Task Manager.</P>
<P></P>
<P CLASS="t"><B>Note</B></P>
<P>Process Explode (Pview.exe), Process Viewer (Pviewer.exe), and Process Monitor (Pmon.exe) all display important counts of system processes. Although the information from these tools is instantaneous and cannot be logged or collected, the tools require almost no setup, so they are very valuable for a quick look.</P>

<P CLASS="spacing"><BR></P><P></P>
<P CLASS="t">No matter what tool you choose, the processes that appear depend upon whether the computer is a server or workstation, and upon the services installed on the computer, including network services. User applications, including the executables for Performance Monitor and Task Manager, appear only when they are running. </P>
<P CLASS="t">Also, a process instance might not be visible for every active service. Performance Monitor and Task Manager display an instance for each executable process running on the system. Many services share a process to conserve system resources, so these appear together as one instance.</P>
<P CLASS="t">For example, many Windows&nbsp;NT 32-bit services, including Alerter, Clipbook Server, and Event Viewer, share the Services.exe process with the Windows&nbsp;NT Services Control Manager, a general process that starts all system services. Net Logon shares the Lsass.exe process with other security services. </P>
<P CLASS="t">It's difficult to monitor these services separately, although you can experiment in associating a service with threads in the process. The SC utility, in the Computer&nbsp;Configuration subdirectory on the Resource Kit CD, displays useful service configuration information, including the name of the process in which the service runs. For more information on SC, see Rktools.hlp.</P></BODY></HTML>
