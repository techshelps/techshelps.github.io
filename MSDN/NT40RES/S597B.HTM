<H3>Audit Determination</H3><P CLASS="t">Windows&nbsp;NT has an audit determination process similar to its access determination process, described earlier in this chapter. After access determination, Windows&nbsp;NT evaluates the following information for possible auditing:</P>
<UL><LI>The subject attempting the access (that is, the set of identifiers representing the subject)</LI></UL><UL><LI>The desired accesses with all generic access types mapped to standard and specific access types</LI></UL><UL><LI>The final determination of whether access is granted or denied</LI></UL><UL><LI>The audit ACL associated with the target object</LI></UL><P></P>
<P CLASS="t">Each ACE in the audit ACL is evaluated as follows:</P>
<P>    1.    Windows&nbsp;NT checks to see if the type is SystemAudit. If not, the ACE is skipped.</P>
<P>    2.    Windows&nbsp;NT compares the identifier in the ACE to the set of identifiers representing the subject. If no match is found, the ACE is skipped.</P>
<P>    3.    The desired accesses are compared to the access mask specified in the ACE. </P>
<P>    4.    If none of the accesses specified in the ACE's mask were requested, the ACE is skipped. The SUCCESSFUL_ACCESS_ACE_FLAG and FAILED_ACCESS_ACE_FLAG flags of the ACE are compared to the final determination of whether access was granted or denied. </P>
<P>    5.    If access was granted but the SUCCESSFUL_ACCESS_ACE_FLAG flag is not set, or if access was denied but the FAILED_ACCESS_ACE_FLAG flag is not set, the ACE is skipped.</P>
<P></P>
<P CLASS="t">If Windows&nbsp;NT performs all of these steps successfully, an audit message is generated.</P>
<P CLASS="t">The following scenario illustrates this process. In this scenario, a system access ACL is being evaluated. Here, Write access to the file object is granted, and the SUCCESSFUL_ACCESS_ACE_FLAG is set in each ACE.</P>

<P CLASS="t">In this example, Windows&nbsp;NT evaluates the ACL by comparing the desired access mask with each ACE and processes the desired mask as follows:</P>
<P>    1.    Windows&nbsp;NT evaluates an ACE for SnrMgrs (of which FredMgr is a member). However, when the desired access is compared to the access mask of the ACE, no match is found, and the ACE is skipped.</P>
<P>    2.    Windows&nbsp;NT evaluates the ACE for FredMgr and finds a match.</P>
<P>    3.    Windows&nbsp;NT checks access flags and finds the SUCCESSFUL_ACCESS_ACE_FLAG is set. Processing stops, and an audit message is generated.</P>
