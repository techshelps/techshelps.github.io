<H3>Kernel Debuggers</H3><P CLASS="t">The Windows&nbsp;NT kernel debuggers — <B>I386kd.exe</B>, <B>Alphakd.exe</B>, <B>Mipskd.exe</B>, and <B>Ppckd.exe</B> — are 32-bit executable files that are used on the host computer to debug the kernel on the target computer. Each host hardware platform has its own set of utilities, which are provided on the Windows&nbsp;NT product CD in the \Support\Debug directory.</P>
<P CLASS="t">The kernel debuggers can be used for either remote or local kernel debugging. If you use local kernel debugging, the host computer is located within a few feet of the target computer and the two computers communicate through a null modem serial cable. If you use remote kernel debugging, the host computer can be at any distance from the target computer because communication takes place through modems. </P>
<P CLASS="t">The host and target computers send debugging information back and forth through their communications ports. The ports on both computers must be configured to pass data at the same rate in bits per second (bps).</P>
<P CLASS="t">After a blue screen appears, record the important information in the message, then restart the computer. You might need to configure the target computer for local or remote debugging and reboot it a second time. You can then continue running Windows&nbsp;NT until the message is displayed again. After the blue screen is displayed the second time, call your technical support group and request assistance with the debugging. They can decide whether to debug the kernel STOP error locally or remotely and instruct you to configure your system appropriately.</P></BODY></HTML>
