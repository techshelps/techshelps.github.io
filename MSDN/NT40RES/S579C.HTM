<H2>Print Devices</H2><P><I></I></P>
<P CLASS="t"><I>Print devices</I> are the machines we call "printers." They produce hardcopy output by interpreting the printer language and creating a bitmap for each page. </P>
<P CLASS="t">Print devices have their own input and output channels; jobs can be directed to input channels such as parallel or serial cables or network adapters. Output can be produced on different media, including paper, film, or fabric. </P>
<P CLASS="t">Print devices have their own internal processors which can be proprietary or general-purpose (such as the Motorola 680<I>xx</I>-series chips in Apple LaserWriter devices). Incoming data is stored in the print-device RAM, which can range from a few bytes to a hundred megabytes. Each print device has software stored in ROM, called "firmware," which interprets the programming language of a print job's source code. Examples of programming languages are PostScript, PCL, and HP-GL/2.</P></BODY></HTML>
