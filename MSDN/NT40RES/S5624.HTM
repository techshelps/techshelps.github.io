<H3>Auditing Backup and Restore Activities</H3><P CLASS="t">When files are being backed up, Windows&nbsp;NT checks to ensure that the user performing the backup has the Back Up Files and Directories special right each time the backup program attempts to copy a file to the backup media. In the same way, Windows&nbsp;NT checks for the Restore Files and Directories right for each file that is being restored from backup media. Obviously, if Windows&nbsp;NT were to record an audit event each time those rights were invoked, thousands of events would be recorded during a routine backup. Because this would flood the security log with event records that most often would be of little value for maintaining system security, Windows&nbsp;NT does not normally record audit events for the use of these rights, even when success auditing of Use of User Rights is enabled in the system user rights policy.</P>
