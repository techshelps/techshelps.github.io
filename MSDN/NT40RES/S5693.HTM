<H3>Test the Preferred Configuration</H3><P CLASS="t">After you've set up your test computers with Windows&nbsp;NT Workstation 4.0, you'll need to run a variety of tests to make sure that the operating system runs correctly on your network and that you can still perform all of your usual tasks. The planning and installation teams should both be involved in this step.</P>
<P CLASS="t">Use your own testing methodology or test the following to verify correct system operation:</P>
<UL><LI>Can you connect to and browse the network?</LI></UL><UL><LI>Can you print both locally and across the network?</LI></UL><UL><LI>Can you perform the core operations of each line of business application locally and on the network (including opening, closing, and printing)? Test all mission-critical applications for proper function.</LI></UL><UL><LI>Can you shut down successfully?</LI></UL><P CLASS="t">If you have several test computers, compare your old client configuration from your previous operating system and your new preferred configuration running Windows&nbsp;NT Workstation 4.0. Compare the two in terms of the following:</P>
<UL><LI>Functionality for administering the computer</LI></UL><UL><LI>Performance for local disk/network/application actions</LI></UL><UL><LI>Ease of use for performing common tasks</LI></UL><UL><LI>Stability of the computer under stress</LI></UL><UL><LI>Compatibility with applications and hardware</LI></UL><P></P>
<P CLASS="t">If the specified client configuration did not work as expected, modify and document the differences until a working preferred client configuration is installed. Try removing related features from the proposed configuration as a solution. Document any changes made to the original configuration. </P>
<P CLASS="t">If the preferred client configuration works as expected, you may also want to conduct additional testing of the optional software features and components in Windows&nbsp;NT Workstation 4.0. This can help you determine whether you are running Windows&nbsp;NT Workstation 4.0 optimally. For this kind of testing, conduct side-by-side evaluations on two computers, changing individual features on each one, to determine the following:</P>
<UL><LI>Performance in terms of responsiveness and throughput</LI></UL><UL><LI>Ease of use </LI></UL><UL><LI>Stability</LI></UL><UL><LI>Compatibility</LI></UL><UL><LI>Functionality</LI></UL><P></P>
<P CLASS="t">Ensure that you have identified a configuration that meets the needs of all the different hardware configurations used in your organization. Note which options you want to predefine as entries for an answer file. The answer file can then be used to automate the installation process.</P></BODY></HTML>
