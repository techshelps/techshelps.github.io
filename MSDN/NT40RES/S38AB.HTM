<H2>Environment Subsystems</H2><P CLASS="t">Windows&nbsp;NT is designed to allow different types of applications to run seamlessly on the same graphical desktop. It runs applications written for existing operating systems and APIs such as MS-DOS, OS/2 1<I>.x</I>, and Windows 3.<I>x,</I> POSIX and Win32.</P>
<P CLASS="t">Windows&nbsp;NT supports a variety of applications through the use of <I>environment subsystems</I>, which are Windows&nbsp;NT processes that emulate different operating system environments.</P>
<P CLASS="t">This chapter has described how the Windows&nbsp;NT Executive provides generic services that all environment subsystems can call to perform basic operating system functions. The subsystems build on the Executive's services to produce environments that meet the specific needs of their client applications.</P>
<P></P>
<P></P>
<P CLASS="t">Each subsystem runs as a separate user-mode process, with each subsystem protected from errors in the others: Failure in one won't cause another subsystem or the Executive to be disabled. Applications are also user-mode processes, so they can't hinder the subsystems or Executive.</P>
<P CLASS="t">Windows&nbsp;NT provides the following protected environments subsystems and Virtual DOS Machines (VDMs):</P>
<UL><LI>MS-DOS NTVDM</LI></UL><UL><LI>Win16 NTVDMs</LI></UL><UL><LI>OS/2 subsystem</LI></UL><UL><LI>POSIX subsystem</LI></UL><UL><LI>Win32 subsystem</LI></UL><P></P>
<P CLASS="t">Each environment is optional and is loaded only when its services are needed by a client application. </P></BODY></HTML>
