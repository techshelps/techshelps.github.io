<H3>Survey Users for Feedback</H3><P CLASS="t">The final part of the pilot rollout involves surveying the users to gauge their satisfaction with the new installation, and to evaluate the level of training and support provided. </P>
<P CLASS="t">Survey members of the pilot user group about their satisfaction with the installation process and ask for their suggestions on what could have been done better. Test the users' proficiency by having them perform a few common tasks or ask them to use several of the new features in Windows&nbsp;NT Workstation 4.0 — for example, have them register their survey results on the server.</P>
<P CLASS="t">When collected, combine the survey results with the ideas for improvements identified by the planning and installation teams during the pilot rollout. Use this information to prepare a checklist of open issues that must be resolved prior to the final rollout. Then assign to individual team members the actions for solving problems or making improvements. Indicate on the checklist how and when each item was resolved, adjusting the deployment plan if appropriate.</P>
<P CLASS="t">If the pilot program did not run smoothly or if user feedback was poor, conduct additional pilot installations until the process works well.</P></BODY></HTML>
