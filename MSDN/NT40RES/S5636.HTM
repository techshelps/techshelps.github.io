<H3>Selecting a Configuration </H3><P CLASS="t">When you have selected the version of Windows&nbsp;NT to start, and the boot loader has collected hardware information, you see the following screen:</P>
<P CLASS="spacing"><BR></P>
<PRE>OS Loader V4.0

Press spacebar now to invoke Hardware Profile/Last Known Good menu.
</PRE>
<P CLASS="t">The boot loader waits a few seconds for you to press the spacebar. If you do not press the spacebar, and you have only one hardware profile, the boot loader loads Windows&nbsp;NT by using the Default control set. Otherwise, you see this screen:</P>
<P CLASS="spacing"><BR></P>
<PRE>    Hardware Profile/Configuration Recovery Menu

This menu allows you to select a hardware profile
to be used when Windows&nbsp;NT is started.

If your system is not starting correctly, then you may switch to a<BR>previous system configuration, which may overcome startup problems.
IMPORTANT: System configuration changes made since the last successful<BR>startup will be discarded.

    Original Configuration
    some other hardware profile

Use the up and down arrow keys to move the highlight
to the selection you want. Then press ENTER.
To switch to the Last Known Good Configuration, press 'L'.
To Exit this menu and restart your computer. press F3.

Seconds until highlighted choice will be started automatically: 5
</PRE>
<P CLASS="t">The first hardware profile is highlighted. If you have created other hardware profiles, use the down arrow to select the one that you want to use. For more information about hardware profiles, use the <B>Find</B> tab in Windows&nbsp;NT Help and enter <B>profile</B>.</P>
<P CLASS="t">You can also select between the Last Known Good Configuration and the Default Configuration. Windows&nbsp;NT automatically uses the Default Configuration if you do not select the Last Known Good Configuration. When you use the Default Configuration, the boot loader uses the Registry information that Windows&nbsp;NT saved at the last shutdown.</P>
<P CLASS="t">If you switch to the Last Known Good Configuration by pressing L and ENTER, the boot loader uses the Registry information that it saved at the completion of the last successful startup to configure this startup.</P>
<P CLASS="t">See the sections "Loading the Kernel" and "Control Sets in the Registry," presented later in this chapter, for more information. </P></BODY></HTML>
