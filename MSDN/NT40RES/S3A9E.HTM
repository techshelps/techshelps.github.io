<H2>Security for Internet Clients</H2><P CLASS="t">It is important to remember that the Internet, like other networks, provides two-way communication. When you are connected to the Internet, other computers can see your computer. By default, Windows&nbsp;NT Workstation security protects your computer from casual intrusion. However, while it is very unlikely that your computer will be attacked while you are browsing the Internet, it is still a good idea to configure your computer securely. Before you install and configure TCP/IP and Dial-Up Networking, you should review the security configuration of your computer.</P>
