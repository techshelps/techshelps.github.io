<H3>I/O Privilege Mechanism</H3><P CLASS="t">Under native OS/2, if the statement IOPL=YES is present in the Config.sys file, applications may include Ring 2 segments in which it is possible to execute CLI/STI instruction (disable-enable hardware interrupts), but not IN/OUT.</P>
<P CLASS="t">The OS/2 subsystem of Windows&nbsp;NT allows OS/2 applications to run Ring 2 code segments (no special statement required in the OS/2 C:\Config.sys) but with the following important restrictions:</P>
<UL><LI>CLI/STI instructions will work.</LI></UL><P>The OS/2 subsystem will suspend all the other OS/2 applications in the system and all the other threads in the OS/2 process issuing the CLI instructions, until an STI instruction follows. This emulation of CLI/STI instruction is much more costly in run-time overhead than on native OS/2 (where the CPU simply disables external interrupts, which would violate the Windows&nbsp;NT robustness design rules) and also much more costly than semaphore calls. Therefore, when it is possible to modify the OS/2 application, semaphore calls are the preferred way to implement critical sections.</P>
<UL><LI>IN/OUT instructions are <I>not</I> supported.</LI></UL><P>Such instructions will cause a general-protection fault and the application will be terminated.</P>
