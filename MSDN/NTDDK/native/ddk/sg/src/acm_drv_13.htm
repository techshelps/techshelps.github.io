<P>
Local ACM drivers are available only to a specific application. The
application must explicitly add the driver to the ACM’s list of available
drivers with a call to <B>acmDriverAdd</B>, which is exported by the ACM and
described in the Win32 SDK. If you are writing a local ACM driver, you can
locate your driver code in your application or in a separate DLL file.
<H4>Including ACM Driver Code in an Application</H4>
<P>
If you include ACM driver code within an application, the application must
define a <B><A HREF="intro_44.htm">DriverProc</A></B>&nbsp;function that recognizes <A HREF="acm_drv_8.htm">ACM
driver messages</A>. To access the ACM driver code, your application must:
<UL>
<LI>
Call <B>acmDriverAdd</B>, specifying it’s own module handle as an input
parameter.
<P>
<LI>
Communicate with the driver code by calling the ACM’s API functions.
<P>
<LI>
Call <B>acmDriverRemove</B>&nbsp;when it has finished using the ACM driver code.
</UL>
<H4>Providing a Local ACM Driver as a Separate DLL</H4>
<P>
If you provide a local ACM driver as a separate DLL, your application must
call <B>LoadLibrary</B>&nbsp;(see the Win32 SDK) to load the driver. The driver
must define a <B><A HREF="intro_44.htm">DriverProc</A></B>&nbsp;function that
recognizes <A HREF="acm_drv_8.htm">ACM driver messages</A>. After the
driver has been loaded, it must:
<UL>
<LI>
Call <B>acmDriverAdd</B>, specifying it’s own module handle as an input
parameter.
<P>
<LI>
Respond to ACM driver messages received when the application calls the ACM’s
API functions.
<P>
<LI>
Call <B>acmDriverRemove</B>&nbsp;when the application signals that it has finished
using the driver.
</UL>
