<P>
The following sections describe how to write a virtual device driver. The VDD
is a 32-bit DLL that runs in user mode in Windows NT. Its purpose is to
translate requests from MS-DOS programs into calls to a 32-bit kernel-mode
device driver. The VDD serves as a bridge between the 16-bit MS-DOS
application and the 32-bit kernel-mode driver. The VDD can be called directly
from a modified MS-DOS application, as explained in <A HREF="vdd_2.htm">Application-Based
Intercepts</A>&nbsp;or it can rely on the VDM to intercept device access requests from
the application and route them to callback functions the VDD has installed.
