<P>
MS-DOS applications are written to use the <I>x</I>86 segmented memory
architecture. They use pointers composed of a 16-bit segment or selector and a
16-bit offset into the segment. Windows NT, on the other hand, uses a flat
memory model, in which pointers are simply 32-bit linear addresses. Because a
VDD can receive a segmented address pointer from an MS-DOS application,
Windows NT provides the function <B>GetVDMPointer</B>&nbsp;to translate MS-DOS
segment:offset or selector:offset style pointers to 32-bit linear address
pointers. The VDD can use the 32-bit pointer to access memory by using Win32
functions, such as <B>VDDAllocMem</B>.
<P>
Do not manually convert segmented addresses (by shifting the segment by four
and adding the offset). On a non-<I>x</I>86 machine, the VDM might not be
based at physical address zero. The <B>GetVDMPointer</B>&nbsp;function converts a
segmented address to a 32-bit address in a platform-independent manner.
<P>
If the VDD is running on a RISC-based Windows NT machine, the <I>x</I>86
emulator precompiles instructions in memory to increase performance. When a
VDD uses a pointer returned by <B>GetVDMPointer</B>&nbsp;to modify memory in a
particular range, it is important to tell the emulator that a change has
occurred so the emulator can recompile the instructions in that range. Calling
<B>FlushVDMPointer</B>&nbsp;or <B>FreeVDMPointer</B>&nbsp;tells the emulator the memory
is no longer subject to modification and the instructions in that range can be
precompiled again. These functions simply return to the caller on an <I>x</I>86
machine.
