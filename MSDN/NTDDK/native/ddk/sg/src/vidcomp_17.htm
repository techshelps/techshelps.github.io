<P>
The ICM_DECOMPRESSEX messages replace the ICM_DECOMPRESS messages and add
extended decompression capabilities. These messages let drivers decompress
images described with source and destination rectangles.
<P>
The ICM_DECOMPRESSEX messages serve the same purpose as the ICM_DECOMPRESS,
ICM_DECOMPRESS_BEGIN, ICM_DECOMPRESS_END, and ICM_DECOMPRESS_QUERY messages,
except that the ICM_DECOMPRESSEX messages use the <A HREF="vidcomp_89.htm">ICDECOMPRESSEX</A>
structure. This structure contains the image input format and data, the output
format and data, the source rectangle, and the destination rectangle. For
compatibility, your driver should support the ICM_DECOMPRESS messages as well
as the ICM_DECOMPRESSEX messages.
<P>
The ICM_DECOMPRESSEX messages also let applications decompress to a frame
buffer under the following conditions:
<UL>
<LI>
The decompressor supports a frame buffer.
<P>
<LI>
MSVideo can access the frame buffer.
<P>
<LI>
The decompressor supports decompression to the format of the frame buffer (for
example, it supports the correct bit depth and it can handle upside-down
formats).
<P>
<LI>
The palette must be an identity palette if the device uses 8-bit color depth.
<P>
<LI>
The decompressor must support 48-bit pointers if the linear frame buffer is
simulated with a banked display card. MSVideo sets the <B>biCompression</B>
member of the BITMAPINFOHEADER structure to 1632 when the decompressor needs
to use 48-bit pointers to access the image.
