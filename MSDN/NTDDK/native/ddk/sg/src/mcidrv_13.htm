<P>
All <A HREF="mcidrv_3.htm">MCI command tables</A>&nbsp;must include the
MCI_NOTIFY flag for all commands. Applications use this flag to request
notification when an operation has completed.
<P>
Normally when an MCI driver receives a command, it should initiate the
associated operation and then return control to the calling application. For
example, if an application sends an MCI_SEEK command, the driver should start
the seek operation and immediately return. The application is not notified
when the operation completes.
<P>
As an option, an application sending any MCI command can request to be
notified when the command operation has completed. To do this, the application
specifies the following arguments along with the command:
<UL>
<LI>
The MCI_NOTIFY flag. The driver receives this flag in the <I>lParam1</I>
argument to <B><A HREF="intro_44.htm">DriverProc</A></B>.
<P>
<LI>
A window handle. The driver receives this handle as the <B>dwCallback</B>
member of any structure whose address is passed as the <I>lParam2</I>&nbsp;argument
to <B><A HREF="intro_44.htm">DriverProc</A></B>.
</UL>
<P>
When a driver receives an MCI command that includes the MCI_NOTIFY flag, the
driver must start the specified operation and then return. When the operation
completes, the driver must call <B><A HREF="mcidrv_47.htm">mciDriverNotify</A></B>
in <I>winmm.dll</I>. The <B>mciDriverNotify</B>&nbsp;function enqueues an
MM_MCINOTIFY message to the window specified in <B>dwCallback</B>. The
application’s window procedure must check for and process the MM_MCINOTIFY
message.
