<P>
Client applications can specify MCI commands as either strings or messages,
but an MCI driver’s <B>DriverProc</B>&nbsp;function only accepts messages.
Therefore, it is necessary to provide command tables, which the MCI command
parser uses to translate command strings into messages. Furthermore, most
commands can accept modifiers, so the MCI parser translates string modifiers
into message arguments that MCI drivers can read.
<P>
There are three types of command tables:
<UL>
<LI>
<I>Core command table</I>
<P>
There is one core command table. It contains the commands that all MCI drivers
must support. These include the <I>required </I>and <I>basic</I>&nbsp;<A HREF="mcidrv_4.htm">MCI
command types</A>. The core command table is included in <I>winmm.dll</I>.
<P>
<LI>
<I>Device-type command tables</I>
<P>
There are command tables for several <A HREF="mcidrv_5.htm">MCI device
types</A>. Each of these tables contains commands that are common to a particular
multimedia device type, such as “videodisc” or “waveaudio”. Several
device-type tables are included in <I>winmm.dll</I>. Others can be included as
separate files, with a filename extension of <I>.mci</I>.
<P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol">&#183;</FONT><I>&nbsp; &nbsp; Device-specific command tables</I>
<P>
There can be any number of device-specific command tables. If a particular
device requires its own set of commands, a unique command table must be
provided. These tables can exist as separate files, with a filename extension
of <I>.mci</I>. They can also be defined within a particular driver’s resource
file and linked to the driver.
</UL>
<P>
Command tables are compiled by the Microsoft Windows Resource Compiler, which
is described in the Win32 SDK.
<P>
Device-type command tables take precedence over the core command table.
Likewise, device-specific command tables take precedence over device-type
command tables. And finally, device-specific tables that reside in separate
files take precedence over those that are linked to drivers. This scheme
allows the core commands and device-type commands to be modified. In fact, it
is common for a device-type or a device-specific table to redefine a core
command in order to provide an expanded set of command modifiers.
<P>

structures, see <A HREF="mcidrv_33.htm">Creating
Customized MCI Commands</A>.
