<P>
The ICM_DRAW message is sent to a rendering driver to decompress a frame of
data and draw it to the screen.
<H5>Parameters</H5>
<DL>
<DT>
<I>dwParam1</I>
<DD>
Specifies a pointer to an <A HREF="vidcomp_90.htm">ICDRAW</A>&nbsp;structure.
<BR>
<DT>
<I>dwParam2</I>
<DD>
Specifies the size of the ICDRAW structure.
</DL>
<H5>Return Value</H5>
<P>
Returns ICERR_OK if successful. Otherwise, returns an error number.
<H5>Comments</H5>
<P>
If the ICDRAW_UPDATE flag is set in the <B>dwFlags</B>&nbsp;member of the ICDRAW
data structure, the area of the screen used for drawing is invalid and needs
to be updated. This depends on the contents of <B>dwFlags</B>.
<P>
If the ICDRAW_UPDATE flag is set and <B>dwFlags</B>&nbsp;is NULL, the driver should
update the entire destination rectangle with the current image. If the driver
does not keep an offscreen image, it can fail this message.
<P>
If the ICDRAW_UPDATE flag is set and <B>dwFlags</B>&nbsp;is nonNULL, the driver
should draw the data and make sure the entire destination is updated. If the
driver does not keep an offscreen image, it can fail this message.
<P>
If the ICDRAW_HURRYUP flag is set in the <B>dwFlags</B>&nbsp;member, the calling
application is requesting the driver to proceed as quickly as possible,
possibly not even updating the screen.
<P>
If the ICDRAW_PREROLL flag is set in the <B>dwFlags</B>&nbsp;member, this video
frame is merely preliminary information and should not be displayed, if
possible. For instance, if play is to start from frame 10, and frame 0 is the
nearest previous key frame, frames 0 through 9 will have the ICDRAW_PREROLL
flag set.
<P>
If the driver is to decompress data into a buffer instead of drawing directly
to the screen, ICM_DECOMPRESS is sent instead.
