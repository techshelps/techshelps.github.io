<P>
Kernel-mode multimedia drivers executing under Windows NT have the following
characteristics:
<UL>
<LI>
They execute in kernel mode.
<P>
<LI>
They export <A HREF="intro_14.htm">kernel-mode driver
entry points</A>&nbsp;that are called by the Windows NT Executive for performing I/O
operations requested by <A HREF="intro_2.htm">user-mode
multimedia drivers</A>.
<P>
<LI>
They are implemented as services under the control of the Windows NT Service
Control Manager.
<P>
<LI>
They communicate with device hardware by calling functions in the Windows NT
Executive. The I/O Manager and the Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL), both of
which are parts of the Windows NT Executive, provide driver compatibility
across the various hardware platforms supported by Windows NT.
<P>
Kernel-mode drivers often do not call Windows NT Executive functions directly.
Instead, they might call functions in support libraries, which in turn call
the Executive functions. The support libraries are described in the chapters
discussing the various driver types. The chapters are listed in <A HREF="intro_1.htm">Types
of Multimedia Devices</A>.
