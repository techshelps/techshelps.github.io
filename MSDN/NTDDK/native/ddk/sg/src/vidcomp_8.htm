<P>
For the video compression and decompression interface, quality is indicated by
an integer in the range of 0 to 10,000. A quality level of 7500 typically
indicates an acceptable image quality. A quality level of 0 typically
indicates a very low quality level (possibly even a totally black image). As
the quality level moves from an acceptable level to low quality, the image
might have a loss of color as the colors in the color table are merged, or as
the color resolution of each pixel decreases. If your driver supports temporal
compression (it needs information from the previous frame to decompress the
current frame), low and high quality might imply how much this type of
compression can degrade image quality. For example, your driver might limit
the compression of a high-quality image to preserve sharp detail and color
fidelity. Conversely, your driver might sacrifice these qualities to obtain
very compressed output files.
<P>
If your driver supports quality values, it maps the values to its internal
definitions used by the compression algorithms. Thus, the definition of image
quality will vary from driver to driver, and, quite possibly, from compression
algorithm to compression algorithm. Even though the values are not definitive,
your driver should support as many individual values as possible.
<P>
The client application obtains the capabilities for compression quality with
the <A HREF="vidcomp_76.htm">ICM_GETDEFAULTQUALITY</A>&nbsp;and <A HREF="vidcomp_78.htm">ICM_GETQUALITY</A>
messages. If your driver supports quality levels, it should respond to the
ICM_GETDEFAULTQUALITY message by returning a value between 0 and 10000 that
corresponds to a good default quality level for your compressor. Your driver
should return the current quality level for the ICM_GETQUALITY message.
<P>
The client application sends the <A HREF="vidcomp_81.htm">ICM_SETQUALITY</A>
message to set the quality level of your driver. Your driver should pass the
quality value directly to the compression routine.
<P>
If your driver supports quality levels, it should set the VIDCF_QUALITY flag
when it responds to the ICM_GETINFO message.
