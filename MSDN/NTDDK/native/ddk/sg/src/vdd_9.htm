In the MS-DOS environment, applications often find it advantageous to write
directly to the memory on a particular board. In Windows NT, applications
cannot write directly to physical addresses. Thus, while an application may
use the virtual address 0xE8000, the actual physical address of the memory
will not necessarily be the same. In fact, the memory space in the range
allowed for boards is initially marked as invalid by the Windows NT memory
manager. Any attempt to access memory in this range by unmodified MS-DOS
applications results in a page fault. A VDD can control access to the memory
range used by its device by using the functions described in the following
sections.
