<P>
Installable compressors are not necessarily limited to video data. By using a
different value than ‘vidc’ in the <B>fccType</B>&nbsp;member, you can specify that
your installable driver expects to handle a type of data that is not video.
Four-character codes for nonvideo data should also be registered. 
<P>
While VidEdit does not support data that is not audio or video, MCIAVI does
provide limited support for other data types, using installable renderers. If
you create a stream with a four-character code type that does not represent
audio or video, its type and handler information are used to search for a
driver capable of handling the data. The search follows the same procedure
used for installable compressor drivers.
<P>
Writing a driver to render nonvideo data is very similar to rendering video,
with the following differences:
<UL>
<LI>
The format used is not a BITMAPINFO structure. The format is defined by the
class of decompressor.
<P>
<LI>
The ICM_DECOMPRESS messages are not used. All data is rendered using the
ICM_DRAW messages because there is no defined decompressed form for arbitrary
data.
