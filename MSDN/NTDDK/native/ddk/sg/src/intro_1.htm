<P>
Each piece of multimedia hardware can be classified as being either an audio
device, a video capture device, or a positioning device. Each of these
classifications can be broken down further, as follows:
<UL>
<LI>
Audio devices include waveform devices, MIDI devices, mixers, and auxiliary
audio devices.
<P>
For information about writing drivers for audio devices, see <A HREF="audiodrv.htm">Audio
Device Drivers</A>.
<P>
For information about writing drivers for compressing audio data, see <A HREF="acm_drv.htm">Audio
Compression Manager Drivers</A>.
<P>
<LI>
Video capture devices capture video images that can be stored in a disk file
and played back later.
<P>
For information about writing drivers for video capture devices, see <A HREF="vcap.htm">Video
Capture Device Drivers</A>.
<P>
For information about writing drivers for compressing video data, see <A HREF="vidcomp.htm">Video
Compression Manager Drivers</A>.
<P>
<LI>
Positioning devices, such as joysticks, light pens, and touch screens, are
devices that can establish a screen position.
<P>
For information about writing drivers for positioning devices, see <A HREF="joydrv.htm">Joystick
Drivers</A>.
</UL>
<P>
For information about writing drivers for the Media Control Interface (MCI),
which is a high-level application interface to all types of multimedia
devices, see <A HREF="mcidrv.htm">MCI Drivers</A>.
