<P>
Application developers sometimes need to transfer single frames of video
information. For instance, a developer might want to record animated sequences
that are generated one frame at a time, or to display a single image, such as
a photograph.
<P>
Clients can transfer single frames of video information by sending the <A HREF="vcap_46.htm">DVM_FRAME</A>
message, along with the address of a <A HREF="vcap_76.htm">VIDEOHDR</A>
structure. Clients specify the VIDEO_IN channel to obtain a frame from the
device’s frame buffer, or the VIDEO_OUT channel to send a frame to the frame
buffer.
<P>
If the channel is VIDEO_IN, the client includes the address of an empty data
buffer. By calling the kernel-mode driver, the user-mode driver transfers the
contents of the device’s frame buffer into the data buffer. If the channel is
VIDEO_OUT, the client includes the address of a filled data buffer. The
user-mode driver sends the data buffer’s contents to the kernel-mode driver,
which in turn transfers the contents to the device’s frame buffer. The sample
video capture drivers support single frame transfers only on the VIDEO_IN
channel.
<P>
When handling single-frame transfers, drivers must take into account current
settings for video format, source or destination rectangles, and color
palettes.
