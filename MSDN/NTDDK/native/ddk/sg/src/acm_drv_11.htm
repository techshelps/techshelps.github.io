<P>
If you are writing an ACM driver that is meant to be available to all
applications, the driver must be installed so that the ACM can find it.
<P>
On the other hand, if you are writing an ACM driver that is meant to be
locally available to a specific application, the driver is not installed.
Instead, either the application or the driver calls <B>acmDriverAdd</B>,
described in the Win32 SDK, to make the driver locally accessible. (For more
information about local ACM drivers, see <A HREF="acm_drv_13.htm">Designing
Local ACM Drivers</A>.)
<P>
ACM drivers that are meant to be available to all applications are installed
by using the Multimedia applet in the Control Panel. You must provide an <I>oemsetup.inf
</I>file for your driver. Following is a sample <I>oemsetup.inf</I>&nbsp;file:
<PRE><FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE="2">[Source Media Descriptions]
&nbsp; &nbsp; 1  = &quot;MSGSM610&quot;  , TAGFILE = disk1

[Installable.Drivers]
msgsm610 = 1:msgsm32.acm, &quot;msacm.msgsm610&quot;, &quot;Microsoft GSM 6.10 Audio CODEC&quot; ,,,
</FONT></PRE>
<P>
For a description of <I>oemsetup.inf</I>&nbsp;file contents, see <A HREF="intro_18.htm">Installing
Multimedia Drivers</A>. The sample file causes the Multimedia applet to create the
following registry entry:
<PRE><FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE="2">msacm.msgsm610 : REG_SZ : msgsm32.acm
</FONT></PRE>
<P>
This entry is placed in the registry path <B>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE \SOFTWARE
\Microsoft \Windows NT \CurrentVersion \Drivers32</B>
<P>
The ACM searches this registry path to determine which ACM drivers are
installed. For each installed ACM driver, there must be a registry value name
of the form <B>msacm.</B><I>alias</I>, where <I>alias</I>&nbsp;is a unique name.
This name is generally known as the <I>driver type</I>. For ACM drivers, only
one driver file can be associated with each driver type.
<P>
Notice that the ACM driver’s file extension is <I>.acm</I>. While not
required, this extension is favored over <I>.dll</I>&nbsp;for ACM drivers.
