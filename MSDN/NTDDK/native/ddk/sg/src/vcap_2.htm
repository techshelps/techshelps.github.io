<P>
Video capture device drivers can capture video input images that device
hardware has stored in a frame buffer. They can pass these images to client
applications as device-independent bitmaps (DIBs). If the hardware allows,
they can display captured images as an overlay on an output display device.
<P>
APIs provided by the Microsoft Video for Windows Development Kit and the AVI
capture (AVIcap) window class allow applications to capture either single
video images or streams of images, and to view images on an overlay display as
they are captured. The AVIcap window class is described in the Win32 SDK.
<P>
The Video Compression Manager allows applications to play back previously
recorded bitmap images. For more information about the Video Compression
Manager and its drivers, see <A HREF="vidcomp.htm">Video
Compression Manager Drivers</A>.
