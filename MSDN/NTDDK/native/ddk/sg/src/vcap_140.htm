<P>
The <B>CaptureService</B>&nbsp;function is a kernel-mode video capture driver’s
deferred procedure call (DPC) function, used for copying captured video data
from the frame buffer to client-supplied buffers. The function is
driver-defined, and the <B>CaptureService</B>&nbsp;name is a placeholder for a
driver-specified function name.
<H5>Parameters</H5>
<DL>
<DT>
<I>pDevInfo</I>
<DD>
Pointer to the DEVICE_INFO structure returned by <B><A HREF="vcap_128.htm">VC_Init</A></B>.
<BR>
<DT>
<I>pBuffer</I>
<DD>
Pointer to a page-locked buffer. Can be NULL (see the following <B>Comments</B>
section).
<BR>
<DT>
<I>pTimeStamp</I>
<DD>
Address of a ULONG location to return the time, in milliseconds, at which the
frame was captured
<BR>
<DT>
<I>BufferLength</I>
<DD>
Size, in bytes, of the buffer specified by <I>pBuffer</I>.
</DL>
<H5>Return Value</H5>
<P>
If the driver has finished using the buffer pointed to by <I>pBuffer</I>, it
should return the number of bytes written to the buffer. If the driver returns
zero and <I>pBuffer</I>&nbsp;is not NULL, <I>VCKernel.lib</I>&nbsp;will return the same
buffer the next time it calls <B>CaptureService</B>.
<H5>Comments</H5>
<P>
The <I>VCKernel.lib</I>&nbsp;library provides a generic DPC function that is called
each time the driver’s <B><A HREF="vcap_150.htm">InterruptAcknowledge</A></B>
function returns TRUE. This generic DPC function calls the driver’s <B>CaptureService</B>
function, which is responsible for copying the current frame buffer contents
into a client buffer. The function executes at an IRQL of DISPATCH_LEVEL.
<P>
The <B>CaptureService</B>&nbsp;function receives, in <I>pBuffer</I>, a pointer to
the next available buffer, which has been page-locked. (This buffer usually is
client-supplied, but if the system has limited memory resources, the buffer
might be one that <I>VCKernel.lib </I>allocated from system space. This
situation is irrelevant to the driver.)
<P>
If <I>pBuffer</I>&nbsp;is NULL, no buffers are available. In this case, the driver
should drop the frame contents (typically by just returning zero), and <I>VCKernel.lib</I>
will increment its count of dropped frames.
<P>
If <I>pBuffer</I>&nbsp;is not NULL, and if the driver does not completely fill the
specified buffer with a single frame, it can return zero to indicate that <I>VCKernel.lib</I>
should specify the same buffer the next time it calls <B>CaptureService</B>.
<P>
The driver returns a time stamp that is relative to the beginning of the
stream and is reset by the driver’s <B><A HREF="vcap_159.htm">StreamStartFunc</A></B>
function. The time stamp should be recorded by the driver’s <B><A HREF="vcap_150.htm">InterruptAcknowledge</A></B>
function <FONT FACE="Symbol">&#190;</FONT> not its <B>CaptureService</B>
function <FONT FACE="Symbol">&#190;</FONT> because there can be a time delay
before the latter function is called.
<P>
If other code within the kernel-mode driver references the same objects that
the <B>CaptureService</B>&nbsp;function references, the driver must use <B><A HREF="vcap_133.htm">VC_SynchronizeDPC</A></B>
to synchronize access to the objects.
<P>
Support for a <B>CaptureService</B>&nbsp;function is required. The driver must
place the address of its <B>CaptureService</B>&nbsp;function in the <A HREF="vcap_137.htm">VC_CALLBACK</A>
structure supplied by <I>VCKernel.lib</I>.
<P>

Mode Drivers Design Guide</I>.
