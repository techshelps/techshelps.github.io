<P>
The Windows NT DDK includes the following three sample ACM drivers:
<DL>
<DT>
<A NAME="DDK_IMA_ADPCM_Audio_Codec"></A><B>IMA ADPCM Audio Codec</B>
<DD>
The IMA ADPCM Audio Codec, <I>imaadp32.dll</I>, converts between PCM and the
IMA ADPCM format. This codec is optimized for speed, and illustrates how to
design conversion routines to reduce computation time. It also provides a
configuration dialog box. The first time the codec is opened, it tries to
automatically configure itself by calculating its maximum sample rate.
<P>
Source files for <I>imaadp32.dll</I>&nbsp;are located in <I>\ddk\src\mmedia\imaadpcm</I>.
<BR>
<DT>
<A NAME="DDK_Microsoft_GSM_6.10_Audio_Codec"></A><B>Microsoft GSM 6.10 Audio Codec</B>
<DD>
The Microsoft GSM 6.10 Audio Codec, <I>msgsm32.dll</I>, implements the GSM
6.10 voice encoding standard, originally developed for digital cellular
telephone encoding. The codec converts between GSM 6.10 and PCM formats. Like <I>imaadp32.dll</I>,
this codec provides a configuration dialog box, and also attempts to
automatically configure itself the first time it is opened.
<P>
Source files for <I>msgsm32.dll</I>&nbsp;are located in <I>\ddk\src\mmedia\gsm610</I>.
<BR>
<DT>
<A NAME="DDK_Microsoft_Audio_Filter"></A><B>Microsoft Audio Filter</B>
<DD>
The Microsoft Audio Filter, <I>msfltr32.dll</I>, is a single driver that
provides both a volume filter and an echo filter. This driver supports a
custom About box and a custom icon, which are explained in <A HREF="acm_drv_15.htm">Providing
a Custom About Box</A>&nbsp;and <A HREF="acm_drv_16.htm">Providing a
Custom Icon</A>.
<P>
Source files for <I>msfltr32.dll</I>&nbsp;are located in <I>\ddk\src\mmedia\msfilter</I>.
</DL>
<P>
You should be able to easily create a new ACM driver by using these samples as
models. The source code contains extensive comments that explain how the code
works and how it should be modified to implement a new driver. You’ll see
that, in general, all ACM drivers are very similar to each other, both in
their functionality and in their code layout.
