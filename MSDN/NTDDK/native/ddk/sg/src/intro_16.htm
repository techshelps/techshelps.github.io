<P>
To build user-mode drivers, refer to the description of the BUILD utility in
the <I>Programmer’s Guide</I>. You must provide a file named <I>makefile</I>
and a file named <I>sources</I>, and place them in the directory path
containing your source files. Refer to the <I>makefile</I>&nbsp;and <I>sources</I>
files provided with the source code for the sample drivers in this DDK.
<P>
All user-mode multimedia drivers must be linked with <I><A HREF="intro_4.htm#DDK_winmm.dll">winmm.dll</A></I>.
Additional libraries are provided for the various device and driver types and
are referred to in the chapters describing each driver type. The chapters are
listed in <A HREF="intro_1.htm">Types of Multimedia
Devices</A>.
<P>
All user-mode multimedia drivers must include the <I>mmystem.h</I>&nbsp;header
file. Additional header files are provided for the various device and driver
types and are referred to in the chapters describing each driver type.
<P>
Because user-mode drivers are dynamic-link libraries, their file extension
should generally be <I>.dll</I>. (This is not a requirement and, for example, <A HREF="acm_drv.htm">Audio
Compression Manager drivers</A>&nbsp;have an extension of <I>.acm</I>.) If you provide
both a 16-bit and a 32-bit version of your driver, append <I>32</I>&nbsp;to the
file name for the 32-bit version.
