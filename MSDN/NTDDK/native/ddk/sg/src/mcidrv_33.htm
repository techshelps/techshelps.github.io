<P>
If MCI’s required and basic command sets do not provide all of the
functionality needed by applications to fully interact with a device, then a
driver developer can create customized MCI commands by doing one or both of
the following:
<UL>
<LI>
Extending the required and basic commands as necessary, by adding additional
input flags, redefining the command data structures, or both.
<P>
<LI>
Extending the command set by defining new commands and data structures.
</UL>
<P>
You should match your MCI command extensions as closely as possible to
existing command extensions. Refer to the Win32 SDK for descriptions of
existing command extensions.
<P>
You define new or modified MCI commands by <A HREF="mcidrv_34.htm">creating
new MCI command tables</A>. Use these tables to define new commands and flags, and
to redefine or extend the required or basic commands.
<P>
<A HREF="mcidrv_41.htm">Creating new MCI command
structures</A>&nbsp;is also sometimes necessary. You must define a new structure if you
are creating a new command, or if you are modifying an existing command in a
way that requires additional structure members.
