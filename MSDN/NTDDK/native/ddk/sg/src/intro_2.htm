<P>
User-mode multimedia drivers executing under Windows NT have the following
characteristics:
<UL>
<LI>
They execute in user mode.
<P>
<LI>
They export <A HREF="intro_8.htm">user-mode driver entry
points</A>&nbsp;that are called by applications and other clients to request I/O
operations.
<P>
<LI>
They communicate with <A HREF="intro_3.htm">kernel-mode
multimedia drivers</A>&nbsp;by calling Win32 functions which, in turn, call functions
in the Windows NT Executive. The Windows NT Executive functions provide the
context switch from user mode to kernel mode.
<P>
Typically, user-mode drivers call <B>CreateFile</B>&nbsp;to open a device instance.
Then they make numerous calls to <B>DeviceIoControl</B>&nbsp;to send I/O control
codes to the kernel-mode driver. Some drivers also call the <B>ReadFileEx</B>
and <B>WriteFileEx</B>&nbsp;functions to transfer data blocks. Calling <B>CloseHandle</B>
closes the device instance. (All of these functions are described in the Win32
SDK.)
<P>
User-mode drivers do not generally call these Win32 functions directly.
Instead, they typically call functions in support libraries, which in turn
call the Win32 functions. The support libraries are described in the chapters
discussing the various driver types. The chapters are listed in <A HREF="intro_1.htm">Types
of Multimedia Devices</A>.
<P>
User-mode drivers do not necessarily communicate with a kernel-mode driver <FONT
FACE="Symbol">&#190;</FONT> some communicate with other user-mode drivers. For
example some <A HREF="mcidrv.htm">MCI drivers</A>&nbsp;call Win32 Audio API
functions to communicate with user-mode <A HREF="audiodrv.htm">audio
device drivers</A>.
</UL>
<P>
Because user-mode Windows NT drivers run under the Windows NT Win32 Subsystem
and call Win32 API functions described in the Win32 SDK, these drivers are
sometimes called <I>Win32-based drivers</I>.
