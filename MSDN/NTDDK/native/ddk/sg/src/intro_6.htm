<P>
For a new piece of multimedia hardware, you must decide if you need both a new
<A HREF="intro_2.htm">user-mode multimedia driver</A>&nbsp;and a
new <A HREF="intro_3.htm">kernel-mode multimedia driver</A>.
If a currently available user-mode driver allows applications to access all of
the functionality provided by the new hardware, then you do not need to write
a new user-mode driver. For example, <A HREF="audiodrv_4.htm">the
standard audio driver, <I>mmdrv.dll</A></I>, might provide all the necessary
interfaces to access all the features of a new sound card. In this case, only
a new kernel-mode driver is necessary. More typically, new hardware requires
development of a new user-mode driver in order to handle the hardware’s unique
configuration requirements. New user-mode drivers can be easily written by
modifying sample drivers provided with this DDK.
<P>
New hardware almost always requires a new kernel-mode driver, because the
kernel-mode driver contains information about a device’s registers and
hardware buffers. Occasionally, a new user-mode driver is written that does
not require support from a new kernel-mode driver. For example, the MCICDA CD
audio driver uses the standard CD-ROM file system, so it does not require a
unique underlying kernel-mode driver.
<P>
If your device can be connected to several different buses, you do not need a
different kernel-mode driver for each bus. The Windows NT Hardware Abstraction
Layer (HAL) insulates the kernel-mode driver from the bus. The <I>Kernel-Mode
Drivers Design Guide</I>&nbsp;provides extensive general information about the
design of kernel-mode drivers. Additionally, specific information about
designing kernel-mode multimedia drivers is provided in the chapters
discussing the multimedia driver types. The chapters are listed in <A HREF="intro_1.htm">Types
of Multimedia Devices</A>.
