<P>
The following types of audio devices can be accessed by applications using API
functions provided by the Windows NT Win32 subsystem:
<UL>
<LI>
<I>Waveform input devices</I>&nbsp;that convert analog audio signals into digital
information.
<P>
<LI>
<I>Waveform output devices</I>&nbsp;that convert digital audio information into
analog audio signals.
<P>
<LI>
<I>MIDI input ports</I>&nbsp;that receive MIDI messages from external MIDI devices,
such as keyboards.
<P>
<LI>
<I>MIDI output ports</I>&nbsp;that send MIDI messages to external MIDI devices,
such as keyboards and drum machines.
<P>
<LI>
<I>Internal MIDI synthesizers</I>, which are internal MIDI output devices that
synthesize music from MIDI messages sent by applications.
<P>
<LI>
<I>Auxiliary audio devices</I>&nbsp;such as CD players, which do not require data
transfers but whose output can be mixed with MIDI and waveform audio, and
whose volume can be controlled by a driver.
<P>
<LI>
<I>Mixer devices </I>that control multiple audio lines.
</UL>
<P>
<I>Combination drivers</I>&nbsp;are audio device drivers that can support several
of these types of audio devices. <A HREF="audiodrv_4.htm">The
standard audio driver, <I>mmdrv.dll</A></I>, is a combination driver.
