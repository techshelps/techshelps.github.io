<P>
The user-mode library <I>drvlib.lib</I>&nbsp;provides the following:
<UL>
<LI>
A standard set of <A HREF="audiodrv_7.htm">user-mode
audio driver entry points</A>&nbsp;for waveform, MIDI, mixer, and auxiliary user-mode
drivers.
<P>
<LI>
A communication path to the device’s kernel-mode driver. This path consists
of:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>
Calling the Windows NT I/O Manager (by means of <B>DeviceIoControl</B>,
described in the Win32 SDK) to send I/O control codes to the kernel-mode
driver.
<P>
<LI>
Calling <B>ReadFileEx</B>&nbsp;and <B>WriteFileEx</B>&nbsp;(described in the Win32 SDK)
to pass data between the user-mode and kernel-mode drivers.
</UL>
<P>
For information on I/O control codes for multimedia drivers, see the <I>Kernel-Mode
Drivers Reference</I>.
<P>
<LI>
A set of functions for creating and managing a kernel-mode driver as a Windows
NT service, and for easily accessing driver keys within the Windows NT
Registry. These functions are useful for installation and configuration
operations, and are listed in <A HREF="audiodrv_20.htm">Installing
and Configuring your Driver, Using <I>drvlib.lib</A></I>.
</UL>
<P>
The entry points, support functions, and communications path to the
kernel-mode driver are identical to those provided by <A HREF="audiodrv_4.htm">the
standard audio driver, <I>mmdrv.dll</A></I>. This library is particularly useful
if your user-mode driver requires only the functionality of <I>mmdrv.dll</I>,
with the addition of customized installation and configuration operations. In
such a case, you would create a module containing a customized <B><A HREF="intro_44.htm">DriverProc</A></B>
function, and then link it with <I>drvlib.lib</I>. To initialize the library,
call <B><A HREF="audiodrv_148.htm">DrvLibInit</A></B>&nbsp;when your driver is loaded.
<P>
If your driver requires customized audio entry point functions, you might
still want to base your functions on the those contained in <I>drvlib.lib</I>.
Sources for <I>drvlib.lib</I>&nbsp;are provided with this DDK, in the directory
path listed in <A HREF="audiodrv_5.htm">Sample Audio Drivers</A>.
