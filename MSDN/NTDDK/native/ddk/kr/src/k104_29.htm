<P>
<B>IoDeleteDevice</B>&nbsp;removes a device object from the system, for example,
when the driver that created it is being unloaded.
<H3>Parameters</H3>
<DL>
<DT>
<I>DeviceObject</I>
<DD>
Points to the driver’s device object to be released.
</DL>
<H3>Comments</H3>
<P>
This routine must be called when a driver that created the device object is
being unloaded or when the DriverEntry routine encounters a fatal
initialization error, such as being unable to properly initialize a physical
device. This routine also is called when a driver reconfigures its devices
dynamically. For example, a disk driver called to repartition a disk would
call <B>IoDeleteDevice</B>&nbsp;to tear down the device objects representing
partitions to be replaced.
<P>
A driver must release certain resources for which the driver supplied storage
in its device extension before it calls <B>IoDeleteDevice</B>. For example, if
the driver stores the pointer to its interrupt object(s) in the device
extension, it must call <B>IoDisconnectInterrupt</B>&nbsp;before <B>IoDeleteDevice</B>.
<P>
When <B>IoDeleteDevice</B>&nbsp;is called, there cannot be any outstanding
references to the device being deleted nor any attached devices. If there are,
a system erorr occurs.
<P>
Callers of <B>IoDeleteDevice</B>&nbsp;must be running at IRQL PASSIVE_LEVEL.
