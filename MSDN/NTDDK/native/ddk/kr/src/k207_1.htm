<H2><A NAME="DDK_CD_ROM_I_O_Requests_KR"></A>7.1  CD-ROM I/O Requests</H2>
<P>
Any driver that sets up device objects of type FILE_DEVICE_CD_ROM is required
to handle three types of requests:
<P>
IRP_MJ_CREATE<BR>
IRP_MJ_READ<BR>
IRP_MJ_DEVICE_CONTROL
<H3>IRP_MJ_CREATE</H3>
<H4>Operation</H4>
<P>
Returns STATUS_SUCCESS, indicating that the device exists. For the caller,
this request opens the device for I/O.
<H4>When Called</H4>
<P>
A higher-level driver is attempting to connect one of its device objects to
the target device object, or a user-mode process has attempted to open a file
stored on the physical device, thereby causing a file system to carry out a
mount operation.
<H4>I/O Status Block</H4>
<P>
Returns STATUS_SUCCESS in the <B>Status</B>&nbsp;field and zero in the <B>Information</B>
field.
<H3>IRP_MJ_READ</H3>
<H4>Operation</H4>
<P>
Transfers data from the underlying device to system memory.
<H4>Output</H4>
<P>
Drivers of CD-ROM devices generally use direct I/O, so the lowest-level driver
transfers data using DMA or PIO into the buffer described by the MDL at <B>Irp-&gt;MdlAddress</B>.
<H4>When Called</H4>
<P>
A Win32™ application with a handle for the opened file object that represents
the CD-ROM device has requested a data transfer.
<H4>I/O Status Block</H4>
<DL>
<DT>
The <B>Information</B>&nbsp;field is set to the number of bytes transferred,
whatever the <B>Status</B>&nbsp;field’s value. In addition to STATUS_SUCCESS,
possible values are any of the following:
<DD>
<PRE><FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE="2">STATUS_INSUFFICIENT_RESOURCES
STATUS_DEVICE_DATA_ERROR
STATUS_INVALID_DEVICE_REQUEST
STATUS_NO_SUCH_DEVICE
STATUS_IO_TIMEOUT
STATUS_IO_DEVICE_ERROR
STATUS_DEVICE_NOT_READY
STATUS_DEVICE_BUSY
STATUS_NO_MEDIA_IN_DEVICE
STATUS_VERIFY_REQUIRED
</FONT></PRE>
</DL>
<H3>IRP_MJ_DEVICE_CONTROL</H3>
<H4>Operation</H4>
<P>
Determined by the I/O control code set at <B>Parameters.DeviceIoControl.IoControlCode</B>
in the driver’s I/O stack location of the IRP.
<H4>When Called</H4>
<P>
A Win32 application with a handle for the opened file object that represents
the CD-ROM device has called <B>DeviceIoControl</B>&nbsp;or a higher-level driver
has set up the request.
<H4>I/O Status Block</H4>
<P>
Also determined by the operation, either STATUS_SUCCESS or an appropriate
STATUS_<I>XXX</I>&nbsp;value. For most operations, the set of possible STATUS_<I>XXX</I>
values includes those propagated from a call to a support routine or
lower-level driver and/or those chosen by the driver designer. In general, the
<B>Information</B>&nbsp;field of the I/O status block is set to the number of bytes
returned or transferred when the device driver completes the IRP.
