<P>
A controller object represents a hardware adapter or controller with
homogenous devices that are the actual targets for I/O requests. A controller
object can be used to synchronize a device driver’s I/O to the target devices
through its hardware adapter/controller. 
<P>
A controller object is partially opaque. Driver writers must know about a
certain field associated with the controller object because their drivers
access this field through the controller object pointer returned by <B>IoCreateController</B>.
The following field in a controller object is accessible to the creating
driver. 
<H3>Accessible Fields</H3>
<DL>
<DT>
<B>PVOID ControllerExtension</B>
<DD>
Points to the controller extension. The structure and contents of the
controller extension are driver-defined. The size is driver-determined,
specified in the driver’s call to <B>IoCreateController</B>. Usually, drivers
maintain common state about I/O operations in the controller extension and
device-specific state about I/O for a target device in the corresponding
device extension. 
</DL>
<H3>Comments</H3>
<P>
Most driver routines that process IRPs are given a pointer to the target
device object. Consequently, device drivers that use controller objects
frequently store the controller object pointer returned by <B>IoCreateController</B>
in each device extension. 
<P>
Note that a controller object has no name so it cannot be the target of an I/O
request, and higher-level drivers cannot connnect or attach their device
objects to a device driver’s controller object. 
<P>
Undocumented fields within a controller object should be considered
inaccessible. Drivers with dependencies on object field locations or access to
undocumented fields might not remain portable and interoperable with other
drivers over time.
