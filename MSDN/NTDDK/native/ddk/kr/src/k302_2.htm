<P>
A miniport driver’s HwScsiAdapterState routine saves or restores the HBA state
according to the value of the <I>SaveState</I>&nbsp;parameter. If its HBA has a
BIOS and, therefore, can be initialized in x86 real mode, a miniport driver
must have this routine, which is called by the x86-only, OS-dependent port
driver when the system transitions from x86 real to protected processor mode.
<H3>Parameters</H3>
<DL>
<DT>
<I>HwDeviceExtension</I>
<DD>
Points to the miniport driver’s storage for per-HBA data.
<BR>
<DT>
<I>Context</I>
<DD>
Is reserved for system use.
<BR>
<DT>
<I>SaveState</I>
<DD>
TRUE indicates the miniport should save the current state of the HBA until the
HwScsiAdapterState routine is called again with <I>SaveState</I>&nbsp;set to FALSE
to restore the saved state.
</DL>
<H3>Return Value</H3>
<P>
HwScsiAdapterState returns TRUE if it successfully saved or restored the HBA
state.
<H3>Comments</H3>
<P>
Miniport drivers of HBAs that are initialized in x86 real mode and that are
sensitive to x86-specific processor mode transitions must have a
HwScsiAdapterState routine. This routine, which is usually called after the
miniport’s HwScsiFindAdapter routine, preserves the initialized HBA state
during x86-only system transition(s) from x86 real to protected processor
mode.
<P>
HwScsiAdapterState is responsible for saving the current state of the HBA in
the <I>HwDeviceExtension</I>&nbsp;when it is called with <I>SaveState</I>&nbsp;set to
TRUE. It must restore the HBA state when it is called subsequently with <I>SaveState</I>
set to FALSE.
<P>
Miniport drivers of HBAs that are initialized in x86 protected mode and
miniports for which it is irrelevant whether their HBAs are being initialized
on a CISC-or RISC-based platform need not have this routine.
