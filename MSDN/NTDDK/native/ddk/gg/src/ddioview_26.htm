<P>
A <I>producer</I>&nbsp;is a driver that can generate fonts (produces glyph
information as output, including glyph metrics, bitmaps, and outlines). A <I>consumer</I>
is a driver that uses fonts (accepts glyph information as input for generating
text output, and must draw its own fonts or those of the hardware on a
device-managed surface). A driver can be both a producer and a consumer. For
example, a printer driver can act as a producer while servicing a <B><A HREF="grfncs_38.htm">DrvQueryFontData</A></B>
call to provide glyph metrics and later act as a consumer while processing a <B><A HREF="grfncs_59.htm">DrvTextOut</A></B>
call.
<P>
A driver is required to handle fonts only when it is a font producer or a font
consumer. If the hardware has a resident font, the driver must supply
information to GDI about this font, including the font metrics in the <A HREF="grstrcts_24.htm">IFIMETRICS</A>
structure, mappings from Unicode to individual glyph identities, individual
glyph attributes, and kerning tables. There are also functions the driver must
support. Some functions are required both by font drivers and drivers that use
driver-specific or device-specific fonts. Others are required only by font
drivers.
<P>
The support of font functions depends on the driver’s abilities. The general
types are:
