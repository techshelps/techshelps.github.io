<P>
An accelerator contains onboard circuitry that enhances the speed of graphics
operations. Such hardware can contain accelerations for specific rendering
operations such as line drawing and filling, or bit block transfers. If the
hardware provides support for a pointer, it is usually much faster for the
driver to make use of this than to use the pointer support provided by GDI.
<P>
The S3 sample driver is a sophisticated and fairly complicated example of an
accelerator that can be found in the <I>s3</I>&nbsp;display driver source example
directory. The S3 display driver is coded entirely in C so that it is portable
across systems. It supports both flat and banked frame buffers. For details
about banked frame buffers, see <A HREF="dpyddi_18.htm">Supporting
Banked Frame Buffers</A>.
