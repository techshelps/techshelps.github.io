<P>
The Windows NT graphics architecture has significantly changed in Release 4.0.
The biggest change is the move of GDI and graphics drivers into the Windows NT
executive. For this reason, all pre-4.0 graphics drivers must be ported and
rebuilt to run on NT4.0. Several new support routines have been added to
kernel-mode GDI, including routines for kernel-mode memory management,
synchronization, and file mapping.
<P>
See <A HREF="port.htm">Porting
Graphics Drivers To Windows NT 4.0 from 3.51</A>&nbsp;for details.
