<P>
A <I>cosmetic </I>line is always one pixel wide and is drawn using a solid
color brush. It is rendered according to the Grid Intersection Quantization
(GIQ) diamond convention in which each pixel can be thought of as having a
1-pixel by 1-pixel diamond around it.
<P>
For rendering cosmetic lines, <B><A HREF="grfncs_56.htm">DrvStrokePath</A></B>
follows the GIQ diamond convention. Figure 3.1 illustrates this convention,
with the shaded diamonds representing the pixels to be lit. Wherever the line
touches a diamond, the corresponding pixel is lighted. Start and end pixels
are determined by the diamond convention. A diamond is exclusive of its sides,
except for the right and bottom vertices. These points on the diamond are
inclusive, unless the slope of the line is exactly one. In this case the left
and bottom vertices are inclusive. A cosmetic line is last-pixel-exclusive;
that is, if the line ends inside the diamond for a pixel, that pixel is <I>not</I>
illuminated.

<B><A HREF="grfncs_30.htm">DrvLineTo</A></B>&nbsp;is an optional entry point that a
driver can supply as an optimization for application calls to the Win32 <B>LineTo</B>
function. <B>DrvLineTo</B>&nbsp;is simpler than <B>DrvStrokePath</B>&nbsp;because it
supports only integer end-points and solid cosmetic lines.
<P>
For raster devices that support the R2_NOT mix mode, the driver must use exact
rendering. Rendering should also be exact for devices that need GDI to draw on
some bitmaps and the driver to draw on other surfaces (unless the pixels are
too small to make any visible difference) or for devices that request GDI
handle complex clipping.
