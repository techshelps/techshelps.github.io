<P>
During its initialization, the spooler does the following for every port and
language monitor it finds in the registry:
<UL>
<LI>
Loads the monitor’s DLL.
<P>
<LI>
Calls the monitor’s <B><A HREF="pmonfncs_11.htm">InitializePrintMonitor</A></B>
function to obtain its function table. The table is returned as a set of
function pointers in a <A HREF="pmonfncs_13.htm">MONITOREX</A>&nbsp;structure. The
monitor must initialize pointers to the routines listed in the must-implement
section of <A HREF="prmon_5.htm">The Print Monitor API</A>, or
the spooler fails the monitor’s creation.
<P>
<LI>
If the monitor is a port monitor or LMPM, the spooler calls the monitor’s <B><A HREF="pmonfncs_7.htm">EnumPorts</A></B>
function to obtain the list of ports available on the local machine for
printing that this monitor supports.
<P>
<LI>
For every printer to be added, the spooler calls the associated monitor’s <B><A HREF="pmonfncs_14.htm">OpenPort</A></B>
or <B><A HREF="pmonfncs_15.htm">OpenPortEx</A>&nbsp;</B>function to acquire a port
handle for every port that has been assigned to that printer.
</UL>
<P>
Once initialization is complete, the spooler has a record of which print
monitors and printers exist, and which ports are associated with each monitor
and printer. Note that port setup is performed before printers are associated
with ports.
