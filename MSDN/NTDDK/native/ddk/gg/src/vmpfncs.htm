<P>
Video miniport drivers must have some and can have all of the functions that
are described in this chapter in alphabetic order.
<P>
Function names in the form of <B>HwVid</B><I>Xxx</I>&nbsp;and <B>SvgaHwIoPort</B><I>Xxx</I>
are sample names only; that is, these functions can have any name chosen by
the driver writer. <B>DriverEntry</B>&nbsp;is a required name. The function, when
assigned to the appropriate structure member for initialization purposes, will
be assigned to HwXxx as opposed to HwVidXxx.
<P>
All miniport driver functions should be made pageable, with a few exceptions.
Miniport functions that cannot be made pageable are:
<UL>
<LI>
<B>HwVidInterrupt</B>
<P>
<LI>
A <B>HwVidSynchronizeExecutionCallback</B>&nbsp;that is passed in calls to <B>VideoPortSynchronizeExecution</B>
<P>
<LI>
<B>HwVidResetHw</B>
<P>
<LI>
<B>HwVidBankedMemoryCallback</B>
<P>
<LI>
An internal function called by any of the preceding function(s)
</UL>
<P>
For more information about video-specific I/O requests that must be supported
by the port-miniport driver pair, see also Chapter 6 of this manual. For more
information about the sequence in which these miniport functions are called,
see also the <I>Graphics Driver Design Guide</I>.
