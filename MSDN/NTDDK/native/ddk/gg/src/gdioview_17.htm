<P>
Surface types can be viewed in context of how they are handled. These types
are as follows: 
<UL>
<LI>
Engine-managed surfaces (standard format bitmaps).
<P>
<LI>
Device-managed standard bitmaps.
<P>
<LI>
Device-managed nonstandard surfaces.
</UL>
<P>
&nbsp;
<H5>Engine-Managed Surfaces</H5>
<P>
A standard-format bitmap, called a <A HREF="glossary.htm#DDK_DIB_GG">DIB</A>, is a
single-plane, packed-pixel (where the data for each pixel is stored in a
contiguous manner)format bitmap. Each scan line of the bitmap is aligned on a
four-byte boundary.
<P>
Standard-format bitmaps are created and supported by GDI when the driver calls
the GDI service <B><A HREF="grfncs_69.htm">EngCreateBitmap</A></B>. An
engine-managed surface must be a DIB. The frame buffer driver creates a DIB as
its <A HREF="gdioview_13.htm#DDK_primary_surface_GG">primary surface</A>&nbsp;and lets GDI handle
rendering operations.
<H5>Device-Managed Surfaces</H5>
<P>
Device-managed surfaces are controlled by the driver and they can be either
DIB or nonDIB surfaces. Having a device-managed DIB surface allows the driver
to call back to GDI to have it draw on the surface. A driver can get a handle
to a DIB by calling <B><A HREF="grfncs_69.htm">EngCreateBitmap</A></B>
and then wrap a surface around it by calling <B><A HREF="grfncs_72.htm">EngCreateDeviceSurface</A></B>,
which requires GDI to call the driver for rendering operations. This is used
in banked frame buffer display drivers. Refer also to <A HREF="dpyddi_18.htm">Supporting
Banked Frame Buffers</A>. 
<P>
A driver can enable a device-managed nonDIB surface by calling <B>EngCreateDeviceSurface</B>
to have GDI create the surface and return a handle to it. GDI relies on the
driver to access, to control drawing to, and to read from a device-managed
surface.
<P>
A <A HREF="glossary.htm#DDK_DDB_GG">DDB</A>, sometimes called a device-format bitmap, is
another type of nonDIB device-managed surface. The DDB is supported to allow
certain drivers, such as the VGA, to implement faster bitmap-to-screen block
transfers. The DDB also allows drivers to draw to banked or nonDIB bitmaps in
offscreen display memory. If a DDB is required, the driver can support <B><A HREF="grfncs_10.htm">DrvCreateDeviceBitmap</A></B>
and call <B><A HREF="grfncs_71.htm">EngCreateDeviceBitmap</A></B>
to have the engine return a handle to the bitmap.
