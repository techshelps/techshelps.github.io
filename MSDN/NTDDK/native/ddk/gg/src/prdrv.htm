<P>
To support device-independent applications consistently across the full range
of possible printing devices, Win32&reg; accesses printer features through a <I>printer
driver</I>. A printer driver is an intermediate software module that provides
device-specific implementations for printer functions.
<P>
Hardware vendors can develop and easily install printer drivers in Windows
NT&reg;. This chapter defines a printer driver’s role in the Windows NT print
environment and outlines the components required by all Windows NT printer
drivers. It then presents general design issues and describes how printer
drivers support Win32 printer administration and setup. Finally, it briefly
describes the Common Property Sheet User Interface with which a printer
interface driver must communicate.
<P>
Part 1 of this manual contains information crucial to the design of all
graphics drivers, which includes both printer and display drivers. It
describes the general capabilities of GDI and provides information on
implementing driver entry points common to all graphics drivers.
Printer-specific DDI support is discussed in <A HREF="prtddi.htm">Supporting
DDI Printing and User Interface Functions</A>. Detailed descriptions of DDI entry
points, GDI support functions, and data structures, can be found in the <I>Graphics
Driver Reference</I>.
