<P>
For many devices, GDI can handle all font functions. Some drivers, however,
can draw their own fonts, or their device’s own fonts, on device surfaces.
Other drivers are font drivers, which can provide glyph bitmaps and/or
outlines, as well as glyph metrics to GDI. In these cases, the driver must
support some of the available font functions.
<P>
Text output is a more general function. If the surface is a standard-format
bitmap, GDI can handle all text output, unless the driver hooks out the call
to enhance performance. For a device-managed surface, the driver must support
text output.
<P>
The following topics provide information with regard to the support of font
and text management functions.
