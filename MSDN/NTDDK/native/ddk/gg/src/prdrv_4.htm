<P>
Printer drivers differ from the typical display driver in that device-specific
information can be obtained and altered via the user interface. Through the
Win32 Printer Folder in the Windows NT interface, the user has access to view
and alter certain printer properties such as the name of the printer, which
port it connects to, and which paper trays are used. Furthermore, many
applications allow modifications to the printer setup for a particular
document.
<P>
To accommodate this functionality, printer drivers must provide a printer
interface DLL that includes functions for setting printer properties and
document properties by the adminstrator/end-user. This printer interface
component is in addition to the printer graphics DLL required for rendering
the image to be printed. 
<P>
Note that where the printer driver is loaded and executed in Windows NT system
memory, the printer interface driver is a user-mode module that is loaded and
executed in the context of the spooler.
<P>
Sample code for the printer interface component of the printer driver can be
found in the <I>psui</I>&nbsp;directory of the Windows NT DDK.
