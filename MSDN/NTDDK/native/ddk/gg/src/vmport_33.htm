<P>
Each MS-DOS application runs as a Windows VDM, which in turn, runs as a
Console Manager application in the Win32 protected subsystem.
<P>
In Windows NT platforms, a kernel-mode component called the <I>V86 emulator</I>
traps I/O instructions issued by MS-DOS applications. As long as such an
application runs within a window, its attempts to access video adapter ports
are trapped and reflected back to the system-supplied video VDD, which
emulates the behavior of the adapter for the application.
<P>
In other words, the display driver retains control of the video adapter while
a VDM runs in a window.
