<P>
The types of lines and curves included in graphic output are geometric lines,
cosmetic lines, and Bezier curves.
<P>
For line and curve output, a driver may support <B><A HREF="grfncs_56.htm">DrvStrokePath</A></B>,
<B><A HREF="grfncs_24.htm">DrvFillPath</A></B>, <B><A HREF="grfncs_55.htm">DrvStrokeAndFillPath</A></B>,
and <B><A HREF="grfncs_34.htm">DrvPaint</A></B>. The driver must support <B>DrvStrokePath</B>
for drawing lines if the surface is device-managed; drivers are not required
to support curves. For a DIB surface, the function is called only if the
driver has hooked it through <B><A HREF="grfncs_64.htm">EngAssociateSurface</A></B>.
<P>
When GDI draws a line or curve with any set of attributes, GDI can call <B>DrvStrokePath</B>.
At a minimum, the <B>DrvStrokePath</B>&nbsp;function must support the drawing of
solid and styled cosmetic lines with a solid color brush and arbitrary
clipping. The GDI <A HREF="grstrcts_27.htm">PATHOBJ</A>&nbsp;and <A HREF="grstrcts_4.htm">CLIPOBJ</A>
service functions make this possible by breaking down the lines into a set of
lines one pixel wide with precomputed clipping. <B>DrvStrokePath</B>&nbsp;provides
a pointer, <I>plineattrs</I>, to the <A HREF="grstrcts_25.htm">LINEATTRS</A>
structure which defines the various line attributes.
<P>
When the path or clipping is too complex for the driver to process on the
device, the driver can punt the call back to GDI. In this case, GDI can break
the <B><A HREF="grfncs_56.htm">DrvStrokePath</A></B>&nbsp;call into a set of
lines one pixel wide with precomputed clipping.
<P>
By calling the CLIPOBJ services from GDI, a driver can have GDI enumerate all
the lines in the path and perform all of the line clipping calculations. In
addition, a driver can use the <A HREF="grstrcts_27.htm">PATHOBJ</A>, <A HREF="grstrcts_4.htm">CLIPOBJ</A>,
or <A HREF="grstrcts_34.htm">XFORMOBJ</A>&nbsp;services to simplify the graphics
operations. For example, a driver can use <B><A HREF="grfncs_4.htm">CLIPOBJ_cEnumStart</A>
</B>and <B><A HREF="grfncs_3.htm">CLIPOBJ_bEnum</A></B>&nbsp;to enumerate the
rectangles in a clip region, send this region down to the printer, and clip to
it. The driver can also use <B><A HREF="grfncs_178.htm">PATHOBJ_vEnumStart</A></B>
and <B><A HREF="grfncs_173.htm">PATHOBJ_bEnum</A></B>&nbsp;to enumerate lines or
curves in the path, and can then send the path to the device, and stroke it.
