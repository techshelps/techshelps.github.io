<P>
A language monitor allows the spooler to configure and monitor the status of a
bidirectional printer. A bidirectional printer supports two-way communication
between itself and the print spooler running on the computer to which the
printer is connected.
<P>
Using a language monitor, the spooler can request configuration and status
information from the printer, and/or the printer can send unsolicited status
information to the spooler whenever certain events occur on the printer. For
example, a language monitor could be written for a printer that can detect and
communicate events such as paper jams, no paper, low or no toner, and/or the
fact that the printer is warming up and not yet ready to print.
<P>
Windows NT supplies the following language monitor:

Printer Job Language (PJL)
</FONT></TABLE>
<P>
If a printer manufacturer’s device is bidirectional and uses a language other
than PJL, vendors can develop a language monitor for it. A language monitor
can also be developed when a vendor wishes to add data, such as
printer-specific control information, to the print stream going to a
unidirectional printer. Language monitors are completely optional in the
Windows NT print architecture.
<P>
For the printer to understand requests from the computer and for the computer
to understand solicited or unsolicited responses from the printer, a vendor
must define a language. For example, the HP LaserJet 4Si is a bidirectional
printer device and Printer Job Language (PJL) is the language that implements
its bidirectional communication.
