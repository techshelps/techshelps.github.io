<P>
To print a document, an application calls a variety of Win32 functions. Many
of these functions depend on the printer graphics component of the printer
driver to perform rendering actions that are specific to the particular type
of printer device being used, such as:
<UL>
<LI>
Drawing/rendering text and graphics
<P>
<LI>
Returning device-specific information
<P>
<LI>
Marking the starting and ending points of documents and pages
<P>
<LI>
Creating device-compatible realizations of graphics engine objects such as
fonts, brushes, and palettes
</UL>
<P>
In addition, the printer graphics driver portion of the printer driver always
supports requests to enable and disable the driver, the <A HREF="glossary.htm#DDK_PDEV_GG">PDEV</A>,
and the rendering surface. If the surface is device-managed, requests to
implement rendering operations are also supported. Requests for the correct
device-dependent data and behavior come to the appropriate driver from GDI
through the DDI entry points.
<P>
Driver functions that return printer-specific information, such as <B>DrvQueryAdvanceWidths</B>,
are often used even when no document is actually being printed. This is the
case when an application must maintain a WYSIWYG display on the screen, so
that what the user arranges on the display will be replicated by the printer
whenever a printed copy is requested. For example, to display the line breaks
in text properly, a word processor must base line-fitting calculations on
character widths and other font metrics from the specific printer’s
realization of a font. Without information on how the printer realizes a
chosen font, the display could not accurately present the printed document.
<P>
Sample code for the printer graphics component of the PostScript printer
driver can be found in the <I>print\psprint\pscript</I>&nbsp;directory of the
Windows NT DDK.
<P>
For DDI functions and implementation details that are common to all graphics
drivers, see <A HREF="ddioview.htm">Supporting the DDI</A>&nbsp;in Part 1.
Printer-specific DDI support is described in <A HREF="prtddi.htm">Supporting
DDI Printing and User Interface Functions</A>.
<H4>Raster Device Drivers</H4>
<P>
Microsoft Windows NT includes <A HREF="glossary.htm#DDK_RasDD_GG">RasDD</A>&nbsp;to simplify the
task of building a raster printer driver. RasDD is capable of carrying out
print-related requests <FONT FACE="Symbol">&#190;</FONT> such as printing
text, rendering bitmaps, and advancing a page <FONT
FACE="Symbol">&#190;</FONT> on most types of printers, which means that the
driver writer doesn’t have to write this code. Instead, driver writers have
only to build a minidriver for their particular printer. The <A HREF="glossary.htm#DDK_Unitool_GG">Unitool</A>
is provided with the Windows NT DDK for this purpose. For more information on
RasDD and minidrivers, see <A HREF="minidrv.htm">Printer
Minidrivers and RasDD</A>.
<P>
RasDD is a data-driven printer driver that uses the minidriver to provide
essential data about a printer. For example, RasDD retrieves required
information from the minidriver to determine the current resolution of the
printer, to identify which fonts are available, and so on.
<P>
Note that RasDD does not support plotters, Adobe PostScript printers, or
printers that use printer-control languages similar to PostScript. For these
devices, a vendor might be able to use the Microsoft-provided drivers, or
might have to implement the functions required by GDI for these types of
printers.
