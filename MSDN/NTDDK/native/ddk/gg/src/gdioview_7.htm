<P>
GDI halftoning produces a quality color-scale or gray-scale image for printing
devices or display devices that do not already have a built-in color or gray
scale. Color halftoning provides:

Highest quality color and gray-scale reproduction possible on a given device.

Increased visual resolution with a limited set of intensity levels.

Improved color correlation between the different output devices.

Traditional analog halftoning is a cellular process that uses a halftoning
screen. The halftoning screen is composed of cells of equal sizes, with
fixed-cell spacing center-to-center. The fixed-cell spacing accommodates the
thickness of the ink, while the size of a dot within each cell can vary to
produce the impression of a continuous tone.
<P>
On a computer, most printing or screen shading also uses a fixed-cell pixel
size. To simulate the variable dot size, a combination of cluster pixels
simulates the halftone screen. In Windows NT, GDI includes halftoning default
parameters that provide a good first approximation. Additional device-specific
information can be added to the system to improve output.
