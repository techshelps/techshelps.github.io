<P>
GDI is the intermediary support between a Windows NT graphics driver and
application. Applications call Win32 GDI functions to make graphics output
requests. These requests are routed to GDI. GDI then sends these requests to
the appropriate graphics driver, such as a display driver or printer driver.
GDI is an NT system-supplied module that cannot be replaced.
<P>
GDI communicates with the graphics driver through a set of DDI functions.
These functions are identified by their <B>Drv</B>&nbsp;prefix. Information is
passed between GDI and the driver through the input/output parameters of these
entry points. The driver <I>must</I>&nbsp;support certain <I>DrvXxx</I>&nbsp;functions
for GDI to call. The driver supports GDI’s requests by performing the
appropriate operations on its associated hardware before returning to GDI.
<P>
GDI includes many graphics output capabilities in itself, eliminating the need
for the driver to support these capabilities and thereby making it possible to
reduce the size of the driver. GDI also exports service functions that the
driver can call, further reducing the amount of support the driver must
provide. GDI service functions are identified by their <B>Eng</B>&nbsp;prefix, and
functions that provide access to<I>&nbsp;</I>GDI-maintained structures have names
in the form of <I>XXXOBJ_Xxx</I>.
<P>
Figure 2.1 shows this flow of communication.
