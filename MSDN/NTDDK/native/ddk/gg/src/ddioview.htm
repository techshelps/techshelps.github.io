<P>
In response to device-independent application calls routed through GDI, a
graphics driver must ensure that its graphics device produces the required
output. A graphics driver controls graphics output by implementing as much of
the Device Driver Interface (DDI) as is necessary.
<P>
DDI function names have the form <I>DrvXxx</I>. GDI calls these <I>DrvXxx</I>
functions to pass data to the driver. In response to a request from an
application, if GDI determines that a function is supported by the driver, GDI
calls that function. It is the responsibility of the driver to support the
function and return to GDI upon its completion.
<P>
This chapter describes the DDI functions of which all graphics driver writers
must be aware. DDI function declarations, structure definitions, and constants
can be found in <I>winddi.h</I>. This include file is shipped with the Windows
NT DDK. See the <I>Graphics Driver Reference</I>&nbsp;for detailed information on
each of the DDI entry point functions, GDI service functions, and DDI
structures and types.
<P>
<B>Note</B>&nbsp; When a device driver returns an error, it can call <B><A HREF="grfncs_125.htm">EngSetLastError</A></B>
to log an extended error code. The application program can then retrieve the
error code.
