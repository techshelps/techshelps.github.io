<P>
It is only through GDI that a Windows NT printer driver communicates with the
application and, by way of the spooler, sends printer instructions to the
device. That is, a printer driver is driven by requests from GDI. If the
driver determines that a print-related request can be adequately processed by
GDI services, it can pass the call back for the graphics engine to handle.
This is referred to as <I>punting</I>&nbsp;the call. This method of deferring
function calls to GDI, when no special processing is required for the
particular printer device, allows the driver to be smaller and can
significantly shorten its development time.
<P>
Since the graphics engine can perform much of the rendering and printing
functionality, and always works in conjunction with a printer driver, it is
recommended that you refer to the <A HREF="gdioview.htm">GDI
Support for Graphics Drivers</A>&nbsp;and its subsequent topics before proceeding with
the printer driver topics that follow. The GDI overview topics provide
