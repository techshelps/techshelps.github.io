<P>
Printer driver data files provide information to the printer graphics and
printer interface components that indicate the printer’s capabilities. These
capabilities include the printer’s memory configuration, the number and type
of cartridges, and the number and size of the paper trays. Driver data files
can be either minidriver, PPD, or PCD files, depending on the printer type.
<H4>Minidrivers</H4>
<P>
A printer minidriver is the <A HREF="glossary.htm#DDK_GPC_GG">GPC</A>&nbsp;data file that RasDD uses
to print to a raster printing device. It contains a collection of data
structures referred to as the printer’s <I>data table.</I>&nbsp;A data table
contains data such as the printer’s resolution, color capabilities, metrics
for device fonts, and the strings that correspond to various printer commands.
It also specifies printer model-specific aspects of how primitive bitmap and
text operations are to be performed.
<P>
To create a printer description file for a new printer, use the Unitool
program, supplied with the Windows NT DDK. Unitool automatically combines the
printer description file with a layer of RasDD interface code to create a
printer driver DLL, called a <I>minidriver</I>. For more information about
using Unitool, refer to <A HREF="minidrv.htm">Printer
Minidrivers and RasDD</A>&nbsp;or the Unitool online Help.
<H4>PPD Files</H4>
<P>
The PostScript driver uses .PPD files. Each <A HREF="glossary.htm#DDK_PPD_GG">PPD</A>&nbsp;file
contains PostScript keywords that provide resource data for a PostScript
printing device. For example, the PPD file contains the printer model name,
nickname, default resolution, page size, printable area of the page, and a
list of device fonts. Unlike the minidriver’s GPC file, which is converted to
a DLL when defined, a PPD file is an ASCII text file that must be read by the
PostScript driver as part of the device initialization during <B><A HREF="grfncs_20.htm">DrvEnablePDEV</A></B>.
<P>
The PostScript driver can support any PostScript printer as long as it has
access to a PPD file for that printer. There must be a PPD file for each
PostScript printer supported.
<P>
The Windows NT PostScript driver supports Adobe version 4.0-compatible .PPD
files.
<H4>PCD Files</H4>
<P>
The plotter driver uses .PCD data files. A <A HREF="glossary.htm#DDK_PCD_GG">PCD</A>&nbsp;data file
is generated from an ASCII text file that contains the capabilities of a
plotter device. The Windows NT DDK supplies two sample text files; it is
recommended that you copy and edit one of these files to define your device.
The DDK also supplies the <I>plotgpc</I>&nbsp;program to convert the text file into
a .PCD file.
