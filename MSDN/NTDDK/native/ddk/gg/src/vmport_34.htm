<P>
For performance reasons, when the user switches an MS-DOS application to
full-screen mode in an x86-based machine, the display driver yields control of
the adapter. The system VGA or a VGA-compatible miniport driver then hooks out
from the V86 emulator all I/O instructions, such as application-issued <B>IN,
REP INSB/INSW/INSD, OUT,</B>&nbsp;and <B>REP OUTSB/OUTSW/OUTSD</B>&nbsp;instructions, to
the video I/O ports. These hooked I/O operations are forwarded to the
VGA-compatible miniport’s SvgaHwIoPort<I>Xxx</I>&nbsp;functions.
<P>
However, for faster performance, a miniport can call <B>VideoPortSetTrappedEmulatorPorts</B>
to allow some I/O ports to be accessed directly by the application. The
miniport continues to hook other I/O ports with its SvgaHwIoPortXxx to
validate the application-issued instruction stream to those ports.
<P>
To prevent a full-screen application from issuing a sequence of instructions
that might hang the machine, the SvgaHwIoPort<I>Xxx</I>&nbsp;functions monitor the
application instruction stream to a driver-determined set of adapter
registers. A miniport driver must enable direct access only to I/O ports that
are completely safe. For example, ports for the sequencer and miscellaneous
output registers should always be hooked by the V86 emulator and trapped to
the miniport-supplied SvgaHwIoPort<I>Xxx</I>&nbsp;functions for validation.
<P>
Direct access to I/O ports for the application is determined by the IOPM
(named for the x86 I/O permission map) that the VGA-compatible miniport sets
by calling <B>VideoPortSetTrappedEmulatorPorts</B>. Note that the miniport can
adjust the IOPM by calling this function to have access ranges, describing I/O
ports, released for direct access by the application or re-trapped to an
SvgaHwIoPort<I>Xxx</I>. The current IOPM determines which ports can be
accessed directly by the application and which remain hooked by the V86
emulator and trapped to an SvgaHwIoPort<I>Xxx</I>&nbsp;function for validation.
<P>
By default, all I/O ports set up in such a miniport’s emulator access ranges
array are trapped to the corresponding SvgaHwIoPortXxx. However,
VGA-compatible miniport drivers usually call <B>VideoPortSetTrappedEmulatorPorts</B>
on receipt of an IOCTL_VIDEO_ENABLE_VDM request to reset the IOPM for the VDM
to allow direct access to some of these I/O ports. Usually, such a driver
allows direct access to all video adapter registers except the VGA sequencer
registers and the miscellaneous output register, plus any SVGA
adapter-specific registers that the driver writer has determined should always
be validated by an SvgaHwIoPortXxx.
