<P>
The Windows NTGPC extensions provide Windows NT-specific information about the
printer that is later passed to GDI. In particular, the Windows NTGPC
extensions data consists of color rendering (halftoning) information made up
of two major components. First, the COLORINFO structure is defined to
characterize the printer’s color rendering. The COLORINFO structure specifies
information such as the purity of the printer’s inks (how much cyan and
magenta is in the yellow ink),  the actual color of the inks, and the gamma of
the printer (how the intensity of the color changes as the amount of color is
increased).
<P>
The other major component of the Windows NTGPC data characterizes the printing
mechanism. This data defines both the <I>effective</I>&nbsp;resolution of the
printer and the default halftone pattern size to use. In practice, the
printer’s stated resolution, such as 300 dpi, actually indicates only the
positioning ability of the printer. To print correctly, the printer’s
effective resolution is also required because the actual dots the printer
creates on the paper are often larger than the printer’s stated resolution.
For example, the LaserJet Series II has a stated positioning ability of
1/300th of an inch, but the actual dots are a slightly less than 1/200th of an
inch. In this case, if every second dot is printed, more than 50 percent of
the page appears to be covered in ink.
<P>
The effective resolution allows the halftoning code to compensate for these <I>large</I>
dots and the image comes out at about the expected intensity. The halftone
pattern size is set on a subjective basis to make the output look good. As the
pattern size increases, the number of grey levels in the image increases (for
a monochrome printer). The image resolution decreases as the halftoning
operation effectively averages over larger chunks of the image.
<P>
The Windows NT DDK contains the <B>ntgpcedt.exe</B>&nbsp;program that specifies the
NTGPC extensions data. The <B>ntgpcedt.exe</B>&nbsp;program reads data from a file
and generates the required data structures in the desired file format. The
structures used in the output file are described in the file <I>ntres.h</I>,
that is also included in the DDK. Because RasDD accepts this file format,
consider the <B>ntgpcedt.exe</B>&nbsp;program as the best means to produce GPC
extensions data.
