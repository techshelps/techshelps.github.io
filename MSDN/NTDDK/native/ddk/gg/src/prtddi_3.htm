<P>
Optional functions that support device-dependent functions in the printer not
covered by regular GDI operations are the following:
<UL>
<LI>
<B><A HREF="grfncs_23.htm">DrvEscape</A></B>
<P>
<LI>
<B><A HREF="grfncs_18.htm">DrvDrawEscape</A></B>
</UL>
<P>
These entry points enable the driver to provide escape functions used to
“tunnel” through GDI, essentially turning GDI into a dumb communications line.
The PostScript driver is an example of a driver that supports these.
<P>
<B>DrvEscape</B>&nbsp;is used to query information from a device when the
information is not available in the device-independent DDI. For example,
information that could be obtained directly from a device might include the
phone number for a FAX machine. Drawing on a surface is allowed, but, because
no <A HREF="grstrcts_4.htm">CLIPOBJ</A>&nbsp;is passed in, as it is in <B>DrvDrawEscape</B>,
drawing in <B>DrvEscape</B>&nbsp;is limited. The escape depends on the value of the
<I>iEsc</I>&nbsp;parameter
<P>
The driver should support <B>DrvDrawEscape</B>&nbsp;when the device allows
device-specific drawing operations not available in a device-independent DDI. <B>DrvDrawEscape</B>
gets a CLIPOBJ as an input parameter. For example, the PostScript driver
implements this call to support the printing of encapsulated PostScript (EPS)
data. The escapes that are supported are determined by <B>DrvEscape</B>.
