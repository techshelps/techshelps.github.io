<B>DrvPrinterEvent</B>&nbsp;is called by the print subsystem when an event occurs
that might require action by the printer driver.
<H3>Parameters</H3>
<DL>
<DT>
<I>pPrinterName</I>
<DD>
Pointer to a null-terminated string that identifies the printer. The string
name can identify a local or remote printer; that is, it can be in the form of
“<I>PrinterName</I>” or <I>“\\Machine\PrinterName</I>”.
<BR>
<DT>
<I>DriverEvent</I>
<DD>
Specifies the event that occurred. Possible values for <I>DriverEvent</I>&nbsp;are
as follows:
<UL>
<LI>
PRINTER_EVENT_ADD_CONNECTION
<P>
<LI>
PRINTER_EVENT_DELETE_CONNECTION
<P>
<LI>
PRINTER_EVENT_INITIALIZE
<P>
<LI>
PRINTER_EVENT_DELETE
<P>
<LI>
PRINTER_EVENT_CACHE_REFRESH
<P>
<LI>
PRINTER_EVENT_CACHE_DELETE
</UL>
<DT>
<I>Flags</I>
<DD>
Bitmask in which the following field can be set:

</FONT></TABLE>
<DT>
<I>lParam</I>
<DD>
Specifies the parameters associated with the event that occurred. This field
is currently always null.
</DL>
<H3>Return Value</H3>
<P>
<B>DrvPrinterEvent</B>&nbsp;returns TRUE upon success; otherwise it returns FALSE.
<H3>Comments</H3>
<P>
The print subsystem calls <B>DrvPrinterEvent</B>&nbsp;when certain events occur
that might require action by the printer driver. Printer interface drivers
must support the PRINTER_EVENT_INITIALIZE event; all other events can be
supported optionally. Details associated with each <I>DriverEvent</I>&nbsp;are
described in the sections that follow.
<H3><A NAME="DDK_PRINTER_EVENT_ADD_CONNECTION_GG"></A>PRINTER_EVENT_ADD_CONNECTION</H3>
<P>
The print subsystem calls <B>DrvPrinterEvent</B>&nbsp;with this event after a
successful call to the Win32 <B>AddPrinterConnection</B>&nbsp;function. The driver
should store connection settings in the HKEY_CURRENT_USER key of the registry,
because printer connections are stored on a per-user basis. Thus, when a user
with a floating profile logs into other machines, the connection floats too.
Because printer connections can float, <B>DrvPrinterEvent</B>&nbsp;is not called
from any machines that a user subsequently logs into after establishing a
printer connection on their current machine.
<P>
The string to which <I>pPrinterName</I>&nbsp;points always identifies a remote
printer for this <I>DriverEvent</I>. The user typically does not have
administrative privileges on the remote server.
<P>
<B>DrvPrinterEvent</B>&nbsp;is called in the context of the calling application for
this event; the calling application is usually the Printer Folder. As a
result, the driver can display a user interface. The print subsystem ignores
the value returned by the driver.
<H3><A NAME="DDK_PRINTER_EVENT_DELETE_CONNECTION_GG"></A>PRINTER_EVENT_DELETE_CONNECTION</H3>
<P>
The print subsystem calls <B>DrvPrinterEvent</B>&nbsp;with this event before
calling the Win32 <B>DeletePrinterConnection</B>&nbsp;function. The driver should
delete connection settings stored earlier in the HKEY_CURRENT_USER key of the
registry during a previous call to this function with a <I>DriverEvent</I>&nbsp;of
PRINTER_EVENT_ADD_CONNECTION, and perform any other clean-up.
<P>
The string to which <I>pPrinterName</I>&nbsp;points always identifies a remote
printer for this <I>DriverEvent</I>. The user typically does not have
administrative privileges on the remote server.
<P>
<B>DrvPrinterEvent</B>&nbsp;is called in the context of the calling application for
this event; the calling application is usually the Printer Folder. As a
result, the driver can display a user interface. The print subsystem ignores
the value returned by the driver.
<H3><A NAME="DDK_PRINTER_EVENT_INITIALIZE_GG"></A>PRINTER_EVENT_INITIALIZE</H3>
<P>
The print subsystem calls <B>DrvPrinterEvent</B>&nbsp;with this event when a
printer is created so that the driver can initialize its registry settings. It
is also called when the Win32 <B>SetPrinter</B>&nbsp;function is called and the
driver changes.
<P>
<B>DrvPrinterEvent</B>&nbsp;is called in the context of the spooler process for
this event; consequently, the driver must not display a user interface. The
spooler verifies that the user has administrative privileges before making the
call, and calls the driver while impersonating the user.
<P>
A driver must implement this event.
<H3><A NAME="DDK_PRINTER_EVENT_DELETE_GG"></A>PRINTER_EVENT_DELETE</H3>
<P>
The print subsystem calls <B>DrvPrinterEvent</B>&nbsp;with this event when a
printer is being deleted so that the driver can delete its registry settings.
<P>
<B>DrvPrinterEvent</B>&nbsp;is called in the context of the spooler process for
this event; consequently, the driver must not display a user interface. The
spooler verifies that the user has administrative privileges before making the
call, and calls the driver while impersonating the user.
<H3><A NAME="DDK_PRINTER_EVENT_CACHE_REFRESH_GG"></A>PRINTER_EVENT_CACHE_REFRESH</H3>
<P>
The print subsystem calls <B>DrvPrinterEvent</B>&nbsp;with this event when the
spooler is establishing a workstation cache or detects that a change to the
cache has occurred. The driver can update any private cache data, such as font
files, at this time.
<P>
<B>DrvPrinterEvent</B>&nbsp;is called in the context of the spooler process for
this event; consequently, the driver must not display a user interface. The
print subsystem ignores the value returned by the driver.
<H3><A NAME="DDK_PRINTER_EVENT_CACHE_DELETE_GG"></A>PRINTER_EVENT_CACHE_DELETE</H3>
<P>
The print subsystem calls <B>DrvPrinterEvent</B>&nbsp;with this event while the
spooler is deleting a cached printer. The driver should delete any privately
cached data, such as font files, at this time.
<P>
<B>DrvPrinterEvent</B>&nbsp;is called in the context of the spooler process for
this event; consequently, the driver must not display a user interface. The
