<P>
Self-declared “VGA-compatible” miniport drivers are set up to configure
themselves in the registry with <B>VgaCompatible</B>&nbsp;set to one (TRUE).
VGA-compatible miniport drivers have the following features:
<UL>
<LI>
Such a miniport driver, usually of an SVGA adapter, is based on the
system-supplied VGA miniport driver, with code modified to support
adapter-specific features. The system-supplied VGA display drivers use the
kernel-mode support provided by VGA-compatible miniport drivers, so the
developer of a new miniport for a VGA-compatible adapter need not write a new
display driver.
<P>
<LI>
Such a miniport driver both provides support for full-screen MS-DOS&reg;
applications to do I/O directly to the adapter registers and also functions as
a <I>video validator</I>&nbsp;to prevent such an application from issuing any
sequence of instructions that would hang the machine.
</UL>
<P>
Miniport drivers of most SVGA adapters fall in this category, but any new
miniport driver for a nonSVGA adapter can provide VGA compatibility support at
the discretion of the driver designer.
