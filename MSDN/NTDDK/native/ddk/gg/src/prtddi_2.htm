<P>
Printer drivers are required to support the following entry points, which
support page and document printing:
<UL>
<LI>
<B><A HREF="grfncs_52.htm">DrvStartDoc</A></B>
<P>
<LI>
<B><A HREF="grfncs_53.htm">DrvStartPage</A></B>
<P>
<LI>
<B><A HREF="grfncs_47.htm">DrvSendPage</A></B>
<P>
<LI>
<B><A HREF="grfncs_22.htm">DrvEndDoc</A></B>
</UL>
<P>
Printing a document begins with a call from GDI to the driver function <B>DrvStartDoc</B>.
This function requests that the driver supply any control information needed
to start the printing of a document. <B>DrvStartDoc</B>&nbsp;also sends the
document name to the printer driver.
<P>
The driver calls <B><A HREF="grfncs_139.htm">EngWritePrinter</A></B>&nbsp;to
send data to the printer by way of the spooler. Along with a buffer of data,
the driver should also supply the printer handle received when GDI called <B><A HREF="grfncs_20.htm">DrvEnablePDEV</A></B>.
<P>
<B><A HREF="grfncs_53.htm">DrvStartPage</A>&nbsp;</B>is called to give the driver
a chance to send any control codes needed to make sure the page is in the
correct format. <B>DrvStartPage</B>&nbsp;should also erase the surface each time it
is called.
<P>
<B><A HREF="grfncs_47.htm">DrvSendPage</A></B>&nbsp;requests the driver to process
and send the page to the printer by calling <B>EngWritePrinter</B>. If the
surface is a bitmap on which the drawing is accumulated, the driver should
access the raw bits by using <B>SURFOBJ_Xxx</B>&nbsp;service functions. Drivers
that use a device-managed surface and send the bits to the printer as the
image is rendered do not send out the drawing in <B>DrvSendPage</B>. During <B>DrvSendPage</B>,
the driver should also send the appropriate printer sequences to eject the
page from the printer.
<P>
If <B>DrvSendPage</B>&nbsp;is slow, the user might want to stop the print job while
in this call. In this case, the driver should call <B><A HREF="grfncs_66.htm">EngCheckAbort</A></B>
at least every five seconds to determine whether printing should be
terminated. If <B>EngCheckAbort</B>&nbsp;returns TRUE, the processing of the page
should be stopped and this function should return FALSE.
<P>
<B><A HREF="grfncs_22.htm">DrvEndDoc</A></B>&nbsp;requests that the driver send any
control information needed at the end of a document. The control codes should
be sent by way of <B>EngWritePrinter</B>.
