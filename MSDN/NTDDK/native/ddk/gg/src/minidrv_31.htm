<H3><A NAME="DDK_Paper_Sizes_Dialog_Box_GG"></A>Paper Sizes Dialog Box</H3>
<P>
A number of sets of paper-size commands can be set up for the minidriver. To
specify paper-size commands, select Paper Info/Size... from the Printer Data
menu and display the initial Paper Sizes dialog box. Alternately, you can
select an existing set of paper-size commands by highlighting the desired set
of sizes in the Paper Sizes list box in the minidriver’s Printer Data window
(scroll to display the paper sizes set on the list if necessary) and double
clicking the selection to display the Paper Sizes dialog box.
<P>
The Paper Sizes dialog box specifies printer data, such as whether a
particular paper size is driver-defined or predefined, the paper dimensions,
the cursor origin, the unprintable-region dimensions, and so on.
<P>
The Diconix 150 Plus printer supports two paper sizes. The first is 8.5 x 11
and the second is defined by the user.
<P>
The HP LaserJet IIP printer supports the following four paper sizes and four
envelope sizes:
<UL>
<LI>
8.5 x 11 inches
<P>
<LI>
Legal (8.5 x 14 inches)
<P>
<LI>
Executive (7.25 x 10.5 inches)
<P>
<LI>
A4 (210 x 297 millimeters)
<P>
<LI>
Envelope #10 (4 1/8 x 9 1/2 inches)
<P>
<LI>
Envelope DL (110 x 220 millimeters)
<P>
<LI>
Envelope C5 (162 x 229 millimeters)
<P>
<LI>
Envelope C3 (324 x 458 inches)
</UL>
<P>
<B>Note</B>&nbsp; The examples in the following topics are based on the first paper
size initialized for each minidriver. In both instances, this is the standard
letter size (8.5 x 11) paper.
<P>
When you finish entering data in the Paper Sizes dialog box:
<UL>
<LI>
Click the OK button to accept the additions or changes.
<P>

</UL>
<H4>Predefined (Paper Sizes)</H4>
<P>
The Predefined button, when set, allows selection of a single paper size from
the Name listbox of predefined names supplied by RasDD or the minidriver.
Click the adjacent Name list box and select a single paper size. This
information will be presented to the user.
<P>
Diconix 150 Plus: Select the name: Letter 8.5 x 11 in.
<P>
HP LaserJet IIP: Same as Diconix 150 Plus.
<H4>Driver Defined (Paper Sizes)</H4>
<P>
The Driver Defined button identifies a driver defined paper size. If the
Driver Defined button is set, enter the name of the paper size in the adjacent
Name box. This information will be presented to the user.
<P>
Diconix 150 Plus: The paper size is predefined. This button is not selected.
<P>
HP LaserJet IIP: Same as Diconix 150 Plus.
<H4>X Size (Paper Width)</H4>
<P>
The X Size control specifies the page width. If the paper size is Predefined,
UniTool provides this value. If the paper size is defined by the user, specify
this value in master units.
<P>
Diconix 150 Plus: The X Size box contains 8160 (8.5 inches x 960 dots per
inch).
<P>
HP LaserJet IIP: The X Size box contains 2550 (8.5 inches x 300 dots per
inch).
<H4>Y Size (Paper Height)</H4>
<P>
The Y Size box control specifies the page height. If the paper size is
Predefined, UniTool provides this value. If the paper size is defined by the
user, specify this value in master units.
<P>
Diconix 150 Plus: The Y Size box contains 6336 (11 inches x  576 dots per
inch).
<P>
HP LaserJet IIP: The Y Size box contains 3300 (11 inches x 300 dots per inch).
<H4>Portrait Mode and Landscape Mode</H4>
<P>
The Paper Sizes dialog box contains separate group boxes for configuring the
printer for portrait and landscape modes. Both group boxes contain a Select
box, an Unprintable Regions box, a Cursor Origin box, and Vector Offset box.
The following topics describe the boxes in more detail.
<H4>Select Paper Size</H4>
<P>
The Select String box command selects the paper size identified in Name. Laser
printers usually require a device command to select a page size.. For nonlaser
printers, use a device command to set the page size if the command is
available. In either case, if a page size selection command is used, check the
PS_EJECTFF box in the fGeneral dialog box.
<P>
Diconix 150 Plus: The default paper size is 8.5 x 11 inches. No command is
required.
<P>
HP LaserJet IIP: These printer-specific commands prevent problems on
particular printers as follows:
<UL>
<LI>
Page Size command (ESC&amp;l2A) selects the 8.5 x 11 inch paper size.
<P>
<LI>
Line Spacing command (ESC&amp;l4D) selects a vertical line spacing of four
lines per inch.
<P>
<LI>
Top Margin command (ESC&amp;l1E) specifies that the top margin is the height
of one line.
<P>
<LI>
Text Length command (ESC&amp;l42F) specifies that 42 lines per page.
</UL>
<P>
To specify a combination of these commands, type the following in the Select
String box:
<PRE><FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE="2">\x1B&amp;l2a4d1e42F
&nbsp;</FONT></PRE>
<H4>Unprintable-Region Dimensions</H4>
<P>
Many printers cannot print text and graphics on some portion of the page. This
area of the page is referred to as the <I>unprintable region</I>. For example,
most laser printers have an unprintable region that varies with different page
sizes. Many narrow carriage dot matrix printers can only print eight inches of
text or graphics. Additionally, the use of sheet feeders on many nonlaser
printers can introduce an unprintable region on the top and/or bottom of the
page.
<P>
To obtain correct output for the different combinations of printer models,
paper sizes, and paper sources, the minidriver must specify information about
the size and placement of the unprintable regions of a printer.
<P>
For more information about limitations imposed by a specific printer model,
see <A HREF="minidrv_47.htm">Model Data</A>.
<P>
For more information about limitations imposed by a paper-feed method, see <A HREF="minidrv_33.htm">Paper
Sources Dialog Box</A>.
<P>
The Unprintable Regions control specifies the size of the unprintable regions
at the top, bottom, left, and right side of a particular paper size. The
unprintable region for a paper size is that region where output is clipped as
a result of physical limitations imposed by the printer’s hardware.
<P>
To generally determine the location of the printer’s physical boundaries:
<OL>
<LI>
Create an ASCII text file using a line width that exceeds the paper width and
a page length that exceeds the paper height.
<P>
<LI>
Copy the file to the printer.
<P>
<LI>
Measure the distance from the left edge of the paper to the left edge of the
text.
<P>
<LI>
Measure the distance from the right edge of the paper to the right edge of the
text.
<P>
<LI>
Measure the distance from the top of the paper to the first line of text.
<P>
<LI>
Measure the distance from the bottom of the paper to the last line of text.
</OL>
<P>
To determine the unprintable region:
<OL>
<LI>
Convert the four values obtained above into master units.
<P>
<LI>
Enter these values in the unprintable-region controls.
</OL>
<P>
After your minidriver is installed, test the accuracy of the values that you
entered in the Unprintable Regions boxes. To do this, use PRNTTEST.EXE, which
is included in the Printer Compatibility Test Suite, and run the printable
region test. The other method requires a Windows graphics or desktop
publishing package as follows:
<OL>
<LI>
Open a Windows graphics or desktop publishing application that renders
straight lines around the entire length and width of the page.
<P>
<LI>
Render four lines: two horizontal lines and two vertical lines as follows:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>
Top horizontal line one inch below the top of the page
<P>
<LI>
Bottom horizontal line one inch above the bottom of the page
<P>
<LI>
Left vertical line one inch from the left edge of the page
<P>
<LI>
Right vertical line one inch from the right edge of the page
</UL>
<P>
<LI>
Print the page.
<P>
<LI>
Examine the intersections of the vertical and horizontal lines.
</OL>
<P>
The lines in the upper-left corner must intersect one inch below the top of
the page and one inch from the left edge of the page. If not, adjust the
cursor origin. For example, if the horizontal line at the top of the page is
1.125 inches from the top, and the horizontal line at the bottom of the page
is .875 inches from the bottom, increment the Y cursor origin by .125 inches.
<P>
<B>Note</B>&nbsp; If the cursor origin is set in the Paper Sizes dialog box, check
the MD_USE_CURSOR_ORIG box in the fGeneral dialog box of the ModelData dialog
box.)
<P>
Diconix 150 Plus: The hardware limits the printable page width to 6.875
inches. Set the left, right, top, and bottom unprintable regions to 0. The
size of the unprintable top and bottom margins can vary depending on the paper
source. The sizes of the unprintable top and bottom regions are expressed in
the paper-source data structure.
<P>
Because this limit is imposed by the printer model, not by the paper size,
list the Page Size Limit (width) in the ModelData data structure and not in
the PAPERSIZE data structure. (This same limit applies to any paper size and
is not specific to letter-sized paper.)
<P>
HP LaserJet IIP: The hardware limits the printable-page width to 8.047 inches.
This means that the left and right unprintable regions on this printer measure
((8.5 <FONT FACE="Symbol">&#45;</FONT> 8.047)/2) inches or .2267 inches.
Converted to horizontal-master units, this value is expressed as (.21875 *
300) or 68. Enter 68 in the Left and Right boxes of the Unprintable Regions
control.
<P>
The printer hardware also limits the printable page height to 10.995 inches.
This means that the top and bottom unprintable regions on this printer measure
((11 <FONT FACE="Symbol">&#45;</FONT> 10.5)/2) inches or .25 inches. Converted
to vertical master units, this value is expressed as (.25 * 300) or 75. Enter
75 in the Top and Bottom boxes of the Unprintable Regions control.
<H4>Cursor Origin</H4>
<P>
(Not currently supported; values should be set to zero.)
<H4>Vector Offset</H4>
<P>
(Not currently supported; values should be set to zero.)
<H4>Page Protection</H4>
<P>
The Page Protection commands enable or disable page protection. The KB
Required box specifies the amount of memory, in kilobytes, to allocate for
page protection when protection is enabled.
<P>
Diconix 150 Plus: Does not support page protection. The Enable and Disable
boxes are empty, and the KB Required box contains zero.
<P>
HP LaserJet IIP: Same as Diconix 150 Plus.
