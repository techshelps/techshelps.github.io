<P>
Microsoft&reg;  Windows NT&reg; provides a robust graphics architecture in
which third party graphics hardware companies can easily integrate their video
displays and printing devices. This book provides design guidelines for
writing effective graphics drivers. It is broken down as follows:
<UL>
<LI>
<B>Part 1: Graphics Drivers</B>
<P>
This section describes the Windows NT graphics architecture, and the Graphics
Driver Interface (GDI) and Device Driver Interface (DDI). Design and
implementation details that are common to both display and printing drivers
are then discussed.
<P>
<LI>
<B>Part 2: Display and Video Drivers</B>
<P>
Part 2 describes the video display environment in Windows NT, and provides
design and implementation details for display and video miniport driver
writers.
<P>
<LI>
<B>Part 3: Printer Drivers</B>
<P>
Part 3 describes the Windows NT printing environment, and provides design and
implementation details for printer driver and/or minidriver writers. Design
guidelines are also provided for third-party vendors who need to write their
own print monitors.
</UL>
<P>
The <A HREF="glossary.htm">glossary</A>&nbsp;found at the end of this book helps
define terms and acronyms specific to the graphics subsystem and driver
design.
<P>
Graphics driver function references are found in the <I>Windows NT Graphics
Driver Reference.</I>&nbsp;For more information on the design of kernel-mode
drivers, see the <I>Windows NT Kernel-mode Driver Design Guide</I>.
<H3>Windows NT Graphics Architecture</H3>
<P>
The Windows NT operating system provides graphics support as a part of its
executive services. The graphics system architecture, from application to
driver output, is shown in Figure 1.1. The printing path shown in this figure
is the most common of many ways to print. Note that the spooler runs in user
mode as a separate process.

Microsoft&reg; Win32&reg; application writers request graphics and print
operations by calling the system-supplied Win32 GDI and WinSpool functions.
The Win32 APIs allow application developers to implement device-independent
code, and are described in the Win32 SDK.
<P>
The Win32 subsystem routes graphics requests to the graphics engine by way of
the NT executive system services. The graphics engine, also known as GDI,
processes these requests in conjunction with the hardware-specific display or
printer driver. GDI communicates with these drivers through a set of functions
called the DDI. Graphics hardware vendors write drivers specific to their
display or printer hardware by implementing some or all of the DDI. GDI is
system-supplied, and cannot be replaced.
<P>
A display driver is paired with a video miniport driver to complete video
display support. Each video miniport driver provides hardware-level support
for its associated display driver. Video miniport driver writers implement the
video miniport driver interface described in Part 2 of this book.
<P>
The Windows NT spooler enables print jobs to be routed to local and network
printers. It is sometimes referred to as the <I>print subsystem</I>&nbsp;since it
is comprised of numerous components. Along with printer drivers and
minidrivers, printer IHVs can develop their own print processor and/or
monitors. See Part 3 of this book for more details.
