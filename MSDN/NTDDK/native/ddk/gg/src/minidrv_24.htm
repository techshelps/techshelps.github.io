<P>
The DDK includes several groups of tests from the Microsoft Hardware
Compatibility Test (HCT) Suite. These tests are found in the <I>\hct</I>
directory of the DDK CD-ROM. They can be installed by running <I>setup.exe</I>
in that directory.
<P>
<B>Setup</B>&nbsp;installs the HCT testing shell and, optionally, several groups of
tests that will exercise the system while loading your driver to help you
uncover problem areas.
<P>
Many of the HCT tests are documented in the <I>Programmer’s Guide</I>&nbsp;topic of
the DDK Help online documentation. A readme file in the <I>\hct </I>directory
provides additional details about disk and hardware requirements, as well as
more information on <B>Setup</B>&nbsp;and <B>Install</B>.
<P>
<B>Note</B>&nbsp; You should use the -ddk switch when using <B>Setup</B>&nbsp;to install
the HCT tests. These tests should first be run using the checked build to aid
driver debugging. They should be run again for final verification on the free
build.
<P>
Microsoft Compatibility Labs (MCL) uses a superset of these tests to certify
Windows NT-compliant drivers. Passing the included DDK HCT tests is a positive
sign that your driver is stabilizing and nearly ready for certification.
