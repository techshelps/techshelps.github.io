<P>
The driver exports only two functions to GDI: <B><A HREF="grfncs_19.htm">DrvEnableDriver</A></B>
and <B><A HREF="grfncs_14.htm">DrvDisableDriver</A></B>. All other
driver-supported functions are exposed to GDI through an array of pointers. A
GDI call to <B>DrvEnableDriver</B>&nbsp;initializes the driver and passes back this
list of driver-supported DDI functions. While there are some functions a
driver must support, GDI will handle those operations not included in the
function list received from the driver’s <B>DrvEnableDriver</B>&nbsp;routine. GDI
calls <B>DrvDisableDriver</B>&nbsp;when the driver is to be unloaded. DDI functions
are discussed in depth in <A HREF="ddioview.htm">Supporting the
DDI</A>.
<P>
GDI makes a large number of services available to the driver. These services
fall into two categories: user objects and service routines.
