<P>
The VGA is the standard video adapter card for <I>x</I>86-based computers.
This hardware can operate in both text and graphics modes. A number of
accelerators, such as the S3, are built on top of VGA-compatible hardware.
There are three sample VGA display drivers: VGA, VGA64K, and VGA256.
<P>
The VGA display driver is the standard VGA 16-color driver, supporting any
resolution up to 2K pixels across and any number of vertical scanlines. The
VGA256 sample driver is designed for 256-color VGA. Both the VGA and the
VGA256 use optimized assembly code to implement accelerations. The VGA256
driver does screen-to-screen scrolls, solid and pattern fills, and text with
fast assembly language, using the VGA hardware for acceleration wherever
possible. The VGA64K and VGA256 drivers are banked frame buffer drivers. Most
other functions are punted to GDI one bank at a time. A driver built on
VGA-compatible hardware could be derived from the VGA256 driver by hooking and
implementing the appropriate functionality.
