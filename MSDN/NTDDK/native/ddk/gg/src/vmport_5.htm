<P>
Miniport drivers that are set up to configure themselves in the registry with <B>VgaCompatible</B>
set to zero (FALSE) have the following features:
<UL>
<LI>
Such a miniport driver provides no special support for full-screen MS-DOS
applications in x86-based machines. Instead, it is loaded along with a
system-supplied VGA (or, possibly, with a VGA-compatible SVGA) miniport
driver, which provides this support for full-screen MS-DOS applications.
<P>
<LI>
In most cases, such a miniport driver either is written for an adapter that
has no VGA compatibility mode or for an accelerator that works independently
of the VGA.
</UL>
<P>
If a new miniport driver cannot provide support for an existing display driver
a corresponding display driver must be written together with the new miniport
driver.
