The DDK includes sample source code for many Windows NT drivers that you can
use as a base for your own driver development. Choose the driver that most
closely matches your device and spend some time analyzing and experimenting
with it. The Win32 SDK provides many tools, including a customizable text
editor, that you can use to modify sample code, as well as to write your own
drivers from scratch. See the Win32 SDK documentation for more details on the
text editor and other development tools.
