<P>
As in line drawing, pixels for filling are considered to be at integer
coordinates. Each scan line in a region is bordered on the left and right by a
segment of the path. Pixels that fall between the left and right borders are
considered inside the fill region. Pixels that are exactly on the left border
are also inside, but those exactly on the right border are excluded. If a top
border is exactly horizontal, any pixels exactly on the border are inside
while pixels exactly on the lower border are excluded.
<P>
Figure 3.4 shows how the pixels included in the fill region are determined
relative to left and right borders of the region. Stated mathematically, the
region is considered to be “closed” on the left and top, and “open” on the
right and bottom.

The convention described above for the x-axis of the fill region also applies
to the y-axis by substituting the left border with the top border and the
right border with the bottom border.
