<P>
To understand graphics driver design, it is important to understand the roles
of GDI and the driver, and how they negotiate. GDI, with its enhanced
capabilities, can handle many operations that previously required a graphics
driver. GDI also has the responsibility of managing data structures critical
to graphics operations, such as surfaces, although each graphics driver must
have access to them.
