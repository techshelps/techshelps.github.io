<P>
Depending on how a driver is implemented and on the features of the underlying
adapter, other DDI functions can be required. For example, if a driver manages
its own surface (using <B><A HREF="grfncs_72.htm">EngCreateDeviceSurface</A></B>
to get a handle to the surface), that driver must also, at a minimum, support
the following drawing functions:
<UL>
<LI>
<B><A HREF="grfncs_9.htm">DrvCopyBits</A></B>&nbsp;
<P>
<LI>
<B><A HREF="grfncs_59.htm">DrvTextOut</A></B>&nbsp;
<P>
<LI>
<B><A HREF="grfncs_56.htm">DrvStrokePath</A></B>&nbsp;
<P>
<LI>
<B><A HREF="grfncs_34.htm">DrvPaint</A></B>&nbsp;
</UL>
<P>
Drivers that write to standard format DIBs usually allow GDI to manage most or
all of these operations. Displays that support settable palettes must support
the <B><A HREF="grfncs_48.htm">DrvSetPalette</A></B>&nbsp;function. The list of
conditionally required functions for all graphics drivers is in <A HREF="ddioview_3.htm">Conditionally
Required Graphics Driver Functions</A>.
<P>
Some display drivers manage fonts, although it is more common for a printer
driver to do so. A display driver is not required to handle fonts unless it
must draw its own fonts or those of the video hardware on a device-managed
surface. If the hardware has a resident font, the display driver must supply
information to GDI about this font. This information includes font metrics,
mappings from Unicode to individual glyph identities, individual glyph
attributes, and kerning tables. Therefore, if your display driver supplies
fonts, it must support the DDI entry points in <A HREF="ddioview_3.htm">Conditionally
Required Graphics Driver Functions</A>&nbsp;that support fonts.
