<P>
The CPSUI is a system-supplied module that manages all aspects of a property
sheet for an application, including the addition of driver-defined pages.
Specifically, the CPSUI is responsible for creating and destroying an
application’s property sheet pages plus any device-specific pages that an
application might request. The CPSUI is also responsible for the display and
update of all dialog boxes that define a page.
<P>
<A NAME="DDK_CTT_GG"></A><B>CTT (character translation table)</B>
<P>
Used in Windows NT miniprint drivers and translated in Windows NT to RLE
files.
<P>
<A NAME="DDK_DDB_GG"></A><B>DDB (device dependent bitmap)</B>
<P>
A data structure describing a bit image, specifying width and height of a
rectangular region in pixels, the width of the array that maps entries from
the device palette to pixels, and the device’s color format in terms of color
planes and bits per pixel.
<P>
<A NAME="DDK_DDI_GG"></A><B>DDI (device driver interface)</B>
<P>
A set of functions implemented by graphics drivers and used by GDI to
communicate with the drivers.
<P>
<A NAME="DDK_despooling_GG"></A><B>despooling</B>
<P>
The conversion of spooled device-independent records into device-specific
records.
<P>
<A NAME="DDK_DIB_GG"></A><B>DIB (device independent bitmap)</B>
<P>
Information on the bitmap is stored in a data structure containing information
such as color format, resolution and color palette for the device on which the
image appears, an array of bits that maps RGB triplets to pixels, and a
data-compression identifier which indicates which if any data compression
scheme was used to reduce the size of the array of bits. A GDI bitmap that can
be rendered accurately on different devices because it contains a color table
that can be read by the rendering device driver. These are standard format
bitmaps created and supported by GDI through <B>EngCreateBitmap</B>.
<P>
<A NAME="DDK_dithering_GG"></A><B>dithering</B>
<P>
A technique used to create the illusion of varying shades of gray on a
monochrome display or printer, or additional colors on a color display or
printer. Dithering relies on treating areas of an image as groups of dots that
are colored in different patterns. Similar to halftones in photography.
<P>
<A NAME="DDK_EMF_GG"></A><B>EMF (enhanced metafiles)</B>
<P>
EMFs are one type of spool file used the Windows NT print spooler. These spool
files reduce the time spent between when the application makes a print request
and when control is returned back to it. This is possible because the GDI
functions calls that produce the application’s graphics object are stored
directly in the EMF. The time-consuming execution of these stored GDI
functions is carried out later, in the background, when the spool file is
played back.
<P>
EMF spool files also promote printer device independence. For example, a
picture measuring 2 inches by 4 inches on a VGA display and stored in an EMF
maintains these original dimensions regardless of the DPI of the printer on
which it is printed.
<P>
<A NAME="DDK_GCAPS_GG"></A><B>GCAPS (graphics capabilities bits)</B>
<P>
A driver specifies its graphics capabilities by setting GCAPS flags in the <B>flGraphicsCaps</B>
member of the <A HREF="grstrcts_6.htm">DEVINFO</A>&nbsp;structure. GDI obtains the
GCAPS when it calls the driver’s <B><A HREF="grfncs_20.htm">DrvEnablePDEV</A></B>
routine.
<P>
<A NAME="DDK_GDI_GG"></A><B>GDI (graphics device interface)</B>
<P>
GDI is split into two pieces. Win32 GDI is a user mode API used by Win32
applications that require graphics support. Kernel-mode GDI interfaces
directly with kernel-mode graphics drivers, as well as the window
manager.Kernel-mode GDI exports several services and functions that can be
called by device drivers to perform a host of drawing and graphics-related
operations. This eliminates the need for graphics drivers to implement much of
the required graphics functionality.
<P>
The Win32 GDI library that is directly assessable to Win32 applications can be
found in <I>GDI32.DLL</I>. It fields calls to the functions listed in <I>wingdi.h</I>
and passes the application-supplied information to kernel-mode GDI by way of
NT’s executive system services. The kernel-mode GDI library is found in <I>WIN32K.SYS</I>.
Kernel-mode GDI communicates with a graphics driver by calling the driver’s
implementations of the DDI functions listed in <I>winddi.h</I>.
<P>
<A NAME="DDK_Glyph_GG"></A><B>Glyph</B>
<P>
The actual shape (bit pattern, outline, etc.) of a character image. For
example, an italic ‘a’ and a roman ‘a’ are two different glyphs representing
the same underlying character. In this usage, “glyph” is a synonym for
“character image” or simply “image.”
<P>
<A NAME="DDK_GPC_GG"></A><B>GPC (generic printer characterization)</B>
<P>
Data files for the RasDD printer driver.
<P>
<A NAME="DDK_Graphics_Engine_GG"></A><B>Graphics Engine</B>
<P>

<P>
<A NAME="DDK_HAL_GG"></A><B>HAL (hardware abstraction layer)</B>
<P>
A Windows NT executive component providing platform-specific support for the
Windows NT Kernel, I/O Manager, kernel-mode debuggers, and lowest-level device
drivers. The HAL exports routines that abstract platform-specific hardware
details about caches, I/O buses, interrupts, and so forth, and provides an
interface between the platform’s hardware and the system software. For
example, the HAL implements a routine to map each device driver’s bus-relative
device interrupt vector to a system-assigned vector with a corresponding
platform-specific hardware priority (DIRQL), as well as several routines that
provide DMA-transfer support.
<P>
The DirectDraw HAL is the hardware-specific code of a display driver that
provides DirectDraw support.

<P>
<A NAME="DDK_IRP_GG"></A><B>IRP (I/O request packet)</B>
<P>
An IRP is the basic I/O Manager structure used to communicate with drivers and
to allow drivers to communicate with each other. A packet consists of two
different parts:
<P>
1. Header, or fixed part of the packet <FONT FACE="Symbol">&#190;</FONT> Used
by the I/O Manager to store information about the original request, such as
the caller’s parameters and the address of the device object upon which the
file is open. It is also used by drivers for storing information such as the
final status of the request. See also <I>I/O status block</I>&nbsp;and <I>device
object</I>.
<P>
2. I/O stack locations <FONT FACE="Symbol">&#190;</FONT> Following the header
is a set of I/O stack locations, one per driver in the chain of layered
drivers for which the request is bound. Each stack location contains the
parameters, function codes, and context used by the corresponding driver to
determine what it is supposed to be doing.
<P>
<A NAME="DDK_kernel_mode_GG"></A><B>kernel mode</B>

<A NAME="DDK_PDEV_GG"></A><B>PDEV</B>
<P>
A logical representation of a phyiscal device. A PDEV is private to a driver
and contains all the information and data that represents the associated
physical device. As part of enabling a PDEV, a driver provides information to
GDI that describes the requested device and its capabilities. Important
information that the driver gives GDI is a set of flags that allow GDI to
determine what kinds of operations the PDEV (and the requested device)
supports. For example, GDI can test the flags returned as part of the PDEV to
determine whether or not the requested device can handle Bezier curves and
geometric wide lines.
<P>

<P>
<A NAME="DDK_RIFF_GG"></A><B>RIFF (resource interchange file format)</B>
<P>
A tagged-file specification used to define standard formats for multimedia
files. Tagged-file structure helps prevent compatibility problems that often
occur when file-format definitions change over time. Because each piece of
data in the file is identified by a standard header, an application that does
not recognize a given data element can skip over the unknown information.
<P>
<A NAME="DDK_RLE_bitmaps_GG"></A><B>RLE bitmaps (run-length encoded bitmaps)</B>
<P>

format bitmaps code information at a rate of 1, 4, 8, 16, or 32 bits per
pixel.
<P>
<A NAME="DDK_streaming_GG"></A><B>streaming</B>
<P>
The process of transferring information from a storage device, such as a hard
disk or CD-ROM, to a device driver. Rather than transferring all the
information in a single data copy, the information is transferred in smaller
parts over a period of time, typically while the application is performing
other tasks.
<P>
<A NAME="DDK_surface_GG"></A><B>surface</B>
<P>
Drawing and text output require a surface, associated with the requested
device, on which to draw. Such a device surface is a subset of an array of 2
(28)  by 2 (28)  pixels. These pixels are addressed by pairs of 28-bit signed
numbers; the upper leftmost pixel of the device surface is given the
coordinates (0,0). The device surface lies in the lower right quadrant of this
coordinate space, where both coordinates are nonnegative. A surface is
associated with a particular PDEV.
<P>
<A NAME="DDK_tagged_file_format_GG"></A><B>tagged file format</B>
