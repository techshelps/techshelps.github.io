<P>
GDI offers improved definitions of lines and curves. Lines are not required to
have integer endpoints in DEVICE coordinates, as was true for Windows 3.x.
This allows the driver to transform graphics objects without gross rounding.
The fundamental curve in GDI is a Bezier curve (cubic spline) rather than an
ellipse. All GDI internal operations are handled with Bezier curves, which are
supported by most high-end devices. For devices that do not handle Bezier
curves, GDI breaks curves down into line segments before calling the driver to
draw them.
<P>
GDI can download regions to be filled in the form of paths, as well as
rectangles. Drivers can decompose paths into trapezoids or spans for filling.
