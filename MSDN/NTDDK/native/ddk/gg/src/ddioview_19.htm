<P>
To a graphics driver, a clip region is a series of rectangles that can be
filled by painting with a brush. A driver must support the <B><A HREF="grfncs_34.htm">DrvPaint</A></B>
function if the driver performs any drawing on a device-managed surface. When
GDI calls <B>DrvPaint</B>, it passes a <A HREF="grstrcts_4.htm">CLIPOBJ</A>
structure to define the region. The <I>iDComplexity</I>&nbsp;member of the
structure classifies the painting operation as one of the following:
<UL>
<LI>
Rectangular<FONT FACE="Symbol">&#190;</FONT>A single rectangle is painted.
<P>
<LI>
Complex<FONT FACE="Symbol">&#190;</FONT>A set of rectangles is painted.
</UL>
<P>
<B>DrvPaint</B>&nbsp;performs the specified operation on the region indicated. If a
complex region has been specified, the driver must first call the GDI service
functions <B><A HREF="grfncs_4.htm">CLIPOBJ_cEnumStart</A></B>&nbsp;and <B><A HREF="grfncs_3.htm">CLIPOBJ_bEnum</A></B>
to enumerate the rectangles that make up the region. It specifies, in the
call, the type of shape it supports.

<B>Note</B>&nbsp; Vector drivers can implement this function using <B><A HREF="grfncs_75.htm">EngCreatePath</A></B>
and the <A HREF="grstrcts_27.htm">PATHOBJ</A>&nbsp;functions to create the hatch
patterns for filling.

As indicated in Figure 3.5, the painting boundary conventions for a rectangle
are similar to those for a path. The area consists of interior pixels bounded
by the pixels of four lines. Two of the lines are horizontal, one designated
as the top scan line and the other as the bottom scan line. The top scan line
is the first line of the rectangle. The pixels of each scan line down to
bottom one are included in the rectangle, but the pixels of the bottom line
itself are excluded.
<P>
The two side lines of the rectangle must also be specified to completely
define the shape. Pixels that fall between the left and right sides are
included. Those that are exactly on the left side are also included, but those
exactly on the right side are excluded.

<B>DrvPaint</B>&nbsp;paints the area specified by the CLIPOBJ onto the surface. <B>DrvPaint</B>
uses the pointer <I>pbo</I>, to indicate the <A HREF="grstrcts_1.htm">BRUSHOBJ</A>
that defines the pattern and colors to fill the area.
