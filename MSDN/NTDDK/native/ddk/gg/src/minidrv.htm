<P>
A printer minidriver is an executable data file that the raster printer device
driver (RasDD) uses to print to a raster printing device. This <A HREF="glossary.htm#DDK_GPC_GG">GPC</A>
file describes the capabilities, commands, and resident fonts of a printer or
class of printers.
<P>
RasDD is the Windows NT system-supplied device driver that, with a minidriver,
provides printer support for raster printing devices. RasDD uses a GDI
standard bitmap, allowing GDI to handle most of the rendering. So, instead of
implementing all the <B>Drv<I>Xxx</I></B>&nbsp;functions that GDI requires, a
driver writer need only create a minidriver that provides information about
the printer. This greatly simplies the task of developing a Windows NT raster
printer driver.
<P>
Other reasons for using minidrivers include:
<UL>
<LI>
They achieve portability across CPU types.
<P>
<LI>
They provide improvements to the minidriver and printer driver software.
<P>
<LI>
They receive updates and changes to the graphics engine.
<P>
<LI>
They obtain high quality color rendering and halftoning.
<P>
<LI>
They support 1, 4, and 8 bits-per-pixel color.
</UL>
<P>
This chapter provides design guidelines for those vendors who need to develop
their own raster device drivers. For those vendors who need only develop a
minidriver, this chapter provides a detailed description on how to use
Unitool.
