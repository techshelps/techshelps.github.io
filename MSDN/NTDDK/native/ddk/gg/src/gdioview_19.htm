GDI exports many service routines that can simplify driver design. The driver
can call these routines directly. The names of routines that are general
graphics engine services start with <B><I>Eng</I></B>. Service routines
related to a particular object always start with the name of the object; for
example, <B>CLIPOBJ_cEnumStart</B>&nbsp;is a CLIPOBJ service.

<DT>
&nbsp;
<DD>
<B>Note</B>&nbsp; The service routines in which the first argument is a pointer to
a user object are methods on that user object, and are called using the usual
C++ conventions. Therefore, drivers written in C++ can access the service
routines as methods.

<A HREF="ddioview.htm">Supporting the DDI</A>&nbsp;describes the DDI entry
points and also explains where many of these service routines can be used to
help the driver implement the entry points. For detailed descriptions of each
of the service functions, see the <I>Graphics Driver Reference</I>.
