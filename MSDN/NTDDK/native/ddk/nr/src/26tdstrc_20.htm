<P>
TDI_CONNECTION_INFO defines the structure of the information returned for a
TDI_QUERY_INFORMATION request in which the <B>IrpSp-&gt;Parameters.QueryType</B>
is set to TDI_QUERY_CONNECTION_INFO.
<H3>Members</H3>
<DL>
<DT>
<B>State</B>
<DD>
Specifies the current state of the connection on the network. 
<BR>
<DT>
<B>Event</B>
<DD>
Specifies the type of event the TDI driver most recently indicated to the
client. The value is expressed as a TDI_EVENT_<I>XXX</I>&nbsp;code. 
<BR>
<DT>
<B>TransmittedTsdus</B>
<DD>
Specifies the number of TSDUs transmitted on the connection endpoint.
<BR>
<DT>
<B>ReceivedTsdus</B>
<DD>
Specifies the number of TSDUs received on the connection endpoint.
<BR>
<DT>
<B>TransmissionErrors</B>
<DD>
Specifies the number of TSDUs that have had an error during transmission on
the connection endpoint.
<BR>
<DT>
<B>ReceiveErrors</B>
<DD>
Specifies the number of TSDUs that have had an error during reception on the
connection endpoint.
<BR>
<DT>
<B>Throughput</B>
<DD>
Specifies the estimated throughput on the connection, expressed in bytes per
second, for sends and receives. Zero indicates that the driver cannot
calculate the throughput.
<BR>
<DT>
<B>Delay</B>
<DD>
Specifies the estimated delay on the connection, expressed as a negative
value. Delay, which is essentially constant regardless of packet size, affects
the transmission time of each TSDU sent to the remote node.
<BR>
<DT>
<B>SendBufferSize</B>
<DD>
If the transport buffers sends internally, specifies the size in bytes of its
send buffer. Otherwise, this member is zero.
<BR>
<DT>
<B>ReceiveBufferSize</B>
<DD>
If the transport buffers receives internally, specifies the size in bytes of
its receive buffer. Otherwise, this member is zero.
<BR>
<DT>
<B>Unreliable</B>
<DD>
Specifies TRUE if the transport determines that the connection has become
unreliable. The transport is likely to send a disconnection event to its
client if this member is TRUE, and sends or receives on this connection are
likely to fail.

<H3>Comments</H3>
<P>
A kernel-mode client that has opened a file object representing a connection
with <B>ZwCreateFile</B>&nbsp;can make a query to determine the current state of
its local connection. Such a client sets up an IRP with <B>TdiBuildQueryInformation</B>,
passing in the <I>QType</I>&nbsp;TDI_QUERY_CONNECTION_INFO, and submits the IRP to
the underlying transport to get this information. 
<P>
TDI_CONNECTION_INFO defines the format in which the transport returns the
requested information for such a query. 
<P>
Until a client has established an endpoint-to-endpoint connection with a
remote-node peer, only a subset of this information is potentially useful to
the client, such as the <B>SendBufferSize</B>&nbsp;and <B>ReceiveBufferSize</B>&nbsp;of
an underlying transport that supports internal buffering. A TDI transport can
simply return its default or initialization values for members that are not
yet relevant or even fail the query-information request if an
endpoint-to-endpoint connection is not yet established. 
<P>
Consequently, kernel-mode clients usually submit this request to their
transports after making an endpoint-to-endpoint connection with a remote-node
peer. For example, the client can estimate the transmission time for sends
over the network using the <B>Delay</B>&nbsp;and <B>Throughput</B>&nbsp;values returned
for this query, assuming the underlying transport does not return a zero for
either. The estimated time to transmit a TSDU of size <I>n</I>&nbsp;bytes can be
calculated as <I>SendTime</I>&nbsp;= <B>Delay</B>&nbsp;+ (<I>n</I>&nbsp;* <B>Throughput</B>).
