<P>
While the NDIS V4.0 library will continue to support NDIS V3.0 full-NIC
drivers for legacy netcards, only NDIS miniport drivers can take advantage of
the enhanced functionality and performance characteristics of NDIS V4.0 for
their NICs. Only NDIS miniport drivers can take advantage of the enhancements
and functionality planned for future versions of the NDIS library. 
<P>
Moreover, NDIS miniport drivers are essentially source-compatible across
Microsoft operating systems that support Win32&reg; while NDIS V3.0 full-NIC
drivers are not. Except for minor differences in installation scripts and
recompilation for the growing number of Windows NT platforms, an NDIS miniport
driver can run in any Microsoft operating system that supports Win32 and on
any machine with a NIC-compatible I/O bus that such an operating system
controls. 
<P>
The NDIS library handles a lot of work for miniports that full-NIC drivers
must handle for themselves. For example, NDIS maintains state about all
bindings to miniport drivers’ NICs so miniports need not support
binding-specific queries. 
<P>
Turning a legacy full-NIC driver into an NDIS miniport results in a smaller
NIC driver, a more easily debugged and maintained NIC driver, and a more
readily extensible NIC driver as the NDIS library adds functionality and
support for new networks. For example, NDIS V4.0 adds support for full-duplex
sends and receives in miniport drivers running on multiprocessor platforms,
for multipacket sends and receives, and for wireless media types. 
<P>

support for miniports, see also the <I>Network Drivers Design Guide</I>.
