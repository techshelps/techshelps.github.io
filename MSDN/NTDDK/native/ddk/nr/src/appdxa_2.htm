<P>
This describes, in alphabetical order, the system-defined functions that
legacy NDIS V3.0 full-NIC drivers provide. Each See Also section shows the
corresponding Miniport<I>Xxx</I>&nbsp;function, if there is one, as an aid to
revising a full-NIC driver into a miniport that can take advantage of the
enhanced functionality of NDIS V4.0 and of future versions of the NDIS
library. 
<P>
NDIS V3.0 full-NIC driver functions with the prefix Mac have metanames
describing their respective basic functionality. Except for the <B>DriverEntry</B>
function, full-NIC driver functions can have any name the driver writer chose.
For easy debugging, most NDIS V3.0 full-NIC driver writers substituted a
driver-specific prefix for the Mac prefix. 
<P>
The initial entry point of any Windows NT kernel-mode driver has the explict
name <B>DriverEntry</B>&nbsp;in order to be loaded automatically by the system. For
more information about the general requirements for and functionality of
Windows NT <B>DriverEntry</B>&nbsp;routines, see also the <I>Kernel-Mode Driver
Design Guide</I>. 
<H3>Initialization-Only and Pageable Driver Code</H3>
<P>
Windows NT full-NIC drivers mark their <B>DriverEntry</B>&nbsp;functions as
initialization-only code, using the NDIS_INIT_FUNCTION macro.
<P>
Other full-NIC functions that neither acquire spin locks nor are called with
spin locks already held can be marked as pageable code, using the
NDIS_PAGABLE_FUNCTION macro. In general, pageable full-NIC driver functions
include at least the following system-defined functions:
<UL>
<LI>
MacAddAdapter
<P>
<LI>
MacRemoveAdapter
<P>
<LI>
MacUnload
</UL>
<P>
Other pageable functions include any driver internals that only pageable Mac<I>Xxx</I>
functions call. Driver functions that run, even for the shortest possible
interval, at IRQL &gt;= DISPATCH_LEVEL cannot be pageable.
