<P>
Like any other standard Windows NT kernel-mode intermediate driver, a TDI
transport driver can have several Dispatch routines, up to one for each
system-defined IRP_MJ_<I>XXX</I>&nbsp;code that the driver must handle. 
<P>
This describes the set of I/O requests for which every transport driver that
supports the TDI interface must provide one or more TdiDispatch<I>Xxx</I>
routines, and it describes the relevant members of each such IRP input to a
transport driver&#39;s TdiDispatch<I>Xxx</I>&nbsp;routine(s). 
<P>
For more information about the architecture of standard kernel-mode
intermediate drivers and the functionality of their Dispatch routines, see the
<I>Kernel-Mode Driver Design Guide</I>. For more information about the
structure of IRPs, the driver-accessible fields of device and file objects,
and the kernel-mode support routines mentioned here, see the <I>Kernel-Mode
Driver Reference</I>. 
<P>
The following TdiDispatch<I>Xxx</I>&nbsp;routines are described in alphabetic
order. For convenience, this describes a separate TdiDispatch<I>Xxx</I>
routine for each IRP_MJ_<I>XXX</I>&nbsp;that any transport driver must handle in
order to support the TDI interface.
