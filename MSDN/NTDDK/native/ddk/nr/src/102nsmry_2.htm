<P>
NDIS miniport drivers of WAN NICs call the same NDIS library functions that
other NIC miniport drivers call with very few exceptions. See the preceding
summary of <A HREF="102nsmry_1.htm">NDIS
Library Functions Used by Miniport Drivers</A>&nbsp;for a list of the common functions
that WAN and LAN miniports call. 
<P>
However, WAN miniport drivers cannot call the following <B>Ndis</B><I>Xxx</I>&nbsp;functions:<BR>
<B>NdisMIndicateReceive</B><BR>
<B>NdisMIndicateReceiveComplete</B><BR>
<B>NdisMSendComplete</B>
<P>
Instead, WAN miniport drivers call these functions:
<DL>
<DT>
<B><A HREF="103ndisx_143.htm">NdisMWanIndicateReceive</A></B>&nbsp;
<DD>
Notifies NDIS that a packet has been received on a particular link, identified
by the given link-context handle, and on a particular NIC, identified by the
adapter handle, and that the full packet is available to be forwarded to the
appropriate bound protocol driver(s). 
<BR>
<DT>
<B><A HREF="103ndisx_144.htm">NdisMWanIndicateReceiveComplete</A></B>
<DD>
Notifies NDIS that one or more receives on a particular link, identified by
the given link-context handle, and on a particular NIC, identified by the
adapter handle, are complete (that is, the preceding call to <B>NdisMWanIndicateReceive</B>
has returned) so that NDIS can notify the appropriate bound protocol
driver(s).
<BR>
<DT>
<B><A HREF="103ndisx_145.htm">NdisMWanSendComplete</A></B>&nbsp;
<DD>
Returns the packet and final status of a completed send request for which the
driver previously returned NDIS_STATUS_PENDING so that NDIS can return the
completed packet to the appropriate bound protocol driver.
