<P>
Functions and macros described here are in alphabetical order. They include
all macros and functions defined in the master header, <I>ndis.h</I>, or in a
system-supplied filter-library header, <I>_filter.h</I>, that NDIS protocol,
miniport, WAN miniport, and intermediate drivers call. 
<P>
To ensure their portability across Windows NT platforms and binary
compatibility across Microsoft operating systems that support Win32&reg;, NDIS
miniport drivers should call only the functions described here. Such a
miniport might require recompilation for different Windows NT platforms and
separate installation scripts to install its NIC on all Microsoft Win32
platforms but such a device driver is otherwise OS-independent. 
<P>
On the other hand, NDIS intermediate drivers that have both NDIS-defined
upper-edge (Miniport<I>Xxx</I>) and lower-edge (Protocol<I>Xxx)</I>&nbsp;functions
and highest-level NDIS transport protocol drivers usually call additional
driver support routines provided by the operating system. For more information
about Windows NT kernel-mode support routines that can be called by NDIS
intermediate and highest-level protocol drivers, see the <I>Kernel-Mode Driver
Reference</I>. 
<P>
For a summary of the NDIS functions and macros used by protocol, by miniport,
and/or by WAN miniport drivers, respectively, see <A HREF="102nsmry.htm">Chapter
2</A>. 
<P>
For more information about the NDIS functions and macros used only by legacy
full-NIC drivers, see <A HREF="appdxa.htm">Appendix A</A>.
