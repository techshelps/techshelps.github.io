<P>
<B>FddiFilterIndicateReceive</B>&nbsp;is called by a NIC driver to indicate a
received packet to all filter library database bindings associated with an
FDDI address. 
<H3>Parameters</H3>
<DL>
<DT>
<I>Filter</I>
<DD>
Points to a previously created and initialized filter library database.
<BR>
<DT>
<I>MacReceiveContext</I>
<DD>
Specifies a context that the NIC driver associates with a packet received from
the network.
<BR>
<DT>
<I>Address</I>
<DD>
Points to the destination address that the NIC driver has already extracted
from the received packet.
<BR>
<DT>
<I>AddressLength</I>
<DD>
Specifies the length, in bytes, of the destination address.
<BR>
<DT>
<I>HeaderBuffer</I>
<DD>
Points to the virtual address of the virtually contiguous buffer containing
the packet header. The buffer is valid only within the current call to this
function.
<BR>
<DT>
<I>HeaderBufferSize</I>
<DD>
Indicates the length, in bytes, of the packet header.
<BR>
<DT>
<I>LookaheadBuffer</I>
<DD>
Points to the virtual address of the virtually contiguous buffer containing
the first bytes of packet data. The packet buffer is valid only for the
current call to this function.
<BR>
<DT>
<I>LookaheadBufferSize</I>
<DD>
Specifies the size, in bytes, of the lookahead buffer.
<BR>
<DT>
<I>PacketSize</I>
<DD>
Specifies the size, in bytes, of the received packet data. This number has
nothing to do with the lookahead buffer. It indicates the size of the received
packet data so that a protocol driver can call <B>NdisTransferData</B>&nbsp;to
transfer the data in the packet, as necessary. The data length does not
include the packet header length.
</DL>
<H3>Comments</H3>
<P>
Instead of calling <B>NdisIndicateReceive</B>&nbsp;without filtering, the NIC
driver calls <B>FddiFilterIndicateReceive</B>&nbsp;to filter a received packet so
that only the appropriate bindings receive it. <B>FddiFilterIndicateReceive</B>
then calls the ProtocolReceive function for each protocol driver to which the
binding filter applies.
<P>
In its calls to ProtocolReceive, <B>FddiFilterIndicateReceive</B>&nbsp;passes each
protocol driver a pointer to the packet header and a pointer to some or all of
the packet data. The protocol driver can: inspect the header and data in the
packet; optionally copy as much of the header or data as is visible; or
optionally call <B>NdisTransferData</B>&nbsp;to instruct the NIC driver to copy the
data into a protocol-supplied packet.
<P>
Callers of <B>FddiFilterIndicateReceive</B>&nbsp;run at IRQL &lt;= DISPATCH_LEVEL.
