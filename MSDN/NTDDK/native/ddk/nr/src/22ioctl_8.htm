<P>
When a kernel-mode client makes a TDI_QUERY_INFORMATION request, it asks the
underlying TDI transport driver to return information of a client-specified
type, such as a broadcast address, the tranport&#39;s capabilities, or its
current statistics for I/O on a particular connection. 
<H3>IRP</H3>
<P>
The transport calls <B>IoGetCurrentIrpStackLocation</B>&nbsp;with the given <I>Irp</I>
to get a pointer to its own I/O stack location in the IRP, shown in the
following list as <B>IrpSp</B>. IRP members relevant to this request include
the following:
<DL>
<DT>
<B>IoStatus.Status</B>
<DD>
Specifies the final status of the query-information request. The transport
sets this member before it completes the IRP, possibly to one of the
following:
<P>
STATUS_SUCCESS<BR>
STATUS_BUFFER_OVERFLOW<BR>
STATUS_INSUFFICIENT_RESOURCES<BR>
STATUS_INVALID_CONNECTION<BR>
STATUS_INVALID_DEVICE_REQUEST<BR>
STATUS_NOT_IMPLEMENTED
<BR>
<DT>
<B>IoStatus.Information</B>
<DD>
Specifies the number of bytes of information the transport is returning to its
client. 
<BR>
<DT>
<B>IrpSp-&gt;MajorFunction</B>
<DD>
Specifies IRP_MJ_INTERNAL_DEVICE_CONTROL. The transport can ignore this member
if it exports a TdiDispatchInternalDeviceControl routine that handles only
TDI_<I>XXX</I>&nbsp;requests. 
<BR>
<DT>
<B>IrpSp-&gt;MinorFunction</B>
<DD>
Specifies TDI_QUERY_INFORMATION.
<BR>
<DT>
<B>IrpSp-&gt;FileObject</B>
<DD>
Points to an open file object representing an address, connection endpoint, or
control channel. The transport uses the <B>FsContext</B>&nbsp;and, possibly, <B>FsContext2</B>
fields to access the state it maintains about this address, connection
endpoint, or control channel. 
<BR>
<DT>
<B>IrpSp-&gt;Parameters</B>
<DD>
Points to a TDI_REQUEST_KERNEL_QUERY_INFO structure, defined as follows:
<PRE><FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE="2">struct _TDI_REQUEST_KERNEL_QUERY_INFO {<B>&nbsp;</B>
&nbsp; &nbsp; LONG QueryType;<B>&nbsp;</B>
&nbsp; &nbsp; PTDI_CONNECTION_INFORMATION RequestConnectionInformation;<B>&nbsp;</B>
} TDI_REQUEST_KERNEL_QUERY_INFORMATION, *PTDI_REQUEST_KERNEL_QUERY_INFORMATION;<B>&nbsp;</B>
<B>&nbsp;</B></FONT></PRE>
<P>
A transport can ignore the <B>RequestConnectionInformation</B>&nbsp;member; it is
always NULL. The transport checks the <B>QueryType</B>&nbsp;member to determine
what information the client requested, which also determines the format of the
information to be returned and, sometimes the client-supplied contents, of the
buffer mapped at <B>Irp-&gt;MdlAddress</B>. 
<P>
For every TDI transport, <B>QueryType</B>&nbsp;can be set to one of the following
system-defined values: 
<DL>
<DT>
TDI_QUERY_ADDRESS_INFO
<DD>
Requests the transport to return information about a particular local-node
address, formatted as a TDI_ADDRESS_INFO structure, in the client-supplied
buffer mapped at <B>MdlAddress</B>. 
<P>
<B>IrpSp-&gt;FileObject</B>&nbsp;must point to a file object representing the
address or to a connection endpoint already associated with the address for
which to return the information. 
<BR>
<DT>
TDI_QUERY_CONNECTION_INFO
<DD>
Requests the transport to return information about a particular connection,
formatted as a TDI_CONNECTION_INFO structure, in the client-supplied buffer
mapped at <B>MdlAddress</B>.  
<P>
<B>IrpSp-&gt;FileObject</B>&nbsp;must point to a file object representing the
connection for which to return the information. 
<BR>
<DT>
TDI_QUERY_BROADCAST_ADDRESS
<DD>
Requests the transport to return a broadcast address, formatted as a
TRANSPORT_ADDRESS structure, in the client-supplied buffer mapped at <B>MdlAddress</B>.
<P>
<B>IrpSp-&gt;FileObject</B>&nbsp;must point to a file object representing a control
channel. 
<BR>
<DT>
TDI_QUERY_NETWORK_ADDRESS
<DD>
Requests the transport to return a local-node address, formatted as a
TRANSPORT_ADDRESS structure, in the client-supplied buffer mapped at <B>MdlAddress</B>.
<P>
<B>IrpSp-&gt;FileObject</B>&nbsp;must point to a file object representing a control
channel.
<BR>
<DT>
TDI_QUERY_DATA_LINK_ADDRESS
<DD>
Requests the transport to return the datalink address, formatted as a
TRANSPORT_ADDRESS structure, in the client-supplied buffer mapped at <B>MdlAddress</B>.
<P>
<B>IrpSp-&gt;FileObject</B>&nbsp;must point to a file object representing a control
channel. 
<BR>
<DT>
TDI_QUERY_PROVIDER_INFO or TDI_QUERY_PROVIDER_INFORMATION
<DD>
Requests the transport to return information about its own capabilities,
formatted as a TDI_PROVIDER_INFO structure, in the client-supplied buffer
mapped at <B>MdlAddress</B>. 
<P>
<B>IrpSp-&gt;FileObject</B>&nbsp;must point to a file object representing a control
channel. 
<BR>
<DT>
TDI_QUERY_PROVIDER_STATISTICS
<DD>
Requests the transport to return information about its resource usage,
formatted as a TDI_PROVIDER_STATISTICS structure, in the client-supplied
buffer mapped at <B>MdlAddress</B>. 
<P>
<B>IrpSp-&gt;FileObject</B>&nbsp;must point to a file object representing a control
channel. 
<BR>
<DT>
TDI_QUERY_DATAGRAM_INFO
<DD>
Requests the transport to return information about its limits on size and
number of datagrams, formatted as a TDI_DATAGRAM_INFO structure, in the
client-supplied buffer mapped at <B>MdlAddress</B>. 
<P>
<B>IrpSp-&gt;FileObject</B>&nbsp;must point to a file object representing a control
channel. A transport also can support this query on open transport addresses
at the discretion of the transport writer. 
<BR>
<DT>
TDI_QUERY_MAX_DATAGRAM_INFO
<DD>
Requests the transport to return information about its limit on datagram size,
formatted as a TDI_MAX_DATAGRAM_INFO structure, in the client-supplied buffer
mapped at <B>MdlAddress</B>. 
<P>
<B>IrpSp-&gt;FileObject</B>&nbsp;must point to a file object representing a control
channel. A transport also can support this query on open transport addresses
at the discretion of the transport writer. 
</DL>
<P>
In addition to the preceding queries, which every TDI transport must support,
a particular transport might support others. For example, NetBIOS transports
also must respond to three additional system-defined TDI_QUERY_<I>XXX</I>, as
described later (see Comments). 
<BR>
<DT>
<B>MdlAddress</B>
<DD>
Points to an MDL, possibly the initial MDL in a chain of MDLs, mapping a
client-supplied buffer containing whatever client-supplied contents are
required to carry out the request. The input contents and format of this
buffer depend on the given <B>QueryType</B>. 
</DL>
<H3>Comments</H3>
<P>
For any NetBIOS transport, <B>QueryType</B>&nbsp;also can specify one of the
following:
<DL>
<DT>
TDI_QUERY_FIND_NAME
<DD>
Requests the NetBIOS transport to return the information, formatted as
FIND_NAME_HEADER followed by FIND_NAME_BUFFER structures, in the
client-supplied buffer mapped at <B>MdlAddress</B>. 
<BR>
<DT>
TDI_QUERY_SESSION_STATUS
<DD>
Requests the transport to return the information, formatted as SESSION_HEADER
followed by SESSION_BUFFER structures, in the client-supplied buffer mapped at
<B>MdlAddress</B>. 
<BR>
<DT>
TDI_QUERY_ADAPTER_STATUS
<DD>
Requests the transport to return the information, formatted as an
ADAPTER_STATUS structure, in the client-supplied buffer mapped at <B>MdlAddress</B>.
<P>
For more information about the preceding NetBIOS-specific structures, see the
Win32 SDK. 
</DL>
<P>
<B>TdiBuildQueryInformation</B>&nbsp;is the macro a client uses to fill in this
IRP.
