<P>
<B>EthFilterIndicateReceive</B>&nbsp;is called by a NIC driver to indicate a
received packet to all filter library database bindings associated with an
Ethernet address. 
<H3>Parameters</H3>
<DL>
<DT>
<I>Filter</I>
<DD>
Points to a previously created and initialized filter library database.
<BR>
<DT>
<I>MacReceiveContext</I>
<DD>
Specifies a context the NIC driver associates with a packet received from the
network.
<BR>
<DT>
<I>Address</I>
<DD>
Points to the destination address the NIC driver has already extracted from
the received packet.
<BR>
<DT>
<I>HeaderBuffer</I>
<DD>
Points to the virtual address of the virtually contiguous buffer containing
the packet header. The buffer is valid only within the current call to this
function.
<BR>
<DT>
<I>HeaderBufferSize</I>
<DD>
Indicates the length, in bytes, of the packet header.
<BR>
<DT>
<I>LookaheadBuffer</I>
<DD>
Points to the virtual address of the virtually contiguous buffer containing
the first bytes of packet data. The packet buffer is valid only for the
current call to this function.
<BR>
<DT>
<I>LookaheadBufferSize</I>
<DD>
Specifies the size, in bytes, of the lookahead buffer.
<BR>
<DT>
<I>PacketSize</I>
<DD>
Specifies the size, in bytes, of the received packet data. This parameter
number is not related to the lookahead buffer, but rather indicates the size
of the received packet data. This allows a protocol driver to call <B>NdisTransferData</B>
and to transfer data in the packet, as necessary. The data length does not
include the packet header length.
</DL>
<H3>Comments</H3>
<P>
Instead of calling <B>NdisIndicateReceive</B>&nbsp;without filtering, the NIC
driver calls <B>EthFilterIndicateReceive</B>&nbsp;to filter a received packet so
only the appropriate bindings receive it. <B>EthFilterIndicateReceive</B>&nbsp;then
calls the ProtocolReceive function of each protocol driver to which the
binding filter applies.
<P>
In its calls to ProtocolReceive, this function passes each protocol driver a
pointer to the packet header as well as a pointer to some or all of the packet
data. The protocol driver can inspect the header and data in the packet,
optionally copy as much of the header or data as is visible, or optionally
call <B>NdisTransferData</B>&nbsp;to instruct the NIC driver to copy the data into
a protocol<FONT FACE="Symbol">&#45;</FONT>supplied packet.
<P>
Callers of <B>EthFilterIndicateReceive</B>&nbsp;run at IRQL &lt;= DISPATCH_LEVEL.
