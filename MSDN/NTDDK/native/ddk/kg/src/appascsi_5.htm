<P>
To find its device(s), the class driver either calls a GetInquiryData routine
or implements the same functionality in its DriverEntry routine. A
GetInquiryData routine allocates an INQUIRY_DATA_SIZE buffer for
SCSI_ADAPTER_BUS_INFO-type data. 
<P>
Next, it allocates an IRP with <B>IoBuildDeviceIoControlRequest</B>, sets the
port driver’s I/O stack location up with the I/O control code
IOCTL_SCSI_GET_INQUIRY_DATA, and passes the IRP on to the SCSI port driver
with <B>IoCallDriver</B>. 
<P>
The class driver uses the <B>InquiryDataOffset</B>&nbsp;in the
SCSI_ADAPTER_BUS_INFO buffer to inspect the SCSI inquiry data and find
device(s) of its type. 
<P>
Like any other kernel-mode driver, a SCSI class driver must set up a device
object to represent each physical, logical, and/or virtual device for which it
handles I/O requests. The class driver also must establish a claim on each of
the physical devices for which it creates a device object with <B>IoCreateDevice</B>.
<P>
Subsequently loaded drivers for the same type of device can determine whether
a particular SCSI peripheral has already been claimed by inspecting the
inquiry data for each HBA and SCSI bus in the machine. A class driver must not
attempt to claim an already claimed device. 
<P>
For more information about the SCSI_ADAPTER_BUS_INFO structure and IOCTLs
supported by the Windows NT SCSI port driver, see the <I>Kernel-Mode</I>&nbsp;<I>Driver
Reference</I>.
