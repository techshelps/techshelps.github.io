As Figure 2.11 shows, the sound device is connected to a system DMA controller
channel. The NT HAL coordinates access to the system’s DMA controller or
controllers and to appropriate DMA channels and/or registers for NT drivers of
all slave DMA devices.

The system sound driver is both a highest-level and lowest-level NT driver
that provides support for user-mode multimedia audio applications. The
Multimedia component of the Win32 subsystem is layered between such an
application and at least four system-supplied Win32 audio drivers: the
wave-input, wave-output, midi-input, and midi-output drivers, which are
implemented as dynamic-link libraries. Depending on its adapter, an NT sound
driver also can provide support for a Win32 Aux driver that responds to
applications’ volume-control requests and/or for a Win32 mixer driver that
supports multimedia mixer applications.
