<P>
At the discretion of the driver designer, any higher-level NT driver can have
as many IoCompletion routines as the driver needs to complete IRPs for various
kinds of operations.
<P>
An IoCompletion routine is run at IRQL &lt;= DISPATCH_LEVEL and in an
arbitrary thread context. A driver writer cannot make assumptions about the
IRQL at which an IoCompletion routine will be called. 
<P>
<B><IMG SRC="../../../wedge.gif" BORDER=0>&nbsp; &nbsp; </B>Consider the following a
design guideline for IoCompletion routines<B>&nbsp;</B>
<P>
Assume that every IoCompletion routine <I>always</I>&nbsp;runs at IRQL
DISPATCH_LEVEL. 
<P>
Running at IRQL DISPATCH_LEVEL restricts the set of support routines an
IoCompletion routine can call. 
<P>
For more information about managing IRQLs in NT drivers, see Chapter 16. For
specific information about the IRQL(s) at which any particular support routine
can be called, see the <I>Kernel-mode Driver Reference</I>.
