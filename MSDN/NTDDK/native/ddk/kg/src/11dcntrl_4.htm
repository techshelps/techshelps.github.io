<P>
If it has an AdapterControl routine, an NT device driver must provide resident
storage for the following:
<UL>
<LI>
Context information to be used in its DMA operations
<P>
<LI>
An <I>AdapterObject</I>&nbsp;pointer returned by <B>HalGetAdapter</B>
<P>
<LI>
A ULONG-type variable to hold the system-determined maximum <I>NumberOfMapRegisters</I>
available for any given DMA transfer request
</UL>
<P>
The driver can provide the necessary storage in a device extension, in a
controller extension, or in nonpaged pool allocated by the driver.
<P>
If it has a ControllerControl routine, an NT device driver must provide
resident storage for the following:
<UL>
<LI>
A <I>ControllerObject</I>&nbsp;pointer returned by <B>IoCreateController</B>
</UL>
<P>
Any NT device driver can provide the necessary storage in a device extension
or in nonpaged pool allocated by the driver. Usually, NT drivers that use
controller objects store the <I>ControllerObject</I>&nbsp;pointer in the device
extension of each device object that represents a physical or logical device
controlled by the hardware represented by the controller object.
<P>
The driver writer determines the size and internal structure of the <I>ControllerObject</I><B>-&gt;ControllerExtension</B>.
<P>
A controller object, which cannot be given a name, cannot be the target of an
I/O request. The hardware it represents usually controls a set of homogeneous
devices that are the actual targets of I/O requests.
