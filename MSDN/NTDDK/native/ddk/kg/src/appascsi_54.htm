<P>
On entry, a HwScsiInterrupt routine should determine if its HBA actually
generated an interrupt. HwScsiInterrupt must return FALSE as soon as possible
if it detects a spurious interrupt so the ISR for the device that actually
generated the interrupt can be called quickly. 
<P>
Otherwise, a miniport’s HwScsiInterrupt routine is generally responsible for
completing the I/O operation that caused the interrupt. Depending on the HBA
and the design of the miniport, a HwScsiInterrupt routine does some or all of
the following: 
<UL>
<LI>
Dismisses the interrupt on the HBA (required) 
<P>
<LI>
Notifies (by calling <B>ScsiPortNotification</B>&nbsp;or <B>ScsiPortCompleteRequest</B>)
the port driver if the HBA indicates that certain SCSI error conditions
occurred during the operation and possibly logging the error. 
<P>
For more information about logging errors, see <A HREF="appascsi_60.htm">Section
A.4.11</A>. 
<P>
<LI>
Completes the requested operation that caused the interrupt, such as calling <B>ScsiPortIoMapTransfer</B>
(see <A HREF="appascsi_52.htm">Section
A.4.6</A>) if the interrupt came in from a previously selected target TID and LU
indicating a readiness to transfer data 
</UL>
<P>
When the HwScsiInterrupt routine (or an internal miniport routine) completes
an SRB, it calls <B>ScsiPortNotification</B>&nbsp;twice: 
<OL>
<LI>
First, with the <I>NotificationType</I>&nbsp;<B>RequestComplete</B>&nbsp;and the just
satisfied SRB 
<P>
<LI>
Next, with the <I>NotificationType</I>&nbsp;<B>NextRequest</B>, or with <B>NextLuRequest</B>
if the HBA supports tagged queueing or multiple requests per logical unit 
</OL>
<P>
For better overall system performance, a miniport’s HwScsiInterrupt routine
should do only the minimum necessary to process I/O requests. That is, the
miniport should be designed to return control from the HwScsiInterrupt routine
as quickly as possible. A HwScsiInterrupt routine must not call <B>ScsiPortStallExecution</B>
with large intervals, thereby tying up a processor and preventing other
drivers from servicing their device interrupts.
