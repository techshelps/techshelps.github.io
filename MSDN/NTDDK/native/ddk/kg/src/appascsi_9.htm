<P>
Class driver Dispatch routines for IRP_MJ_CREATE and IRP_MJ_CLOSE requests
usually have no SCSI-specific requirements. Most SCSI class drivers are
intermediate drivers; their Dispatch routines just return STATUS_SUCCESS to
indicate that a given device object exists so that higher-level drivers and,
indirectly, user-mode applications can open the device for I/O and close the
device afterward. 
<P>
A SCSI class driver must have a Dispatch routine for IRP_MJ_SHUTDOWN requests
and possibly for IRP_MJ_FLUSH_BUFFERS requests if its device caches data
internally, if its device might be attached to a bus driven by an HBA that
caches data internally, or if a file system is layered above the class driver.
To maintain data integrity, such a cache should be flushed to the device
before the system is shut down. 
<P>
See also Chapter 6 for more information about general requirements for
Dispatch routines.
