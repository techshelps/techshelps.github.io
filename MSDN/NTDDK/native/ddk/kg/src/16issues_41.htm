<P>
The user-visible name for a particular device can be subsystem-specific, as
mentioned in <A HREF="16issues_32.htm">Section
16.8.1.3</A>. For example, an MS-DOS&reg; or Win32 application’s print job is
likely to be directed to a logical device named LPT1, rather than to the NT
device object name for the parallel port to which a printer is attached.
<P>
A subkey of the <B>CurrentControlSet\Control</B>&nbsp;key,<B>&nbsp;\Session Manager\DOS
Devices</B>, contains subkeys with value entries for the Win32 subsystem’s
logical device names. During system initialization, the Win32 Session Manager
sets up symbolic link objects in the NT object namespace <B>\??</B>&nbsp;(formerly <B>\DosDevices</B>),
using the registry’s <B>\Session Manager\DOS Devices</B>&nbsp;subkeys. Each
symbolic link object creates an alias between a Win32-visible name and the
corresponding NT device object name, so that applications and/or end users can
use the Win32-visible name to send I/O requests to the underlying device.
<P>
Windows NT supplies a default set of Win32 logical names for standard MS-DOS
and Windows&reg; devices like LPT1, but the default set cannot include every
possible device that might be present in or added to a Windows NT machine.
Consequently, NT driver writers must set up symbolic link objects in the NT
object namespace <B>\??</B>, in order to make their devices available to Win32
applications and end users for I/O requests. <A HREF="16issues_42.htm">Section
16.9.1</A>, explains how the writer of a new NT device driver can set up the
necessary symbolic link(s).
<P>
As mentioned in <A HREF="16issues_31.htm">Section
16.8.1.2</A>, NT drivers of floppy and CD-ROM devices from which the system itself
can be loaded must set up a symbolic link between the ARC- or NtDetect-created
“hardware” name for the device and the corresponding device object name. <A HREF="16issues_43.htm">Section
16.9.2</A>&nbsp;explains how the writer of a new floppy or CD-ROM device driver can set
up the necessary symbolic link(s).
