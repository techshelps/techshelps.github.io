<P>
Processing any IRP begins in the Dispatch routine that the DriverEntry routine
set up to handle the given major function code (IRP_MJ_<I>XXX</I>), which is
set in the driver’s I/O stack location of each incoming IRP. 
<P>
Most NT drivers’ Dispatch routines are called in an arbitrary thread context
at IRQL PASSIVE_LEVEL, with the following exceptions:
<UL>
<LI>
Any highest-level NT driver’s Dispatch routines are called in the context of
the thread that originated the I/O request, which is commonly a user-mode
application thread.
<P>
In other words, the Dispatch routines of NT file system drivers and other
highest-level NT drivers are called in a nonarbitrary thread context at IRQL
PASSIVE_LEVEL. 
<P>
<LI>
The DispatchRead and/or DispatchWrite routines of mass-storage device drivers
and of NT intermediate drivers layered above them, can be called at IRQL
APC_LEVEL and in an arbitrary thread context. 
<P>
The DispatchRead and/or DispatchWrite and any other routine that also
processes read and/or write requests in such a device or intermediate driver <I>must
be resident at all times</I>. These NT driver routines can neither be pageable
nor be part of a driver’s pageable-image section. 
<P>
For more information about pageable and pageable-image driver routines, see
the <I>Programmer’s Guide</I>. 
</UL>
<P>
The driver writer determines how many Dispatch routines any NT driver has. An
NT driver can have as many Dispatch routines as the IRP_MJ_<I>XXX</I>&nbsp;
function codes the driver handles, as already mentioned in Chapter 4.
