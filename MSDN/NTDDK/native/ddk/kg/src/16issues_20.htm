<P>
Windows NT is designed to be both more robust and more “user-friendly” than
some PC operating systems with respect to runtime errors. That is, the system
is designed to do the following: 
<UL>
<LI>
To continue running without allowing one component (or thread) to corrupt
other components’ code or data when an error occurs 
<P>
<LI>
To continue running without sending a flood of cryptic error messages to end
users whenever errors occur 
</UL>
<P>
Granted that some I/O errors are user-induced. For example, a request to read
data from a file on removable media when the user has supplied the wrong
diskette, tape, or CD-ROM causes a user-induced I/O error. Such an error can
be corrected readily when the user is prompted to supply the appropriate
media, as discussed in <A HREF="16issues_27.htm">Section 16.7</A>.
<P>
Other I/O errors cannot be readily corrected by the majority of end users. For
these kinds of I/O errors, Windows NT continues to run without forcing the
user to become aware of errors that the user cannot fix immediately. Instead,
it provides a system error-logging thread that formats and stores information
about I/O errors as entries in a file. 
<P>
The Win32 event viewer, which reads and displays this error log file, allows
Windows NT users, system administrators, or support technicians to monitor the
condition of the hardware in a given machine and replace failing hardware as
necessary, to tune the configuration of devices in the machine for better
performance, and to debug hardware problems if they occur.
