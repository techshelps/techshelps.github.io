<P>
The required functionality of a particular Dispatch routine varies, depending
on the IRP_MJ_<I>XXX</I>&nbsp; it handles, on the individual driver’s level in a
chain of NT drivers, and on the type of underlying physical device. 
<P>
Basically, most Dispatch routines process incoming IRPs as follows:
<OL>
<LI>
Check the driver’s I/O stack location in the IRP to determine what to do and
check the parameters, if any, for validity. 
<P>
<LI>
Satisfy the request and complete the IRP if possible; otherwise, pass it on
for further processing by lower-level drivers or by other device driver
routines. 
</OL>
<P>
Whether an NT driver must check its I/O stack location to determine what to do
and to check parameters depends on the given IRP_MJ_<I>XXX</I>, as well as on
whether that driver set up a separate Dispatch routine for each IRP_MJ_<I>XXX</I>
&nbsp;that the driver handles.
<P>
Whether an NT driver must pass on an IRP for further processing depends on the
validity of the parameters, if any, as well as on the IRP_MJ_<I>XXX</I>&nbsp; and
on the driver’s level, if any, in a chain of layered drivers.
