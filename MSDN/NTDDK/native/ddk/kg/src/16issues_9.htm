<P>
Many NT drivers use only the memory allocated for their device objects’ device
extensions as their global storage areas and their I/O stack locations in IRPs
as operation-specific local storage areas. However, an NT driver can allocate
additional system-space memory for its needs and can use the kernel stack to
pass small amounts of data in calls to internal driver routines.
