<P>
Assuming its DispatchRead, DispatchWrite, or DispatchDeviceControl routine
determined that a request was valid and called <B>IoStartPacket</B>, a device
driver’s StartIo routine is called to process the packet immediately if the
device is not already busy. If the packet is queued by <B>IoStartPacket</B>,
eventually a call to <B>IoStartNextPacket</B>&nbsp;from the driver’s DpcForIsr or
CustomDpc routine causes the StartIo routine to be called with the dequeued
IRP. 
<P>
The StartIo routine calls <B>IoGetCurrentIrpStackLocation</B>&nbsp;and determines
which operation must be performed to satisfy the request. It preprocesses the
IRP in any way necessary before programming the physical device to carry out
the I/O request. 
<P>
The StartIo routine must call a device driver’s SynchCritSection routine to
perform the necessary device programming if access to the physical device
(and/or the device extension) must be synchronized with that driver’s ISR. For
more information, see <A HREF="07strtio_8.htm">Section
7.2.3</A>.
<P>
An NT device driver that uses buffered I/O either transfers data into (reads)
or from (writes) a system-space buffer, allocated by the I/O Manager, that the
driver finds in each IRP at <B>Irp-&gt;AssociatedIrp.SystemBuffer</B>.
