<A NAME="DDK_Figure_2..22_KG"></A>Figure 2.22 illustrates the device objects that
represent the sound adapter shown previously in <A HREF="02irps_15.htm#DDK_Figure_2..11_KG">Figure
2.11</A>. The sound driver shown in <A HREF="02irps_15.htm#DDK_Figure_2..12_KG">Figure 2.12</A>
creates these device objects by calling an I/O support routine.

<P>
Like the parallel and serial drivers described in <A HREF="02irps_24.htm">Section
2.5.3</A>, the system-supplied sound driver creates a set of logical device
objects: one each for wave-input, wave-output, midi-input, and midi-output
operations. If the driver also supports a Win32 Aux and/or mixer driver, it
creates a device object to represent it.
<P>
An adapter object represents the system DMA controller channel to which the
sound card is connected (as shown in <A HREF="02irps_15.htm#DDK_Figure_2..11_KG">Figure 2.11</A>).
The NT HAL creates as many adapter objects as the system needs to represent
all DMA controller channels or nonSCSI-busmaster adapters in a given machine.
<P>
An adapter object is wholly opaque to drivers: the sound driver must use the
system’s adapter support routines to accomplish its DMA transfers of (for
example) wave data; it cannot access the adapter object by another means.
Consequently, this driver has an AdapterControl routine, as shown previously
in <A HREF="02irps_5.htm#DDK_Figure_2..4_KG">Figure 2.4</A>.
