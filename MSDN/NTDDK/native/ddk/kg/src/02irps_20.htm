<P>
Keep the following points in mind when designing an NT driver:
<UL>
<LI>
The NT SCSI and video port drivers cannot be replaced.
<P>
<LI>
A replacement device driver (lowest-level driver) must implement the same
functionality as the driver it replaces. For example, a replacement keyboard
or mouse port driver must use the system-defined interface between itself and
a system-supplied class driver that it reuses, and vice versa.
<P>
<LI>
A new intermediate driver to be inserted between any pair of system-supplied
drivers must interoperate with those drivers. In other words, such a new
driver must comply with the requirements outlined in the <A HREF="02irps_4.htm">Section
2.2.1</A>&nbsp;and <A HREF="02irps_9.htm">Section
2.3.4</A>.
