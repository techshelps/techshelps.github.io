<P>
Every SCSI miniport driver must have at least the following system-defined
routines: 
<UL>
<LI>
<B>DriverEntry</B>&nbsp;to initialize the miniport driver 
<P>
<LI>
HwScsiFindAdapter to determine how (or whether) driver-supported HBA(s) are
configured in the machine 
<P>
<LI>
HwScsiInitialize to initialize supported HBA(s) 
<P>
<LI>
HwScsiStartIo to start operations on its HBA(s) for incoming requests 
<P>
<LI>
HwScsiResetBus to handle bus-reset requests. 
</UL>
<P>
Depending on each HBA and the driver designer, SCSI miniport drivers also have
some or all of the following system-defined routines: 
<UL>
<LI>
HwScsiInterrupt to handle HBA-generated interrupts, which is optional if and
only if the HBA does not generate interrupts so the miniport manages all I/O
operations on its HBA by polling 
<P>
However, using polling exclusively has an adverse effect on a miniport’s
performance and on its HBA’s I/O throughput. Such a miniport driver should
also have a HwScsiTimer routine. 
<P>
<LI>
HwScsiDisableInterruptsCallback and HwScsiEnableInterruptsCallback to handle
deferred I/O processing if interrupt-driven I/O operations take a long time 
<P>
<LI>
HwScsiTimer to time operations that require long delays on the HBA, or for any
other purpose determined by the driver designer
<P>
A miniport should have a HwScsiTimer routine if it has no HwScsiInterrupt
routine so it can use the HwScsiTimer routine for efficient polling of its
HBA. 
<P>
<LI>
HwScsiDmaStarted, which is required if the HBA uses a system DMA controller,
to set up an HBA transfer after the system DMA controller has been programmed
by the port driver 
<P>
<LI>
HwScsiAdapterState, which is optional if and only if the HBA has no BIOS or
x86-real-mode driver and/or will never run in x86-only Microsoft Windows
systems 
</UL>
<P>
Each of the preceding miniport driver routines, except <B>DriverEntry</B>, has
a name chosen to describe its functionality. Except for <B>DriverEntry</B>,
which is a required name for every miniport’s initial entry point, names for
miniport driver routines can be anything the driver writer chooses. 
<P>
The following sections describe the requirements for and functionality of each
of these miniport driver routines. See the <I>Kernel-Mode Driver Reference</I>
for their formal definitions and descriptions of their parameters. 
<P>
