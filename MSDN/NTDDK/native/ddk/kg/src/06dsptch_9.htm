<P>
An NT intermediate-level driver <I>cannot</I>&nbsp;allocate IRPs for lower-level
drivers by calling <B>IoMakeAssociatedIrp</B>. Only highest-level NT drivers
can call <B>IoMakeAssociatedIrp</B>&nbsp;to allocate IRPs and set them up for a
chain of lower drivers. The I/O Manager automatically completes the original
IRP when all its associated IRPs have been completed, as long as the driver
does <I>not</I>&nbsp;call <B>IoSetCompletionRoutine</B>&nbsp;with the original IRP or
with any of the associated IRPs it allocates. 
<P>
If an intermediate driver creates IRPs for lower drivers, it should call <B>IoAllocateIrp</B>,
<B>IoBuildDeviceIoControlRequest</B>, <B>IoBuildSynchronousFsdRequest</B>, or <B>IoBuildAsynchronousFsdRequest</B>.
However, <B>IoBuildSynchronousFsdRequest</B>&nbsp;can be called only in the
following circumstances: 
<UL>
<LI>
By a driver-created thread to build IRPs for read or write requests, because
such a thread can wait in a nonarbitrary thread context (its own) on a
dispatcher object, such as a driver-initialized <I>Event</I>&nbsp;passed to <B>IoBuildSynchronousFsdRequest</B>
<P>
<LI>
In the system thread context during initialization or while unloading 
<P>
<LI>
To build IRPs for inherently synchronous operations, such as create, flush,
shutdown, close, and device control requests
<P>
However, a driver is more likely to call <B>IoBuildDeviceIoControlRequest</B>
to allocate device control IRPs than <B>IoBuildSynchronousFsdRequest</B>.
