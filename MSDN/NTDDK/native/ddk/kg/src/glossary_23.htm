<P>
A block of storage from which entries of a specified, fixed size can be
allocated and deallocated quickly. Callers of the <B>Ex</B>(ecutive) Support
zone routines must synchronize their allocation and deallocation of entries
within their zones.
<P>
For example, the I/O Manager uses zones to implement lookaside lists for fast
allocation and deallocation of IRPs and MDLs. As another example, some of the
system-supplied SCSI class drivers use zones to allocate and release memory
for SRBs.
<H3><A NAME="DDK_Zw_routines_KG"></A>Zw routines</H3>
<P>
A set of entry points parallel to the executive’s system services. A call to a
<B>Zw</B><I>Xxx</I>&nbsp;entry point from kernel-mode code (including calls from
other system services or NT drivers) supplies the corresponding system
service, except the caller’s access rights and the arguments to the <B>Zw</B>
“alias” are not checked for validity, and the call does not cause the previous
mode to be set to user mode. It is the responsibility of a kernel-mode caller
to check all user-supplied arguments for validity before such a caller passes
them on to a<B>&nbsp;Zw</B><I>Xxx</I>&nbsp;entry point. See also <I>system services</I>,
<I>probe</I>, and <I>SEH</I>.
