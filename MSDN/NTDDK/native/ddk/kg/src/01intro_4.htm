<P>
Because Windows NT is a portable operating system, designed to run on both
CISC-based and RISC-based machines, devices and their NT drivers must be both
hardware-configurable and software-configurable.
<P>
For example, a given disk device might be attached to either of two EISA buses
in one Windows NT machine, but the same device might be limited to a single
EISA bus in another Windows NT machine. Such a device is <I>hardware-configurable</I>.
To remain portable, its driver must not contain hard-coded machine-dependent
values.
<P>
The driver of such a disk device might provide hardware-level support to one
or more NT file systems in any given machine, depending on how the user
partitions the disk. In addition, an NT intermediate driver might support
fault tolerance (mirrored partitions, stripe sets, and/or volume sets) for
higher-level file system drivers in machines with sufficient mass storage
capacity. In other words, the same physical disk driver could provide support
to more than one type of higher-level driver in some Windows NT machines but
not in others. Such a disk driver is <I>software-configurable</I>, as are all
intermediate and file system drivers that ultimately depend on support from NT
device drivers.
<P>
The NT HAL component, implemented as a dynamic-link library, is responsible
for all hardware-level, platform-specific support needed by every other
component in the system, including NT drivers. The HAL exports support
routines that hide platform-specific hardware details about caches, I/O buses,
interrupts, and so forth, to provide an interface between the platform’s
hardware and the system’s software. For example, an NT device driver must call
a HAL-supplied routine to map the bus-relative interrupt vector at which its
device interrupts in a given machine to the system-assigned vector the driver
will use.
<P>
The NT Configuration Manager component provides a database, called the<I>
registry</I>, of information about the hardware, peripheral devices, and
drivers in a given machine. NT drivers can use the registry to get information
about both the hardware configuration of the machine and other drivers in the
system. NT drivers also supply information about their devices and
machine-specific configurations in the registry.
