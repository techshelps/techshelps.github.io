<P>
Extended attribute
<P>
An EA is viewed as an untyped name-value pair that is defined by the user to
describe extended information about a file. Typical system uses are to store
the icon for an image, to indicate that the file is a symbolic link, etc.
<H3><A NAME="DDK_ECC_KG"></A>ECC</H3>
<P>
Error correction code
<H3><A NAME="DDK_EISA_KG"></A>EISA</H3>
<P>
Extended industry standard architecture
<P>
A standard that defines the architecture of (and interface to) the extended PC
I/O bus. See also <I>ISA</I>.
<H3><A NAME="DDK_event_object_KG"></A>event object</H3>
<P>
A user-mode object upon which one or more threads can wait until the event is
set to the Signaled state. Every user-mode event object is implemented through
the use of a kernel-mode event object. A kernel-mode event object is an
instance of a Kernel-defined dispatcher object type.
<P>
Each event object can be classified as either of the following:
<P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol">&#183;</FONT>&#09;When a <I>synchronization event</I>
(a.k.a. “autoclearing event”) is set to the Signaled state, a single thread
that was waiting on the event is released (its dispatch state transitions from
waiting to ready, standby, or running), and the event is automatically reset
to the Not-Signaled state.
<P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol">&#183;</FONT>&#09;When a <I>notification event</I>&nbsp;is set
to the Signaled state, all threads that were waiting on the event are
released, and the event remains in the Signaled state until it is explicitly
reset to the Not-Signaled state.
<H3><A NAME="DDK_exception_KG"></A>exception</H3>
<P>
A synchronous error condition, resulting from the execution of a particular
machine instruction. See also <I>SEH</I>.
<H3><A NAME="DDK_executive_KG"></A>executive</H3>
<P>
The collection of kernel-mode components that form the base Windows NT
operating system. Executive components include the Executive Support, Kernel,
Memory Manager, Cache Manager, Process Structure, Interprocess Communication
(LPC and RPC), Object Manager, I/O Manager, Configuration Manager, Hardware
Abstraction Layer, and Security Reference Monitor. Each executive component
except the Cache Manager and Hardware Abstraction Layer supplies a specialized
set of native system services, and every executive component exports a set of
kernel-mode support routines for use by other executive components.
<P>
NT drivers also call kernel-mode support routines supplied by executive
components, including (but not limited to) routines beginning with the prefix
“Ex” for <B>Ex</B>(ecutive) Support. Other support routines of interest to
drivers begin with the prefixes: <B>Hal</B>,<B>&nbsp;Ke</B>(rnel), <B>Ps</B>&nbsp;(for <U>P</U>rocess
<U>S</U>tructure), <B>Ob</B>(ject), <B>Io</B>, <B>Mm</B>&nbsp;(for <U>M</U>emory <U>M</U>anager),
<B>Cc</B>&nbsp;(for <U>C</U>a<U>c</U>he Manager), <B>Se</B>(curity), <B>Rtl</B>&nbsp;(<U>R</U>un<U>t</U>ime
<U>L</U>ibrary), and <B>FsRtl</B>&nbsp;(for <U>F</U>ile <U>S</U>ystem <U>R</U>un<U>t</U>ime<U>
L</U>ibrary). See also <I>Zw routines</I>.
<P>
Note that NT drivers, including device, intermediate, and file system drivers,
are considered part of the executive after they are loaded. The “operating
system” visible to end users is actually a protected subsystem that runs in
user mode, calling system services, on top of the executive. That is, the
executive is hidden from end users by a subsystem-supplied interface that
emulates Windows&reg;, POSIX, or some other operating system.
