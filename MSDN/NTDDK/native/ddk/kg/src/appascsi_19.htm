<P>
If a Windows NT SCSI class driver already exists for a particular type of
device, it might be unnecessary to write a driver for a new device of the same
type. Each system-supplied SCSI class driver was designed to support
SCSI-II-compliant peripheral devices of a given type and was tested against a
number of vendors’ devices. Thus, any system-supplied SCSI class driver might
provide all the support another SCSI-II-compliant device of its type needs. 
<P>
If an existing SCSI class driver does not fully support a new device of its
type, a new driver must be written as either of the following: 
<UL>
<LI>
A new SCSI class driver for the device, which, in most cases, is also
unnecessary 
<P>
<LI>
Or, an SFD layered over an existing system-supplied class driver 
</UL>
<P>
Unless a new device requires that every request be handled in a
device-specific manner, writing an SFD takes far less development time than
writing a new SCSI class driver. 
<P>
An SFD supplies device-specific support for requests that require special
handling, such as translating data sent to or returned from the device in a
nonstandard format, or programming the device in response to an
IRP_MJ_DEVICE_CONTROL request. Such an SFD can let the appropriate system SCSI
class driver process all I/O requests that require no special handling.
