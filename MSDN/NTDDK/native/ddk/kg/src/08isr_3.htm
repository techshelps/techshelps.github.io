<P>
Every NT driver that has an ISR also must have a DpcForIsr or CustomDpc
routine. At the driver writer’s discretion, any NT device driver can have
additional CustomDpc routines, used to complete particular kinds of
interrupt-driven I/O operations. 
<P>
If any driver routine shares data, device registers, or context information
with the driver’s ISR, that driver also must have one or more SynchCritSection
routines.
<P>
Note that in a Windows NT uniprocessor machine, the ISR must return before the
DpcForIsr or a CustomDpc routine can execute. However, it is possible for the
ISR and DpcForIsr (or a CustomDpc) to run concurrently in an SMP machine. 
<P>
For more information about DpcForIsr and CustomDpc routines, see Chapter 9.
For more information about SynchCritSection routines, see Chapter 10.
