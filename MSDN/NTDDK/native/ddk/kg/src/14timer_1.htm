<P>
Any NT driver can have as many IoTimer routines as the device objects it
creates and any number of CustomTimerDpc routines.
<P>
NT drivers can use these routines to monitor whether an I/O operation timed
out, to restart device operations that have timed out, to log errors when an
operation has timed out or a device error has occurred, or for any other
purpose the driver designer chooses.
<P>
An IoTimer or CustomTimerDpc routine runs at IRQL DISPATCH_LEVEL, and it is
run in an arbitrary thread context.
<P>
Running at IRQL DISPATCH_LEVEL restricts the set of support routines an
IoTimer or CustomTimerDpc routine can call.
<P>
For more information about managing IRQLs in NT drivers, see Chapter 16. For
specific information about the IRQL(s) at which any particular support routine
can be called, see the <I>Kernel-Mode Driver Reference</I>.
