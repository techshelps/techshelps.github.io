<P>
The designer of a higher-level NT driver can make no assumptions about whether
or how existing lower-level NT drivers handle cancelable IRPs. As soon as any
higher-level NT driver calls <B>IoCallDriver</B>&nbsp;with an IRP, it no longer
“owns” that IRP and it can neither determine nor control whatever processing
lower-level drivers are doing to satisfy that request.
<P>
However, any higher-level NT driver can set its IoCompletion routine in an IRP
by calling <B>IoSetCompletionRoutine</B>&nbsp;before it calls <B>IoCallDriver</B>.
Such a higher-level driver can determine whether any pending IRP is cancelled
in a lower driver by calling <B>IoSetCompletionRoutine</B>&nbsp;with the <I>InvokeOnCancel</I>
parameter set to TRUE before it passes the IRP on to lower drivers.
<P>
A higher-level NT driver can call <B>IoCancelIrp</B>&nbsp;with any pending IRP that
the driver allocates.<B>&nbsp;</B>However, making this call does not guarantee that
the given driver-allocated IRP will be completed with its I/O status block set
to STATUS_CANCELLED. Such a higher-level driver that calls <B>IoCancelIrp</B>
can check whether the given IRP was cancelled only in its IoCompletion routine
so it must call <B>IoSetCompletionRoutine</B>&nbsp;with the <I>InvokeOnCancel</I>
parameter set to TRUE before passing the IRP on to lower drivers. For more
information about IoCompletion routines, see Chapter 13.
<P>
A higher-level NT driver should not call <B>IoCancelIrp</B>&nbsp;with an IRP that
it did not allocate.
