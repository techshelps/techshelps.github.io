<A NAME="DDK_Figure_2..7_KG"></A>Figure 2.7 shows two possible hardware
configurations for the keyboard and mouse devices:
<UL>
<LI>
Each connected directly somewhere on the system bus
<P>
<LI>
Both connected through a keyboard and auxiliary device controller
</UL>

<A NAME="DDK_Figure_2..8_KG"></A>Figure 2.8 illustrates the corresponding layered
drivers for I/O operations on the devices shown in Figure 2.7.

<P>
Note that NT drivers of keyboard and mouse devices, whatever the hardware
configuration, can use the system’s higher-level NT keyboard class and mouse
class drivers to handle hardware-independent operations. These are called <I>class
drivers</I>&nbsp;because each supplies system-required but hardware-independent
support for a particular class of device.
<P>
A corresponding <I>port driver</I>&nbsp;implements the device-specific support to
carry out required I/O operations on each physical device. The system’s
(i8042) keyboard and auxiliary device port driver for x86-based Windows NT
platforms manages device-specific operations for both mouse and keyboard. In a
hardware configuration where each device is separately connected, as shown in <A HREF="#DDK_Figure_2..7_KG">Figure
2.7</A>, each system class driver can be layered over separate device-specific
port drivers, or a single driver for each device could be implemented as a
separate, monolithic (lowest-level) driver.
