<P>
The <I>DeferredContext</I>&nbsp;passed to <B>KeInitializeDpc</B>&nbsp;points to a
context area where other driver routines and the CustomTimerDpc routine can
maintain state. This <I>DeferredContext</I>&nbsp;pointer is passed to the DPC
routine whenever it is called, as shown by the declaration.
<P>
A CustomTimerDpc has no particular associations with a driver-created device
object. However, a driver can associate a CustomTimerDpc routine with a
driver-created device object by passing a <I>DeferredContext</I>&nbsp;pointer to
the device object when it calls <B>KeInitializeDpc</B>.
<P>
Such a context area must be in resident memory allocated by the driver.
Usually, this context area is in a device extension. It can be in a controller
extension if the driver uses a controller object or in nonpaged pool allocated
by the driver. The contents of the context area are driver-determined.
<P>
If a CustomTimerDpc routine shares context information with the driver’s ISR,
the CustomTimerDpc routine must call <B>KeSynchronizeExecution</B>&nbsp;with a
SynchCritSection routine in order to access the shared context safely.
<P>
If the CustomTimerDpc shares the context information with other nonISR driver
routine(s), the area at <I>DeferredContext</I>&nbsp;must be protected by an
executive spin lock.
<P>
For more information about SynchCritSection routines, see Chapter 10. For more
information about using executive and interrupt spin locks, see Chapter 16.
