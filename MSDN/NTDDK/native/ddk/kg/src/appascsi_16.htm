<P>
Unless a SCSI class driver ORs the <B>SrbFlags</B>&nbsp;for a given request with
SRB_FLAGS_NO_QUEUE_FREEZE, the system port driver freezes a queue for a given
logical unit after any of the following: 
<UL>
<LI>
A bus reset occurred while the logical unit was executing a request. 
<P>
<LI>
The logical unit returned SCSISTAT_CHECK_CONDITION or
SCSISTAT_COMMAND_TERMINATED, which the class driver can find in the SRB’s <B>ScsiStatus</B>
member. 
<P>
<LI>
A request was timed out. 
<P>
<LI>
A request was terminated by a bus message command such as SCSIMESS_ABORT. 
</UL>
<P>
The port driver indicates that an LU-specific queue has been frozen by
returning a request with SRB_STATUS_QUEUE_FROZEN in the <B>SrbStatus</B>
member. New requests from the class driver can be inserted into the queue, but
no requests are sent to the logical unit except autosense requests. 
<P>
Freezing the queue under these conditions gives each SCSI class driver an
opportunity to analyze an error before other queued jobs are executed. For
example, a class driver might need to reinitialize the TID after the
controller has been reset, or queued jobs might need to be cancelled if the
media has changed. To reinitialize a TID, the driver can send a request with
the <B>SrbFlags</B>&nbsp;ORed with SRB_FLAGS_BYPASS_FROZEN_QUEUE. 
<P>
A ReleaseQueue routine allocates and sets up an IRP and an SRB to either
release or flush a frozen queue. The <B>Function</B>&nbsp;member of the SRB must be
set to SRB_FUNCTION_RELEASE_QUEUE or SRB_FUNCTION_FLUSH_QUEUE, which both
releases a frozen queue and cancels all currently queued requests for the
target logical unit. The port driver completes all requests in a flushed queue
with their <B>SrbStatus</B>&nbsp;members set to SRB_STATUS_FLUSHED. 
<P>
A ReleaseQueue routine should allocate memory for an SRB by calling <B>ExAllocatePool</B>
with the memory type <B>NonPagedPoolMustSucceed</B>&nbsp;because failing to release
a frozen queue makes the device inaccessible. 
<P>
Note that a class driver’s ReleaseQueue routine is called asynchronously,
generally from its IoCompletion routine. A class driver’s IoCompletion routine
cannot call ReleaseQueue to flush a queue that is not frozen. However, it can
call ReleaseQueue to release an unfrozen queue, and the port driver simply
ignores such a request.
