<P>
Any NT driver that can be replaced, or unloaded and reloaded, while Windows
NT&reg; is running must have an Unload routine.
<P>
NT drivers for video, keyboard, or mouse devices, and for mass-storage devices
that can hold the system page file currently do not have Unload routines
because these types of devices must be available while the current system is
running. Higher-level NT drivers layered above these device drivers also do
not have Unload routines.
<P>
Like every DriverEntry routine, an Unload routine runs at IRQL PASSIVE_LEVEL
and is called in the context of a system thread.
<P>
In general, the process of unloading a driver is a synchronous operation.
