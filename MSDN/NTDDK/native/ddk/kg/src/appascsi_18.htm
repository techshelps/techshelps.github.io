<P>
The port-miniport driver pair is responsible for retrying requests if certain
SCSI errors occur, including bus parity errors, selection time-outs, and
target controller busy errors. If their retry attempts fail, the Windows NT
SCSI port driver completes the request with an appropriate error and logs the
I/O error, as well. 
<P>
SCSI class drivers should never attempt to retry a request that the port
driver has already failed due to any of the preceding errors. 
<P>
SCSI class drivers are required to retry requests that fail due to target
controller errors, SCSI bus resets, or time-outs. In general, a RetryRequest
routine can resubmit such an IRP to the port driver and direct that the SRB be
placed at the head of the port driver’s LU-specific queue. 
<P>
In particular, a RetryRequest routine should do the following:
<OL>
<LI>
Ensure that a partial transfer request has the correct values set for the
starting address and length. 
<P>
<LI>
Zero the <B>SrbStatus</B>&nbsp;and <B>ScsiStatus</B>&nbsp;members of the SRB. 
<P>
<LI>
Set up the <B>SrbFlags</B>&nbsp;member, as necessary for the device. 
<P>
<LI>
Set up the I/O stack location for the port driver in the IRP as already
described in <A HREF="appascsi_9.htm">Sections
A.1.4</A>&nbsp;through <A HREF="appascsi_14.htm">A.1.4.5</A>.
<P>
<LI>
Call <B>IoSetCompletionRoutine</B>&nbsp;for the IRP, because the driver’s
IoCompletion routine might need to retry the request more than once, or to
call the driver’s InterpretRequestSense or ReleaseQueue routine. 
<P>
<LI>
Pass the request on to the port driver with <B>IoCallDriver</B>. 
</OL>
