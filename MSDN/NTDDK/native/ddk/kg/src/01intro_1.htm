<H2><A NAME="DDK_Kinds_of_Drivers_in_Windows_NT_KG"></A>1.1  Kinds of Drivers in Windows NT</H2>
<P>
Within the Windows NT operating system, there are two basic kinds of drivers:
<UL>
<LI>
User-mode drivers, such as Win32 multimedia drivers, VDDs for MS-DOS&reg;
applications with application-dedicated devices, or another protected
subsystem’s drivers
<P>
User-mode drivers are subsystem-specific and are not discussed here. See the <I>Multimedia
Drivers</I>&nbsp;and <I>Virtual DOS Drivers</I>&nbsp;documentation in the DDK for more
information.
<P>
<LI>
Kernel-mode drivers for logical, virtual, or physical devices
<P>
These are called <I>NT drivers</I>, because they are part of the Windows NT<I>
executive</I>: the underlying, “new technology” microkernel-based operating
system that supports one or more protected subsystems. In the rest of this
material, <I>NT</I>&nbsp;is frequently used to mean the Windows NT executive.
</UL>
<P>
As <A HREF="01intro.htm">Figure 1.1</A>&nbsp;shows, NT includes a number of
kernel-mode components with well defined functionality isolated in each
component. Those of most interest to NT device driver writers are the Kernel,
I/O Manager, Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL), Configuration Manager, Memory
Manager, Executive Support, and Process Structure components. Additional
components of interest to some NT driver writers include the Object Manager
and Security Reference Monitor. Also of interest to NT file system driver
writers is the Cache Manager, which is not shown in <A HREF="01intro.htm#DDK_Figure_1.1_KG">Figure
1.1</A>.
<P>
Like NT itself, NT drivers are implemented as discrete, modular components
with a well defined set of required functionality. All NT drivers have a set
of system-defined <I>standard driver routines</I>&nbsp;and some number of internal
routines as determined by the driver writer.
<P>
There are three basic types of NT drivers. Each type has a slightly different
structure and quite different functionality:
<UL>
<LI>
<I>Device drivers</I>, such as a keyboard or disk driver that directly
controls a physical device
<P>
Device drivers are sometimes called <I>lowest-level drivers</I>, particularly
when such a driver is the lowest driver in a chain of layered NT drivers.
<P>
<LI>
<I>Intermediate drivers</I>, such as a virtual disk, mirror, or
device-type-specific <I>class</I>&nbsp;driver, that depend on support from
underlying device drivers
<P>
<LI>
<I>File system drivers</I>&nbsp;(FSDs), such as the system-supplied FAT, HPFS,
NTFS, or CDFS drivers, that also depend on support from underlying lower-level
drivers
<P>
While a particular NT file system driver might or might not get support from
one or more intermediate drivers, every NT file system driver ultimately
depends on support from one or more device drivers.
</UL>
<P>
Windows NT network drivers also can be classified as one of these types of
drivers. For example, an NT server or redirector is a specialized file system
driver, a transport driver is a type of intermediate NT driver, and a physical
netcard (sometimes called a media access controller) driver is an NT device
driver. However, NT provides specialized interfaces and support for network
drivers, such as NDIS 3.0 (<I>Network Device Interface Specification, Version
3.0</I>) for drivers of physical net cards.
<P>
While this documentation provides some useful overviews and background
information for NT file system and network driver writers, it is primarily a
design guide for writers of NT device and intermediate drivers. Network driver
writers can consult the relevant Windows NT Device Driver Kit (DDK)
documentation.
