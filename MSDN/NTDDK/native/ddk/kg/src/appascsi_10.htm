<P>
For all requests that require the port driver to execute a request on the SCSI
bus, the class driver must set up an IRP with an SRB containing a CDB.
Consequently, most class drivers have one or more internal routines to build
SRBs. For more information about BuildSrb routines, see <A HREF="appascsi_13.htm">Section
A.1.4.4</A>. 
<P>
SCSI class drivers also pass on IRP_MJ_INTERNAL_DEVICE_CONTROL requests to the
Windows NT SCSI port driver. Such a request can originate from a SCSI filter
driver, described in <A HREF="appascsi_19.htm">Section
A.2</A>. As for IOCTL_SCSI_PASS_THROUGH requests described in <A HREF="appascsi_11.htm">Section
A.1.4.2</A>, the class driver is responsible for setting the <B>PathId</B>, <B>TargetId</B>,
and <B>Lun</B>&nbsp;members in the SRB. The class driver is also responsible for
setting the <B>MinorFunction</B>&nbsp;code to IRP_MN_SCSI_CLASS in the port
driver’s I/O stack location before passing the IRP on to the port driver with <B>IoCallDriver</B>.
<P>
Every SCSI class driver is responsible for splitting up transfer (IRP_MJ_READ
and/or IRP_MJ_WRITE) requests that exceed the underlying HBA’s capabilities.
Consequently, most class drivers also call an internal SplitTransferRequest
routine, described in <A HREF="appascsi_14.htm">Section
A.1.4.5</A>, or implement the same functionality in their Dispatch routine(s) for
read and write requests.
