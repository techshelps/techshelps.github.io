<P>
Any NT driver that uses either an interlocked or supplemental device queue
must provide storage for the necessary NT objects and resources. 
<P>
If it uses either kind of queue, an NT driver must provide storage for the
following:
<UL>
<LI>
For a doubly-linked interlocked queue, storage both for an executive spin
lock, required as a parameter to the <B>ExInterlocked..List</B>&nbsp;routines, and
for the queue header of type LIST_ENTRY
<P>
For more information about using spin locks, see Chapter 16.
<P>
<LI>
For a device queue, storage for a Kernel-defined device queue object
<P>
While each device queue object has an associated executive spin lock and a
queue header, storage for these resources is allocated automatically when the
driver provides storage for its device queue object. 
</UL>
<P>
NT drivers usually provide this storage in the device extensions of their
device objects, but they can call <B>ExAllocatePool</B>&nbsp;with the <I>PoolType</I>
parameter set to <B>NonPagedPool</B>&nbsp;to allocate storage or can provide
storage in a controller extension if they use controller objects. 
<P>
For more information about allocating pool memory, see Chapter 16. For more
information about controller objects, see Chapter 3.
