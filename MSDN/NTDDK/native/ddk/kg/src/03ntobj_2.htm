<P>
An NT device object, like the driver object described in Chapter 2, is
partially opaque to NT drivers. NT driver writers must know about certain
field names and system-defined symbolic constants associated with device
objects because their drivers must access these fields through the <I>DeviceObject</I>
pointer returned by <B>IoCreateDevice</B>&nbsp;and passed to most standard NT
driver routines.
<P>
Nevertheless, NT driver writers should be aware that the location of any field
that is accessible through a returned <I>DeviceObject</I>&nbsp;pointer can change
from one Windows NT&reg; platform or version to another. In addition, NT
driver writers should consider “unpublished” fields within an NT object
inaccessible: that is, NT drivers should <I>never</I>&nbsp;access them. Any NT
driver that has dependencies on NT object field locations or that accesses
undocumented fields within an NT object also compromises its own future
portability and interoperability with other NT drivers.

Figure 3.2 shows field names and constants that are particularly important for
NT device and intermediate driver writers.
