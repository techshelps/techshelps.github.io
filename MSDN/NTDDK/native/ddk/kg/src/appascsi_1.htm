<P>
To the I/O Manager and any higher-level drivers layered above a SCSI class
driver, most SCSI class drivers are standard kernel-mode intermediate drivers.
Such a class driver must supply a set of Dispatch routines to which the I/O
Manager and/or still higher-level drivers, such as FSDs, can send IRPs for
appropriate I/O operations. 
<P>
In addition, every class driver must have a DriverEntry routine and one or
more IoCompletion routines. A SCSI class driver also can have any other
standard higher-level driver routine, such as an Unload routine, as necessary.
<P>
For more information about standard kernel-mode driver routines, see Chapter 4
.
