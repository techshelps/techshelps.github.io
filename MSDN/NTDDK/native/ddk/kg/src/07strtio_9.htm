<P>
Any higher-level NT driver can have a StartIo routine at the driver writer’s
discretion. However, such a driver is unlikely to be interoperable with
existing lower-level drivers and is likely to exhibit poor performance
characteristics. 
<P>
A StartIo routine in a higher-level NT driver has the following effects:
<UL>
<LI>
Incoming IRPs can be queued by calling <B>IoStartPacket</B>&nbsp;from the driver’s
Dispatch routine(s) and <B>IoStartNextPacket</B>&nbsp;from its IoCompletion
routine(s), thereby causing IRPs to be processed one at a time through the
StartIo routine.
<P>
<LI>
The driver’s I/O throughput could become appreciably slower during periods of
heavy I/O demand, because its StartIo routine can become a bottleneck.
<P>
<LI>
Such a driver’s StartIo routine calls <B>IoCallDriver</B>&nbsp;with each IRP at
IRQL DISPATCH_LEVEL, thereby causing all lower-level drivers’ Dispatch
routines also to run at IRQL DISPATCH_LEVEL. This restricts the set of support
routines that lower drivers can call in their Dispatch routines. Because most
NT driver writers assume their drivers’ Dispatch routines run at IRQL &lt;
DISPATCH_LEVEL, such a higher-level driver is unlikely to be interoperable
with many existing lower-level drivers. 
<P>
<LI>
Such a StartIo routine reduces overall system throughput because it and the
Dispatch routines of all lower-level drivers in its chain are run at raised
IRQL. 
<P>
For more information about the IRQLs at which standard driver routines are
run, see Chapter 16. For specific information about any particular standard
routine, see the pertinent chapter among Chapters 5 through 15.
</UL>
<P>
None of the system’s higher-level NT drivers has a StartIo routine, because it
can slow IRP processing for the driver itself, for all drivers above and below
it, and for the system overall. 
<P>
Most higher-level NT drivers simply send IRPs to the underlying device
driver(s) from their Dispatch routines, as described in Chapter 6, and do any
necessary clean-up processing in their IoCompletion routines. For more
information about IoCompletion routines, see Chapter 13. 
<P>
However, higher-level NT drivers can set up internal queues for IRPs that
request particular kinds of operations or set up internal queues to hold IRPs
bound for a set of heterogeneous underlying devices like the NT SCSI port
driver, as mentioned in <A HREF="07strtio_1.htm">Section 7.1</A>.
