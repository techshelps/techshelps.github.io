<H2><A NAME="DDK_M_KG"></A>M</H2>
<H3><A NAME="DDK_MACL_KG"></A>MACL</H3>
<P>
Mandatory access control list
<P>
A part of the security descriptor for each object in a system with a B1 or
higher security rating from the U.S. National Computer Security Center.
<H3><A NAME="DDK_map_KG"></A>map</H3>
<P>
(1) To translate a virtual address into a physical address or vice versa. See
also <I>MDL</I>.
<P>
(2) To translate a bus-relative address into a logical address to be used by a
device as if it were a physical address. See also <I>HAL</I>.
<P>
(3) To alias a bus-relative interrupt vector to a system-assigned interrupt
vector. See also <I>HAL</I>.
<H3><A NAME="DDK_MCB_KG"></A>MCB</H3>
<P>
Map control block
<P>
An MCB is a structure used by NT file systems in mapping the VBNs for a file
to the corresponding LBNs on the disk.
<H3><A NAME="DDK_MDL_KG"></A>MDL</H3>
<P>
Memory descriptor list
<P>
An opaque structure, defined by the Memory Manager, that uses an array of
physical page frame numbers (PFNs) to describe the pages that back a virtual
memory range.
<H3><A NAME="DDK_method_KG"></A>method</H3>
<P>
A routine supplied with an NT object type that handles standard operations
(such as open, close, delete, parse, dump, and read or reset security
attributes) on every instance of the object type.
<H3><A NAME="DDK_MIDI_KG"></A>MIDI</H3>
<P>
Musical instrument digital interface
<H3><A NAME="DDK_miniport_driver_KG"></A>miniport driver</H3>
<P>
A device-specific kernel-mode driver linked to an NT port driver, usually
implemented as a dynamic-link library, that provides an interface between the
port driver and the system. NT defines the architecture of the following kinds
of miniport drivers:
<P>
(1) An HBA-specific driver, linked against the NT-supplied SCSI port driver,
that drives one or more SCSI buses, or a mass-storage device driver that uses
the NT SCSI port driver as its interface to the system.
<P>
(2) A video-adapter-specific driver, linked against the NT-supplied video port
driver, that supports a corresponding display driver.
<P>
(3) A network-adapter-specific driver, linked against the NT-supplied NDIS
library.
<H3><A NAME="DDK_mirror_driver_KG"></A>mirror driver</H3>
<P>
a.k.a. “shadow driver or RAID1 driver”
<P>
An intermediate (layered somewhere between an FS and a disk DD) driver whose
responsibility is to maintain a duplicate of a disk partition.
<P>
The system-supplied fault tolerant disk driver, ftdisk, is a mirror driver.
<H3><A NAME="DDK_mount_KG"></A>mount</H3>
<P>
Operation that requests a file system to make a volume useable by the I/O
Manager. This is done by filling in the information in a VPB which indicates
the serial number and label of the volume, as well as by filling in the
pointer to the file system’s device object that represents the “volume”
mounted on the real device. See <I>VPB</I>.
<H3><A NAME="DDK_multiprocessor_machine_KG"></A>multiprocessor machine</H3>
<P>
A platform with more than one CPU. Windows NT is designed to run on
multiprocessor machines, usually configured to be:
<P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol">&#183;</FONT>&#09;<I>Homogenous</I>&nbsp;<FONT
FACE="Symbol">&#45;</FONT> all CPUs are identical, and either all have
identical coprocessors or none has a coprocessor.
<P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol">&#183;</FONT>&#09;<I>Closely coupled</I>&nbsp;<FONT
FACE="Symbol">&#45;</FONT> all CPUs share memory and have uniform access to
memory.
<P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol">&#183;</FONT>&#09;<I>Symmetric</I><FONT
FACE="Symbol">&#45;</FONT> every CPU can access memory, handle any interrupt,
and access I/O control registers just like every other CPU in the system. Note
that any version of Windows NT that runs on a symmetric multiprocessor machine
also runs <I>unchanged</I>&nbsp;on a uniprocessor machine based on the same CPU.
<P>
While Windows NT can run on <I>asymmetric</I>&nbsp;platforms, configured with a
master CPU that handles all IRQs and one or more slave CPUs as long as the
platform is both homogenous and closely coupled, the system has been designed
to run primarily on symmetric multiprocessor platforms because SMP machines
have better performance characteristics, particularly for I/O.
<H3><A NAME="DDK_mutex_object_KG"></A>mutex object</H3>
<P>
A kernel-mode-only, Kernel-defined dispatcher object type, used to provide
mutually-exclusive, deadlock-free access to a resource.
<P>
A mutex owner (thread) must run exclusively in kernel mode while it retains
ownership; an attempt to switch to user mode while holding a mutex causes a
system crash. Ownership of a mutex by a given thread has the following
effects:
<P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol">&#183;</FONT>&#09;Prevents the owning thread’s process
from leaving the balance set
<P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol">&#183;</FONT>&#09;Raises the owning thread’s priority to
the the lowest real-time priority value if the owning thread’s priority is not
already higher
<P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol">&#183;</FONT>&#09;Prevents the delivery of normal
kernel-mode APCs
<P>
Each mutex object has a caller-initialized, associated level value, and a
given thread should acquire ownership of a mutex if and only if:
<P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol">&#183;</FONT>&#09;The requested mutex is currently unowned
by another thread.
<P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol">&#183;</FONT>&#09;The requesting thread does <I>not</I>
already own a mutex of a (numerically) higher level.
<P>
Implementing the preceding policy, together with the requirement that a mutex
owner run exclusively in kernel mode, prevents deadlocks.
<P>
Note that recursive ownership of a mutex is possible. However, any thread that
claims a mutex N times must explicitly release that mutex N times in order to
set the mutex to the Signaled state.
