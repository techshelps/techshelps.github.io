<P>
<A NAME="DDK_MAC_or_Mac_media_access_controller__NG"></A><B>MAC or Mac</B>&nbsp;(media
access controller)
<P>
Refers to a specific type of netcard driver. 
<P>
<A NAME="DDK_MCA_NG"></A><B>MCA</B>
<P>
Microchannel architecture, a type of backplane architecture that only accepts
a compatible netcard. 
<P>
<A NAME="DDK_MDL_memory_descriptor_list__NG"></A><B>MDL</B>&nbsp;(memory descriptor
list)
<P>
A memory descriptor list uses an array of physical page frame numbers (PFNs)
to describe the pages that back a virtual memory range. 
<P>
<A NAME="DDK_MIB_managed_information_block__NG"></A><B>MIB</B>&nbsp;(managed
information block)
<P>
The MIB is the set of netcard driver objects that represent information about
driver capabilities and current status. The MIB identifies a managed object by
a 32-bit OID. 
<P>
<A NAME="DDK_monolithic_NG"></A><B>monolithic</B>
<P>
A type of driver that includes the functions of both a transport driver and a
netcard driver. 
<P>
<A NAME="DDK_multicast_address_NG"></A><B>multicast address</B>
<P>
A 48-bit identifier (as transmitted over an Ethernet or FDDI network) naming
the group of stations that should receive a data packet. Instead of being a
bitmask (see functional address), a multicast address simply contains a unique
group number by which receiving stations can request packets. 
<P>
<A NAME="DDK_multiprocessor_machine_NG"></A><B>multiprocessor machine</B>
<P>
A platform with more than one CPU. Windows NT is designed to run on
multiprocessor machines, usually configured to be: 
<P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol">&#183;</FONT>&#09;Homogenous <FONT
FACE="Symbol">&#190;</FONT> all CPUs are identical, and either all have
identical coprocessors or none has a coprocessor. 
<P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol">&#183;</FONT>&#09;Closely coupled <FONT
FACE="Symbol">&#190;</FONT> all CPUs share memory and have uniform access to
memory. 
<P>
<FONT FACE="Symbol">&#183;</FONT>&#09;Symmetric <FONT
FACE="Symbol">&#190;</FONT> every CPU can access memory, handle any interrupt,
and access I/O control registers just like every other CPU in the system. Note
that any version of Windows NT that runs on a symmetric multiprocessor machine
also runs <I>unchanged</I>&nbsp;on a uniprocessor machine based on the same CPU. 
<P>
While Windows NT can run on asymmetric platforms, configured with a master CPU
that handles all IRQs and one or more slave CPUs as long as the platform is
both homogenous and closely coupled, the system has been designed to run
primarily on symmetric multiprocessor platforms because SMP machines have
better performance characteristics, particularly for I/O.
