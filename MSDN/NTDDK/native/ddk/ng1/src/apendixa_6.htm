<P>
As mentioned earlier, the  DDK for Windows NT includes code for several sample
miniport NIC drivers. For sample code to full NIC drivers, you will have to
use the older DDK from Windows 3.1. For more information about this sample NIC
driver, see <A HREF="apendixa_49.htm">Section A.4</A>. 
<P>
The sample code is based on an Ethernet driver that controls a MIPS-based
network interface card using the SONIC integrated circuit, manufactured by
National Semiconductor. The sample driver contains functions that you can
adapt to your own purposes. There are always hardware-dependent functions that
only you can write. However, many functions (primarily those that communicate
with the NDIS interface library instead of a network interface card) are
fairly standard. You can use these with little or no modification.
