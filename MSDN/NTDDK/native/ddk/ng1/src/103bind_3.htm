<P>
As already mentioned in the preceding section, the binding engine writes the
results for each component of the previously described steps into the registry
<B>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services<BR>
\</B><I>NameOfComponent\</I><B>Linkage</B>&nbsp;key. The following three value
entries are written to this key.
<DL>
<DT>
<B>Bind</B>
<DD>
Specifies a list of the device name(s) of the component(s) to which the
binding engine has determined <I>NameOfComponent</I>&nbsp;can bind. 
<P>
For a NIC driver, this list contains the name of one or more underlying
network adapters it can manage. 
<P>
For an intermediate driver, this list includes the NICs exported by all the
NIC drivers for all network adapters on the machine. Because the binding
engine includes the names of all NICs exported by any network driver, this
list will include the name exported by the NDIS intermediate driver’s
upper-edge miniport component. See <A HREF="103bind_13.htm">Section 3.5</A>
for a discussion of the review process in which this binding is deleted from
the registry. 
<P>
For a transport protocol driver, this is a list of the name(s) of all exported
underlying NICs or virtual NICs to which it could possibly bind. This list can
include devices that are incompatible with the transport’s operation, usually
because the NIC implements a medium the transport does not support. See <A HREF="103bind_13.htm">Section
3.5</A>&nbsp;for a discussion of the review process and the deletion of such devices
from the <B>Bind</B>&nbsp;list. See also <A HREF="103bind_12.htm">Section
3.4.8</A>&nbsp;for information about defining experimental media types. 
<P>
For a service, this list includes the name(s) of one or more device(s)
exported by transport protocol(s) to which the service can bind itself. 
<BR>
<DT>
<B>Export</B>
<DD>
Specifies a list of the device name(s) that an overlying component can use to
bind itself to <I>NameOfComponent</I>. 
<P>
Usually these device names are formed by concatenating the name of the
exporting component with the <B>Export</B>&nbsp;entries of underlying components
with which the exporting component can bind. However, a component can export a
single, unconcatenated pseudo-device name to which still higher level
components bind, but operate by multiplexing over several underlying devices.
See <A HREF="103bind_8.htm">Section 3.4.4</A>&nbsp;for more information
about the <B>BindForm</B>&nbsp;net rule. 
<BR>
<DT>
<B>Route</B>
<DD>
Specifies the path through the network stack from <I>NameOfComponent</I>&nbsp;to
the underlying NIC, as a concatenated list of exported device names configured
beneath <I>NameOfComponent</I>.
