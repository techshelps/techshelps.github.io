<P>
Windows NT has a <I>netdtect.sys</I>&nbsp;support driver that allows user
applications to perform a narrow range of physical I/O and memory operations.
The driver exports its capabilities to user applications running in the Win32
subsystem. This is accomplished through the <I>netdtect.dll</I>, which
verifies that interface resources, such as IRQs, are available for use. 
<P>
Every NIC has an associated DLL that instructs the support driver DLL on how
to interact with that network adapter. This allows the installer to interact
directly with a NIC even though the NIC-specific driver has not been loaded.
<P>
The Windows NT NIC level DLL interface allows a variety of NICs to be
controlled by a single DLL. For information on the entry points for the NIC
detection DLLs, see <A HREF="209dtfun.htm#DDK_NIC_Detection_DLL_Functions_NG">Chapter 9</A>.
