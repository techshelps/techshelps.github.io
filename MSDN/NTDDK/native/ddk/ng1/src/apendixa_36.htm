<P>
This section describes full NIC drivers that comply with NDIS 3.0. If you are
providing a network driver, it is not necessary for you to write a full NIC
driver because the current version of Windows NT supports an NDIS 3.0 miniport
NIC driver. It is recommended that you provide a miniport driver instead of
the full NIC driver to save time. You can develop fewer routines in your
miniport driver because there is more support for common routines in the NDIS
interface library.
<P>
The NDIS library maintains a descriptor block for each NIC driver or transport
driver that registers itself on a network. Depending on the type of driver,
the descriptor block contains the addresses of the NIC driver upper-edge
functions or the transport driver lower-edge functions. With the exception of
interrupt service routines and media access control synchronization functions,
NIC driver processing occurs at or below the IRQL DISPATCH_LEVEL. This chapter
describes the main operations involved, which are: 
<UL>
<LI>
Initializing wrapper and registering drivers. 
<P>
<LI>
Registering a network interface card. 
<P>
<LI>
Opening a network interface card. 
<P>
<LI>
Sending data. 
<P>
<LI>
Indicating and transferring received data. 
<P>
<LI>
Indicating status. 
<P>
<LI>
Querying and setting NIC driver capabilities (per binding). 
<P>
<LI>
Querying global statistics (per network interface card). 
<P>
<LI>
Closing a network interface card. 
<P>
<LI>
Resetting a network interface card. 
<P>
<LI>
Removing a network interface card. 
<P>
<LI>
Unloading and deregistering drivers and terminating wrapper. 
</UL>

For help in following the descriptions, refer to the <I>Network Driver
Reference</I>.  Chapter 1 of the reference defines the upper-edge NIC driver
functions; Chapter 2 defines the NDIS library functions; Part I, Chapter 4
details NDIS 3.0 OIDs; Chapter 5 defines NDIS 3.0 status codes; and Chapter 6
describes structures and enumerations used by NIC drivers.
