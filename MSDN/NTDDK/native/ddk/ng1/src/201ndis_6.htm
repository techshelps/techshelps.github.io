<P>
Each NIC driver contains its own MIB, an information block in which the driver
stores dynamic configuration information and statistical information that a
management entity can query or set. Configuration information includes data
such as an Ethernet multicast address list, and statistical information
includes data such as the number of broadcast packets received. Each
information element within the MIB is referred to as an <I>object</I>. To
refer to each such managed object, NDIS defines an <I>Object Identifier</I>.
Therefore, if a management entity wants to query or set a particular managed
object, it must provide the specific OID for that object.
<P>
The MIB tracks three classes of objects: 
<OL>
<LI>
Those general to all NDIS NIC drivers
<P>
<LI>
Those specific to all NDIS NIC drivers for a given medium type, such as
Ethernet or Token Ring
<P>
<LI>
Those specific to a particular vendor implementation
</OL>
<P>
&nbsp;
<P>
The <I>general</I>&nbsp;and mandatory <I>media-specific</I>&nbsp;OIDs are documented in
the <I>Network Driver Reference</I>. For these system-defined OID_<I>XXX</I>
codes, this documentation indicates whether an NDIS driver’s
MiniportQueryInformation<B>&nbsp;</B>function can be queried on the associated
management object or the MiniportSetInformation function can receive a request
to set the management object. In legacy full NIC drivers, the MacRequest<B>&nbsp;</B>function
is called to both query and set values, while MacQueryGlobalStatistics is
called for global statistics queries. The implementation-specific OIDs for a
particular NIC driver should be listed and described in the documentation
accompanying a given NIC driver. 
<P>
Besides being classified as either <I>operational characteristics</I>&nbsp;(for
example, multicast address list) or <I>statistics</I>&nbsp;(for example, broadcast
packets received), objects are classified as either <I>mandatory</I>&nbsp;or <I>optional</I>.
All operational characteristics objects for either general or media-specific
classes are mandatory, but only some statistics objects are mandatory. All
implementation-specific objects are classified as mandatory.
<P>
Figure 1.2 shows the structure of an OID.

<P>
The first 3 bytes of the OID provide a key to the OID’s various
classifications, with the fourth byte identifying the specific information
management object within those classifications.
<P>
For a listing and descriptions of all NDIS <I>general </I>and <I>media-specific
</I>OIDs, refer to the <I>Network Driver Reference</I>.
