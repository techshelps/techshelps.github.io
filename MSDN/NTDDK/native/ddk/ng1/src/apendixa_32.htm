<P>
Filter libraries are special sets of NDIS interface library wrapper functions
that route a packet from the NIC driver to specific bound transport drivers.
Each filter library maintains a transport database for the associated network,
Ethernet, Token Ring, or FDDI. The database associates each network interface
card binding with a list of transport driver addresses. The NIC driver must
indicate each packet received through the filter library appropriate to the
network. Then the filter library processes the received packet and passes it
on to each transport driver that has an address entry matching the packet
destination address. For more information about NIC driver action functions,
see <A HREF="apendixa_12.htm">Section A.2.1</A>.
