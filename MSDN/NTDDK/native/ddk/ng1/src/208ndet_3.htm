<P>
This describes the usage model for the components used in detecting network
adapters .
<H4>Primary NIC Installation</H4>
<P>
The initial setup detection process occurs once, during primary system
installation. This process attempts to locate one instance of a known NIC.
When this instance is located, the process ends. 
<P>
This process is the primary objective of the Windows NT NIC-detection
software. The results of this process determine subsequent recommendations
made to the user.
<P>
The user interface allows the user to bypass initial detection, because this
method can eliminate a possible halt or failure, particularly on an ISA bus
machine.
<H4>Secondary NIC Installation</H4>
<P>
Any time a NIC is installed, either during main or OEM installation, the
secondary detection processes are used to confirm proper installation. These
secondary detection processes include configuration querying, configuration
verification, and resource validation. Configuration querying presents the
user with the current card settings. The configuration verification ensures
the NIC can accept user selections. Resource validation ensures that the IRQ
and other critical hardware configuration parameters do not conflict with
other devices in the same computer.
