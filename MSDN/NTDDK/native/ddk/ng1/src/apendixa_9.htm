<P>
Filter libraries are special sets of NDIS interface library functions that
route a received packet to a specific bound transport driver, based on packet
target address. NDIS 3.0 currently supports the filter libraries listed below.
A NIC driver can access filter library functions by including the appropriate
header file. 
<UL>
<LI>
Ethernet filter library (<I>efilter.h</I>)
<P>
<LI>
Token Ring filter library (<I>tfilter.h</I>)
<P>
<LI>
FDDI filter library (<I>ffilter.h</I>)
</UL>
<P>
Each filter library maintains a database for a network interface card. The
database associates each NIC binding with a list of addresses. The filter
library processes a packet and passes it on to each transport driver that has
an address entry matching the destination address of the packet.
