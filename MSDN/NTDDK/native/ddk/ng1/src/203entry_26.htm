<P>
Besides being called during initialization, MiniportSetInformation is called
in two additional cases: 
<OL>
<LI>
During a hardware reset, and
<P>
<LI>
As a result of a protocol call to <B><A HREF="../../nr/src/103ndisx_19.htm">NdisCloseAdapter</A></B>.
</OL>
<P>
MiniportSetInformation is called during a hardware reset operation as
described in the next section. In this case, MiniportSetInformation is called
to reset the miniport to its initial state with respect to its addresses.
<P>
NDIS calls MiniportSetInformation when a miniport’s NIC is closed by a
protocol’s <B><A HREF="../../nr/src/103ndisx_19.htm">NdisCloseAdapter</A></B>&nbsp;call.
Such a miniport will be requested to update its addressing information.
