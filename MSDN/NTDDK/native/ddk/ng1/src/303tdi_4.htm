<P>
A file object that represents an open connection endpoint identifies a
specific connection on which local and remote-node peer processes are
communicating with each other across the network or will communicate with each
other when the local-node process has established an endpoint-to-endpoint
connection with a remote-node peer. 
<P>
Any such file object must be associated with another open file object that
represents a particular transport address. The transport address identifies
the process, as already described in <A HREF="303tdi_3.htm">Section
3.2.1</A>. 
<P>
In a similar manner, the transport uses the file object representing the local
connection endpoint to maintain state about the remote-node peer process, such
as the remote-node transport address, with which its local-node client
establishes an endpoint-to-endpoint connection. 
<P>
A client process can establish many endpoint-to-endpoint connections between
itself and other processes on remote nodes. For example, the Windows NT
redirector establishes separate connections between itself and each remote
Windows NT Server with which it communicates. Such a client can have several
open connection endpoints all separately associated with an open transport
address. 
<P>
When a process wants to send data over an endpoint-to-endpoint connection, it
must have a means of identifying which of all existing connections the data is
to be sent over. Each open file object that represents a connection endpoint
is used to discriminate among established endpoint-to-endpoint connections of
the same process.
