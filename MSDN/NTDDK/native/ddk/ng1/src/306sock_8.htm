<P>
Client and server applications send and receive disconnect data in a manner
similar to the way each sends and receives connect data. 
<P>
To send disconnect data, a client application calls <B>setsockopt </B>with the
SO_DISCDATA option and a buffer of disconnect data to be transmitted to the
server on the remote node. This data is sent either when the client
application calls <B>shutdown</B>&nbsp;to disconnect the send side of the socket or
when the application calls <B>closesocket </B>on the socket.
<P>
To receive disconnect data, a client application must call <B>setsockopt</B>
with the SO_DISCDATALEN option prior to a remote’s closure of the connection.
This option specifies the amount of disconnect data the application expects to
receive.
<P>
After the remote has disconnected, any server-supplied disconnect data can be
retrieved with the SO_DISCDATA option to <B>getsockopt</B>. The client
application passes in a buffer large enough to hold all the disconnect data,
and Windows Sockets copies the received disconnect data into this buffer.
