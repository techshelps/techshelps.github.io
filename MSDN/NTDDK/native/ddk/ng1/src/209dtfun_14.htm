<P>
This describes auxiliary functions exported by the network control panel
application (NCPA). It assumes the reader is familiar with the nature and
syntax of the installation script language, described in the <I>Programmer&#39;s
Guide</I>. 
<P>
The system-supplied <I>setup.exe</I>&nbsp;is an interpreter of the INF language. As
such, <I>setup.exe</I>&nbsp;requires all information passing between it and its
extension DLLs to be in text form. The NCPA has a set of auxiliary functions
that provide such translation. These functions are used to provide access to
other functions too complex to write in the INF language.
<P>
Some NCPA-provided functions are used in NIC detection to encapsulate the
functionality. The functions are divided into two classes: those that are
essentially wrappers, and those that have algorithms to utilize the functions
described here.
<P>
One of the primary purposes of these auxiliary functions is to handle
dynamically installed NIC-detection DLLs. Addition of new DLL names is done
automatically by INF routines in the <I>utility.inf</I>&nbsp;file<I>. </I>
<P>
<I>Msncdet.dll</I>&nbsp;should always appear first in such a list. All the DLLs in
this list are automatically loaded and queried about available network
interface cards during system installation.
