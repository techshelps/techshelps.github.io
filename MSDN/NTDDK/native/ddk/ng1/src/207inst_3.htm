<P>
This provides information on how to install a serial driver (or serial driver
emulator) so Remote Access setup can be configured to use that driver.
<P>
Write a configuration utility that installs the driver. Package the
configuration utility as a DLL that can be started from the network control
panel by using an installation script (<I>.inf</I>&nbsp;file). Users can then
install the hardware by using the network control panel application, clicking
the “Add Adapter” button, and installing the correct driver.
<H5>Port Naming</H5>
<P>
Serial Adapters (serial driver emulators):    COM1, COM2, ... COM<I>m</I>
<H5>Windows NT Registry</H5>
<P>
For an X.25 adapter with a serial driver emulator, merge the [<I>X.25_card_name</I>]
script section in with the Remote Access <I>pad.inf</I>&nbsp;script located in the
RAS subdirectory of the Windows NT system directory, for example, <I>winnt35\system32\ras</I>.
The <I>Remote Access Service Administrator&#39;s Guide</I>&nbsp;provides details on
how to write a <I>pad.inf</I>&nbsp;script.
<P>
Indicate which COM ports the driver exposes to the system by storing
information in the Windows NT registry&#39;s hardware devicemap as shown in
the following example: 
<PRE><FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE="2">HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE
&nbsp; &nbsp; HARDWARE
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; DEVICEMAP
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; SERIALCOMM
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Serial0    REG_SZ  COM1
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Serial1    REG_SZ  COM2
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; .
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; .
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; .
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Serialn    REG_SZ  COMn
&nbsp;</FONT></PRE>
<P>
If there are one or more serial ports in the local system, the SERIALCOMM key
will already exist. The serial driver installation script should then add the
number of supported serial ports to the existing list of ports. When a serial
driver is loaded, it must add the supported ports to the SERIALCOMM key
because this information is updated every time the system is restarted.
