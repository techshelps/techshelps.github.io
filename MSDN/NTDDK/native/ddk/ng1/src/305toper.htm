<P>
Many TDI operations involve an endpoint-to-endpoint connection between a
local-node client and a remote-node client. These TDI operations are <I>connection-oriented</I>
and include the following:
<UL>
<LI>
Opening a local-node connection endpoint
<P>
<LI>
Requesting a connection
<P>
<LI>
Accepting a connection
<P>
<LI>
Sending connection-oriented data
<P>
<LI>
Receiving connection-oriented data
<P>
<LI>
Disconnecting
<P>
<LI>
Closing a local-node connection endpoint
</UL>
<P>
TDI also permits <I>connectionless</I>&nbsp;communications between nodes on a
network. This type of operation does not require the local-node client to
establish an endpoint-to-endpoint connection with a remote-node client. They
are faster but less reliable than connection-oriented communications. TDI
connectionless operations include the following:
<UL>
<LI>
Sending a datagram
<P>
<LI>
Receiving a datagram
</UL>
<P>
The remaining TDI operations are common to connection-oriented and
connectionless communication, including the following:
<UL>
<LI>
Opening a local-node transport address 
<P>
<LI>
Packaging and submitting a request
<P>
<LI>
Setting and querying information
<P>
<LI>
Receiving error notification
<P>
<LI>
Requesting transport-specific actions, if the underlying transport supports
any extensions to the TDI interface for its clients
<P>
<LI>
Closing a previously opened transport address 
</UL>
<P>
The following sections describe the main TDI operations, as much as possible
in the same order as these operations are likely to occur. See the <I>Network
Driver Reference</I>, Part 2, for more detailed information about the TDI,
transport, and client routines mentioned here. 
<P>
See the <I>Kernel-Mode Driver Reference</I>&nbsp;for more detailed information
about the support routines, such as <B>ZwCreateFile</B>&nbsp;and <B>IoCallDriver</B>,
mentioned here.
