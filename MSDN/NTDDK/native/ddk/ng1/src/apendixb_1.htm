The Windows NT kernel environment differs fundamentally from the traditional
UNIX kernel. In Windows NT, a thread executing in the kernel can be preempted,
whereas a thread executing within the UNIX kernel can be interrupted, but not
preempted. In Windows NT, many threads may also execute concurrently in the
kernel on several processors. For Windows NT, a STREAMS driver must be
declared in the <B>qi_mplevel</B>&nbsp;member of its <I>qinit </I>structures to be
either:

The service procedure of a queue can execute concurrently with the service
procedure of any other queue. The put procedure of a queue can execute
concurrently with the service procedure of that queue and the service and put
procedures of any other queue. Multiple instances of the put procedure of a
queue may also execute concurrently.

Only one service or put procedure from a subsystem can execute at any given
instant. The procedures of other subsystems or of fully parallel stacks may
execute concurrently. Execution of these other procedures is serialized with
the subsystem if they enter it by way of a <B>put</B>&nbsp;call.
