<P>
NIC drivers also must add entries to the registry that specify the net rules
for the adapter type that the NIC driver exports. For instance, a NIC driver
that manages an elnkii adapter must specify the elnkii NIC’s net rules. For
any NIC, the only required net rule entries are:
<UL>
<LI>
<B>type</B>&nbsp;
<P>
<LI>
<B>class</B>&nbsp;
<P>
<LI>
<B>bindform</B>&nbsp;
</UL>
<P>
These entries are stored in the registry in the NIC-specific <B>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\WindowsNT<BR>
\CurrentVersion\NetworkCards\</B><I>CardNumber</I><B>\NetRules</B>&nbsp;key. 
<P>
The required net rules entries for an adapter appear in the registry as
follows:
<DL>
<DT>
<B>type</B>
<DD>
Specifies an adapter name, followed by a specification of its type. 
<DL>
<DT>
Typically an adapter name is formed from the adapter type, concatenated with
the word <B>Adapter</B>&nbsp;to look like the following: 
<DD>
<B>type : REG_SZ : elnkii    elnkiiAdapter</B>
</DL>
<DT>
<B>class</B>
<DD>
Specifies the class to which the NIC belongs as a name that contains the
predefined <B>Adapter</B>, usually followed by <B>basic</B>&nbsp;indicating this is
a primitive class. However, a parent class can be specified at the discretion
of the driver writer, particularly for a driver that handles any one of
several models of related adapters. 
<DL>
<DT>
A typical <B>class</B>&nbsp;net rule in the registry for a NIC looks like the
following:
<DD>
<B>class : REG_SZ : elnkiiAdapter    basic</B>
</DL>
<DT>
<B>bindform</B>
<DD>
Specifies the <I>ObjectName</I>&nbsp;of the NIC as visible in the Windows NT object
namespace under the <B>\Device</B>&nbsp;node, whether generated binding information
should appear under the <B>..\Linkage</B>&nbsp;key in the registry (usually <B>yes</B>),
whether the name of the NIC should be concatenated into binding strings
(usually <B>yes</B>), followed by <B>container</B>. 
<DL>
<DT>
For NICs, <B>container</B>&nbsp;is always chosen for the fourth field because the
name of the NIC is delimited by slashes in binding strings. A typical bindform
entry in the registry for a NIC looks like the following:
<DD>
<B>bindform : REG_SZ : &quot;EE161&quot;   yes    yes    container</B>
</DL>
</DL>
<P>
There is no <B>bindable</B>&nbsp;net rule specified in this registry key for an
adapter because every adapter, as the lowest level component in a binding
stack, is <I>bound to</I>&nbsp;by other network components. An adapter does not <I>bind
itself to</I>&nbsp;any network component. 
<P>
No <B>use</B>&nbsp;net rule for an adapter is necessary. The fact that a NIC&#39;s
net rules appear at <B>..\NetworkCards\</B><I>CardNumber</I><B>\NetRules</B>
implies that the <I>ComponentRole</I>&nbsp;is always <B>adapter</B>.
