<H3><A NAME="DDK_Query_Information_Requests_NG"></A>6.14.1  Query Information Requests</H3>
<P>
Query information-type requests differ from set information-type requests in
that one or more members in the request structure, denoted by the OUT prefix
in the structure definition, are reserved for information to be passed back to
the calling process. Members prefixed with IN should be considered read-only.
The first member in all query information requests, <B>ulRequestID</B>, is
reserved for future use, and should be ignored.
<P>
Definitions for the following structures are found in <I>ndistapi.h</I>.
<H5>OID_TAPI_DEV_SPECIFIC</H5>
<P>
This request is used as a general extension mechanism to enable WAN NIC
drivers to provide access to features not described in other requests. The
meaning of the extensions are device-specific, and taking advantage of these
extensions requires the application to be fully aware of them. This function
uses an NDIS_TAPI_DEV_SPECIFIC structure. 
<H5>OID_TAPI_GET_ADDRESS_CAPS</H5>
<P>
This request queries the specified address on the specfied line device to
determine its telephony capabilities. This request uses an
NDIS_TAPI_GET_ADDRESS_CAPS structure.
<H5>OID_TAPI_GET_ADDRESS_ID</H5>
<P>
This request returns the address ID associated with the address in a different
format on the specified line. This request uses an NDIS_TAPI_GET_ADDRESS_ID
structure.
<H5>OID_TAPI_GET_ADDRESS_STATUS</H5>
<P>
This request queries the specified address for its current status and uses an
NDIS_TAPI_GET_ADDRESS_STATUS structure.
<H5>OID_TAPI_GET_CALL_ADDRESS_ID</H5>
<P>
This request retrieves the address ID for the indicated call using an
NDIS_TAPI_GET_CALL_ADDRESS_ID structure.
<H5>OID_TAPI_GET_CALL_INFO</H5>
<P>
This request returns detailed information about the specified call using an
NDIS_TAPI_GET_CALL_INFO structure.
<H5>OID_TAPI_GET_CALL_STATUS </H5>
<P>
This request returns the current status of the specified call using an
NDIS_GET_CALL_STATUS structure.
<H5>OID_TAPI_GET_DEV_CAPS</H5>
<P>
This request queries a specified line device to determine its telephony
capabilities. The returned information is valid for all addresses on the line
device. The request uses an NDIS_TAPI_GET_DEV_CAPS structure.
<H5>OID_TAPI_GET_DEV_CONFIG</H5>
<P>
This request returns a data structure object, the contents of which are
specific to the line (WAN miniport NIC driver) and device class, giving the
current configuration of a device associated one-to-one with the line device.
This request uses an NDIS_TAPI_GET_DEV_CONFIG structure.
<H5>OID_TAPI_GET_EXTENSION_ID</H5>
<P>
This request returns the extension ID that the WAN miniport NIC driver
supports for the indicated line device. The request uses an
NDIS_TAPI_GET_EXTENSION_ID structure.
<H5>OID_TAPI_GET_ID</H5>
<P>
This request returns a device ID for the specified device class associated
with the selected line, address, or call. The request uses an NDIS_TAPI_GET_ID
structure.
<H5>OID_TAPI_GET_LINE_DEV_STATUS </H5>
<P>
This request queries the specified open line device for its current status.
The information returned is global to all addresses on the line. The request
uses an NDIS_TAPI_GET_LINE_DEV_STATUS structure.
<H5>OID_TAPI_MAKE_CALL</H5>
<P>
This request places a call on the specified line to the specified destination
address. Optionally, call parameters can be specified if anything but default
call-setup parameters are requested. The request uses an NDIS_TAPI_MAKE_CALL
structure.
<H5>OID_TAPI_NEGOTIATE_EXT_VERSION</H5>
<P>
This request returns the highest version extension number the miniport is
willing to operate under for this device, given the range of possible
extension versions. The request uses an NDIS_TAPI_NEGOTIATE_EXT_VERSION
structure.
<H5>OID_TAPI_OPEN</H5>
<P>
This request opens the line device whose device ID is given, returning the NIC
driver’s handle for the device. The NIC driver must retain the NDISTAPI
driver’s handle for the device for use in subsequent calls to the LINE_EVENT
callback procedure. The request uses an NDIS_TAPI_OPEN structure.
<H5>OID_TAPI_PROVIDER_INITIALIZE</H5>
<P>
This request initializes the WAN miniport NIC driver to handle TAPI
operations. The request uses an NDIS_TAPI_PROVIDER_INIT structure.
