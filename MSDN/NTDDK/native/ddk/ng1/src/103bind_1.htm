<P>
Relationships between network components can be expressed as <I>dependencies</I>
and as <I>bindings</I>. A network component has binding relationships <I>with</I>
other network components and dependencies <I>on</I>&nbsp;other network components
or groups of components, as follows:
<UL>
<LI>
A <I>dependency</I>&nbsp;expresses a relationship between components that
determines the order in which those components are loaded by the Service
Controller. 
<P>
<LI>
A <I>binding</I>&nbsp;relationship has meaning for NDIS and network components but
not for the Service Controller. A binding relationship exists if a network
component can open or initialize a next lower component to form a path for
transmitting network data from a local network client onto the network media.
</UL>
<P>
Binding relationships are determined by a system software component called the
<I>binding engine</I>. When the binding engine runs, it generates binding
information for all network components in the registry. In addition, the
binding engine generates dependencies for each of these components based on
the binding information each component&#39;s <I>.inf</I>&nbsp;script wrote into the
registry. The binding engine writes these dependencies into the registry, and
later the Service Controller reads them to determine the load order of
dependent components. 
<P>
If a network component has a dependency that cannot be derived from the
binding information, the network component&#39;s <I>.inf</I>&nbsp;script must write
the dependency at <B>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet<BR>
\Services\</B><I>NameOfComponent</I>\<B>Linkage</B>&nbsp;as the value for <B>OtherDependencies</B>.
Such a value will be added to a component’s dependency information by the
binding engine.
<P>
If a network component does not have a <B>…\NetRules</B>&nbsp;entry in the
registry, the binding engine does not generate any bindings or derived
dependencies. Such a component must write its dependencies directly to <B>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SERVICES\CurrentControlSet\Services<BR>
\</B><I>NameOfComponent<B>\</B>&nbsp;</I><B>DependOnService</B>.
