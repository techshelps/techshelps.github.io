<P>
All Windows NT I/O requests are directed to an open file object, which can
represent a physical or virtual device, a data file, or any logical target of
I/O requests, that can be opened by a particular process. Open file objects
are process-specific. For example, the I/O Manager creates a file object for
each process that opens a particular data file concurrently. 
<P>
TDI uses file objects to represent entities that exist in <I>any</I>&nbsp;network
communication environment. In particular, TDI uses file objects to represent
the following types of TDI-defined entities:
<UL>
<LI>
To represent transport <A HREF="303tdi_3.htm">addresses</A>
opened by specific processes or groups of processes on a network node
<P>
<LI>
To represent <A HREF="303tdi_4.htm">connection
endpoints</A>&nbsp;identifying specific endpoints associated with particular transport
addresses, opened to set up endpoint-to-endpoint connections with remote-node
peer processes 
<P>
<LI>
To represent <A HREF="303tdi_5.htm">control
channels</A>&nbsp;identifying transport providers, opened for the purpose of setting
and querying global configuration, features, limits, and/or statistics
information maintained by the underlying transport
</UL>
<P>
A TDI transport driver and the underlying NDIS drivers provide a mechanism by
which data can be transferred from a process on one network node to one or
more processes that reside either on<I>&nbsp;</I>the same node or<I>&nbsp;</I>other<I>&nbsp;</I>network
nodes. The preceding address and connection endpoint entities represented by
open file objects are the means by which such transfers occur. 
<P>
For example, the Windows NT redirector process opens two file objects, one
representing a transport address and the other a connection endpoint
associated with that address, to send SMB (Server Message Block) messages to a
Windows NT server process on a remote node and to receive messages back from
the server process on the remote node.
