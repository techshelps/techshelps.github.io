<P>
A <I>network management</I>&nbsp;process can query or set global configuration or
statistical information with respect to a specific transport provider. To do
so, such a process must have a means of identifying a particular transport
among several possible transport providers.  
<P>
Such a client opens a file object that represents a control channel so that it
can query the appropriate transport. In effect, the client opens a file object
that represents the device object created by the underlying transport driver
when the client opens a control channel, either by calling <B>ZwCreateFile</B>
or <B>IoGetDeviceObjectPointer</B>. 
<P>
Other TDI clients that send and receive data across the network also can open
a control channel to query their underlying transports. For example, such a
client might issue a query to determine the transport&#39;s limit on datagram
size so the client could effectively size the buffers that it will allocate to
send and receive datagrams subsequently.
<P>
In general, a TDI transport maintains global state information about its
features and current statistics, rather than process-specific state
information tied to a particular open file object. For example, a client that
queries the current state of its open transport address passes a pointer to a
client-specific file object representing that address, but the transport
returns information about the number of clients that currently have the same
address open.
