<P>
After a miniport has determined its hardware resources and has called <B>NdisMSetAttributes(Ex)</B>,
it claims the resources it will use in the registry. The miniport <I>must</I>
call <B>NdisMSetAttributes(Ex)</B>&nbsp;before the following steps are taken. Every
miniport, no matter what type of NIC it manages, must at a minimum:
<UL>
<LI>
Allocate the memory it needs to manage its device. This memory is in addition
to that allocated for its adapter-specific structure. For instance, it might
allocate memory to receive incoming frames and perhaps staging buffers for
outgoing data.
<P>
<LI>
Register the I/O ports it is claiming for its NIC by calling <B><A HREF="../../nr/src/103ndisx_124.htm">NdisMRegisterIoPortRange</A></B>.
</UL>
