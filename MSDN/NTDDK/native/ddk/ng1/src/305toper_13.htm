<P>
After closing any associated connection(s), a TDI client is ready to close an
open transport address. 
<P>
When a client no longer has any use for an open transport address or control
channel, it <I>must</I>&nbsp;release that object as follows: 
<UL>
<LI>
Pass the file object pointer returned by <B>ObReferenceObjectByHandle</B>&nbsp;to <B>ObDereferenceObject</B>.
<P>
<LI>
Pass the file handle that was returned by <B>ZwCreateFile</B>&nbsp;when the
connection endpoint was opened to <B>ZwClose</B>. 
</UL>
<P>
In a similar manner, a TDI client also can close any control channel it has
opened in its underlying transport driver. 
<P>
If the client opened the file object representing a control channel with a
call to <B>IoGetDeviceObjectPointer</B>, it must pass the returned file object
pointer to <B>ObDereferenceObject</B>&nbsp;to release the file object. 
<P>
Then, the I/O Manager submits IRPs to the transport’s <A HREF="../../nr/src/21tddisp_1.htm">TdiDispatchCleanup</A>
and <A HREF="../../nr/src/21tddisp_2.htm">TdiDispatchClose</A>&nbsp;routines.
<P>
These transport routines immediately close the transport address or control
channel and free all associated client-specific transport driver resources.
For example, TdiDispatchCleanup cancels any pending requests on a transport
address that is being closed, deregisters any ClientEvent<I>Xxx</I>&nbsp;handlers
on that address, and cleans up client-specific state for that address. If this
client has released the last file handle for a particular transport address,
the transport also releases internal state for that transport address. 
<P>
After <B>ZwClose</B>&nbsp;returns to the client, it cannot submit a request to the
underlying transport for the transport address or control channel it
previously had open. The client-specific file object representing that address
or control channel no longer exists. 
<P>
