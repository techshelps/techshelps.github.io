<P>
Every NDIS driver, whether a NIC driver, an intermediate driver or a protocol
driver must provide a setup file, sometimes called an .<I>inf</I>&nbsp;<I>script</I>,
containing information about how that driver is loaded and about its
relationships to other network drivers. During system setup, the network is
configured on the machine, and the setup file for each network component
writes information into the registry that describes how this component fits
within the set of installed network drivers that are bound into network
stack(s). This registry information is read by NDIS and the network drivers
during driver initialization. 
<P>
After initial system setup, whenever the network control panel application
(NCPA) is run to reconfigure the network, for example to install a new driver,
a new binding analysis is carried out, and NCPA writes modified registry
contents that reflect the new configuration and the new binding relationships.
<P>
This describes what <I>binding</I>&nbsp;means in the context of NDIS driver
installation and how binding information is established during setup and
configuration, as well as what binding rules must be put into the registry for
various network components.
