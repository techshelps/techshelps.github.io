<P>
Server applications use connect data differently from client applications in
two important ways:
<OL>
<LI>
A server application receives the client’s connect data before it sends back
its own. 
<P>
<LI>
Because Windows Sockets does not support delayed-connection acceptances as TDI
does, a server application must send the same response-connect data to all
clients. 
</OL>
<P>
To receive connect data sent by clients, a server application calls <B>setsockopt</B>
with the SO_CONNDATALEN option to force Windows Sockets to reserve buffer
space for receiving connect data for incoming connect requests. The specified
amount of connect-data buffer space is used subsequently for all incoming
connects, but Windows Sockets allocates a separate buffer for each connect. 
<P>
After a newly connected socket is accepted with <B>accept</B>, the server
application calls <B>getsockopt</B>&nbsp;with the SO_CONNDATA option and a
server-allocated buffer large enough to hold the expected data. Windows
Sockets fills in this buffer with the connect data sent by the client.
<P>
To send response-connect data to clients, a server application calls <B>setsockopt</B>
with the SO_CONNDATA option and a buffer of data before any incoming
connections are accepted (typically before <B>listen</B>). Thereafter, any
client that connects to the server receives that server-supplied
connect-response data. The connect-response data for a server can be changed
at any time with another <B>setsockopt</B>&nbsp;call, which discards the previous
data and replaces it with the new data.
