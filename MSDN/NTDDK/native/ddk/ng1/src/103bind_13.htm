<P>
When a network component’s <I>.inf</I>&nbsp;script runs and it sets one as the
value of the <B>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft<BR>
\</B><I>NameOfComponent</I><B>\CurrentVersion\Review</B>&nbsp;entry, this setup
file is run a second time after the binding engine has written the results of
its analysis to the registry. During its review pass, a driver’s setup file
reviews the <B>Bind</B>, <B>Export</B>, and <B>Route</B>&nbsp;values written by the
binding engine, and deletes any inappropriate bindings, a process known as
“pruning.” 
<P>
A review can be also requested by setting the <B>Review</B>&nbsp;entry to one to do
other operations for a network component after the bindings have been
generated. For instance, the system TCP/IP transport uses its review pass to
read the available adapters it has to work with and to assign IP addresses to
them.
<P>
Unless restricted by a component&#39;s net rules, the binding engine will
generate a list of possible adapters for any transport protocol driver that,
according to the system&#39;s built-in rules, lists all available NICs in the
machine, including NICs of media types that the transport might not support. 
<P>
In other words, a network component must have an .<I>inf</I>&nbsp;file that
requests a review pass during which the generated bindings are reviewed and
any unusable bindings pruned if the net rules it specifies cannot restrict the
bindings generated by the binding engine. 
<P>
If pruning of unusable bindings is not done before driver initialization, when
a transport protocol, for instance, calls <B>NdisOpenAdapter</B>, a miniport
for an underlying adapter can select a medium the transport does not support.
When this occurs, the transport&#39;s call to <B>NdisOpenAdapter</B>&nbsp;fails,
and an error message is written to the event log. This error message can be
avoided if the transport prunes bindings in a review pass prior to driver
initialization to delete any NICs that are not possible partners. Developers
should write an .<I>inf</I>&nbsp;script that reviews and prunes bindings for every
component for which net rules cannot be used to restrict the generated
bindings list. 
<P>
NIC miniports seldom, if ever, request a review pass. They usually set the <B>Review</B>
entry to zero because the net rules for NIC drivers can be used to restrict
the list of generated bindings between the miniport and the NICs in the
machine.
