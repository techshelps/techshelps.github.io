<P>
This chapter describes the main functions provided by a full NIC driver that
complies with NDIS 3.0. The NIC driver functions with the prefix <B>Mac</B>
are the routines that must be exported by a full NIC driver. Since the
addresses to these functions, not the actual names, are passed during driver
initialization, you may name the exported functions with some other prefix.
The functions used by a full NIC driver from the NDIS interface library are
also covered, including the Ethernet filter library, the Token Ring Filter
library, and the FDDI filter library. 
<P>
This chapter also describes the lower-edge functions exported by a transport
driver because these routines call through the NDIS interface library to full
NIC drivers.
<P>
For a detailed description of how the functions work together, see <A HREF="apendixa_36.htm">Section
A.3</A>.
