<P>
TDI provides connection-oriented services at the transport layer to provide
the highest quality of service at the lowest cost. Depending on the specific
driver protocol, this can involve packetizing of client data, sequencing,
acknowledgment, retransmission, flow-control, and error recovery.
<P>
TDI also provides connectionless services for datagrams. However, these
services are lightweight: they do not provide error-free delivery or flow
control. The transport layer generally does not segment or reassemble
datagrams. Delivery of connectionless data is best-effort only for TDI
transports. 
<P>
A datagram send is an inherently unreliable form of network communication. The
sending client has no way of determining how many or which remote-node clients
have opened the target remote-node address or whether the remote-node
transport is currently accepting datagrams. Furthermore, the local-node TDI
driver can lose or duplicate a datagram at the discretion of the transport
driver writer. By contrast, the local-node transport is responsible for
retrying sends on an established endpoint-to-endpoint connection until the
transmitted data is accepted on the remote node and acknowledged by the
remote-node transport while the endpoint-to-endpoint connection is active. 
<P>
Like a datagram-send, a datagram receive operation can be unreliable. That is,
the local-node TDI driver can lose or duplicate a received datagram at the
discretion of the transport driver writer. By contrast, the local-node
transport is responsible for delivering a receive on an established
endpoint-to-endpoint connection until the transmitted data is accepted (or
rejected) by its client and acknowledged to the remote-node transport while
the endpoint-to-endpoint connection is active. 
<P>
An endpoint-to-endpoint connection remains active until it is broken by a
disconnect operation, as described later in <A HREF="305toper_11.htm">Section
5.11</A>&nbsp;or until the underlying transport&#39;s time-out logic determines that
the remote node is failing to respond.
