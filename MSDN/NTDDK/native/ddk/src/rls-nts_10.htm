<P>
The following changes are relevant to graphics drivers:
<UL>
<LI>
<I>GDI and Graphics Drivers Must be Ported to Kernel Mode</I>
<P>
GDI and graphics drivers have been moved to kernel mode for improved graphics
performance and memory savings. See the Appendix in the <I>Graphics Driver
Design Guide</I>&nbsp;for a snapshot of the new architecture and for porting tips.
The Appendix also lists new and obsolete functions.
<P>
<LI>
<I>Bidirectional Printer Support is Available</I>
<P>
Windows NT now supports language monitors. Vendors with bidirectional devices
that use PJL can use the system-supplied <I>pjlmon</I>; other vendors can
develop their own language monitors. The port monitor design has been enhanced
to support bidirectional port communication. See the <I>Graphics Driver Design
Guide</I>&nbsp;for details.
<P>
<LI>
<I>DirectDraw Driver Support is Available</I>
<P>
Minimal DirectDraw driver support is available to driver writers who want to
offer DirectDraw support in their Windows NT 4.0 display drivers. Reference
pages for supported DirectDraw driver functions and structures are found in
the <I>Graphics Driver Reference</I>.
<P>
<LI>
<I>3D Support</I>
<P>
Direct3D hardware support will be available in a post-4.0 Windows NT release.
Hardware manufacturers targeting the games market should write Direct3D
drivers for Windows 95 and keep in touch for news of availability on Windows
NT. Those manufacturers targeting the mid- to high-end 3D market should
consider using the Mini Client Driver (MCD) model to accelerate OpenGL
applications. The MCD interface is appropriate for a wide range of 3D
hardware. Manufacturers targeting the high-end market should consider moving
to the Installable Client Driver (ICD) model to support OpenGL. For further
information on these alternatives send email to <I>ihv@microsoft.com</I>&nbsp;with
a subject line including the text “3D Drivers on Windows NT”.
<P>
The device driver interface for 3D hardware (3D DDI) is not supported in
Windows NT Version 4.0.
