<I>SCSI Miniports Should Not Use Both DMA and PIO</I>
<P>
The SCSI port driver cannot guarantee synchronization between DMA transfers
and the <B>Srb.DataBuffer</B>&nbsp;that has been mapped for the miniport while the
SRB is being processed. As a result, miniport drivers that use DMA should not:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>
Set both <B>NeedPhysicalAddresses</B>&nbsp;and <B>MapBuffers</B>&nbsp;to TRUE in the
PORT_CONFIGURATION_INFORMATION structure.
<P>
<LI>
Modify the contents of <B>Srb.DataBuffer</B>&nbsp;while they are processing an SRB.
<P>
<LI>
Access data transferred from the adapter into <B>Srb.DataBuffer</B>.
</UL>
<P>
The SCSI port driver ensures the contents of <B>Srb.DataBuffer</B>&nbsp;are
synchronized with the DMA transfer after the request has been completed
(provided the miniport has flushed the DMA channel).
<P>
<LI>
<I>SCSI Miniport IOCTLs and ISA Adapters</I>
<P>
SRB_FUNCTION_IO_CONTROL requests are set up by the SCSI port driver to
transfer data from the adapter. The port driver does not copy the contents of <B>Srb.DataBuffer</B>
to any pages that the system has remapped (pages are remapped below 16 MB so
they are accessible by ISA devices).
<P>
As a result, SCSI miniport drivers should not DMA transfer data in <B>Srb.DataBuffer</B>
directly to the adapter. Miniport drivers can transfer the data by copying the
buffer’s contents into a section of non-cached extension and to the adapter
from there.
