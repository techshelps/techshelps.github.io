<P>
During the Windows phase of a Windows NT installation, or when the program is
run in maintenance mode, it is possible for the user to install a driver that
is not part of the Windows NT distribution. The user is presented with a menu
that includes an Other item which, if selected, causes the Setup program to
prompt the user to enter the location of the driver’s files. The Setup program
fails if it does not find an <I>oemsetup.inf</I>&nbsp;file in the directory
indicated by the user.
<P>
You can create an <I>oemsetup.inf</I>&nbsp;file for your driver using an extended
GUI INF script language. The Windows NT Setup program acts as an interpreter
and executes the instructions in these text file scripts. The GUI INF script
language enables you to create a sophisticated installation script with the
following features:
<UL>
<LI>
One section can call another section as if it were a subroutine, passing
multiple parameters and receiving multiple return values.
<P>
<LI>
Operators are available for manipulating string, list, and integer variables.
<P>
<LI>
Flow of control is supported through if-else contructs and goto statements.

Built-in commands are provided for a number of common operations, such as
accessing the configuration registry, calling a function in a DLL, or starting
a new process.
<P>
<LI>
Built-in dialog templates can be displayed using text specified in the INF
file. There is also an easy to use mechanism for providing text in multiple
languages (for example, English, French, and so forth).

The GUI INF Script Language section below provides a detailed description of
the GUI INF script language.
