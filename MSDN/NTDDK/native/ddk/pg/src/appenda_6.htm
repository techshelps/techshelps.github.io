<P>
In the GUI INF script language, files are broken into logical groups called
sections. A section is identified by a header line that consists of a name in
square brackets (for example, [Identify]). Following the header line is the
body of the section, consisting of one or more lines that are interpreted by
the Windows NT Setup program.
<P>
The GUI INF script supports three types of sections: shell, install, and
detect. All three section types begin with a header line. The section types
differ in the command used to call the section, and in the commands and
keywords that can be used within the section.
