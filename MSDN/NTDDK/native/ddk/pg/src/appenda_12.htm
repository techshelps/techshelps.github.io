<P>
As discussed earlier, the Setup program maintains a separate symbol table for
storing the variables and their values for each shell section called.
Consequently, different shell sections can use the same variable names without
conflict. Any install section called by a shell section can access all the
variables that have been defined in its shell section. Similarly, variables
defined in an install section are available in the shell section, even after
the install section has been exited. A shell section can use the exclamation
point (<B>!</B>) operator to access variables that were defined by its shell
section ancestors. When control returns from a shell section, the shell
section’s symbol table is deleted.
<P>
Use the following syntax to access the value associated with a variable:
<P>
$([!]<I>var</I>)&#09;
<P>
When the Setup program is interpreting a line in an INF script, it replaces
this with the value string associated with <I>var</I>. The optional ‘<B>!</B>’
operator enables accessing global variables (that is, variables defined in
other shell sections, including sections in other INF files). The ‘<B>!</B>’
operator is useful in accessing the global variables defined in the INF
scripts distributed with the Setup program, such as <I>initial.inf</I>.
<P>
Examples:
<PRE><FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE="2">$(Option)        ; a local variable
$(!STF_NTPATH)   ; a global variable
&nbsp;</FONT></PRE>
<P>
Other operators for accessing variable values are described in the next
section, INF operators.
