<P>
Before the information in the INF file can be accessed, it must be opened by
calling <B>SetupOpenInfFile</B>. This function returns a handle to the INF
file. 
<P>
If you do not know the name of the INF file that you need to open, <B>SetupGetInfFileList</B>
can be used to obtain a list of all the INF files of a particular type (either
legacy INF files, new INF files, or both) in a directory. 
<P>
Once an INF file has been opened, additional INF files can be appended to the
opened INF file by using <B>SetupOpenAppendInfFile</B>. When subsequent Setup
functions reference an open INF file, they will also be able to access any
information stored in any appended files. 
<P>
If no INF file is specified during the call to <B>SetupOpenAppendInfFile</B>,
the file specified by the <B>LayoutFile</B>&nbsp;entry in the <B>Version </B>section
of the INF file opened during the call to <B>SetupOpenInfFile</B>&nbsp;is appended.
<P>
When the information in the INF file is no longer needed, <B>SetupCloseInfFile
</B>should be called to release resources allocated during the call to <B>SetupOpenInfFile</B>.
