<P>
An install section is like a subroutine of the shell section that called it.
It can access the variables of the shell section’s symbol table. Like a shell
section, the lines of an install section are interpreted sequentially, and you
can use flow control keywords (for example, <B>ifstr</B>, <B>goto</B>) to
control execution. There are a number of built-in commands that can be used in
both shell sections and install sections. There are commands that can only be
used in install sections, and other commands that can only be used in shell
sections. It is not possible to call a shell, install, or detect section from
within an install section.
<P>
An <I>oemsetup.inf</I>&nbsp;file uses install sections to perform such actions as
copying files and setting up the configuration registry.
