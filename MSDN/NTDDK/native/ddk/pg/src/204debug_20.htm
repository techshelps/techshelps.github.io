<P>
The DDK’s BUILD utility uses the settings created by the environments
represented by the two build environment icons, the Checked Build Environment
and the Free Build Environment, created during the installation process to
provide a simple mechanism that can be customized for setting up the build
environment. These environments set various environment variables that control
the compiler and linker options and definitions used when the BUILD utility
uses the <I>makefile.def</I>&nbsp;file. These include the command-line switches
that determine the level of debugging symbols stored in the executable files,
and the compiler-specific definitions that cause optional sections of code to
be included or excluded. 
<P>
Using the Checked Build Environment sets up the build environment to produce a
debugging version of the driver that corresponds to the checked build of
Windows NT. Similarly, using the Free Build Environment results in a
streamlined version of the driver that corresponds to the free build of
Windows NT. When you are building a driver for debugging, use the Checked
Build Environment to build a driver with the appropriate symbolic debugging
information.
<P>
The specific compiler and linker options that are enabled for checked and free
builds vary depending on the platform for which you are building the driver.
By default the Checked Build Environment will build the driver with CodeView
symbolic information which will allow for source level debugging of the device
driver. In contrast, the Free Build Environment only enables COFF symbolic
debugging information providing minimal symbolic debugging information.
