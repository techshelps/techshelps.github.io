<P>
During the text setup phase of Windows NT installation, the Windows NT Setup
program installs drivers for the following components: keyboard, mouse, video,
SCSI, disk, CD-ROM, machine/HAL. If text setup cannot find a driver for any of
these components, it prompts the user to insert a disk containing the driver.
The user can also select Other from a list of drivers for a component, and
this causes Setup to prompt the user for a disk.
<P>
If you are distributing a driver for one of these hardware components, and
intend to enable the user to install it during text setup, your distribution
disk must include a file named <I>txtsetup.oem</I>. Note that for your
distribution disk to be used during the text setup phase, the disk must use
the FAT file system. A <I>txtsetup.oem</I>&nbsp;file is a text file containing the
following information:
<UL>
<LI>
Identifies the hardware components supported by this <I>txtsetup.oem</I>&nbsp;file.
<P>
<LI>
Lists the files to copy from the distribution disk for this component.
<P>
<LI>
Lists the registry keys and values to create for this component.
