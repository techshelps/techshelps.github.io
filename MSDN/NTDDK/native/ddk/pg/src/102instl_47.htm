<P>
Windows NT has a number of subsystems to control various classes of devices.
Classes identify logical device types such as display, keyboard, and network.
Because each subsystem has different user options and different compatibility
constraints, it is impossible to have a single utility support installation of
all possible devices. Instead, each class is responsible for providing its own
installer. 
<P>
A single installer can support installation of both the class and individual
devices. However, this depends on the class and in some cases separate device
installers are used. Typically, the installer is combined with the Control
Panel applet for the given class, although this is not a requirement. 
<P>
The class and device installers are responsible for displaying the appropriate
dialog boxes or carrying out appropriate installation tasks. Although a class
installer gives the device installer full control of the installation process,
in most cases, the device installer simply directs the class installer to
complete the task for it. The device installer can insert additional
configuration dialogs, hardware detection, and other features into the process
as is appropriate for the device.
