<P>
This chapter describes the requirements and methods for installing a device
driver on a machine using the Microsoft&reg;Windows NT&reg; operating system.
Windows NT 4.0 installation methods are presented in this chapter. Most
drivers are installed using the Windows NT 4.0 information (INF) files and
Setup functions; however, some drivers (for example, network and multimedia)
are installed with the legacy methods described in <A HREF="appenda.htm">Appendix
A</A>. Driver installation can occur either during or after the installation of
Windows NT on the machine.
<P>
When Windows NT is installed on a machine, the initial phase of the Windows NT
Setup program installs only the minimum number of drivers needed for NT to
run: keyboard, mouse, video, SCSI/Disk, and Machine/HAL. This phase of the
Setup program is known as text setup. If you want the user to be able to
install your driver during text setup, your distribution disk must include a
text file named <I>txtsetup.oem</I>. The Text Setup section in this chapter
discusses the format of this file.
<P>
After the text setup phase has been completed, the Setup program boots Windows
NT and proceeds with the GUI-mode phase of the Windows NT installation. During
this phase, the Setup program gives the user an opportunity to install network
components. 
<P>
After Windows NT has been installed, a user with administrator privileges can
install drivers. This would be necessary, for example, if a device is added to
the hardware configuration that was not present when NT was installed or if
the user wants to install a different or updated driver for an existing
device. For this situation, the following installation methods are available:
<UL>
<LI>
To install a display driver, keyboard driver, modem driver, mouse driver, PC
Card (PCMCIA) driver, port driver, printer driver, SCSI adapter driver, tape
device driver, or telephony driver, the user would run the corresponding
applet in the Control Panel folder.
<P>
<LI>
To install network components, the user would run the Networks applet (<I>ncpa.cpl
</I>) in the Control Panel folder. This applet calls the Windows NT Setup
program, and expects to find an <I>oemsetup.inf</I>&nbsp;(or <I>oemsetnt.inf </I>)
file on the supplied distribution disk. For more information, see <A HREF="appenda.htm">Appendix
A</A>.
<P>
<LI>
To install a multimedia device, the user would run the Multimedia applet (<I>multimed.cpl
</I>) in the Control Panel folder. The driver distribution disk must contain
an <I>oemsetup.inf</I>&nbsp;(or <I>oemsetnt.inf </I>) file. For more information,
see <A HREF="appenda.htm">Appendix A</A>.
</UL>
<P>
For driver types not discussed above, the driver developer can write an
installation program and provide this with the driver. The installation
program would use functions in the Setup API to set up the registry and to
copy files.
