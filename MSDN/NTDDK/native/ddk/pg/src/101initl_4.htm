<P>
After the operating system and boot drivers are loaded from the disk into
memory by NTLDR or OSLOADER, control is passed to the Windows NT Executive.
<P>
The HAL is an Executive component that exports the platform-specific
functionality. It supports limited output functionality to allow the Kernel to
display informational and error messages as other components of the
kernel-mode Executive are initialized.
<P>
The NTLDR’s initial BIOS call (see <A HREF="101initl_3.htm">Section
1.2.1</A>) is made in <I>x</I>86 real mode.
<P>
HAL support for video output also is necessary if the machine crashes. The HAL
can be called by the Kernel to reinitialize the video adapter to an
alphanumeric mode and to display information, such as a register dump and
stack backtrace.
