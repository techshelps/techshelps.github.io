<P>
When checked executables or DLLs are built using this procedure, the files
contain their external symbols by default. Thus, the symbols are available to
the debugger as soon as the program or DLL is loaded. When free executables or
DLLs are built, symbol files with the filename extension <I>.dbg</I>&nbsp;are put
in the same directory as the built executables.
<P>
It is possible to get line-number (local) information in the image files using
BUILD. However, this is not the default since it would have a severe impact on
disk space requirements needed to build the system. This information can be
included by setting the NTDEBUG environment variable as follows:
<PRE><FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE="2">set NTDEBUG=ntsd
</FONT></PRE>
<P>
Setting this environment variable causes BUILD to generate .<I>obj</I>&nbsp;files
and image files with full symbolic debugging information.
