<p>
Contains buttons that are frequently used when positioning elements on the page. With the exception of the Lock icon, most of the items on this toolbar band are available whenever you are working in the treeview or detail panes of the designer.</p>
<p>
You can click a toolbar button once to carry out the action represented by that button.</p>
<h2>Toolbar Buttons</h2>
<p class=dt>
<b>Show Table Borders</b></p>
<p class=indent>
Toggles the borders of any tables in your HTML page that have their Border property set to zero. When the Border property of a table is set to zero, no border appears in the designer by default, and no border will appear in the browser when the page is run. This button enables you to temporarily view the border of these tables as you work in the designer, making it easier to position and move tables.</p>
<p class=tl>
By default, this icon is selected when you add a designer.</P><p class=dt>
<b>Show Details</b></p>
<p class=indent>
Displays glyphs for HTML elements that do not have a visual representation, such as comments, scripts, styles, and unknown or unsupported HTML tags. By default, this icon is selected when you add a designer.</p>
<p class=tl>
In addition to showing unknown or unsupported elements, the Show Details button shows a glyph that represents the position in the HTML stream of each absolutely positioned element on the page when absolute position mode is turned on.</P><p class=dt>
<b>Absolute Position</b></p>
<p class=indent>
Determines whether the selected item is positioned absolutely or relatively. When you use absolute positioning for an element, the element's HTML contains a style attribute that indicates its exact location on the page.</p>
<p class=tl>
When you deselect absolute positioning, elements are positioned from left to right and top to bottom across the screen, space permitting, or at the current cursor location, running from left to right, regardless of the point at which they are dropped. At run time, the page can reposition relatively positioned elements based on the width of the end user's browser window.</P><p class=dt>
<b>Lock</b></p>
<p class=indent>
Prevents an absolutely positioned element from being inadvertently moved. This is a design-time only feature: Setting lock on an element does not hinder your ability to programmatically move an element at run time.</p>
<p class=dt>
<b>Absolute Position Mode</b></p>
<p class=indent>
Sets the page designer in either absolute or relative positioning mode by default. The default is applied to each element on the page as the element is created. In absolute positioning mode, all items you place on the page are positioned absolutely, according to x and y coordinates rather than according to where they appear in the HTML text. By default, this icon is selected when you add a designer.</p>
<p class=dt>
<b>Order</b></p>
<p class=indent>
Contains a series of options you can use to arrange the elements on a page in three-dimensional space. You can layer elements on top of or behind other elements, bring them to the front or back of a stack of elements, or place elements behind or in front of text.</p>
