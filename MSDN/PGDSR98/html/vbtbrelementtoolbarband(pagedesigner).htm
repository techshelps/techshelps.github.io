<p>
Contains buttons that are frequently used when grouping elements on the page or working with tables. You can click a toolbar button once to carry out the action represented by that button.</p>
<p>
With the exception of the Table Operations icon, the options on this toolbar band are available only when you have highlighted a selection of text or elements in the Detail pane, or when you select the Document or Body object or a DIV element in the treeview. The Table Operations icon is always available.</p>
<h3>Toolbar Buttons</h3>
<p class=dt>
<b>Wrap Selection in &lt;DIV&gt;…&lt;/DIV&gt;</b></p>
<p class=indent>
Creates an HTML DIV element around the currently selected element or elements by inserting &lt;DIV&gt; and &lt;/DIV&gt; tags before and after the selection. A DIV element is a grouping element used to allow you to perform operations on a range of HTML elements. DIV offsets the elements it contains by inserting a break after its closing tag. It is therefore not suited for use within a single paragraph or in situations where you do not want to introduce a new break onto the page. In these situations, use the SPAN tag.</p>
<p class=tl>
DIV elements are not automatically assigned an ID by Visual Basic. If you want to program the DIV you insert, you must assign a value to its ID property in the Properties window.</P><p class=dt>
<b>Wrap Selection in &lt;SPAN&gt;…&lt;/SPAN&gt;</b></p>
<p class=indent>
Creates an HTML SPAN element around the currently selected element or elements by inserting &lt;SPAN&gt; and &lt;/SPAN&gt; tags before and after the selection. A SPAN element is a grouping element that allows you to perform operations on a portion of an HTML element. Unlike DIV, SPAN does not insert a break or make any formatting changes to the elements it encloses. It is therefore well suited to grouping sections of text or elements that you do not want to offset.</p>
<p class=tl>
SPAN elements are not automatically assigned an ID by Visual Basic. If you want to program the SPAN you insert, you must assign a value to its ID property in the Properties window.</P><p class=dt>
<b>Make Selection Into Link</b></p>
<p class=indent>
Turns the selected text into a hyperlink by inserting the appropriate HTML tags before and after the selection. You define where the link should go when it is selected by setting the HREF property for the element or writing a code procedure.</p>
<p class=dt>
<b>Table Operations</b></p>
<p class=indent>
Contains a series of options that allow you to insert tables and manipulate their structure by adding, deleting, and rearranging their rows, columns, and cells.</p>
