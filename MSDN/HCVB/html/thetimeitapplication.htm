<p>
The Time It program is designed to answer performance questions. Its interface is simple, as you can see in Figure 1-1. You select a performance problem from a list box. Time It displays a description of the problem and the default number of iterations needed to run the test. You can modify the number of iterations. Click the Time It button (or double-click the list box item) to run the test. Nothing fancy. The goal of the Time It design is simply to make it easy to add new problems to the list box. (That turns out to be unexpectedly difficult in Visual Basic, but for now let’s look only at the mechanics of timing operations in Visual Basic and Windows.)</p>
