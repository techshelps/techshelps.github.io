According to Kemeny and Kurtz, omitting Let on any assignment is a sign of bad programming practice, and only Street Basics allow such horrible habits. The reason: Let distinguishes use of the equal sign (=) for assignment from its use for tests of equality. It’s true that Basic is the only popular modern language that overloads the equal sign to mean both assignment and equality. C uses = for assignment and == for equality. Pascal uses the symbol := for assignment and = for equality. In FORTRAN, = means assignment, and .EQ. means equality.</p>
<p>
If you think about it, <i>Let a = 1</i> is technically accurate. It also lets compilers op&shy;ti&shy;&shy;mize more efficiently. In other words, this pedantic nonsense makes perfect sense. Fortunately, Microsoft didn’t buy this argument, and neither should you.</p>
