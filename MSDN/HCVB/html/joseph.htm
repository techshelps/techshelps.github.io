<p>
He’s been programming in Basic since the first IBM PC rolled off the assembly line. Back in the days of BASICA, he learned to start all programs with <i>DefInt A-Z</i>. He still does. Most of his variables are integers, and he can simply make them up and use them on the fly. Same with strings and real numbers, except that he has to add $, !, and other type-declaration characters. Joseph never declares simple variables before use. He thinks that Dim is for arrays. It annoys him to have to use Dim for user-defined types, but he’s gotten used to that as just one more Basic anomaly. He finds it particularly useful to make up variables in the Debug window.</p>
<p>
Joseph is a disciplined coder with a complicated naming convention for variables. He doesn’t run into the misspelled-variable problem very often, and when he does, he has enough experience to track down the problem quickly. Joseph writes so much good code so quickly that many of the younger programmers try to imitate his style. Somehow it doesn’t work as well for them. They spend a lot of time debugging.</p>
