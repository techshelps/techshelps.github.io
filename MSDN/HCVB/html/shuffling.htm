<BR>
The opposite of sorting is shuffling, a common task in games. Shuffling means randomizing each element in an array. The trick is that each element must appear in the array once and only once, but in a random position. You can’t go through the array randomizing wildly, because you would end up with duplicate elements.</p>
<BR>
ShuffleArray uses the same helper object as SortArray. It uses the Swap method but doesn’t need the Compare method.</p>
<pre><code>Sub ShuffleArray(av() As Variant, Optional helper As ISortHelper)<BR>    Dim iFirst As Long, iLast As Long<BR>    If helper Is Nothing Then Set helper = New CSortHelper<BR>    <BR>    iFirst = LBound(av): iLast = UBound(av)<BR>    ‘ Randomize array<BR>    Dim i As Long, v As Variant, iRnd As Long<BR>    For i = iLast To iFirst + 1 Step -1<BR>        ‘ Swap random element with last element<BR>        iRnd = MRandom.Random(iFirst, i)<BR>        helper.Swap av(i), av(iRnd)<BR>    Next<BR>End Sub</code></pre>
<BR>
The algorithm works by choosing any random element between the first and last elements and exchanging it with the last element, which then is random. Next it finds a random element between the first and the next-to-last elements and exchanges it with the next-to-last element. This process continues until the shuffling is finished.</p>
<BR>
The Fun ’n Games program, which is discussed in Chapter 6, uses the Shuffle sub to shuffle a deck of cards.</p>
