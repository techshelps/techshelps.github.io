<p>
Visual Basic now allows you to declare events in your server with the Event statement and raise them with the RaiseEvent statement. Your client programs can receive events from a server using the WithEvents statement. That’s the <BR>easy way.</p>
<p>
You can also create events by defining an interface in the server and having the client implement the interface. The client must also pass a reference from the implementing object to the server so that the server can call the client, thus creating the events. That’s the efficient way.</p>
<p>
Either way, events are an important new class feature, but we’ll temporarily <BR>skip them.</p>
