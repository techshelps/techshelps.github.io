Wrong book. That’s a user interface problem, not a programming problem. But I can give you a few quick suggestions. Put up a dialog box telling users they are filthy, unwashed idiots with ugly children. Tell them they have just committed error <font face="Symbol"><span style="font-family:symbol">&#45;</span></font>2147211501 (&amp;H80042713). Display the message “I am unworthy,” and make them click OK. Then terminate the program, throwing all their wretched, unsaved work into the bit bin.</p>
<p>
But I digress. What I meant to recommend is that you read Alan Cooper’s book <i>About Face: The Essentials of User Interface Design</i> (IDG Books, 1995). His diatribe against bad error handling is more caustic than anything I could write, but he softens the blow by providing positive suggestions.</p>
