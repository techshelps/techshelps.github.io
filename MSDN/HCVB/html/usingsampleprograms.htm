<p>
The setup program on the companion CD sets up the sample source code to make it as easy as possible to use. All the components are installed and registered in the proper places automatically. Compiled versions of utility programs are installed on your disk for easy use, but simple test programs exist only in source format (to save disk space). The EXEs for all programs are on the companion CD, and you can run them from there.</p>
<p>
When you finish the setup, you’ll end up with a new directory called by default HardCore2. (You can override it.) This directory will contain Visual Basic Project (VBP) and Visual Basic Project Group (VBG) files for all the samples and components. If you want to step through the sample client program, load the VBP file. You’ll see client source, but use the compiled version of VBCore and any other components. If you load the VBG file, you’ll have access to the complete source for both the client and the components. Chapter 5 explains how this system works.</p>
