I used to think that no one had actually used Rem for comments since 1985. Recently, however, I encountered a long piece of complex Basic code that looked strangely like an MS-DOS batch file. All the comments were preceded by Rem. Please don’t do this. Basic is probably the only computer language ever invented that has a keyword to initiate comments. In the last version of this book, I suggested that if everyone would pretend that Rem doesn’t exist, maybe Microsoft would remove it in the next version. Not only did they not remove it, they carried the wretched thing over to Visual Basic, Scripting Edition. Yuck!</p>
