<p>
She came to Visual Basic from C. She thought that Basic was a toy language, and she wasn’t happy about being assigned to work with it. She still makes disparaging comments about Basic’s lack of pointers and its other limitations. Nevertheless, although she hates to admit it, she’s hooked. She gets more work done in Visual Basic than she ever imagined doing in C. But old habits die hard.</p>
<p>
She programs in Basic as if it were C. She always uses Option Explicit and declares every variable with an explicit data type. She never uses Variant. Susan thinks that type-declaration characters are an abomination and uses them only when absolutely necessary in constants. She doesn’t even know that DefInt is a legal statement.</p>
