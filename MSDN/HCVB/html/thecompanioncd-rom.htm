<p>
The code you see in this book is the tip of an iceberg. For every line shown, probably 10 more appear on the companion CD. It’s true that some of the code on the companion CD isn’t very interesting. You already know how to fill list boxes, open files, and respond to button clicks. But you’ll also find a lot of hardcore code. Some of this code is described but not shown in the book. Some of it you’ll have to find by exploring on your own. Most programmers will find something of value to use with their own programs, but code you can use is only one benefit. A more important goal is to show by example that you can do anything you want with Visual Basic.</p>
