<p>
Back in the old days before Microsoft Windows, there was MS-DOS. It was easy to start programming under MS-DOS, especially with Basic. You could go a long way without really understanding what you were doing. But if you wanted to program without limits, you had to learn about low memory, ports, and MS-DOS and BIOS interrupts. Visual Basic is the same way, but more so. If you’re serious, you have to get under the hood.</p>
<p>
In Windows programming, getting under the hood means learning about messages, windows, processes, and all the other elements of the Windows application programming interface (API). Unfortunately for Visual Basic programmers, you have to learn most of this stuff in another language—C. Just a few years ago, the idea of doing all your API work in Visual Basic seemed foolish. Sure, you could write Declare statements, even in version 1, but often it was easier to write or buy a DLL written in another language.</p>
<p>
That was the official line anyway, but lots of hardcore programmers never bought it. <i>Hardcore Visual Basic, Second Edition </i>tries to prove that you can indeed break through any API barrier if you have the right attitude and enough time for research and experimentation. You can judge for yourself, but I think I did prove it, even in some cases where the time spent could hardly justify the benefits gained. But if you buy this book, you get the benefit of my experiments without expending the time and brain cells.</p>
