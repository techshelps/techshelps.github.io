<H2>Custom Message Types for Schedule+</H2><P>When you invite people to attend a meeting or when you reserve a resource, Schedule+ automatically prepares a <I>Request form</I>. When you respond to someone else's meeting request, Schedule+ generates a <I>Response form</I>. This section describes the forms Schedule+ automatically generates and the custom message types associated with each.</P>
<P>Mail enables you to create and use custom message types to send specific kinds of messages, as described in Chapter 8, "Mail." Schedule+ uses this feature to define meeting requests, meeting responses, and meeting cancellations. In the Registry, Schedule+ defines five message types in the Mail\Custom Messages subkey in the Registry:</P>
<UL><LI>     Meeting Request (defined as message type IPM.Microsoft Schedule.MtgReq)</LI><LI>     Positive Meeting Response (defined as message type IPM.Microsoft Schedule.MtgRespP)</LI><LI>     Negative Meeting Response (defined as message type IPM.Microsoft Schedule.MtgRespN)</LI><LI>     Tentative Meeting Response (defined as message type IPM.Microsoft Schedule.MtgRespA)</LI><LI>     Meeting Cancellation (defined as message type IPM.Microsoft Schedule.MtgCncl)</LI></UL><P>These message types create special Request and Response forms that you can use to schedule meetings with others in your workgroup. For example, when you add a new appointment, choose a time, and specify attendees, the Send Request form shown in the following dialog box is displayed automatically.</P>

<P>This message is deposited in the Outbox and sent to users just as any Mail message would be sent. </P>
<P>When a meeting attendee accepts the meeting, another automatic form, called the Response form, is generated and sent as a Mail message. Three variations of the Response form (Positive, Negative, and Tentative) are defined by custom message types defined by Schedule+. These three message types define the Response forms and a portion of the response message (such as "I might attend," shown in the Response form). They also add Yes:, No:, or Tentative: to the front of the original request title to create a response-message title. When the messages are displayed in the recipient's Messages window, these custom message types also display symbols (<FONT FACE="symbol">ü</FONT>, <B>X</B>, or <B>?</B>) to the left of each message to make it easy to see responses at a glance.</P>
<P><img src="XRGE03.gif"></P>
<P>Because meeting messages are sent using Mail facilities, they can be viewed from within Schedule+ or from within Mail. Only one copy of each message is maintained; however, because what appear to be duplicates are really only pointers to the original. So when you delete the message in one view, it is also deleted in the other.</P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
