<H2>Overview of Schedule+ Architecture</H2><P>Schedule+ is an example of a Mail-enabled application. It relies on Mail for certain functions, including support for logging on, accessing Mail's address book, and sending and receiving messages. </P>
<P>Because Schedule+ relies on Mail for key functionality, there is no special Schedule+ server. User account information for Mail is automatically translated  to Schedule+ accounts. </P>
<P>Figure 9.1 illustrates the key components that make up Schedule+.</P>

<P>Figure 9.1    Schedule+ Architecture</P>
<P>As shown in Figure 9.1, Schedule+ maintains both an online calendar and an offline calendar, so you can use Schedule+ as a stand-alone application or as a networked application. The <I>offline calendar</I> (.CAL) file on your hard disk is read by the program when you start Schedule+ locally. As you make changes to your calendar, those changes are written to disk immediately.</P>
<P>When you use Schedule+ online, it uses the <I>online calendar</I> (.CAL) file in the WGPO\CAL directory of the workgroup postoffice. When run online, Schedule+ uses Mail to send meeting messages and to provide name service and logon support.</P>
<P>A separate program, <I>Reminder</I> (MSRMND32.EXE), is used to notify you of Schedule+ appointments. This application is typically installed in the Windows&nbsp;NT Startup group and runs in the background (it can alternately be launched by Schedule+). When it is included in the Startup group, as soon as you log on to Windows&nbsp;NT you are prompted to supply your Mail logon name and password. The same logon is shared by Reminder, Schedule+, and Mail. </P>
<P>The next few sections discuss the components shown in Figure 9.1 that make up Schedule+.</P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
