<H1>Registry Value Entries</H1><P>Wherever possible, you should use the Control Panel and the applications in the Administrative Tools program group to make changes to the system configuration. For those occasions when you need to view or adjust a setting, this chapter identifies the Registry entries that you can add or change using the Registry Editor. </P>
<P>In this chapter, entries for Registry values are listed alphabetically within the following groups of topics:</P>
<UL><LI>     Summaries of entries in the Select, Control, and Services subkeys in HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet</LI><LI>     Network adapter cards, drivers, and bindings</LI><LI>     Device drivers, with entries for disk, serial, and parallel port devices; keyboard and mouse devices; SCSI miniport devices; and video display devices</LI><LI>     Services, with entries for the Alerter, AppleTalk and Macfile, DLC, Eventlog, NetBEUI (NBF) transport, Netlogon, Replicator, Server, NWLink, TCP/IP, UPS, and Workstation services</LI><LI>     Mail and Schedule+</LI><LI>     User preferences</LI><LI>     Fonts and printing</LI><LI>     Windows&nbsp;NT subsystems</LI></UL><P><B>Caution</B>   Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems, including corruption that may make it necessary to reinstall Windows&nbsp;NT.</P>
<P>Not all entries that appear here may be found in the Registry for a particular computer. For many entries, the system uses the default value unless you add the entry to the Registry and specify another value.</P>
<P>The information in this chapter appears in the following format:</P>
<P><B>Entry Name     REG_type    </B><I> Range for value entry</I></P>
<P>A description of the entry, usually including the conditions under which you might change the value.</P>
<P>Default:  <I>value<BR></I>(For value ranges that are Boolean, the value can be <B>1</B> for true or "enabled," or <B>0</B> for false or "disabled.") </P>
<P>In general, if you change values for any entries in the CurrentControlSet, you must restart the computer for the changes to take effect. </P>
<P>If you change values for entries under HKEY_CURRENT_USER using Registry Editor, you may have to log off and log back on for the changes to take effect. </P>
<P><B>Note</B>   You'll find a navigational hint at the bottom corner of each page, indicating which service or portion of the Registry is described on that page.</P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
