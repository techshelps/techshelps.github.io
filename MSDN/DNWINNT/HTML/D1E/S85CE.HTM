<H3>How To Enroll</H3><P>The Microsoft Developer Network Level 1 annual membership fee is $195 U.S. ($275 Canadian) plus shipping and tax. The Level 2 annual membership fee is $495 U.S. ($695 Canadian) plus shipping and tax. If you are already a member of the Developer Network Level 1, you can upgrade to Level 2 for $395 U.S. ($555 Canadian). Upgrading ends your Level 1 membership and starts a one-year Level 2 membership, so you'll receive four quarterly updates to the Development Platform and the Development Library. </P>
<P>To join in the U.S. or Canada, call (800) 759-5474 (24 hours a day, seven days a week). Outside North America, please call (303) 684-0914 or contact your local Microsoft subsidiary directly.</P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
