<H2>Sources of Troubleshooting Information</H2><P>Your Windows&nbsp;NT documentation set is a valuable source of troubleshooting information. The <I>Installation Guide</I> for Windows&nbsp;NT Workstations, the <I>Installation Guide</I> for Windows&nbsp;NT Server, and the <I>Upgrade Guide</I> each  have a chapter titled "Troubleshooting." </P>
<P>The Messages database and book that is shipped with Windows&nbsp;NT and with this resource kit is another source of troubleshooting information. Thousands of messages are documented, with the probable cause and recommended solution to each of them. In particular, the STOP messages that appear when the system fails with a blue screen are documented in <I>Windows NT Messages</I>.</P>
<P>The Event Log lets you examine the events that preceded the problem. Use the Event Viewer to examine this log, as described in your <I>Windows&nbsp;NT</I> <I>System Guide</I>. </P>
<P>The Knowledge Base is a database of tips, hints, and solutions to known problems. It is created and maintained by Microsoft Product Support, and is included with this resource kit. See the /KB directory in your <I>Windows&nbsp;NT Resource Kit</I> distribution files.</P>
<P>Some of the chapters in this <I>Resource Guide</I> end with a "Question and Answer" section that is often a good source of troubleshooting information.</P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
