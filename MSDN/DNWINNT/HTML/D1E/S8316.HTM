<H1>Windows&nbsp;NT Security Model </H1><P>Security in Windows&nbsp;NT was included as part of the initial design specifications for Windows&nbsp;NT and is pervasive throughout the operating system. The security model includes components to control who accesses which objects (such as files and shared printers), which actions an individual can take on an object, and which events are audited.</P>
<P>This chapter provides an overview of the security model and describes the components that make up the model. It also explains how Windows&nbsp;NT tracks each user and each securable object. This overview helps you understand system messages and information found in the Event Viewer. This chapter also provides examples of Windows&nbsp;NT security, showing how Windows&nbsp;NT validates access requests and how it audits activities performed on protected objects.</P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
