<H3>Auditing Security Events in the Security Log</H3><P>Windows&nbsp;NT auditing features can record events to show which users  access which objects, what type of access is being attempted, and whether  or not the access attempt was successful. You can view audited security events through Event Viewer by selecting Security from the Log menu. (For complete information about how to use Event Viewer, see the chapter on Event Viewer in either the <I>Microsoft Windows&nbsp;NT System Guide </I>or the<I> Microsoft Windows&nbsp;NT Advanced Server System Guide</I>.)</P>
<P>You can see detailed information about a particular audited event in the security log by double-clicking on that event.</P>

<P>To set up auditing on your computer, use the Auditing and Security options in  the User Manager, File Manager, Print Manager, and other tools. From these tools, you can specify the types of auditing events you want to include in the security log. For more information about setting auditing options within these tools, see the Windows&nbsp;NT documentation.</P>
<P><B>Note</B>   While Event Viewer is adequate for most requirements, the security  model is defined so that developers can write their own custom security event viewer/monitor. For details on Windows&nbsp;NT security-related APIs, see the <I>Microsoft Win32 Software Development Kit. </I></P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
