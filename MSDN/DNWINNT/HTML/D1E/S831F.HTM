<H3>Types of Objects</H3><P>The type of permissions that can be granted or denied for an object depends  on the object's type. For example, you can specify permissions like Manage Documents and Print for a printer queue, while for a directory you can specify Read, Write, Execute, and so on.</P>
<P>Another quality that affects the permissions of an object is whether that object is a container object or a noncontainer object. A <I>container object</I> is one that logically contains other objects; <I>noncontainer</I> objects do not contain other objects. For example, a directory is a container object that logically contains files and other directories. Files are noncontainer objects. This distinction between container and noncontainer objects is important because objects within a container object can inherit certain permissions from the parent container. For more information, see "Access Control Inheritance," later in this chapter. </P>
<P><B>Note</B>   NTFS (described in Chapter 5, "Windows NT File Systems and Advanced Disk Management") supports the inheritance of ACLs from directory objects to file objects that are created within the directory. </P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
