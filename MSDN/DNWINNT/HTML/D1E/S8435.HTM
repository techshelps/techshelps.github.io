<H3>Recurrence Patterns</H3><P>The recurrence pattern is defined by three fields that, in combination, define the following recurrence patterns: daily, weekly, biweekly, monthly defined by a pattern, monthly defined by a date, yearly defined by a pattern, and yearly defined by a date.</P>
<P>The three fields used to define the recurrence types and patterns are describe in the following table.</P>

<P>All bits are T in the case of a monthly or yearly recurrence defined by the specific date. In the daily-every weekday recurrence or the monthly or yearly recurrences defined as the <I>x</I> weekday, the first and seventh bits are F, and all others are T. In the monthly or yearly recurrence where field 2 is weekend day (see the description of fields below), the first and seventh bits are T and all others are F.

If you look at the choices for the monthly recurrence in Schedule+, you'll see that the pattern is defined by two fields. For example, a monthly appointment can be on the first (field 1) weekday (field 2) of the month. The yearly pattern is defined by three fields. The first two are the same as the monthly fields, and field 3 is the month of the year. <B>IWeek</B> is followed by five bits with T or F; only one of these bits can be T. Field 2 of the monthly or yearly recurrence pattern is defined by <B>bgrfValidDows</B>. For example, if field 2 is a weekday, <B>bgrfValidDows</B> would be FTTTTTF.
