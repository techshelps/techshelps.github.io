<H3>Providers Entries for Mail</H3><P>Entries in the Providers subkey for Mail define settings that service providers use with Microsoft Mail front-end programs. For this release, there are service providers for Microsoft Mail for PC LANs. Service providers for other mail systems may be available later.</P>
<P>This is the Registry path for this subkey:</P>
<P><BR></P>
<pre><code>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Mail\Providers</code></pre>
<P><B>Logon     REG_SZ     </B><I>DLL name</I></P>
<P>Identifies a single DLL that contains the logon and session management code for your mail system. This value is often, but not necessarily, the same as the <B>Transport</B> and <B>Name</B> entries. This value is the base name of the DLL, without the .DLL filename extension, but include a path if the DLL is not in a directory on the user's path or in the directory containing the Mail executable file.</P>
<P>Default:  MSSFS32</P>
<P><B>Name     REG_SZ     </B><I>DLL name</I></P>
<P>Identifies one or more DLLs that contain functions required to browse system and personal user lists. One of the values is often, but not necessarily, the same as the <B>Logon</B> and <B>Transport</B> entries. Enter the base name of the DLL, without the .DLL filename extension, but include a path if the DLL is not in a directory on the user's path or in the directory containing the Mail executable file.</P>
<P>The order of providers in this entry is significant. When Mail is attempting to resolve ambiguous names typed in a message and finds an exact match in the first provider in the list, it will not go on to query the rest. Placing the personal address book provider first can save time in that process.</P>
<P>Default:  MSSFS32  PABNSP32 </P>
<P><B>SharedFolders     REG_SZ     </B><I>DLL name</I></P>
<P>Identifies a single DLL that contains functions required to read and write messages in Microsoft PC Mail shared folders.</P>
<P>Default:  MSSFS32 (It is unlikely that any DLL other than MSSFS will have this functionality.)</P>
<P><B>Transport     REG_SZ     </B><I>DLL name</I></P>
<P>Identifies a single DLL that contains the functions necessary to send and receive mail on your mail system. It is often, but not necessarily, the same as the <B>Logon</B> and <B>Name</B> entries. Enter the base name of the DLL, without the .DLL filename extension, but include a path if the DLL is not in a directory on the user's path or in the directory containing the Mail executable file.</P>
<P>Default:  MSSFS32</P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
