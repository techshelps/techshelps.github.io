<H2>Questions and Answers About Schedule+</H2><P>This section answers some common questions about Schedule+.</P>
<UL><LI>     Does Schedule+ support OLE or attachments (such as a meeting schedule)?
<P>No, but Mail does. You can create a message to invite attendees to a meeting and refer them to a separate Mail message that includes OLE objects and/or attachments.</P></LI><LI>     Does Schedule+ include all hours of each day as valid meeting times when the auto-pick feature is used to search for a meeting time?
<P>To determine a meeting time, auto-pick only looks at weekdays (Monday–Friday) within the time defined by your start-work and end-work settings in the General Options command. Schedule+ looks only at the meeting initiator's settings to determine valid times. Schedule+ doesn't recognize the nonworking hours of other users, and you aren't able to define days other than Saturday or Sunday as nonworking days.</P></LI><LI>     Does Schedule+ support recurring meetings? For example, I'd like to schedule a weekly meeting with my group.
<P>Schedule+ supports recurring <I>appointments</I>, but not recurring <I>meetings</I>. Schedule+ also doesn't support recurring meeting requests. Instead, you must request the meeting for a single occurrence and then remind the attendees to use the Recurring Appointment command to enter it for each week. Alternately, you can ask everyone attending your weekly meeting to set up their own recurring appointment for that time each week.</P></LI><LI>     Are there options for altering the time and date displays (for example, using a 24-hour clock or a European date format)?
<P>Yes. From the Windows&nbsp;NT Control Panel, double-click the International icon. In the International dialog box, you can specify the format used for the date and the time, which will affect the displays in Schedule+ also.</P></LI><LI>     Does Schedule+ support customized reminder sounds?
<P>Yes. From the Windows&nbsp;NT Control Panel, double-click the Sound icon. In the Sound dialog box, select the sound you want to assign to the Schedule+ Reminders. (You must have a suitable wave output device and driver installed on your computer.)</P></LI><LI>     Because each resource requires a user account, does this mean that each resource requires a user license?
<P>No. Microsoft's licensing is per computer running the software, not per user account used. </P></LI><LI>     What are the dimensions of the print sizes in Schedule+?
<P>The formats are designed to match the most popular appointment book sizes. They are the following:</P>


<UL><LI>     Standard (8.5 inches by 11.5 inches)</LI><LI>     Junior (5.5 inches by 8.5 inches)</LI><LI>     Pocket (3.75 inches by 6.75 inches)</LI></UL></LI><LI>     Are meetings scheduled by somebody else distinguished in any way?
<P>Yes. If you double-click an appointment created by someone else, the name of the person who created it will be indicated at the bottom of the appointment details. However, the appointment is not identified differently by an icon or special color in the appointment book.</P></LI><LI>     How can I view or modify someone else's calendar?
<P>Schedule+ enables you to grant access privileges to other users with the Set Access Privileges command from the Options menu. Once you have assigned privileges to another user, that user can view your calendar while signed in under his or her own account by choosing Open Other's Appt. Book from the File menu.</P></LI><LI>     What is the difference between the "Modify" and the "Assistant" privileges?
<P>The modify privilege is part of the set of privileges granted to your assistant. In addition to modifying privileges, the assistant can send meeting messages on your behalf by requesting a meeting while viewing your calendar. The assistant also receives meeting messages designated for you and can respond to them on your behalf.</P></LI><LI>     When I specify someone as my Schedule+ assistant, do we both receive meeting messages for my meetings, or does only my assistant receive them?
<P>You have the ability to specify either of the above. If you select General Options from the Options menu, you will see a check box that specifies Send Meeting Messages Only To My Assistant.</P></LI><LI>     Because I can view the meeting request messages from Mail or Schedule+, does this mean that there are actually two messages?
<P>No. The Schedule+ Messages box and the Mail Inbox just provide two views of the same message. The message is only stored in one place. When you delete it from one view, it is deleted in the other view.</P></LI></UL></FONT></BODY></HTML>
