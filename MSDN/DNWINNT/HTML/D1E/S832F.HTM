<H3>Audit Determination</H3><P>Windows&nbsp;NT has an audit determination process similar to its access determination process, described earlier in this chapter. Following access determination, Windows&nbsp;NT evaluates the following information for possible auditing:</P>
<UL><LI>     The subject attempting the access (that is, the set of identifiers representing  the subject)</LI><LI>     The desired accesses with all generic access types mapped to standard and specific access types</LI><LI>     The final determination of whether access is granted or denied</LI><LI>     The audit ACL associated with the target object</LI></UL><P>Each ACE in the audit ACL is evaluated as follows:</P>
<OL><LI>    Windows&nbsp;NT checks to see if the type is SystemAudit. If not, the ACE is skipped.</LI><LI>    Windows&nbsp;NT compares the identifier in the ACE to the set of identifiers representing the subject. If no match is found, the ACE is skipped.</LI><LI>    The desired accesses are compared to the access mask specified in the ACE. </LI><LI>    If none of the accesses specified in the ACE's mask were requested,  the ACE is skipped. The SUCCESSFUL_ACCESS_ACE_FLAG and FAILED_ACCESS_ACE_FLAG flags of the ACE are compared to the  final determination of whether access was granted or denied. </LI><LI>    If access was granted but the SUCCESSFUL_ACCESS_ACE_FLAG flag is not set, or if access was denied but the FAILED_ACCESS_ACE_FLAG flag is not set, the ACE is skipped.</LI></OL><P>If Windows&nbsp;NT performs all of these steps successfully, an audit message is generated.</P>
<P>The scenario shown below illustrates this process. In this scenario, a system access ACL is being evaluated. Here, Write access to the file object is granted, and the SUCCESSFUL_ACCESS_ACE_FLAG is set in each ACE.</P>

<P>In this example, Windows&nbsp;NT evaluates the ACL by comparing the desired access mask with each ACE and processes the desired mask as follows:</P>
<OL><LI>    Windows&nbsp;NT evaluates an ACE for SnrMgrs (of which FredMgr is a member). However, when the desired access is compared to the access  mask of the ACE, no match is found, and the ACE is skipped.</LI><LI>    Windows&nbsp;NT evaluates the ACE for FredMgr and finds a match.</LI><LI>    Windows&nbsp;NT checks access flags and finds the SUCCESSFUL_ACCESS_ACE_FLAG is set. Processing stops, and an audit message is generated.</LI></OL><P></P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
