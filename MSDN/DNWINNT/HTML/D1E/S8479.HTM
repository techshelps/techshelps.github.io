<H2>Maintaining the Registry </H2><P>Windows&nbsp;NT enforces access control on Registry files, so it is difficult for users to accidentally or intentionally damage or delete hives on a running system. While the system is running, hive files are kept open by the system for exclusive access on all file systems. If the Windows&nbsp;NT <I>SystemRoot</I> is not on an NTFS volume, the Registry files can be tampered with—specifically, users can remove hives for user profiles that aren't currently loaded. With NTFS, such tampering can be prevented.</P>
<P>You should plan how you will protect the Registry for each Windows&nbsp;NT computer at your site. This section describes how to ensure that you will have working Registry files under most conditions.</P>
<P>For more details about how to ensure recoverability under all conditions, see "Making Sure the System Always Starts" in Chapter&nbsp;12, "Configuration Management and the Registry."</P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
