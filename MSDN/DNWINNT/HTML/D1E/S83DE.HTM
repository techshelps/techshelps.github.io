<H2>About Typography in Windows&nbsp;NT </H2><P>A <I>typeface</I> is a set of characters that share common characteristics such as stroke width and the presence or absence of serifs. For example, Arial and Courier are both typefaces. Frequently, both the typeface and its name are copyrighted and/or trademarked by the typeface designer or manufacturer.</P>
<P>In Windows&nbsp;NT, a <I>font</I> is the name of a typeface, excluding attributes such as bold or italic. This general definition is more widely used than the traditional definition associated with traditional typography. For example, MS Serif is a font in Windows&nbsp;NT.</P>
<P>In Windows&nbsp;NT, a <I>font family</I> refers to a group of typefaces with similar characteristics. The families that Windows&nbsp;NT recognizes for font installation  and mapping are Roman, Swiss, Modern, Script, and Decorative. For example,  the sans serif typefaces Arial, Arial Bold, Arial Bold Italic, Arial Italic, Small Fonts, and MS Sans Serif are all part of the Swiss font family.</P>
<P>For printing and display in a computer system, each font has its own character  set according to the ASCII, ANSI, or original equipment manufacturer (OEM) standard or other industry standard that defines what character is represented  by a specific keystroke. Windows&nbsp;NT uses the ANSI character set. Many non-Windows&nbsp;NT-based applications use the ASCII character set or the OEM character set. </P>
<P>The following basic terms are used in Windows&nbsp;NT to define the appearance of a font in an application:</P>
<UL><LI>     <I>Font style</I> refers to specific characteristics of the font. The four characteristics you can define for fonts in Windows&nbsp;NT are italic, bold, bold italic, and roman. (Roman is often referred to as Normal or Regular in font dialog boxes).</LI><LI>     <I>Font size</I> refers to the vertical point size of a font, where a point is about 1/72 of an inch. Typical sizes for text are 10-point and 12-point.</LI><LI>     <I>Font effects</I> refers to attributes such as underlining, strikeout, and color that can be applied to text in many applications.</LI></UL><P>The following terms are also used to describe fonts and typefaces:</P>
<UL><LI>     <I>Spacing</I> can be either fixed or proportional. In a <I>fixed font</I>, such as Courier, every character occupies the same amount of space. In <I>a proportional font</I>,  such as Arial or Times New Roman&reg;, character width varies.</LI><LI>     <I>Pitch</I> refers to the amount of horizontal space used for each character of  fixed-width fonts. This is often specified in characters-per-inch (CPI), typically where 10-pitch equals 12-point, 12-pitch equals 10-point, and 15-pitch equals 8-point type. (Some fonts use other equivalencies.)</LI><LI>     <I>Serif</I> and <I>sans serif </I>describe specific characteristics of a typeface. Serif fonts, such as Times New Roman or Courier, have projections that extend from the upper and lower strokes of the letters. Sans serif fonts, such as Arial and MS Sans Serif, do not have serifs.</LI><LI>     <I>Slant</I> refers to the angle of a font's characters, which can be italic or roman  (no slant). </LI><LI>     <I>Weight</I> refers to the heaviness of the stroke for a specific font, such as Light, Regular, Book, Demi, Heavy, Black, and Extra Bold.</LI><LI>     <I>Width</I> refers to whether the standard typeface has been extended or compressed horizontally. The common variations are Condensed, Normal, or Expanded. </LI><LI>     <I>X-height</I> refers to the vertical size of lowercase characters.</LI></UL></FONT></BODY></HTML>
