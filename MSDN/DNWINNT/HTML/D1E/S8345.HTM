<H2>Customizing Setup</H2><P>This section discusses how to customize the setup files on a distribution share.</P>
<P>The files on the Windows NT installation CD cannot, of course, be altered because you would have to create a custom CD. Also, it is not recommended that you try to alter the files on the Windows NT installation disk set because the altered files might be larger than the original installation files; thus, reassigning disk numbers to numerous files can quickly become a daunting task.</P>
<P>It is recommended that you perform a plain installation on a new computer, and then use the network to upgrade to your custom installation. However, if you simply want to add a few files to a floppy disk installation set, you can put them in an additional disk, and specify the disk and the files in the [Media] and [Files] sections of the TXTSETUP.SIF file. Where the file is named in the [Files] section, specify that it be copied always, as described under "Format of the TXTSETUP.SIF File" earlier in this chapter.</P>
<P></P>
<P><B>Caution</B></P>
<P>Be careful when making modifications to the .SIF and .INF files. Troubleshooting changes made to these files is quite difficult. Setup is unforgiving about incorrect syntax in its instructions. Never modify the original file; always make a backup copy. When you get part of your changes working, make a backup copy of the working file.</P>
<P>Making changes to these files is <I>not</I> supported by Microsoft Product Support Services. This information is only provided for your reference.</P>
