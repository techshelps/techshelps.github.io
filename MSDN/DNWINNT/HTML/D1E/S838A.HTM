<H2>NTFS</H2><P>NTFS provides a combination of performance, reliability, and compatibility not found in either FAT or HPFS. It is designed to quickly perform standard file operations such as read, write, and search — and even advanced operations such as file-system recovery — on very large hard disks. </P>
<P>It also includes security features required for file servers and high-end personal computers in a corporate environment. NTFS supports data access control and ownership privileges that are important for the integrity of corporate data. While directories shared by a Windows&nbsp;NT Server are assigned particular permissions, NTFS files and directories can have assigned permissions whether they are shared or not. NTFS is the only file system on Windows&nbsp;NT that allows you to assign permissions to individual files. </P>
<P>NTFS has a simple, yet very powerful design. From the file system's perspective, everything on the NTFS volume is a file or part of a file. Every sector on an NTFS volume that is allocated belongs to some file. Even the file system metadata (information that describes the file system itself) is part of a file. </P>
<P>This attribute-based file system supports object-oriented applications by treating all files as objects that have user-defined and system-defined attributes.</P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
