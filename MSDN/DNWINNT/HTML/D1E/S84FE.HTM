<H3>Browser Service Entries</H3><P>The parameters that control network bindings for the Browser service are described in "NetRules Subkey Entries," earlier in this chapter.</P>
<P>Under the following Registry path, two parameters are found:</P>
<P><BR></P>
<pre><code>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Browser\Parameters</code></pre>
<P><B>CacheHitLimit     REG_DWORD     </B><I>0 to 256</I></P>
<P>Describes the number of NetServerEnum requests required to qualify that the response to a NetServerEnum request be cached. If the browser receives more than <B>CacheHitLimit</B> NetServerEnum requests with a particular set of parameters, it caches the response and returns that value to the client.</P>
<P>Default:  1</P>
<P><B>CacheResponseSize     REG_DWORD     </B><I>0 to xffffffff</I></P>
<P>Specifies the maximum number of responses kept for each transport. To disable this feature, set this value to 0.</P>
<P>Default:  10</P>
<P><B>IsDomainMasterBrowser     REG_SZ     </B><I>Boolean</I></P>
<P>For TCP/IP, specifies a workstation within a workgroup which can be included in global LMHOSTS file. When this parameter is set to Yes, it forces the elevation of a workstation's priority for the browser. This helps with WAN browsing.</P>
<P>This value should be set on a few systems for the workgroup, placing mappings for each in the global LMHOSTS file. For example, in a workgroup with 20 members, set this value on three of the computers to earn a better chance to act as master browsers. This facilitates remote browsing ability for workstations in remote domains whose domain master browser has successful mappings for these special workgroup members.</P>
<P><B>MaintainServerList     REG_SZ     </B><I>Boolean or Auto</I></P>
<P>If this value is No, this server is not a browse server. If this value is Yes, this server becomes a browse server. It attempts to contact the Master Browse Server to get a current browse list. If it cannot find the Master Browse Server, it forces an election and is, of course, a candidate to become the master. </P>
<P>If <B>MaintainServerList</B> is Auto, this server may or may not become a browse server, depending on the results of the Registry exchange with the Master Browse Server. </P>
<P>If <B>MaintainServerList</B> is set to Yes, the computer is configured to always be a backup browser.</P>
<P>Default:  Auto, if none is present. (This server contacts the Master Browse Server, and the Master Browse Server tells this server whether it should become a browse server.)  </P>
<P><B>QueryDriverFrequency     REG_DWORD     </B><I>0 to 900</I></P>
<P>Indicates the time after which a browser master will invalidate its NetServerEnum response cache and the frequency that a master browser will query the browser driver to retrieve the list of servers. Increasing this time makes browsing somewhat faster, but browse information will not necessarily be 100 percent accurate to the minute. Lowering this time makes browse response more accurate, but will increase the CPU load on the browse master.</P>
<P>Default:  30</P>
<P>The following Browser driver parameters are found under this Registry path for the Datagram Receiver:</P>
<P><BR></P>
<pre><code>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\DGRcvr\Parameters</code></pre>
<P><B>BrowserServerDeletionThreshold     REG_DWORD</B></P>
<P><B>BrowserDomainDeletionThreshold        REG_DWORD    </B><I>0 to 0xffffffff</I></P>
<P>If more than <B>BrowserServerDeletionThreshold</B> servers (or <B>BrowserDomainDeletionThreshold</B>) servers (or domains) are flushed in a 30-second interval, this will cause an event to be generated. </P>
<P>Default:  0xffffffff </P>
<P><B>FindMasterTimeout     REG_DWORD    </B><I>0 to 0xfffffff</I></P>
<P>Specifies the maximum number of seconds that FindMaster requests should be allowed to take. If you have a slow LAN, you may want to increase this value (but only if directed by Microsoft Product Support services).</P>
<P>Default:  0xffffffff </P>
<P><B>GetBrowserListThreshold     REG_DWORD     </B><I>Number</I></P>
<P>Represents the threshold that the Browser uses before logging an error indicating that too many of these requests have been "missed." If more requests than the value of <B>GetBrowserServerList</B> are missed in an hour, the Browser logs an event indicating that this has happened. </P>
<P>Default:  0xffffffff (That is, never log events.)</P>
<P><B>MailslotDatagramThreshold      REG_DWORD     </B><I>Number</I></P>
<P>Represents the threshold that the Browser uses before logging an error indicating that too many of these requests have been "missed." If more mailslots than the value of <B>MailslotDatagramThreshold</B> are missed in an hour, the Browser logs an event indicating that this has happened. </P>
<P>Default:  0xffffffff (That is, never log events.)</P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
