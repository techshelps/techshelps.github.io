<H3>PostScript Printer Fonts</H3><P>Adobe Type 1 PostScript fonts are scalable outlines that can be printed at any size. PostScript outline fonts can also be rotated to any angle and can be printed in both portrait and landscape modes. However, font size limits are often imposed by applications. A common PostScript font size limit in an application is 127 points.</P>
<P>Most PostScript printers include either the standard Apple LaserWriter Plus set of 35 scalable fonts or the earlier Apple LaserWriter set of 17 fonts. </P>
<P>Type 1 fonts are installed in the Fonts icon in Control Panel. When you install the font, Windows&nbsp;NT gives you the option of creating an equivalent TrueType font for use as a screen font.</P>
<P>PostScript printers can print Windows&nbsp;NT raster screen fonts, vector screen fonts, TrueType fonts, or Type 1 fonts.</P>
<H4><A NAME="sec0"></A>LaserWriter Plus Typefaces</H4><P>The LaserWriter Plus standard font set includes eleven typefaces, including the following eight, which are available in roman, bold, italic, and bold italic:</P>
<UL><LI>     AvantGarde Gothic</LI><LI>     Helvetica</LI><LI>     ITC Bookman&reg;</LI><LI>     Palatino&reg;</LI><LI>     Courier</LI><LI>     Helvetica Narrow</LI><LI>     New Century Schoolbook</LI><LI>     Times</LI></UL><P>The other three typefaces are Symbol, Zapf Chancery, and Zapf Dingbats. The Symbol typeface contains mathematical and scientific symbols; Zapf Chancery is a calligraphic font; and Zapf Dingbats contains decorative bullet characters and embellishments. These typefaces are available only in roman style. </P>
<H4><A NAME="sec1"></A>PostScript Printers and TrueType</H4><P>TrueType fonts are treated as downloaded fonts by the PostScript driver. When you use TrueType fonts on a PostScript printer, scaling and hints are always performed in the computer. Scan conversion can be done in the computer or in the printer, depending on the point size. At smaller point sizes, TrueType performs scan conversion in the computer; at larger point sizes, scan conversion is done in the printer.</P>
<P>You can map a TrueType font to a PostScript font by using the FontSubst option in Print Manager. (Choose Properties from the Printer menu, and then choose Setup to see this option.) This is helpful to view TrueType as a screen font and to get PostScript for the printout font. This will increase printing speed, but the results on the display may not be exactly the same as the printed output. </P>
<P>Alternately, you can choose to download TrueType fonts as soft fonts to the printer, so that the printed output matches the screen display. (In Print Manager, specify your printer and choose Properties from the Printer menu. Then, in order, choose these three command buttons: Details, Job Defaults, Options. Select the Download TrueType Fonts as Softfont option button.)</P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
