<H1>Windows&nbsp;NT Architecture</H1><P>When users first look at Microsoft&reg; Windows&nbsp;NT&trade;, they notice the familiar Windows 3.<I>x</I> interface. But what is visible to users is only a small part of Windows&nbsp;NT — a host of powerful features lie beneath the surface.</P>
<P>Windows&nbsp;NT is a preemptive, multitasking operating system based on a 32-bit design. It includes security and networking services as fundamental components of the base operating system. Windows&nbsp;NT also provides compatibility with many other operating systems, file systems, and networks. This operating system runs on both complex instruction set computing (CISC) and reduced instruction set computing (RISC) processors. Windows&nbsp;NT also supports high-performance computing by providing kernel support for computers that have symmetric multiprocessor configurations.</P>
<P>Windows&nbsp;NT only looks familiar. This chapter describes the powerful features under the graphical user interface. It provides an overview by introducing the Windows&nbsp;NT components and showing how they interrelate. Other chapters  in this book provide the details, explaining more about particular components  such as the Windows&nbsp;NT security model, integrated networking features and connectivity options, Windows&nbsp;NT file systems, the printing system, and the Registry.</P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
