<H2>Network Settings in the Registry</H2><P>When a network component is installed, various information is added to the Registry. Each network component is represented in two distinct areas of the Registry:</P>
<UL><LI>     Software registration keys for the component's driver and adapter card under HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE</LI><LI>     Service registration keys for the component's driver and adapter under HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM</LI></UL><P>The following sections describe the general organization and content of the software and service registration information for network components and then conclude with information about bindings for network components and dependency handling.</P>
<P><B>Note</B>   The information in this section is provided for informational purposes, so that you can easily find entries in the Registry. All changes to settings for network adapters and supporting software should be made by choosing the Network icon in Control Panel, not by directly editing values in the Registry.</P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
