<H2>Adding and Removing Windows&nbsp;NT Components, A-D Files</H2><P>You can use the Windows&nbsp;NT Setup program to add and remove various components that are not essential to the operation of Windows&nbsp;NT. For example, you might want to remove some non-essential Windows files to free up space on your hard disk, or add components you previously removed or that you did not install during initial setup. You can decide at any time to add or remove all or part of components such as README files, accessories, games, screen savers, and wallpaper.</P>
<P><B>Note</B>   When you remove components, the files are deleted from your computer. If you want to add them later, you must supply the files from the Windows&nbsp;NT installation disks or from a source directory on your network.</P>
<P>For more information about adding or removing files or components, see "Adding and Removing Windows&nbsp;NT Components" in Chapter&nbsp;12, "System Maintenance with Windows&nbsp;NT Setup," in the <I>Windows&nbsp;NT System Guide</I>.</P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
