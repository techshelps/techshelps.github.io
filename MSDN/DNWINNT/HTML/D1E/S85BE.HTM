<H3>Common Printing Problems</H3><H4><A NAME="sec0"></A>Paper is not Feeding from the Correct Tray</H4><P>If the printer is not drawing paper from the tray you expect it to, make sure you have correctly matched your form with a source in Print Manager. For information on how to perform this task, search for "Forms, assigning to a printer" in Print Manager Help.</P>
<H4><A NAME="sec1"></A>Print Jobs are Incomplete or Missing</H4><P>Even if there is enough memory on a printer, print jobs can fail if only a small amount of memory is visible to the system. When you first install a printer driver, the default value, which may be as low as 300K, is assumed. Often, additional memory is needed to meet the demands your organization places on the printer, and has been installed. For this additional memory to be used, it must be specified as a property of the printer, using Print Manager. </P>
<P>The number specified as "printer memory" in the printer properties refers not to the total memory on the printer, but only to the portion available for PostScript Virtual Memory. If you specify the total amount of memory on the printer in this text box, Print Manager might in some cases use so much memory for downloaded data such as fonts that not enough is left for the printer to operate. </P>
<P>To find out what number should be entered in the Printer Memory text box, copy the file PS.TXT, included with this resource kit, to the printer. The output is a page that tells you what values to use.</P>
