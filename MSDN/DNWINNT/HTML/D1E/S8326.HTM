<H3>Example 3: Requesting Read and Write Access as Object Owner</H3><P>In the example shown next, Windows&nbsp;NT knows by reading FredMgr's access token that he is a member of the Mgrs group. Processing of the ACL will stop as soon as Windows&nbsp;NT sees that NoAccess (None) is assigned to the Mgrs group, even though the other two ACEs allow Read, Write, and Execute access for FredMgr. </P>
<P><img src="XRGU17.gif"></P>
<P>However, after failing to gain access via the discretionary ACL, Windows&nbsp;NT notices that FredMgr is the owner of the object. Because of this, he is granted ReadControl and WRITE_DAC automatically. Since this is all the access he is asking for, his request is granted. </P>
<P>If FredMgr had asked for any other access in addition to ReadControl and WRITE_DAC, the request would be denied even though Fred is the object's owner. In this case, FredMgr receives the following message:</P>
<P><BR></P>
<pre><code>G:\FILE2.TXT<BR>You do not have permission to open this file. <BR>See the owner of the file or an administrator to obtain permission.</code></pre>
<P>In this case, because FredMgr is the owner, he can change his own permissions  to grant himself appropriate access to the file.</P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
