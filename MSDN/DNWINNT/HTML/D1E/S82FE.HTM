<H2>Conventions in This Manual</H2><P>This document assumes that you have read the Windows NT documentation set and that you are familiar with using menus, dialog boxes, and other features of the Windows operating system family of products. It also assumes that you have installed Windows NT on your system and that you are using a mouse. For keyboard equivalents to menu and mouse actions, see the Microsoft Windows&nbsp;NT online Help.</P>
<P>This document uses several conventions to help you identify information. The following table describes the typographical conventions used in the <I>Windows NT Resource Guide.</I></P>

<P><BR></P><P>Other conventions in this document include the following:</P>
<UL><LI>     "MS-DOS" refers to Microsoft MS-DOS version 3.3 or later.</LI><LI>     "Windows-based application" is used as a shorthand term to refer to an application that is designed to run with 16-bit Windows and does not run without Windows. All 16-bit and 32-bit Windows applications follow similar conventions for the arrangement of menus, dialog box styles, and keyboard and mouse use.</LI><LI>     "MS-DOS–based application" is used as a shorthand term to refer to an application that is designed to run with MS-DOS but not specifically with Windows or Windows NT and is not able to take full advantage of their graphical or memory management features.</LI><LI>     "Command prompt" refers to the command line where you type MS-DOS–style commands. Typically, you see characters such as C:\&gt; to show the location of the command prompt on your screen. In Windows NT, you can double-click the MS-DOS Prompt icon in Program Manager to use the command prompt.</LI><LI>     An instruction to "type" any information means to press a key or a sequence of keys, and then press the ENTER key.</LI><LI>     Mouse instructions in this document, such as "Click the OK button" or "Drag an icon in File Manager," use the same meanings as the descriptions of mouse actions in the Windows NT System Guide and the Windows online tutorial.</LI></UL><P><I>This book is dedicated to all the hardworking writers, editors, reviewers, and numerous production staff people at Microsoft that make books like this possible.
