<H2>Creating a Distribution Share</H2><P>In most cases, people who customize Windows&nbsp;NT Setup are doing so for a corporation whose users will run Setup from a distribution share. Therefore, the first step (after installing Windows&nbsp;NT on at least one computer) is to set up a distribution share for your corporation. You need separate shares for Windows&nbsp;NT workstation and Windows&nbsp;NT server. You will modify the files after they are in the shared directory.</P>
<P>This section explains some of the caveats to creating Setup shares along with a few preparatory steps you will need to take before modifying the files.</P>
<H3><A NAME="sec0"></A>To create a distribution share</H3><OL><LI>    Create a share for the installation files for Windows NT servers and a separate share for the installation files for Windows NT workstations.</LI><LI>    Copy the installation files to the shares you have created.
<P>By copying the entire set of files you can reproduce the directory structure on the distribution media. As a result, your distribution share will have different subdirectories for the different platforms (x86, MIPS, and so on).</P>

<P>Copy the files from the Windows&nbsp;NT Setup CD, using the following syntax for the <B>xcopy</B> command:</P>

<P><B>xcopy</B> <I>cd</I>:\ <I>share </I>/s</P>

<P>where <I>cd </I>is the drive letter you have assigned to your CD-ROM drive. <I>Share</I> is the location of the distribution share you created. For example:</P>

<P>xcopy f:\i386 \\winnt35_dist\x86</P></LI><LI>    Share the destination directory, making it read-only.</LI></OL><P>From target computers, users can connect to the appropriate directory on the distribution share to install Windows&nbsp;NT. Users running MS-DOS, Microsoft Windows, or Windows&nbsp;NT can connect to the appropriate directory on the distribution share and run the <B>winnt </B>or<B> winnt32</B> utility to start the installation process. For more information, see the <I>Windows&nbsp;NT System Guide</I>.</P>
<P>These distribution shares are used primarily for installing Windows&nbsp;NT with the <B>winnt</B> or <B>winnt32</B> utility. They can also be used by a user who has installed Windows&nbsp;NT and wants to install additional files. For instance, a user who wants to install a printer driver can type in the path to the network distribution share when Setup prompts for the location of the printer driver.</P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
