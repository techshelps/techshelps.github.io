<H3>Changing the File System on a Partition</H3><P>There are three ways to establish a new file system on a disk partition:</P>
<UL><LI>     Specify the file system for the boot partition during the installation process. </LI><LI>     Use the <B>format </B>utility and specify the file system for the partition.</LI><LI>     Use the <B>convert</B> utility to convert a partition from FAT or HPFS to NTFS. This leaves the existing files intact. </LI></UL><P>With the <B>format</B> utility, you can format a partition as an NTFS volume by specifying the <B>/fs:ntfs</B> option. Using the <B>format</B> utility destroys all existing files on the partition. </P>
<P>With the <B>convert</B> utility, you can convert an existing partition from FAT or HPFS to NTFS without destroying files. You cannot convert from NTFS to another file system. To convert a volume to the NTFS file system, type the <B>convert</B> command using this form, where E:<B> </B>is the partition you want to convert:</P>
<P><BR></P>
<pre><code>convert e: /fs:ntfs</code></pre>
<P>The <B>convert </B>utility can be used on the boot partition of non-RISC–based computers, as well as on secondary partitions. However, the <B>convert </B>utility cannot convert the boot partition while it is in use. Instead, if you specify the active partition, an entry is added to the Registry so that the <B>convert</B> utility is run the next time the system is booted. </P>
<P></P>
<P><B>Caution</B></P>
<P>You must not convert the boot partition to NTFS on a RISC–based computer. This is because the firmware on RISC-based computers loads the  first system files in the Windows&nbsp;NT boot process, and the firmware understands only the FAT file system. Converting the boot partition would therefore make the computer unable to boot. If you want to use NTFS on a RISC-based computer, create a small boot partition (1 MB or larger) to hold the HAL.DLL and OSLOADER.EXE files. The rest of the disk can be used as an NTFS partition. The installer correctly puts the HAL.DLL and OSLOADER files on the boot partition.</P>
<P>If someone mistakenly converts the RISC–based boot partition to NTFS, run the ARCINST.EXE utility from the install CD-ROM and reformat the boot partition as FAT.</P>
<P></P>
<P>The <B>convert</B> utility works in only one direction, so you cannot use it to change your file system from NTFS back to FAT or HPFS format. Instead, you must reformat the NTFS drive using the <B>format</B> command. (Be sure to back up any files you want to preserve before using the <B>format</B> command.)</P>
<P>Remember, though, that you cannot use the Windows&nbsp;NT <B>format</B> command on the system partition. If Windows&nbsp;NT is installed on the NTFS partition, you can reformat the drive by following these steps:</P>
<OL><LI>    Start Windows&nbsp;NT Setup.</LI><LI>    Choose Custom Installation.</LI><LI>    When Setup prompts you to select the partition where you would like to install Windows&nbsp;NT, highlight the NTFS drive, and type <B>P</B> to delete the partition. </LI><LI>    Continue using the Setup program to recreate and format the partition.</LI></OL></FONT></BODY></HTML>
