<H2>Printing Terms</H2><P>In Window NT, a<I> print device</I> refers to the actual hardware device that produces printed output. A <I>printer</I> refers to the software interface between the application and print device.</P>
<P>In Windows&nbsp;NT terminology, a <I>queue </I>is just a group of documents waiting to be printed. In the NetWare and OS/2 environments, queues are the primary software interface between the application and print device: users submit print jobs to a queue. However, with Windows&nbsp;NT the printer is that interface — the job is sent to a printer, not a queue.</P>
<P><I>Network-interface printers</I><B><I> </I></B>are printers with their own network cards; they need not be adjacent to a print server since they are directly connected to the network.</P>
<P>Print device resolution is measured in <I>dots per inch </I>(DPI). The greater the DPI, the better the resolution.</P>
<P>Print jobs are classified into <I>data types </I>based on what modifications the spooler should make to the job (if any). For instance, one data type implies that the spooler should not modify the job at all; another data type implies that the spooler should add a form feed to the end of the job, and so on.</P>
<P><I>Rendering</I> means converting a print job from whatever commands the application uses to describe output into commands that a print device understands.</P>
<P>The terms <I>workstation </I>and <I>server </I>refer to two different roles in over-the-network printing. The workstation is the computer that sends print jobs over the network; the server is the computer that receives print jobs. Do not confuse these terms with Windows&nbsp;NT Workstation and Windows&nbsp;NT Server. Both Windows&nbsp;NT Workstation and Windows&nbsp;NT Server can operate in either workstation or server roles. However, because Windows&nbsp;NT Workstation is limited to 10 connections from other computers, it does not make a practical print server except in small-network situations. Unless otherwise specified, all topics in this chapter apply equally to both Windows&nbsp;NT Workstation and Windows&nbsp;NT Server.</P>
<P><I>Spooling</I> means writing the contents of a print job to a file on disk. This file is called a <I>spool file</I>. <I>Despooling</I> means reading the contents from a spool file, and then sending those contents to a print device.</P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
