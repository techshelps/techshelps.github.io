<H2>About Mail</H2><P>The Mail application provided with Windows&nbsp;NT has a client side, a mail-server side, and an interface between them. The client side includes a visual user interface, made up of viewers for messages, folders, and address lists. The server simply contains a directory structure known as the <I>postoffice</I> and has no programmatic components. The interface between the client and server manages message storage and retrieval, name validation, and directory access.</P>
<P>A user sends mail to and receives mail from a <I>message store</I> on their own computer. When a user sends a message, it is forwarded from the local computer's message store to the postoffice located on the mail server. The postoffice has a mailbox for each user, giving users access to the messages they've received when they sign in to Mail.</P>

<P>Mail uses a <I>shared file system</I>, which means that the postoffice must reside on a share on a computer running Windows&nbsp;NT to which each user in the workgroup has access. The postoffice is a directory structure in which the main directory is called a <I>workgroup postoffice</I> (WGPO). All postoffice file manipulation is handled by the Mail client.</P>
<P>The postoffice is a temporary message store, holding a message until the recipient's workstation retrieves it. Mail is efficient because it stores only one copy of each mail message, even when a message is addressed to multiple recipients. When it is retrieved, the message is removed from the postoffice. A message sent to multiple recipients has a reference count in it. The count decrements each time a recipient retrieves the message, and the message itself is removed when the reference count drops to zero.</P>
<P>For information about how to use Mail, see Chapter&nbsp;7, "Mail," in the <I>Windows&nbsp;NT System Guide</I>.</P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
