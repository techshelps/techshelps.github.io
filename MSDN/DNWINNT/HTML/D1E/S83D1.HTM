<H3>Windows&nbsp;NT Workstation Computer</H3><P>When a Windows-based application running on a Windows&nbsp;NT Workstation computer sends a job to a printer established by the Connect To command, it  uses the graphics engine to create a fully rendered job, with data type RAW. The router sends this job to the router on the Windows&nbsp;NT print server (or sends via  the redirector to a Windows for Workgroups, OS/2, or NetWare server).</P>
<P>When you first establish the printer using the Connect To command, if the printer is on a Windows&nbsp;NT print server the server downloads the proper driver to you. If the printer is on a non-Windows&nbsp;NT print server, you must install the printer driver manually.</P>
<P>When a Windows-based application running on a Windows&nbsp;NT Workstation computer sends a job to a printer established by the Connect To command, the application still uses the graphics engine, but the graphics engine only renders the job part-way, into a journal file. The user quickly regains control of the application. In the background, the router always passes journal jobs to the local print provider, which gives control to WINPRINT to complete the rendering into printer commands. The local print provider then gives control to the appropriate print monitor, which transmits jobs to the print device.</P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
