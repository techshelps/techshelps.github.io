<H3>Microsoft Mail Entries</H3><P>This subkey is used to define the appearance and behavior of the Mail program. This is the Registry path for this subkey:</P>
<P><BR></P>
<pre><code>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Mail\Microsoft Mail</code></pre>
<P>This key also appears under HKEY_USERS\.DEFAULT, but its only contents are <B>MigrateIni and MigrateIniPrint</B>.</P>
<P>These are the value entries that can appear in this key:</P>
<P><B>CheckLatencyInterval     REG_SZ      </B><I>seconds</I><B>    </B></P>
<P>Affects the mail spooler's latency checking, which is intended to prevent spooler background processing from interfering with foreground work. If the specified length of time passes without the spooler having any work to do, the latency algorithm is reinitialized. </P>
<P>Default:  30 seconds</P>
<P><B>DemosEnabled     REG_SZ      </B><I>0 or 1</I><B>    </B></P>
<P>Specifies whether the Demos menu option is to be displayed in the Help menu. If the value of the entry is 1, the Demos menu option is displayed in the Help menu. If this entry is 0, the Demos menu option is not shown. </P>
<P>Default:  0 (The Mail demos are not provided with Windows&nbsp;NT.)</P>
<P><B>ExportMmfFile     REG_SZ      </B><I>filename</I><B>    </B></P>
<P>Identifies the path and filename for a .MMF file pointing to the last place a mail folder was exported to. This entry is written by the Mail program and is used as a default value for display in the Export Folder dialog box when you choose Export Folders from the File menu in Mail.</P>
<P><B>FixedFont     REG_SZ      </B><I>facename, size, 0 or 1</I><B>, </B><I>0 or 1</I></P>
<P>Identifies the fixed-pitch font used to display the body text of a mail message. This entry has four parts, each separated by a comma:  typeface name (not the font file name), point size, flag for bold, and flag for italic. The Change Font command on the View menu toggles between the Normal font and the Fixed font. </P>
<P>Default:  Courier New, 9, 0, 0</P>
<P><B>ForceScanInterval     REG_SZ      </B><I>seconds</I></P>
<P>Affects the mail spooler's latency checking, which is intended to prevent the spooler background processing from interfering with foreground work. If the designated length of time passes without the spooler getting an opportunity to do outstanding work, idle time is requested more frequently (based on the value of <B>ScanAgainInterval</B>), and eventually idle time is used whenever it can. </P>
<P>Default:  300 seconds (5 minutes)</P>
<P><B>GALOnly     REG_SZ      </B><I>0 or 1</I></P>
<P>If this entry is set to 1, the Mail address book displays only the Global Address List and the personal address book, thereby providing a flat address list of all the users visible from your postoffice. You must be running against a PC Mail 3.0 or higher postoffice with global address list support for this to work. <B>GALOnly</B> is currently supported only by the PC Mail name service provider. </P>
<P>Default:  0</P>
<P><B>IdleRequiredInterval     REG_SZ      </B><I>seconds</I></P>
<P>Affects the mail spooler's latency checking, which is intended to prevent the spooler's background processing from interfering with foreground work. The spooler defers its work temporarily if the system has serviced an interactive request such as a keyboard entry or mouse movement within this interval, to avoid starting a transfer when the user is busy. </P>
<P>Default:  2 seconds</P>
<P><B>Lang     REG_SZ</B><I>     String</I></P>
<P>This value is specific to Japanese Windows&nbsp;NT in order to give better interoperability with U.S. mail clients. If you specify anything other than "USA" for &lt;String&gt;, Japanese is used in the prefix.</P>
<P>Default: (none)</P>
<P><B>LocalMMF     REG_SZ      </B><I>0 or 1</I></P>
<P>Specifies the location where the user's mail message file (.MMF) is created when the user runs Mail for the first time. If this entry is 0, the user's Mail messages are stored in the postoffice on the server. If this entry is 1, the user's .MMF file is created locally in the <I>SystemRoot</I> directory rather than on the postoffice the first time Mail is run. Also, this value set to 1, in conjunction with the <B>NoServerOptions</B> entry, prevents .MMF files from being stored in the postoffice. </P>
<P>Default:  1</P>
<P><B>Login     REG_SZ      </B><I>mailbox name</I></P>
<P>Identifies the default User Name (up to 10 characters) displayed in the Mail Sign In dialog box used to log into Mail. If you set both the <B>Login</B> and <B>Password</B> entries, the Login dialog is not displayed when you start Mail, and your mailbox is immediately displayed. If you set just <B>Login</B>, Mail prompts for your password only. </P>
<P>Default:  (blank)</P>
<P><B>MailBeep     REG_SZ      </B><I>filename</I></P>
<P>Specifies the path name of a .WAV file to change the sound that Mail uses to notify the user when new mail arrives. This entry is ignored if the Sound Chime option in the Mail Options dialog box is not checked. </P>
<P>Mail looks at this entry only if it can't find a <B>MailBeep</B> entry in the  HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Control&nbsp;Panel\Sounds subkey. </P>
<P>Default:  (blank)—Mail beeps twice when new mail arrives.</P>
<P><B>MailTmp     REG_SZ      </B><I>Pathname</I></P>
<P>Set this entry to a directory where Mail can place temporary copies of attached files. When you launch an application by double-clicking a file attached to a mail message, Mail copies the file to this directory and runs the application. </P>
<P>Default:  The value of the TEMP environment variable. If there is no TEMP variable, the default is the <I>SystemRoot</I> directory.</P>
<P><B>MAPIHELP     REG_SZ      </B><I>filename</I></P>
<P>Specifies the MAPI Help file to be used when the user requests help in any of the dialog boxes displayed by the MAPI support functions. This entry is defined when the Mail program is run for the first time. </P>
<P>Default:  The MSMAIL32.HLP file in the user's <I>SystemRoot\</I>SYSTEM32 directory (for example, C:\WINNT\SYSTEM32\MSMAIL32.HLP).</P>
<P><B>MigrateIni     REG_SZ     </B><I>0 or 1</I></P>
<P>Specifies whether to migrate the Mail .INI files created by a Windows for MS-DOSMS-DOS version of Mail for use under Windows&nbsp;NT. This entry is saved in the HKEY_USERS\.DEFAULT\Software\Microsoft\Mail subkey. In HKEY_CURRENT_USER, this entry is deleted after the user first runs Mail.</P>
<P>Default:  1 (yes)</P>
<P><B>MigrateIniPrint     REG_SZ     </B><I>0 or 1</I></P>
<P>Specifies whether to migrate the Mail .INI print information created by a Windows for MS-DOS version of Mail for use under Windows&nbsp;NT. This entry is saved in the HKEY_USERS\.DEFAULT\Software\Microsoft\Mail subkey. In HKEY_CURRENT_USER, this entry is deleted after the user first runs Mail.</P>
<P>Default:  1 (yes)</P>
<P><B>Multi-Message     REG_SZ      </B><I>0 or 1</I><B> </B></P>
<P>Defines the last setting chosen for the Print Multiple Notes On A Page check box in the Print dialog box, which appears when you print messages from Mail. Set this entry to 0 for that option to appear unchecked by default. </P>
<P>Default:  1 (That is, the check box is checked by default.) </P>
<P><B>NetBios     REG_SZ      </B><I>0 or 1</I></P>
<P>Enables NetBIOS notification of new mail delivery. When NetBIOS notification is used, the Windows&nbsp;NT computer sending a mail message to another Windows&nbsp;NT computer sends a NetBIOS notification message to the destination computer to tell the Mail program running on that machine that a new mail message was sent to the computer. The Mail program on the destination computer can then check the workgroup postoffice for the new mail message. This entry set to 1 to enable NetBIOS notification also provides quicker response to the arrival of new mail from users on your local postoffice. If this entry is 0 to disable NetBIOS notification, the Mail client needs to regularly check for the arrival of new mail messages on the postoffice.</P>
<P>Default:  1</P>
<P><B>NewMsgsAtStartup     REG_SZ      </B><I>0 or 1</I></P>
<P>Specifies whether Mail is to check for new mail messages in the foreground as soon as the user logs in. Set this entry to 1 to have Mail download new messages as quickly as possible when it is started. If this entry is 0, Mail checks for new messages in the background (as is usually the case when the Mail application is being used). </P>
<P>Default:  0</P>
<P><B>NextOnMoveDelete     REG_SZ      </B><I>0 or 1</I><B> </B><I>or&nbsp;</I><B>–</B><I>1</I></P>
<P>If this entry is 1, Mail automatically opens the next message in a folder after you delete or move an open message. If set to –1, mail automatically opens the previous message. This facilitates quick scanning through the Inbox. If set to 0, Mail closes the Read Note window after you move or delete the message, and you must press Enter or double-click to open the next message. Use 1 for messages sorted in ascending order (in the order received) and –1 for messages sorted in descending order (most recent message first). </P>
<P>Default:  1</P>
<P><B>NormalFont     REG_SZ      </B><I>facename, size, 0 or 1</I><B>, </B><I>0 or 1</I></P>
<P>Identifies the default font (normally proportionally spaced) used to display Mail messages. This entry has four parts, each separated by a comma:  typeface name (not the font file name), point size, flag for bold, and flag for italic. The Change Font command in the View menu toggles between the Normal font and the Fixed font. The latter is useful for viewing messages that were created using a fixed-pitch font. Both entries affect only message body text, not the message envelope text or folder lists; Mail uses Helv 8 for that purpose. </P>
<P>Default:  Helv, 10, 0, 0 (The FontSubstitutes subkey defines the mapping of the Helv font to a font present on the local computer.)</P>
<P><B>NoServerOptions     REG_SZ      </B><I>0 or 1</I></P>
<P>If this entry is 1, the Server button in the Mail Options dialog box is unconditionally disabled. On the Mail server, this button calls up another dialog box that enables the user to relocate the .MMF file. Together with the <B>LocalMMF</B> entry, this entry prevents .MMF files from being stored on the postoffice. </P>
<P>Default:  0</P>
<P><B>OfflineMessages     REG_SZ      </B><I>Pathname</I></P>
<P>Defines the file location when you choose to store your message file somewhere other than the postoffice. When you start up without connecting to the postoffice, this entry locates the file quickly (without presenting a File Browse dialog box). The entry is removed when you store your message file at the postoffice. </P>
<P></P>
<P><B>Note   </B>If you start online and your .MMF file is not on the postoffice, this entry is not used. Use the Mail Server Options dialog box to move your .MMF file.</P>
<P>Default:  The path specified in the Mail Options Server dialog for a local message file. </P>
<P><B>OldStorePath     REG_SZ      </B><I>Pathname</I></P>
<P>Contains the original path to a file that was originally stored in a place other than the postoffice. This entry is written temporarily by the Mail transport while you are moving your message file (using the Mail Options Server dialog box). This entry is removed after the move completes successfully and only appears if the system crashes during a move.</P>
<P><B>Password     REG_SZ      </B><I>password</I></P>
<P>Use this entry and the <B>Login</B> entry to provide Mail with your account information, without being required to type this information into the Mail Sign In dialog box each time. If there is no password, leave the value for this entry blank, but do not omit the entry. Omitting the entry means you want to type your password each time in the Mail Sign In dialog box when you start Mail. </P>
<P>Default:  (blank)—you are prompted for a password by the Mail program.</P>
<P><B>PollingInterval     REG_SZ      </B><I>minutes</I></P>
<P>Gives the default for the Check for New Mail Every <I>n</I> Minutes option in the Mail Options dialog box. The value the user enters in the dialog box is written to the user's mail message file (.MMF)—this value is used to define how often the Mail spooler checks for new mail messages. </P>
<P>Default:  10</P>
<P><B>Printer     REG_SZ      </B><I>printer name, driver name, port</I></P>
<P>This is the printer that appears in the Mail Print dialog box and is used by Mail when printing messages. </P>
<P>Default:  the default printer specified in Print Manager</P>
<P><B>PumpCycleInterval     REG_SZ      </B><I>seconds</I></P>
<P>Permits the spooler to check for new mail more often than once per minute, or to override the polling interval value defined in the user's mail message file. </P>
<P>Default:  60 seconds, or the number of minutes specified in the Mail Options dialog box </P>
<P><B>ReplyPrefix     REG_SZ      </B><I>String</I></P>
<P>If this entry is present, Mail distinguishes your comments from the original message when you reply to mail. When you reply, the original message text is copied to the body of the reply message, and each line of the original is prefixed with the string specified by this entry. If the string contains a space, enclose it within double quotation marks (for example, "| "—a vertical bar followed by a space). </P>
<P>Default:  (blank)</P>
<P><B>ScanAgainInterval     REG_SZ      </B><I>seconds</I></P>
<P>Affects the mail spooler latency checking to prevent spooler background processing from interfering unduly with foreground work. When the spooler defers work because of higher priority, interactive tasks, it rechecks the availability of the system at this interval. </P>
<P>Default:  2</P>
<P><B>Security     REG_SZ      </B><I>0 or 1</I></P>
<P>If this entry is 1, Mail prompts for your password whenever its window is restored from its iconic state. That is, if Mail is minimized and you double-click on the icon, you must re-enter your password before you (or anyone else) can see your messages.</P>
<P>Default:  0</P>
<P><B>ServerPassword     REG_SZ      </B><I>password</I></P>
<P>Identifies the password used to connect to the server specified by the <B>ServerPath</B> entry. This entry should be used to specify the password for the file share if the form of the <B>ServerPath</B> entry is specified using the universal naming conventions (UNC) and the server, share, or the path name contains spaces. If this entry is present, the value for the <B>ServerPath</B> entry is interpreted literally, and any spaces present in the value for the entry is used when dynamically connecting to the workgroup postoffice. </P>
<P>If the <B>ServerPassword</B> entry is used, do not specify a password for the <B>ServerPath</B> entry (the password will be misinterpreted, and the resulting path to the workgroup postoffice will be invalid). The <B>ServerPassword</B> entry is written by the Mail program when connecting for the first time to the workgroup postoffice and is stored in the Microsoft Mail key file in encrypted format. Do not change this entry.</P>
<P><B>ServerPath     REG_SZ      </B><I>Pathname</I><B><BR>ServerPath     REG_SZ     </B><I> \\server\share\path  password</I><B><BR>ServerPath     REG_SZ      </B><I>server/share:path</I></P>
<P>If this entry is present, Mail searches for the postoffice in the specified directory. The first form, with a normal path name, works on all networks—the connection to the file share containing the network postoffice must be made before running the Mail program. The second form (UNC) works only on Windows&nbsp;NT and on Microsoft networks and compatibles. If you use the UNC form, Mail connects dynamically (without using a drive) to the file server where the postoffice resides. (If the specified UNC name contains any spaces, the password for the share needs to be specified for the <B>ServerPassword</B> entry.) The third form works only on Novell NetWare networks and uses an unused drive letter to connect dynamically to the NetWare file server where the postoffice resides. If no value is specified for the <B>ServerPath</B> entry, Mail asks the user for a path to the workgroup postoffice and writes a new value for this entry.</P>
<P><B>SharedExtensionsDir     REG_SZ      </B><I>Pathname</I><B><BR>SharedExtensionsDir     REG_SZ      </B><I>\\server\share\path  password</I></P>
<P>If this entry is present, Mail searches for shared custom commands and messages in the specified directory. The SHARED32.INI file in that directory identifies the shared extensions to load. Additional extensions can be entered in the Microsoft Mail key. Administrators often provide a common share point for extensions to Mail to simplify updating the extensions, and this entry makes it work. The first form with a normal path name works on all networks. The second form works only on Windows&nbsp;NT and on Microsoft networks and compatibles. If the second form is used, Mail connects dynamically (without using a drive) to the file server where the shared extensions reside.</P>
<P>Default:  (blank)</P>
<P><B>SharedFolders     REG_SZ      </B><I>0 or 1</I></P>
<P>Enables the use of Mail shared folders. If this entry is 1, the user can access shared folders. If this entry is 0, shared folders are unavailable to the user. </P>
<P>Default:  1</P>
<P><B>SpoolerBackoffInterval     REG_SZ      </B><I>milliseconds</I></P>
<P>Specifies the amount of time the mail spooler waits before retrying an operation that has failed because of a transient mail server error condition, such as a locked file. </P>
<P>Default:  2000 (two seconds)</P>
<P><B>SpoolerReconnectInterval     REG_SZ      </B><I>seconds</I></P>
<P>Specifies the amount of time the mail spooler waits before retrying an operation that has failed because of a fatal mail server error condition, such as a lost network connection. </P>
<P>Default:  60 (one minute)</P>
<P><B>StripGatewayHeaders     REG_SZ      </B><I>0 or 1</I></P>
<P>If this entry is 1, message header text that appears above the dashed line is stripped from PC Mail messages that arrive via a gateway. Set this value to 0 if you want to see the extended information supplied by the gateways, which typically includes items such as message identifiers specific to the foreign mail system. </P>
<P>Message header text supplied by native PC Mail clients is always stripped. Only the PC Mail transport supports this entry.</P>
<P>Default:  1 (That is, you don't see gateway information.)</P>
<P><B>WG     REG_SZ      </B><I>0 or 1</I></P>
<P>Specifies whether the version of the Mail program running on the computer is the Mail program provided with Windows&nbsp;NT. This entry is used internally by the Mail application and is written by the Mail program when it is executed. </P>
<P>Default:  1</P>
<P><B>Window    REG_SZ    </B><I>Left Top Right Bottom Zoom Toolbar Statusbar Scrollbars</I></P>
<P>Specifies the zero-relative position within its menu where the main Mail window is to appear. This entry consists of eight numbers that govern the display of the main Mail window. This information is written when you exit Mail, and the changes you made while Mail was running are lost. </P>
<P>The format for this entry is as follows:</P>
