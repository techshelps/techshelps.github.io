<H3>Printer Security</H3><P>Windows&nbsp;NT security is integrated into Print Manager so that you can specify which printers have which security attributes. For example, you can specify that everyone in your department can print to this printer, and only one or two specified people can administer it.</P>
<P>There are four categories of permissions you can assign to a person or group for a specific Windows&nbsp;NT printer:</P>
<UL><LI>     Full control, which allows a user complete access and administrative control</LI><LI>     Manage documents, which allows a person to change the status of anyone's jobs but not of printers</LI><LI>     Print, which enables the user to print on the printer and have control to pause, resume, or delete his or her own jobs</LI><LI>     No access, which denies access to the printer</LI></UL><P>By default on Windows&nbsp;NT Server, the Administrators, Server Operators, and Print Operators groups are granted Full Control. On Windows&nbsp;NT Workstation, the Administrators and Power users groups have Full Control. On both types of computer, the Creator Owner group is granted Manage Documents and the Everyone group has the Print permission. </P>
<P>To explicitly deny access to a printer, you must specify No Access for a particular group or user.</P>
<P>Print Manager also provides an auditing option for tracking successful or unsuccessful printing and administrative events for particular groups or individuals. To use this option, you must first enable auditing in User Manager. From the Policies menu, select Audit. Next select the Audit These Events option button and choose OK. (You do not need to specify any events in this dialog box to enable print auditing.)</P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
