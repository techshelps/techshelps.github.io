<H3>Licensing Options</H3><P>Level 1 membership includes a single-user license for the Development Library. In the U.S. and Canada, you can purchase licenses to share a single CD over a network for $40 ($55 Canadian) per additional user. Each additional license allows one designated user to install the Development Library Viewer software on a single workstation to access the CD's contents.</P>
<P>For large workgroups, Level 1 memberships with concurrent-user licenses are available in two configurations: a five-user license is $595 U.S. ($835 Canadian), and a 25-user license is $2495 U.S. ($3495 Canadian). Concurrent-user licenses permit the members of a large group to install the Development Library Viewer software on their workstations, but allow no more than five (or 25) users to run the application at a given time. The number of developers supported by a concurrent-user license depends primarily on their usage patterns and network performance. Developers who expect to make heavy use of the Development Library should consider individual memberships. Call (800) 759-5474 for more information on licensing.</P>
<P>Level 2 membership includes a single-user license for both the Development Library and the Development Platform. Additional licenses are not available for Level 2 memberships.</P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
