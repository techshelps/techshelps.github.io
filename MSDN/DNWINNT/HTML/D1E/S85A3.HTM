<H2>POSIX Conformance</H2><P>For a system to be given a certificate of POSIX.1 conformance, it must meet the following requirements:</P>
<UL><LI>     The system must support all of the interfaces as defined in the ISO/IEC 9945-1.</LI><LI>     The vendor must supply a <I>POSIX.1 Conformance Document</I> (PCD) with the vendor's implementation as specified in ISP/IEC 9945-1.</LI><LI>     The implementation must pass the appropriate <I>National Institute of Standards and Technology</I> (NIST) test suite.</LI></UL><P>Windows&nbsp;NT version 3.1 Workstation and Windows&nbsp;NT Server have been tested using the official NIST PCTS for <I>Federal Information Processing Standard</I> (FIPS) 151-2 and NIST has validated the test results. Windows&nbsp;NT version 3.5 is in the process of being verified for POSIX.1 compliance and will also be submitted to NIST for FIPS 151-2 certification. FIPS 151-2 incorporates POSIX.1 as a reference standard and also requires a number of the optional features defined in POSIX.1 to promote application portability among conforming implementations. An implementation that conforms to FIPS 151-2 also conforms to POSIX.1. Note that conformance is specific to the manufacturer, hardware platform, and model number on which the implementation is tested.</P>
<P>POSIX.1 is a source-level standard; it does not provide any binary compatibility.</P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
