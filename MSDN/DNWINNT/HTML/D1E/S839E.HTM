<H3>Running chkdsk on an NTFS Volume</H3><P>Each time you boot Windows&nbsp;NT, it performs an autocheck routine. If this routine detects a dirty volume, it automatically runs the <B>chkdsk /f</B> command to fix the inconsistency or error. (Note that it is normal for <B>chkdsk </B>to report consistency errors on an NTFS drive containing the pagefile.) As long as no specific files are listed as being damaged and no other errors are detected, the volume will be marked clean, and there is rarely a need to force a <B>chkdsk /f</B>.</P>
<P>If the <B>chkdsk</B> command locates files or directories that have lost pointers to their parent directory, they are named FILE###.CHK and DIR###.CHK, respectively, and housed in the FOUND### directory of the NTFS volume.</P>
<P>If you run <B>chkdsk /f</B> from the command line and see the message "Cannot lock the current drive," you should simply make another drive current. For example,  if you are trying to run <B>chkdsk /f</B> for drive D, type <B>C: </B>to make drive C the current drive, and then type the following command:</P>
<P><BR></P>
<pre><code>chkdsk d: /f </code></pre>
<P><B>Note</B>   If Windows&nbsp;NT is unable to run the <B>chkdsk /f</B> command (for example, because you want to run it on the boot partition or because someone is accessing the partition from the network), Windows&nbsp;NT prompts you whether you would like the autocheck routine to run with <B>chkdsk /f </B>upon reboot.</P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
