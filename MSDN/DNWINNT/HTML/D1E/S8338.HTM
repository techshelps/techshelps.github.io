<H3>Format of the INITIAL.INF and PARTIAL.INF Files</H3><P>The INITIAL.INF and PARTIAL.INF files are text files that contain one or more sections. Each section begins with a section title in brackets (for example, "[Files-I386-nt-system32]"). Some sections contain lists of files to be installed by Setup. Other sections contain a Setup scripting language. The scripting language is not usually needed for customizing setup, and is beyond the scope of this chapter.</P>
<P>In the INITIAL.INF file, files are listed in the following format:</P>
<P><I>disk number</I>, <I>filename</I>, SIZE=<I>file size</I></P>
<P>where <I>disk number </I>is the number of the Setup floppy disk or CD on which the file exists. The following is an example of a typical section in the INITIAL.INF file.</P>
<P><BR></P>
<pre><code>[Files-i386-WindowsOptions]
1,256COLOR.BMP , SIZE=999
1,ARCADE.BMP , SIZE=999</code></pre>
<P>In the PARTIAL.INF file, the name assigned to the option is also indicated. The format is as follows:</P>
<P><I>option name = disk number</I>, <I>filename</I>, SIZE=<I>file size</I></P>
<P>where <I>option name</I> is defined in the [Optional<I>TypeLanguage</I>] section.</P>
<P>For example, the options presented during Setup as "256-Color Wallpaper" and "Arcade Wallpaper" are defined in the following section of the PARTIAL.INF file:</P>
<P><BR></P>
<pre><code>[OptionalWallpapersENG]
    256ColorWallpaper = "256-Color Wallpaper"
    ArcadeWallpaper   = "Arcade Wallpaper"
...</code></pre>
<P>The file used for this option is defined as shown in the following example from the PARTIAL.INF file:</P>
<P><BR></P>
<pre><code>[Files-i386-WindowsOptions]
256ColorWallpaper = 1,256COLOR.BMP , SIZE=999
ArcadeWallpaper = 1,ARCADE.BMP , SIZE=999</code></pre>
<P>Each .INF file also contains a [Source Media Descriptions] section, which lists the Setup media. Usually, there will be only one entry for the CD. In this case, the section looks similar to the following:</P>
<P><BR></P>
<pre><code>[Source Media Descriptions]
    1  = "Windows&nbsp;NT Server CD-ROM"  , TAGFILE = cdrom.s</code></pre>
<P>The number in the first column is the <I>disk number</I>, which is used<I> </I>in the file list described earlier. If you are using a floppy disk set, each disk in the set is listed, and the [Source Media Descriptions] sections looks similar to the following:</P>
<P><BR></P>
<pre><code>[Source Media Descriptions]
    1  = "Windows&nbsp;NT Setup Disk #1"  , TAGFILE = disk1
    2  = "Windows&nbsp;NT Setup Disk #2"  , TAGFILE = disk2
    3  = "Windows&nbsp;NT Setup Disk #3"  , TAGFILE = disk3
    ...</code></pre>
<P></P>
<P><B>Note</B></P>
<P>Lines in the files that begin with a semicolon (;) are treated as comments and are ignored by Setup. Including comments in these files is helpful, for example, when you want to document changes you are making to the file.</P>
<P>You can also use a semicolon for commenting out lines in the TXTSETUP.SIF file. In the DOSNET.INF file, use a pound sign (#) instead of a semicolon for commenting out lines.</P>
<P>Remember that you must use the correct symbol for the file you are modifying; otherwise, Setup fails.</P>
