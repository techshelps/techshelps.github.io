<H2>Questions and Answers About Mail</H2><P>This section answers some common questions about Mail.</P>
<UL><LI>     How much disk space does the Mail postoffice require?
<P>You should allow approximately 2 MB of storage on the Mail server to start. As the Mail system is used, the amount of space it requires grows based on the number of users and the size of the messages and attachments being stored.</P></LI><LI>     Is there a limit on the size or number of attachments you can have in a Mail message?
<P>There is a limit to the<I> </I>number of attachments you can have in a mail message, not the size. The constraint is the size of a single mail message (not including the size of any attachments). The size of the message text plus the number of attachments must always be less than 32K—allowing for many more attachments than most users need to get their message across.</P></LI><LI>     Will the Message Finder search attachments to my mail messages?
<P>No, not currently.</P></LI><LI>     Can I retrieve deleted messages?
<P>Mail doesn't actually purge deleted files; it moves them to a Deleted Mail folder. Deleted messages are not deleted until you empty the Deleted Mail folder or quit the program. You can also configure Mail so that messages are not deleted when you quit the program. To keep mail messages from being deleted when you quit Mail, select Options from the Mail menu and then clear the Empty Wastebasket When Exiting check box.</P></LI></UL><P></P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
