<H3>Deleting Serial Ports</H3><P>You can configure communication ports as described in the previous section or as described in "Serial Subkey Entries in the Services Subkey" in Chapter 14, "Registry Value Entries." You might also need to delete one or more COM ports, which you can only do by deleting the related Registry information in the DeviceMap and Services areas of the Registry. To delete entries in the DeviceMap subkey, you must be logged on as a member of the Administrators group. </P>

<P>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Hardware\DeviceMap\SerialComm</P>

The values are of the form <B>Serial</B><I>yyy</I>=COM<I>x</I>, where COM<I>x</I> can be COM1 to COM256, and <B>Serial</B><I>yyy</I> can be from Serial0 through any large positive number such as Serial15000.</P>
