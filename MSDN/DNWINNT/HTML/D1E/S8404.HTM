<H2>Questions and Answers About Fonts</H2><P>This section answers some common questions about using fonts with Windows&nbsp;NT.</P>
<UL><LI>     I printed the same document with TrueType fonts from two different computers to the same PostScript printer. The two printouts are different. Why? 
<P>TrueType font substitution is different on the two computers. Use Print Manager to reconfigure font substitution on one of the computers.</P></LI><LI>     My document looks fine on the screen but prints with a different font. Why?
<P>This may be happening for one of two reasons. Either you specified the wrong printer model during setup, or the downloadable font did not download to the print device. Check the Printer Properties dialog box to see that the printer driver you are using matches the print device. Then choose Setup, and check the amount of memory for your printer. Make sure the amount shown in the Setup dialog box accurately reflects the amount of memory for your print device. If there is too little memory, the print device may not be able to download fonts.</P></LI><LI>     My document prints OK, but it looks funny on the screen. Why?
<P>There is no direct displayable equivalent of a device font that you are using.</P></LI><LI>     I can't select a font that I know is provided by a cartridge installed in the printer. Why? 
<P>In Print Manager, make sure that the printer properties lists the correct cartridge.</P></LI></UL><P></P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
