<H3>Windows&nbsp;NT Vector Fonts</H3><P>Vector fonts are a set of lines drawn between points, like a pen plotter drawing a  set of characters. Vector fonts can be scaled to virtually any size, but generally  they do not look as good as raster fonts in the sizes that raster fonts are specifically designed for. </P>
<P>Vector fonts are stored in Windows&nbsp;NT as collections of Graphical Device Interface (GDI) calls and are time-consuming to generate. But these fonts are  useful for plotters and other devices where bitmapped characters can't be used. Before TrueType, vector fonts were also used in some applications to create large characters or characters that were rotated or distorted from the baseline.</P>
<P>Some Windows&nbsp;NT-based applications automatically use vector fonts at larger sizes. Some applications allow you to specify at what point size you want to  use vector fonts. For example, the Vector Above setting in Aldus&reg; PageMaker&reg; specifies the point size at which PageMaker will switch to vector fonts. </P>
<P>The Windows&nbsp;NT fonts Roman, Modern, and Script are vector fonts. Although  the vector fonts use the ANSI character set, they are marked internally as an OEM character set. These fonts are sometimes referred to as <I>plotter fonts</I> because, unlike most other fonts, they can be used on plotters.</P>
<P><B>Note</B>   Third-party, non-TrueType scalable font products that were supported by Windows&nbsp;3.1 are not supported by Windows&nbsp;NT. These products include Adobe Type Manager&reg; (ATM&reg;), Bitstream&reg; Facelift&reg;, and Atech Publisher's PowerPak.</P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
