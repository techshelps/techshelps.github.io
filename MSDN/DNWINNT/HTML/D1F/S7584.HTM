<H2>Interdomain Trust Relationships</H2><P>With Windows&nbsp;NT Server, the user accounts and global groups from one domain can be used in another domain. When a domain is configured to allow accounts from another domain to have access to its resources, it effectively <I>trusts</I> the other domain. The <I>trusted</I> domain has made its accounts available to be used in the <I>trusting</I> domain. These trusted accounts are available on Windows&nbsp;NT Server computers and Windows&nbsp;NT Workstation computers participating in the trusting domain. </P>
<P><B>Hint    </B>By using trust relationships in your multidomain network, you reduce the need for duplicate user account information and reduce the risk of problems caused by unsynchronized account information.</P>
<P>The <I>trust relationship</I> is the link between two domains that enables a user with an account in one domain to have access to resources on another domain. The trusting domain is allowing the trusted domain to return to the trusting domain a list of global groups and other information about users who are authenticated in the trusted domain. There is an implicit trust relationship between a Windows&nbsp;NT Workstation participating in a domain and its PDC.</P>
<P>The following figure illustrates a trust relationship between two domains, where the London domain trusts the Topeka domain. </P>

<P>Figure 4.4    Trusted Domain </P>
<P>In this example, the following statements are true because the London domain trusts the Topeka domain:</P>
<UL><LI>Users defined in the Topeka domain can access resources in the London domain without creating an account within that domain.</LI><LI>Topeka appears in the From box at the initial logon screen of Windows&nbsp;NT computers in the London domain. Thus, a user from the Topeka domain can log on at a computer in the London domain.</LI></UL><P>When trust relationships are defined, user accounts and global groups can be given rights and permissions in domains other than the domain where these accounts are located. Administration is then much easier, because you need to create each user account only once on your entire network, and then the user account can be given access to any computer on your network (provided you set up domains and trust relationships to allow it).</P>
<P><B>Note    </B>Trust relationships can be configured only between two Windows&nbsp;NT Server domains. Workgroups and LAN Manager 2<I>.x</I> domains cannot be configured to use trust relationships.</P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
