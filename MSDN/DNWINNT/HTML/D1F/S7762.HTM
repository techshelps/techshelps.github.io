<H3>WAIS Server</H3><P>The Wide Area Information Server (WAIS) lets users query full-content indexes of distributed databases and retrieve requested data. Working with tools in the WAIS Toolkit, which is also included in this resource kit, WAIS responds to client connections and queries, returning information on the files shared in the WAIS data directory. In addition, you can log transactions involving the WAIS Server service.</P>
<P>For more information, see the "WAIS Toolkit" section later in this chapter. The WAIS Toolkit is used to build and maintain the WAIS database (index) for the WAIS Server. See also the sections "Gopher Server" and "World Wide Web Server." Both of these services use WAIS databases.</P>
<H4><A NAME="sec0"></A>Overview and Requirements</H4><P>WAIS servers can be accessed from a variety of WAIS client software programs. When a user queries a WAIS database, a list is returned of the files containing the words specified in the query. When an item is chosen from that list, WAIS server returns that item for display on the user's screen.</P>
<P>While WAIS is used primarily to provide Internet users with access to the information you want to share, you can also use it on your local area network, or on the corporate internet, to help users within the organization find the information they need quickly and efficiently. </P>
<P>To run the WAIS Server service, you'll need a computer with Windows&nbsp;NT 3.5 installed, at least 16 MB of RAM, and a network connection. When you install the WAIS Server (WAISS) you also need to install the WAISINDEX.EXE and WAISSERV.EXE files. These files are part of the WAIS Toolkit.</P>
<H4><A NAME="sec1"></A>Installing a WAIS Server</H4><P>The EMWAC document, <I>WAIS Server Manual</I> (included in this resource kit) gives you complete information on installing and configuring the WAIS server service. It is in the same directory with the files for the WAIS Server program (WAISS.*).</P>
<H4><A NAME="sec2"></A>Operating the WAIS Server Service</H4><P>The WAIS Server service is controlled like any other Windows&nbsp;NT service, through the Services option in Control Panel. The EMWAC document, <I>WAIS Server Manual</I>, gives specific information about controlling and monitoring this service.</P>
<P>When you first install the service, and periodically thereafter, it is a good idea to use Performance Monitor to make sure users of the service are not putting too great a load on the computer. You can divide the load among several different computers if necessary. </P>
<P>You'll need to maintain an index of the information available on your WAIS server, so that users can find the information you have provided. For this, use the programs described in "WAIS Toolkit" later in this chapter.</P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
