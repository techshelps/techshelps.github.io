<H3>Managing Users</H3><P>Use the FTP Server option in Control Panel to manage users connected to the FTP Server and to set security for each volume on the FTP Server. For convenience on Windows&nbsp;NT Server computers, the same dialog box can be reached from Server Manager by choosing the FTP menu command. </P>
<P>In the FTP User Sessions dialog box, the Connected Users box displays the names of connected users, their system's IP addresses, and how long they have been connected. For users who logged on using the <B>anonymous</B> user name, the display shows the passwords used when they logged on as their user names. If the user name contained a mail host name (for example, ernesta@trey-research.com) only the username (ernesta) appears. Anonymous users also have a question mark (?) over their user icons. Users who have been authenticated by Windows&nbsp;NT security have no question mark.</P>
<P>The FTP Server enables you to disconnect one or all users with the disconnect buttons. Users are not warned if you disconnect them.</P>
<P>The FTP Server displays users' names as they connect but does not update the display when users disconnect or when their connect time elapses. The Refresh button enables you to update the display to show only users who are currently connected.</P>
<P>Choosing the Security button displays the FTP Service Security dialog box, where you can set Read and Write permissions for each partition on the FTP Server, as described earlier in this chapter. You must set the permissions for each partition you want FTP users to have access to. If you do not set partition parameters, no users will be able to access files. If the partition uses a secure file system, such as NTFS, file system restrictions are also in effect.</P>
<P>In addition to FTP Server partition security, if a user logs on using a Windows&nbsp;NT account, access permissions for that account are in effect. </P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
