<H1>Network Interoperability</H1><P>In addition to Windows-based networking, Windows&nbsp;NT supports network interoperability with computers running a wide range of operating systems and network protocols. This support makes it easy to incorporate computers running Windows&nbsp;NT into existing networks so you can take advantage of the advanced features of Windows&nbsp;NT without disrupting your enterprise.</P>
<P>The networking architecture of Windows&nbsp;NT is protocol-independent, providing standard interfaces for applications—such as Windows Sockets, remote procedure calls (RPC), and NetBIOS—and device drivers. Besides making it easier to implement a particular protocol stack for Windows&nbsp;NT, this architecture also enables a Windows&nbsp;NT computer to run multiple protocols on a single network adapter card. As a result, a Windows&nbsp;NT computer can simultaneously communicate with a number of different network systems.</P>
<P>Of particular interest to most network administrators is how to provide access by and to computers running Windows&nbsp;NT Workstation and Windows&nbsp;NT Server in the following environments:</P>
