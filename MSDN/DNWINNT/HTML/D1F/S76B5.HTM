<H2>Setting Preferences for WINS Manager</H2><P>You can configure several options for administration of WINS servers. The commands for controlling preferences are on the Options menu.</P>
<H3><A NAME="sec0"></A>To display the status bar for help on commands</H3><UL><LI>From the Options menu, choose the Status Bar command.</LI></UL><P>When this command is active, its name is checked on the menu, and the status bar at the bottom of the WINS Manager window displays descriptions of commands as they are highlighted in the menu bar. </P>
<H3><A NAME="sec1"></A>To set preferences for WINS Manager</H3><OL><LI>From the Options menu, choose the Preferences command to display the Preferences dialog box. </LI></OL><P><B>Tip</B>   To see all the available preferences, choose the Partners button.</P>
<P><img src="xtc5_16a.gif"></P>
<OL start=2><LI>Specify settings for the options in which you want to change, and then choose the OK button.</LI></OL><P>The following list describes the various preferences in which you can set using this dialog box:</P>
<P>Address Display group box</P>
<P>Select an option to indicate how you want address information to be displayed throughout WINS Manager—as computer name, IP address, or an ordered combination of both.</P>
<P><B>Note</B>   Remember that the kind of address display affects how a connection is made to the WINS server — for IP addresses, the connection is made via TCP/IP; for computer names, the connection is made via named pipes.</P>
<P>Server Statistics group box</P>
<P>If you want the statistics in the WINS Manager window to be refreshed automatically, select the Auto Refresh checkbox, and then enter a number in the Interval box to specify the number of seconds between refresh actions. WINS Manager also refreshes the statistical display automatically each time an action is initiated while you are working in WINS Manager.</P>
<P>Computer Names</P>
<P>Select the LAN Manager-Compatible checkbox if you want computer names to adhere to the LAN Manager naming convention. </P>
<P>LAN Manager computer names are limited to 15 characters, as opposed to 16-character NetBIOS names used by some other sources, such as Lotus Notes&reg;. In LAN Manager names, the 16th byte is used to indicate whether the device is a server, workstation, messenger, and so on. When this option is selected, WINS adds and imports static mappings with 0, 0x03, and 0x20 as the 16th byte.</P>
<P>All Windows-based networking, including Windows NT, follows the LAN Manager convention. This checkbox should, therefore, be selected unless your network accepts NetBIOS name from other sources.</P>
<P>Miscellaneous group box</P>
<P>If you want the system to query the list of servers each time the system starts to find out if each server is available, select the Validate Cache Of Known WINS Servers At Startup Time checkbox. If you want a warning message to appear each time you delete a static mapping or the cached name of a WINS server, select the Confirm Deletion Of Static Mappings And Cached WINS Servers checkbox.</P>
<P>New Pull Partner Default Configuration group box</P>
<P>In the Start Time box, type a time to specify the default for replication start time for new pull partners, and then specify values in the Replication Interval box to indicate how often data replicas will be exchanged between the partners. </P>
<P>The Replication Interval should be the same as, or less than, the lowest refresh time interval that is set on any of the replicating WINS servers. The minimum value for the Replication Interval is 40 minutes. </P>
<P>New Push Partner Default Configuration</P>
<P>In the Update Count box, type a number to specify a default for how many registrations and changes can occur locally before a replication trigger is sent by this server when it is a push partner. The minimum value is 20.</P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
