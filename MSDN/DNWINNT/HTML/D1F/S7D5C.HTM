<H3>Character and Graphics Terminal Support</H3><P>The TCP/IP Telnet utility is built into the Windows Terminal accessory to make it easy for a Windows&nbsp;NT computer to have character-oriented terminal access to UNIX systems via TCP/IP. Telnet provides basic terminal emulation of TTY (scrolling), as well as emulation of DEC VT-100 (ANSI) and VT-52 terminals. </P>
<P>Even in the traditionally character-oriented UNIX environment, many applications are moving to graphical user interfaces. X Windows is a commonly used standard for graphical interfaces in networked UNIX environments. A number of third-party companies are also developing X&nbsp;Servers to enable Windows&nbsp;NT users to access and run X-based applications on UNIX systems. (In X Windows terminology, an X Server runs on a client workstation to provide graphics output on behalf of an X Client program running on an applications server.) Several third-party vendors are also developing X&nbsp;Client libraries for Windows&nbsp;NT as well; this eventually will enable UNIX (or other systems with X Server capabilities) to access client-server applications running on a Windows&nbsp;NT computer. Companies developing X Servers and X Client libraries for Windows&nbsp;NT include Hummingbird, Congruent, and Digital Equipment Corporation. </P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
