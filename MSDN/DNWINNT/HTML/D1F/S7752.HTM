<H1>Setting Up Internet Servers and Clients on Windows&nbsp;NT Computers</H1><P>This chapter briefly describes Internet services and how Internet server applications interact with client applications. Many client services are generally available for use with Windows and Windows&nbsp;NT computers. In addition, several server services are included in this resource kit. This chapter provides information to help you decide whether to provide specific Internet services, and how to set up an Internet server with the services you choose to provide. This chapter discusses two types of tools: </P>

<P><BR></P><P>The Internet provides a vast collection of information with many tools that are used to publish and access the information. Consult the Internet or your local library or bookstore for comprehensive discussions of the tools available for using the Internet.</P>
<P>The Internet has been evolving since the early 1970's. Early servers on the Internet conformed to original Internet protocols, such as the file transfer protocol (FTP) or virtual terminal protocol (VTP, now called Telnet). These protocols let you copy files and/or issue commands or start programs through a character-based interface or a graphical user interface (such as Windows or XWindows).</P>
<P>Recently, Internet technology has grown beyond the simple file transfers on character-based FTP or Telnet clients. Newer protocols and clients on the Internet now have graphical interfaces and present information and services to Internet users using hypertext documents. Gopher servers and World Wide Web (WWW) servers now provide formatted text, sounds, and animation to Internet users. You must use the proper browser (such as Cello or Mosaic, or a Gopher client) to use these Internet services. Fortunately, these browsers often support the older standards, such as FTP, so you can use the newer browsers to access multiple services and data types.</P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
