<H3>IP Address</H3><P>An IP address is used to identify a node on a network (workstation, server, printer, etc.) and to specify routing information on an internetwork. Each node on the internetwork must be assigned a unique IP address. In Windows&nbsp;NT, the IP address can be configured statically or configured dynamically from a Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) server. </P>
<P>The remote access server can automatically assign IP addresses to remote workstations when they connect. The addresses is generated from a static pool that has been reserved for use by the RAS server, or via dynamic allocation from a DHCP server.</P>
<P>Where needed, the RAS server can be configured to allow remote clients to specify their own IP addresses. This is useful for the case where remote workstations each want to be guaranteed a specific IP address when they are connected to the network.</P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
