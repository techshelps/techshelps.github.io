<H2>SQL Server</H2><P>Microsoft SQL Server 4.21 has been completely reengineered for Windows&nbsp;NT. SQL Server includes the following enhancements and performance improvements that were not part of previous versions of SQL Server:</P>
<UL><LI>     A new Symmetric Server architecture allows SQL Server to scale from notebook computers to symmetric multiprocessor servers, with support for Intel-based and RISC-based computers. This architecture dynamically balances the processor load across multiple CPUs and provides a preemptive multithreaded design for improved performance and reliability.</LI><LI>     Windows&nbsp;NT provides preemptive scheduling, virtual paged memory management, symmetric multiprocessing, and asynchronous I/O, the foundation of a mission-critical database server platform. Integration with the Windows&nbsp;NT operating system improves operational control and ease of use. Administrators can manage multiple SQL Servers across distributed networks using graphical tools for configuration, security, database administration, performance monitoring, event notification, and unattended backup.</LI><LI>     Unified logon security with Windows&nbsp;NT security means that authorized users do not have to maintain separate SQL Server logon passwords and can bypass a separate logon process for SQL Server. Additionally, SQL Server applications can take advantage of Windows&nbsp;NT security features, which include encrypted passwords, password aging, domain-wide user accounts, and Windows-based user administration.</LI><LI>     Windows&nbsp;NT provides an ideal platform for building powerful 32-bit client-server applications for Microsoft SQL&nbsp;Server. The <I>Microsoft SQL&nbsp;Server Programmer's Toolkit</I> contains a 32-bit Win32-based version of&nbsp;the Microsoft DB-Library<FONT FACE="Symbol">ä</FONT> application programming interface.</LI><LI>     Microsoft SQL Server is fully interoperable with Microsoft SQL Server for OS/2, as well as with SYBASE SQL Server for the UNIX and VMS operating systems. Existing applications will work unchanged. Microsoft SQL Server operates across all corporate network environments, including Novell NetWare and TCP/IP-based LANs.</LI></UL><P>The key to enterprise interoperability is network independence. Microsoft SQL Server can support clients communicating over multiple heterogeneous networks simultaneously, with no need for additional integration products. SQL Server communicates on named pipes (over either NetBEUI or TCP/IP network protocols) with Windows, Windows&nbsp;NT, MS-DOS, and OS/2 clients. In addition, SQL Server can simultaneously support TCP/IP Sockets for communication with Macintosh, UNIX, or VMS clients and SPX Sockets for communications in a Novell NetWare environment. It also supports DECnet&trade; Sockets, AppleTalk, and Banyan VINES. Microsoft SQL Server leverages the power, ease of use, and scalability offered by the Windows&nbsp;NT operating system to manage large databases for mission-critical applications.</P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
