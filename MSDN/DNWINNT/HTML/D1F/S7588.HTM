<H3>Setting Up Domains</H3><P>The way you configure your network into domains depends on your administrative resources and the size of your network. This section describes the most common domain models:</P>
<UL><LI>Single domain</LI><LI>Master domain</LI><LI>Multiple master domain</LI><LI>Multiple trust</LI></UL><H4><A NAME="sec0"></A>Single Domain</H4><P>In the single domain model, there is only one domain. Because there are no other domains, there are no trust relationships to administer. This model is the best implementation for organizations with fewer than 10,000 users in which trust among departments is not an issue. This model offers centralized management of all user accounts, and local groups have to be defined only once. In an organization with multiple domains where there is no need to share information among domains, the best configuration is often multiple single domains.</P>
<P>If, however, you anticipate significant growth in your organization, you might want to consider a more flexible model, such as the multiple master domain model described later in this section. If your organization grows beyond 10,000 users, the single domain model can no longer support all your users, and there might be a great deal of administrative work involved in reconfiguring your user database.</P>
<H4><A NAME="sec1"></A>Master Domain</H4><P>In an organization with fewer than 10,000 users in which trust among departments is an issue, the master domain model is a suitable option. In this model, one domain, the master domain, is trusted by all other domains, but does not trust any of them. Trust relationships among the other domains can be defined and administered as necessary.</P>
<P>The master domain model offers the benefits of both central administration and multiple domains. In an organization with a number of departments, each department can administer its own resources, but user accounts and global groups still need to be defined only once, in the master domain.</P>
<P>As with the single domain model, however, the user population is limited to 10,000, because all user accounts are maintained in one place, the master domain. Further, local groups must be defined for each domain, which can require significantly more administration if you use local groups extensively.</P>
<H4><A NAME="sec2"></A>Multiple Master Domain</H4><P>For large organizations, or those which anticipate substantial growth, the multiple master domain model might be the best solution. In this model, there is more than one master domain, each of which trusts all the other master domains, and all of which are trusted by all the other domains. None of the master domains trusts any of the subdomains.</P>
<P>This model works best when computer resources are grouped in some logical fashion, such as by department or by location. Because a multiple master domain model can support as many as 10,000 users per master domain, it works well for large organizations. And because all the master domains trust each other, only one copy of each user account is needed.</P>
<P>The administrative requirements for a multiple master domain model can be considerably greater than for a single domain or master domain model. Local and global groups might have to be defined several times, there are more trust relationships to manage, and not all user accounts reside in the same domain. </P>
<H4><A NAME="sec3"></A>Multiple Trust</H4><P>In the multiple trust model, all domains trust all other domains. This model is the simplest to understand, but if many domains are involved it is the most complex to administer. </P>
<P>Like the multiple master domain model, the multiple trust model is scalable as the organization grows: it can support as many as 10,000 users for each domain (not for each master domain, as in the multiple master domain model). Because each domain has full control over its own user accounts, the multiple trust model can work well for a company without a centralized management information services (MIS) department. If, however, the organization has many domains, there can be a very large number of trust relationships to manage. And because domain administration is decentralized, it is harder to assure the integrity of global groups that other domains might use.</P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
