<H3>Changes to Computers in the Trusting and Trusted Domains</H3><P>When one domain is permitted to trust another, User Manager for Domains creates an interdomain trust account in the Security Accounts Manager (SAM) of the trusted domain. This account is like any other global user account, except that the USER_INTERDOMAIN_TRUST_ACCOUNT bit in the control field for the account is set. The interdomain trust account is used only by the primary domain controller and is invisible in User Manager for Domains. The password is randomly generated and is maintained by User Manager for Domains.</P>
<P>When this trust relationship is established, the Netlogon service on the trusting domain attempts discovery on the trusted domain, as described later in this chapter, and the interdomain trust account is authenticated by a domain controller on the trusted domain.</P>
<P>When one domain trusts another, a trusted domain object is created in the LSA of the trusting domain, and a Secret object is created in the LSA of the trusting domain. </P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
