<H3>Using TCP/IP for Scalability in Windows Networks</H3><P>TCP/IP delivers a scalable internetworking technology widely supported by hardware and software vendors. </P>
<P>When TCP/IP is used as the enterprise-networking protocol, the Windows-based networking solutions from Microsoft can be used on an existing internetwork to provide client and server support for TCP/IP and connectivity utilities. These solutions include:</P>
<UL><LI>     Microsoft Windows&nbsp;NT Workstation 3.5, with enhancements to support wide area networks (WAN), TCP/IP printing, extended LMHOSTS file, Windows Sockets 1.1, FTP Server service software, and DHCP and WINS client software.</LI><LI>     Microsoft Windows&nbsp;NT Server 3.5, with the same enhancements as Windows&nbsp;NT, plus DHCP server and WINS server software to support the implementation of these new protocols.</LI><LI>     Microsoft TCP/IP-32 for Windows for Workgroups 3.11, with Windows Sockets support, can be used to provide access for Windows for Workgroups computers to Windows&nbsp;NT, LAN Manager, and other TCP/IP systems. Microsoft TCP/IP-32 includes DHCP and WINS client software.</LI><LI>     Microsoft LAN Manager, including both client and server support for Windows Sockets, and MS-DOS–based connectivity utilities. The Microsoft Network Client 2.0 software on the Windows NT Server compact disc includes new Microsoft TCP/IP support with DHCP and WINS clients.</LI></UL><P>The current version of TCP/IP for Windows&nbsp;NT also supports IP routing in systems with multiple network adapters attached to separate physical networks (multihomed systems). </P>
