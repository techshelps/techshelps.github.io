<H2>Administering the FTP Server Service</H2><P><img src="xtc7_1.gif"></P>
<P>After initial installation is complete, the FTP Server service is automatically started in the background each time the computer is started. Remote computers can initiate an FTP session while the FTP Server service is running on your Windows&nbsp;NT computer. Both computers must be running the TCP/IP protocol.</P>
<P>You must be logged on as a member of the Administrators group to administer the FTP Server.</P>
<P>Remote users can connect to the FTP Server using their account on the FTP Server, an account on the FTP Server's domain or trusted domains (Windows&nbsp;NT Server only), or using the <B>anonymous</B> account if the FTP Server service is configured to allow anonymous logons.</P>
<P>When making any configuration changes to the FTP Server (with the exception of security configuration), you must restart the FTP Server by either restarting the computer or manually stopping and restarting the server, using the <B>net</B> command or Services option in Control Panel. </P>
<H3><A NAME="sec0"></A>To start or stop the FTP Server service</H3><UL><LI><FONT FACE="Symbol">     </FONT>Double-click the Services option in Control Panel.</LI></UL><P>    – Or –</P>
<P>    At the command prompt, type the command <B>net stop ftpsvc</B> followed by the <B>net start ftpsvc</B> command. </P>
<P>Restarting the service in this way disconnects any users presently connected to the FTP Server without warning—so use the FTP Server option in Control Panel to determine if any users are connected. Pausing the FTP Server (by using the Services option in Control Panel or the <B>net pause </B>command) prevents any more users from connecting to the FTP Server but does not disconnect the currently logged on users. This feature is useful when the administrator wants to restart the server without disconnecting the current users. After the users disconnect on their own, the administrator can safely shut down the server without worrying that users might lose work. When attempting to connect to a Windows&nbsp;NT FTP Server that has been paused, clients receive the message "421&nbsp;-&nbsp;Service not available, closing control connection."</P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
