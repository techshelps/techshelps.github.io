<H2>Windows&nbsp;NT User Accounts</H2><P>Windows&nbsp;NT needs only a single logon, even for a heterogeneous networking environment, in part because security in Windows&nbsp;NT is assigned by user rather than by resource. Resource-based security models require a separate password for each resource a user wants to access.</P>
<P>In Windows&nbsp;NT, the network administrator creates an account for each user wanting to use network resources. As described in Chapter 2, "Windows&nbsp;NT Security Model," of the <I>Windows&nbsp;NT Resource Guide, </I>Windows&nbsp;NT maintains a user account containing a unique security ID within the user accounts database. Windows&nbsp;NT also keeps track of permissions and user rights for the user. When a person logs on, the <I>Security Accounts Manager</I> (SAM) checks the user's logon information against data in its user accounts database to authenticate the logon. Then, when access is granted, the <I>Local Security Authority</I> (LSA) creates a security access token for that user.</P>

<P><b>Note</b></P>
<P>A user who forgets his or her password might assume that he or she can gain access to a resource via the Guest account; this is not the case. Because Windows&nbsp;NT recognizes the username, it compares the user's logon information only with the account information for that username. If the password does not match, no access is granted.</P>
<P>By default, the Guest account on Windows&nbsp;NT Server is disabled so that only those users with recognized accounts can access the system. As described in the <I>Windows&nbsp;NT Server Concepts and Planning Guide</I>, Windows&nbsp;NT uses the Guest account for people with an unrecognized user account, including users logging on from untrusted domains. Domains and trust relations are explained later in this chapter.</P>
<P></P>
<P>Depending on the way your corporation's network is organized, a given user might, in fact, have more than one account, perhaps one granting access to the local computer or workgroup and another for domains on the network. The user account database used to authenticate a logon doesn't necessarily reside on the user's local computer. Its location depends on whether the computer is part of a workgroup or a domain and whether the user is logging on to the local computer, to the home domain, or to another domain. </P>
<P>In the Windows&nbsp;NT security model, there are two types of user accounts:</P>
<UL><LI>A <I>global user account</I> is a normal user account that fits into the Windows&nbsp;NT model described in this chapter. User accounts on Windows&nbsp;NT Workstation computers and on Windows&nbsp;NT Server computers that are not domain controllers are global accounts. Global users are authenticated by the primary domain controller (PDC) or backup domain controller (BDC) on a domain, or through trust relationships.</LI><LI>A <I>local user account</I> is a user account that fully participates in a domain but is available only by remote logon and is authenticated only by user information available locally on the machine that is processing the logon.  For example, a local user might be a member of a Windows for Workgroups, LAN Manager 2.<I>x, </I>or Novell network. Local user accounts are available only within their domain; they cannot be authenticated through trust relationships. </LI></UL></FONT></BODY></HTML>
