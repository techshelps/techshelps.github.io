<H3>IP Addresses and Domain Names</H3><P>Each computer on the Internet must have an IP address. If you use a PPP dial-up connection the Internet, to use Internet tools, it does not matter if you are assigned a random IP address by the PPP server for the duration of your call.</P>
<P>If you want to start a WWW server you will want a permanent IP address. If you want to connect a network to the Internet, you must have as many IP addresses as you have computers on the network.</P>
<P>For an Internet server or servers to become reachable by a friendly name, such as <B>microsoft.com</B>, rather than an IP address of 12 numerals, you must use a domain name. Most Internet service providers can register a domain name for your Internet service and provide IP addresses. Both are required to be seen and used by others on the Internet.</P>
<P>If you must apply for your own domain name or IP addresses, you should have a good understanding of the Domain Name System (DNS) and TCP/IP networking.</P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
