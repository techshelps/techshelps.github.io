<H3>TCP/IP Protocol</H3><P>At the protocol level, Windows&nbsp;NT includes a fast, robust implementation of the Transport Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) protocol stack, the most commonly used protocol among UNIX systems. Using TCP/IP, Windows&nbsp;NT computers can communicate with UNIX systems without additional networking software. (TCP/IP also provides efficient communication on wide-area networks, even when no UNIX systems are involved.) The TCP/IP protocol stack for Windows&nbsp;NT is NDIS-compliant and so can be used in conjunction with NetBEUI Frame (NBF) and other NDIS-compliant protocols. It includes an internet protocol (IP) router, serial line internet protocol (SLIP), and point-to-point protocol (PPP) support.</P>
<P>In addition to the TCP/IP protocol itself, Windows&nbsp;NT also includes more than a dozen TCP/IP utilities that make it easier for experienced UNIX users to access UNIX systems from Windows&nbsp;NT and to administer the TCP/IP networking on their own computer. Additional tools are included on the CD-ROM accompanying this resource kit.</P>
<P>Windows&nbsp;NT also provides facilities for integrating computers running Windows&nbsp;NT into networks managed through Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP), which is commonly used to manage TCP/IP networks. Through its SNMP service, a Windows&nbsp;NT computer can report its current status to an SNMP management system on a TCP/IP network, either in response to a request from a management system or automatically when a significant event occurs on the Windows&nbsp;NT computer.</P>
