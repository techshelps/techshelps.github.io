<H3>Access to Files in a Trusting Domain</H3><P>Users from the trusted domain can be given rights and permissions to objects in the trusting domain using File Manager, just as if they were members of the trusting domain. Subject to account privilege, users in the trusted domain can browse resources in the trusting domain. </P>
<P>For example, suppose the London domain trusts the Topeka domain. User EmilyP, who is a member of the Topeka domain, wants to access MYFILE.TXT, which is a file located on a Windows&nbsp;NT Server computer in the London domain. When EmilyP attempts to log on to the server in London, her user account information is not transferred to the London domain's user database. Because London trusts Topeka, the London domain has access to user information in the Topeka domain's user account database. Authenticating a user logon in this manner is called <I>pass-through authentication, </I>a concept that is discussed in greater detail later in this chapter. </P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
