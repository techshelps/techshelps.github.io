<H2>Using Windows&nbsp;NT with NetWare</H2><P>Windows&nbsp;NT computers can easily be integrated into a predominantly NetWare environment, making the benefits of an advanced operating system available to an existing network.</P>
<P>A network administrator contemplating a mixed network environment is naturally concerned about how the various components will be able to communicate with each other. In the case of a mixed Windows-based networking and NetWare environment, the network administrator wants to ensure that Windows&nbsp;NT Workstation computers added to the network are able to use file and print resources on existing NetWare servers, and that existing NetWare clients can access client-server applications running on Windows&nbsp;NT Servers. The following figure shows how the various components of the network relate to each other.</P>

<P>The following sections discuss how Windows&nbsp;NT computers can effectively function either as a client of NetWare servers or as an application server for NetWare clients.</P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
