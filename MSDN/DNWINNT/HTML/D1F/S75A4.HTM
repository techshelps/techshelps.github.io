<H3>Troubleshooting Logon Problems</H3><P>This section discusses the two categories of typical problems users might face that relate to logons:</P>
<UL><LI>Problems when trying to view a server's shared resources</LI><LI>Problems when trying to access one of those resources</LI></UL><H4><A NAME="sec0"></A>Viewing a Server's Shared Resources</H4><P>Suppose AnnM logs on to a Windows&nbsp;NT domain with the password Yippee. She wants to view the shared resources on a server named \\PRODUCTS, but her password there is Yahoo. Because of this situation, Ann sees the following message displayed on the screen:</P>
<P><BR></P>
<pre><code><BR>Error 5: Access has been denied.</code></pre>
<P>AnnM asks the administrator of \\PRODUCTS to change her password, but the administrator leaves the User Must Change Password At Next Logon checkbox checked. When AnnM tries to view the server's shared resources this time, she sees the following message displayed on the screen:</P>
<P><BR></P>
<pre><code><BR>Error 2242: The password of this user has expired.</code></pre>
<P>When the administrator of \\PRODUCTS clears the User Must Change Password At Next Logon checkbox, AnnM is finally able to see the server's shared resources.</P>
<H4><A NAME="sec1"></A>Accessing a Server's Shared Resources</H4><P>Suppose AnnM is logged on to a Windows&nbsp;NT domain with the password Yippee but wants to connect to a shared directory on \\PRODUCTS, where her password is Yahoo. Even though \\PRODUCTS has a Guest account because there is an account for AnnM, she is not allowed to gain access via the Guest account. Instead, Windows&nbsp;NT prompts AnnM for the valid password on \\PRODUCTS.</P>
<P>On the other hand, JeffH wants to access the same shared directory and has no account on \\PRODUCTS. He is allowed access to this resource via the Guest account for \\PRODUCTS and is assigned the permissions associated with that account.</P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
