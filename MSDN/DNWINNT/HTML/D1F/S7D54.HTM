<H3>NetBIOS Gateway</H3><P>Windows NT continues to support NetBIOS gateways, the architecture used in previous version of Windows NT and LAN Manager. Remote users connect using NetBEUI, and the RAS server translates packets, if necessary, to IPX or TCP/IP. This enables users to share network resources in a multi-protocol LAN, but prevents them from running applications which rely on IPX or TCP/IP on the client. The NetBIOS gateway is used by default when remote clients are using NetBEUI. The following illustrates the NetBIOS gateway architecture of RAS.</P>

<P>An example of the NetBIOS gateway capability is remote network access for Lotus&reg; Notes&reg; users. While Lotus Notes does offer dial up connectivity, dial up is limited to the Notes application only. RAS complements this connectivity by providing a low-cost, high-performance remote network connection for Notes&reg; users which not only connects Notes, but offers file and print services, and access to other network resources.</P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
