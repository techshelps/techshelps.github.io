<H2>Windows&nbsp;NT Workstations and Servers</H2><P>Above all, the goal of a network is to share resources in one location on the network and to use them from another location on the network. On a network, computers can be organized in one of two ways:</P>
<UL><LI>On networks using a classic <I>client-server model,</I> dedicated servers share resources and client workstations can access those resources.</LI><LI>On networks using the <I>peer-to-peer networking model</I> (also called workgroup computing), each computer can act as both client workstation and server. Computers running </LI></UL><P>Windows&nbsp;NT allows you to configure your network using either or both of these models. Windows NT Workstation can use the peer-to-peer model with as many as ten users simultaneously connected to each workstation.</P>
<P>In the Windows&nbsp;NT architecture, two software components—called the server and the redirector—provide server and workstation functionality. Both of these components reside above the TDI and are implemented as file system drivers. </P>
<P>Being implemented as file system drivers has several benefits. Applications can call a single API (namely, Windows&nbsp;NT I/O functions) to access files on local and remote computers. From the I/O Manager's perspective, there is no difference between accessing files stored on a remote networked computer and accessing those stored locally on a hard disk. The redirector and server can directly call other drivers and other kernel-mode components such as the Cache Manager, thus optimizing performance. Each can be loaded and unloaded dynamically. In addition, the Windows&nbsp;NT redirector can coexist with other redirectors (discussed more fully in the section called "Interoperating with Other Networks," later in this chapter).</P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
