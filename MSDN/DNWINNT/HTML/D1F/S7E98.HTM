<H3>Connecting a LAN to the Internet</H3><P>If you have a small business you might want your LAN clients to access the Internet. By installing Windows&nbsp;NT with a network adapter card connected to your LAN, and another network card for your Internet connection, you can create two-way communication with the Internet by configuring Windows&nbsp;NT as a simple router.</P>

<P>Windows&nbsp;NT is suited as a TCP/IP router only in small, single subnet networks because Windows&nbsp;NT does not process the RIP requests that automatically maintain a TCP/IP router table. If you have a larger network, with more that one subnet, you probably need the performance of a dedicated router (and likely have routers in your network already).</P>
