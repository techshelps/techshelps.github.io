<H2>Installing DHCP Servers</H2><P>You install a DHCP server as part of the process of installing Microsoft TCP/IP. These instructions assume you have already installed the Windows&nbsp;NT Server operating system on the computer.</P>
<P><B>Caution    </B>Before installing a new DHCP server, check for other DHCP servers on the network to avoid interfering with them.</P>
<P>You must be a member of the Administrators group for the computer you are installing or administering as a DHCP server.</P>
<H3><A NAME="sec0"></A>To install a DHCP server</H3><OL><LI>Double-click the Network icon in Control Panel to display the Network Settings dialog box, and then choose the Add Software button to display the Add Network Software dialog box.</LI><LI>In the Network Software box, select TCP/IP Protocol And Related Components, and then choose the Continue button. </LI><LI>In the Windows&nbsp;NT TCP/IP Installation Options dialog box, select the appropriate options to be installed, including at least DHCP Server Service. Also select the SNMP Service option if you want to use Performance Monitor or SNMP to monitor DHCP.</LI><LI>Choose the OK button. When Windows&nbsp;NT Setup prompts you for the full path to the Windows&nbsp;NT Server distribution files, provide the appropriate location, and then choose the Continue button. </LI></OL><P>All necessary files are copied to your hard disk. </P>
<P>After you finish configuring TCP/IP and the Network Settings dialog box is displayed, choose the OK button. </P>
<OL><LI>Complete all the required procedures for manually configuring TCP/IP as described in "Configuring TCP/IP" in Chapter 11, "Installing and Configuring Microsoft TCP/IP and SNMP." </LI></OL><P>If this DHCP server is multihomed (has multiple network adapters), you must use the Advanced Microsoft TCP/IP Configuration dialog box to specify IP addresses and other information for each network adapter. </P>
<P>Also, if any adapter on the DHCP server is connected to a subnet that you do not want this server to support, then you must disable the bindings to that subnet for the particular adapter. To do this, double-click the Network icon in Control Panel, choose the Bindings button in the Network Settings dialog box, and then disable the related binding.</P>
<P><B>Note</B>   You cannot use DHCP to automatically configure a new DHCP server, because a computer cannot be a DHCP client and server simultaneously.</P>
<P>All the appropriate TCP/IP and DHCP software is ready for use after you reboot the computer.</P>
<P>The DHCP Client service is a Windows&nbsp;NT service running on a Windows&nbsp;NT computer. The supporting DHCP client software is automatically installed for computers running Windows&nbsp;NT Server or Windows&nbsp;NT Workstation when you install the basic operating system software.</P>
<P>The Microsoft DHCP Server service starts automatically during system startup if you have installed this service. You will probably want to pause the service while you are configuring scopes for the first time.</P>
<H3><A NAME="sec1"></A>To pause the DHCP Server service at any Windows&nbsp;NT computer</H3><OL><LI>Double-click the Services icon in Control Panel. </LI></OL><P>– Or –</P>
<P>In Server Manager, choose Services from the Computer menu. </P>
<OL><LI>In the Services dialog box, select the Microsoft DHCP Server service. </LI><LI>Choose the Pause button, and then choose the Close button.</LI></OL><P>You can also start, stop, pause, and continue the DHCP service at the command prompt using the following commands:  <B>net start dhcpserver</B>, <B>net stop dhcpserver</B>,<B> net pause dhcpserver</B>, and <B>net continue dhcpserver</B>. </P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
