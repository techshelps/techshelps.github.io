<H2>Windows&nbsp;NT Networking Model</H2><P>As with other architecture components of Windows&nbsp;NT, the networking architecture is built of layers. This helps provide expandability by allowing other functions and services to be added. Figure 1.5 shows all of the components that make up the Windows&nbsp;NT networking model.</P>

<P>Figure 1.5    Windows&nbsp;NT Networking Model</P>
<P>Each of the Windows&nbsp;NT networking layers performs these functions.</P>
<P>The Windows&nbsp;NT networking model begins at the MAC sublayer where <I>network adapter card drivers</I> reside. These drivers link Windows&nbsp;NT to the network via corresponding network adapter cards. Windows&nbsp;NT includes RAS to allow network access to computers for people who work at home or on the road. For more information, see "Remote Access for Windows&nbsp;NT Clients," later in this chapter.</P>
<P>The network model includes two important interfaces — the <I>NDIS 3.0 Interface</I> and the <I>Transport Driver Interface</I> (TDI). These interfaces isolate one layer from the next by allowing an adjacent component to be written to a single standard rather than many. For example, a network adapter card driver (below the NDIS interface) does not need to include blocks of code specifically written for each transport protocol it uses. Instead, the driver is written to the NDIS interface, which solicits services from the appropriate NDIS-conformant transport protocol(s). These interfaces are included in the Windows&nbsp;NT networking model to allow for portable, interchangeable modules. </P>
<P>Between the two interfaces are <I>transport protocols</I>, which act as data organizers for the network. A transport protocol defines how data should be presented to the next receiving layer and packages the data accordingly. It passes data to the network adapter card driver through the NDIS Interface and to the redirector through the TDI.</P>
<P>Above the TDI are <I>redirectors,</I> which "redirect" local requests for network resources to the network.</P>
<P>For interconnectivity with other vendors' networks, Windows&nbsp;NT allows multiple redirectors. For each redirector, the Windows&nbsp;NT computer must also have a corresponding <I>provider</I> DLL (supplied by the network vendor). A Multiple Provider Router determines the appropriate provider and then routes the application request via the provider to the corresponding redirector. </P>
<P>The rest of this chapter describes these Windows&nbsp;NT networking components in detail.</P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
