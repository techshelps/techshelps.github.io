<H2>Integrating Windows&nbsp;NT and UNIX Systems</H2><P>With its advanced configuration management tools, Windows&nbsp;NT is especially suited for integrating with most of the UNIX variants that are likely to be found on many networks. Among the Windows&nbsp;NT features that make it easy to interoperate with UNIX systems are:</P>
<UL><LI>Built-in TCP/IP protocol and utilities.</LI><LI>Support for character and graphics terminal emulation.</LI><LI>Advanced file transfer and data sharing capabilities.</LI><LI>Distributed processing support.</LI><LI>Application portability.</LI></UL><P>The following sections provide further information about these features. With DHCP and WINS, combined with the DNS server and other TCP/IP tools provided in this resource kit, integrating Windows&nbsp;NT and UNIX systems is easier than ever. For full details on TCP/IP in the Windows&nbsp;NT environment, see Part III, "TCP/IP," and Part IV, "Windows&nbsp;NT and the Internet."</P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
