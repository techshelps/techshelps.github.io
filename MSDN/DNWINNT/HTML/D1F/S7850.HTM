<H4><A NAME="sec1"></A>PullCommRetryCount {Pull 2}</H4><P>    Specifies the retry count in case of communication failure when doing pull replication. This is the maximum number of retries to be done at the interval specified for the partner before WINS stops for a set number of replication-time intervals before trying again.</P>
<H4><A NAME="sec2"></A>PullPnrTable {Pull 3}</H4><P>    A list of partners with which pull replication needs to be done.</P>
<H4><A NAME="sec3"></A>pPullPnrEntry {PullPnrTable 1}</H4><P>    The row corresponding to a partner.</P>
<H4><A NAME="sec4"></A>PullPnrAdd {pPullPnrEntry 1} </H4><P>    The address of the remote WINS partner. </P>

<H4><A NAME="sec7"></A>PullPnrMemberPrec {pPullPnrEntry 4}</H4><P>    The precedence to be given to members of the special group pulled from the WINS. The precedence of locally registered members of a special group is more than any replicas pulled in.</P>
<H4><A NAME="sec8"></A>PullPnrNoOfSuccRpls {pPullPnrEntry 5}</H4><P>    The number of times replication was successful with the WINS after invocation or reset of counters.</P>
<H4><A NAME="sec9"></A>PullPnrNoOfCommFails {pPullPnrEntry 6}</H4><P>    The number of times replication was unsuccessful with the WINS because of communication failure (after invocation or reset of counters).</P>
<H4><A NAME="sec10"></A>PullPnrVersNoLowWord {pPullPnrEntry 7}</H4><P>    The Low Word of the highest version number found in records owned by this WINS. </P>
