<H3>Planning for Server Performance</H3><P>A WINS server can typically service 1500 name registrations per minute and about 760 queries per minute. There is no built-in limit to the number of records that a WINS server can replicate or store.</P>
<P>Based on these numbers, and planning for large-scale power outage where many computers will come on line simultaneously, the conservative recommendation is that you plan to include one WINS server and a backup server for every 10,000 computers on the network.</P>
<P>Two factors can particularly enhance WINS server performance. WINS performance increases almost 25 percent on a computer with two processors. Also, using NTFS as the file system also improves performance. </P>
<P>After you establish WINS servers in the internetwork, you can adjust the Renewal interval. Setting this interval to reduce the numbers of registrations can help tune server response time. (The Renewal interval is specified in the WINS Server Configuration dialog box.)</P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
