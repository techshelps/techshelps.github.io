<H3>Additional Considerations Regarding Mixed Networking Environments</H3><P>Before adding computers running Windows&nbsp;NT (or other non-NetWare operating systems) to a NetWare network, a NetWare administrator should anticipate some of the potential problems that might arise.</P>
<P>One source of possible difficulty for NetWare administrators is that Windows&nbsp;NT NetWare clients do not run NetWare logon scripts. However, Windows&nbsp;NT can run its own logon scripts, and the ability of Windows&nbsp;NT to maintain persistent connections through logon scripts and user profiles provides much the same functionality as NetWare logon scripts in many instances.</P>
<P>Another area of difficulty is backing up Windows&nbsp;NT NetWare clients. Novell servers do not provide tape backup services for their Windows&nbsp;NT clients without third-party software. A Windows&nbsp;NT computer equipped with a supported tape drive can back up other Windows&nbsp;NT computers, as well as NetWare servers and computers running Windows networking software.</P>
<P>Finally, Windows&nbsp;NT can act as a client only for a NetWare server running NetWare version 3<I>.x</I> and earlier. Windows&nbsp;NT can access servers running NetWare 4.<I>x</I> through the server's Bindery Emulation Mode that emulates version 3<I>.x</I>. </P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
