<H3>Troubleshooting Telnet</H3><H4><A NAME="sec0"></A>To determine why the banner displayed with Telnet identifies a different computer, even when specifying the correct IP address</H4><OL><LI>Make sure the DNS name and hosts table are up to date. </LI><LI>Make sure that two computers on the same network are not mistakenly configured with the same IP address. 
<P>The ethernet and IP address mapping is done by the ARP (address resolution protocol) module, which believes the first response it receives. Therefore, the impostor computer's reply sometimes comes back before the intended computer's reply. </P>

<P>These problems are difficult to isolate and track down. Use the <B>arp&nbsp;-g </B>command to display the mappings in the ARP cache. If you know the ethernet address for the intended remote computer, you can easily determine whether the two match. If not, use <B>arp&nbsp;-d </B>to delete the entry, then use <B>ping </B>with the same address (forcing an ARP), and check the ethernet address in the cache again by using <B>arp&nbsp;-g</B>. </P>

<P>Chances are that if both computers are on the same network, you will eventually get a different response. If not, you might have to filter the traffic from the impostor host to determine the owner or location of the system.</P></LI></OL></FONT></BODY></HTML>
