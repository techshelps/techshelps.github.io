<H2>Overview of TCP/IP Printing</H2><P>In a Windows&nbsp;NT internetwork with multiple kinds of computers and operating systems, users can take advantage of Microsoft TCP/IP to easily print to computers that are connected through a UNIX computer or that are connected directly to the network (via a built-in network adapter card or through a serial/parallel ethernet print server). </P>
<P>Such an internetwork might include computers running Windows&nbsp;NT Workstation and Windows&nbsp;NT Server, plus computers with only Microsoft Windows for Workgroups 3.11 or MS-DOS with LAN Manager networking software. </P>
<P>To take advantage of the printing capabilities of Microsoft TCP/IP, only the single Windows&nbsp;NT computer that defines a TCP/IP printer needs to have TCP/IP installed. All the other client computers can print to the TCP/IP printers over any protocol they share with the Windows&nbsp;NT TCP/IP print server. That is, the computer acting as the Windows NT TCP/IP print server must be configured with all protocols used by any clients that will be printing to the TCP/IP printer. </P>
<P>Any Windows&nbsp;NT computer with TCP/IP printing installed can print directly to these kinds of printers and can function as a gateway for other network users.</P>
<P>In the following sample configuration of a Microsoft network, all computers can connect to printers named <B>\\nt\p1</B> and <B>\\nt\p2</B> on the network. The Windows&nbsp;NT computer with Microsoft TCP/IP installed created these TCP/IP printers, which consist of a direct-connect printer and a printer connected to a UNIX computer. The Windows&nbsp;NT computer with TCP/IP is named <B>nt</B> in this example, and the printers are named <B>p1</B> and <B>p2</B>, respectively. </P>
