<H3>Configuring WINS Servers</H3><P>For each WINS server, you must configure threshold intervals for triggering database replication, based on a specific time, a time period, or a certain number of new records. If you designate a specific time for replication, this occurs one time only. If a time period is specified, replication is repeated at that interval.</P>

<P><BR></P><P>The replication interval for this WINS server's pull partner is defined in the Preferences dialog box, as described in "Setting Preferences for WINS Manager" later in this chapter. The extinction interval, extinction timeout, and verify interval are derived from the renewal interval and the replication interval specified. The WINS server adjusts the values specified by the administrator to keep the inconsistency between a WINS server and its partners as small as possible.</P>
<OL start=4><LI>If you want this WINS server to pull replicas of new WINS database entries from its partners when the system is initialized or when a replication-related parameter changes, select the  Initial Replication in the Pull Parameters checkbox, and then type a value for Retry Count.</LI></OL><P>The retry count is the number of times the server should attempt to connect (in case of failure) with a partner for pulling replicas. Retries are attempted at the replication interval specified in the Preferences dialog box. If all retries are unsuccessful, WINS waits for a period before starting replication again. For information about setting the start time and replication interval for pull and push partners, see "Setting Preferences for WINS Manager" later in this chapter. </P>
