<H1>Setting Up LMHOSTS</H1><P>The LMHOSTS file is commonly used on Microsoft networks to locate remote computers for network file, print, and remote procedure services and for domain services such as logons, browsing, replication, and so on. </P>
<P>Use the LMHOSTS file for smaller networks or to find hosts on remote networks that are not part of the WINS database (since name query requests are not broadcast beyond the local subnet). If WINS servers are in place on an internetwork, users do not have to rely on broadcast queries for name resolution, since WINS is the preferred method for name resolution. With WINS servers in place, therefore, the LMHOSTS file might not be necessary. </P>
