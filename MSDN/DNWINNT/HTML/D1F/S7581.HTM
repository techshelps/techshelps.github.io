<H2>Workgroups and Domains </H2><P>A <I>workgroup</I> is simply an organizational unit, a way to group computers that don't belong to a domain. In a workgroup, each computer keeps track of its own user and group account information and does not share this information with other computers. Each Windows&nbsp;NT computer that participates in a workgroup maintains its own security policy and security account databases.  </P>
<P>Users on a workgroup are considered global users, as explained in the previous section. Logons to another computer are authenticated on the remote computer only by valid username and password.</P>

<P>Figure 4.2    Computers Participating in a Workgroup</P>
<P>A workgroup is a good network configuration for a small group of computers with not many user accounts, where network administration is not an issue, or in an environment with a mix of Microsoft networks that does not include Windows&nbsp;NT Server computers.</P>
<P>A <I>domain</I> is a group of servers that share common security policy and user account databases. One Windows&nbsp;NT Server computer acts as the primary domain controller (PDC), which maintains the centralized security databases for the domain. Other Windows&nbsp;NT Server computers in the domain function as backup domain controllers and can authenticate logon requests. Domains can also contain Windows&nbsp;NT Server computers that do not act as domain controllers, Windows&nbsp;NT Workstation computers, LAN Manager 2<I>.x</I> servers, and other workstations such as those running Windows for Workgroups and MS-DOS. Users of a Windows&nbsp;NT Server domain are authenticated by the primary domain controller or by a backup domain controller. Logon credentials include the username, password, and domain name.</P>
<P>With Windows&nbsp;NT, administrators have full centralized control over security. To eliminate any single point of failure on a Windows&nbsp;NT Server domain, the user account database, including the logon scripts (which are discussed in Chapter 3, "Windows&nbsp;NT User Environments") is automatically replicated to the backup domain controllers.</P>

<P>Figure 4.3    Computers Participating in a Domain</P>
<P>Domains and workgroups can interoperate and are identical in terms of browsing. If a Windows&nbsp;NT  computer is not participating in a domain, it is by default part of a workgroup (even if the workgroup is only one computer) and can be browsed as part of that workgroup. For more information, see Chapter 5, "Windows&nbsp;NT Browser."</P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
