<H3>Using DHCP</H3><P>The best method for ensuring easy and accurate installation of TCP/IP is to use automatic DHCP configuration, which uses DHCP to configure your local computer with the correct IP address, subnet mask, and default gateway. </P>
<P>You can take advantage of this method for configuring TCP/IP if there is a DHCP server installed on your network. The network administrator can tell you if this option is available. You cannot use DHCP configuration for a server that you are installing as a DHCP server or a WINS server. You must configure TCP/IP settings manually for DHCP servers, as described in "Configuring TCP/IP Manually" later in this chapter. </P>
<H4><A NAME="sec0"></A>To configure TCP/IP using DHCP</H4><OL><LI>    Make sure the Enable Automatic DHCP Configuration option is checked in either the Windows&nbsp;NT TCP/IP Installation Options dialog box or the TCP/IP Configuration dialog box.</LI><LI>    When you restart the computer after completing TCP/IP installation, the DHCP server automatically provides the correct configuration information for your computer.</LI></OL><P>If you subsequently attempt to configure TCP/IP in the Network Settings dialog box, the system warns you that any manual settings will override the automatic settings provided by DHCP. As a general rule, you should not change the automatic settings unless you specifically want to override a setting provided by DHCP. For detailed information about DHCP, see "Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol" in Chapter&nbsp;12, "Networking Concepts for TCP/IP."</P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
