<H3>The Netlogon Service</H3><P>The Netlogon service provides users logging on with a single access point to a domain's primary domain controller and all backup domain controllers. The Netlogon service replicates any changes to the security database to all domain controllers in the domain, including the SAM, BuiltIn, and LSA databases described in Chapter 2, "Windows&nbsp;NT Security Model," of the <I>Windows&nbsp;NT Resource Guide. </I>The SAM database is limited only by the number of Registry entries permitted and by the performance limits of the computer hardware. The maximum number of accounts of all types the SAM database supports is 10,000. </P>
<P>The Netlogon service on a Windows&nbsp;NT Server computer fully synchronizes its user database when the domain controller is first installed, or when the domain controller is brought back online after being offline, and the PDC's change log is full when the server returns online. </P>
<P>The Netlogon service accepts logon requests from any client and provides complete authentication information from the SAM database. It can authenticate logon requests as a member of a trusting or trusted domain. </P>
<P>The Netlogon service runs on any Windows&nbsp;NT computer that is a member of a domain. It requires the Workstation service and the "Access This Computer from Network" right, which is set in User Manager on Windows&nbsp;NT Workstation computers or servers, or User Manager for Domains on domain controllers. A domain controller also requires that the Server service be running. </P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
