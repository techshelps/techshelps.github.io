<H3>WAIS Toolkit</H3><P>The WAIS Toolkit is a companion to the WAIS Server service, Gopher Server service, and HTTP Server service. The toolkit includes the following files:</P>

<P><BR></P><P>To install the WAIS Toolkit software, your computer must meet the following requirements:</P>
<UL><LI>The computer must have an Intel, Digital Alpha, or MIPS processor.</LI><LI>At least 16 MB of RAM must be installed on the computer.</LI><LI>The Windows&nbsp;NT operating system must be installed on the computer.</LI></UL><H4><A NAME="sec0"></A>Installing the WAIS Toolkit</H4><P>The WAIS Toolkit software is generally installed at the same time as the WAIS, Gopher, or HTTP Server services. The EMWAC document, <I>WAIS Toolkit</I>, (included in this resource kit) gives you complete information on installing the WAIS Toolkit. It is in the same directory with the files for the WAIS Server program (WAISS.EXE) and toolkit files listed in the section immediately preceding this one. The EMWAC document is in WAISTOOL.DOC (the Word for Windows file) and WAISTOOL.PS (the PostScript file ready for printing).</P>
<H4><A NAME="sec1"></A>Using the WAIS Toolkit</H4><P>The EMWAC document, <I>WAIS Toolkit</I>, contains information on using the tools. Read the section "Using the Tools" in that document for a thorough discussion of the command syntax for the tools and for information on making the WAIS index more usable by the use of synonym files. There are many parameters and options to these commands. You will probably want to test the tools on your files and make adjustment to your commands before making your WAIS server public.</P>
<P>If files are constantly being added to your WAIS server, you will probably want to set up a batch file to create a new index on a regular basis. If new information appears all at once and at irregular intervals, you might prefer to create a new index explicitly at those times. </P>
<P>Telnet Server</P>
<P>Telnet is an Internet standard protocol supporting remote, text-based sessions from a system running a telnet <I>client</I> program to a <I>host</I> system running a telnet<I> server</I> service. A telnet client program is included with Windows&nbsp;NT 3.5. A Telnet server service is included with this resource kit. After you install the Telnet server service, Internet users will be able to <I>telnet</I> from any system running a telnet client to your Windows&nbsp;NT 3.5 Internet server. They can then issue commands through a text-based command-line interpreter, such as CMD.EXE.</P>
<P>The Telnet server service has two components: the service itself (TELNETD.EXE) and an underlying component, the <I>Remote Session Manager</I>. The Remote Session Manager is responsible for initiating, terminating and managing telnet sessions. It includes a number of command-line utilities designed to make it easier to work in a remote character session environment. </P>
<P>The<B><I> </I></B>Telnet Server service<B><I> </I></B>runs on all Intel-based platforms that run Windows&nbsp;NT&nbsp;3.5, and requires less than 3 MB of space on your hard disk. </P>
<P>The Telnet Server service is a subset of The Connectivity Kit from Software Innovations, Inc. For more information on <I>The Connectivity Kit</I>, contact Software Innovations Incorporated:</P>

<P>Installing the Telnet Server Service</P>
<P>Before you install the Telnet server service<B><I>,</I></B> you must be running the TCP/IP protocol. Install the Telnet server service using the Network option in Control Panel. You should be logged in as Administrator when this service.</P>
<P>All the files needed to actually install the Telnet server service are in the \TELNET subdirectory of the directory for your platform on the resource kit CD. You must install the Remote Session Manager first, and then install Telnetd.</P>
<P>To install the Telnet server service</P>
<P>Double-click the Network icon in Control Panel to display the Network Settings dialog box.</P>
<P>Choose the Add Software button to display the Add Network Software dialog box.</P>
<P>In the Network Software box, choose Remote Session Manager. </P>
<P>If the Remote Session Manager does not appear on the list, choose the &lt;Other&gt; Requires Disk From Manufacturer option, and then enter the path to the installation files when you are prompted. </P>
<P>Enter the full path to the directory containing the installation files on the CD. </P>
<P>The installation files are in the \TELNET subdirectory of the directory for your platform. For example, if you are installing on a computer using an Intel <I>x</I>86 processor and your CD-ROM drive is drive D, the path would be:</P>
<P>D:\i386\TELNET  </P>
<P>Repeat steps 2, 3, and 4 to install Telnetd. </P>
<P>The choice in the Network Software box is "Telnetd (Inbound Telnet)."</P>
<P>Choose OK when you have finished installing Telnet server service software. </P>
<P>When prompted to restart your computer, choose Yes if you want to restart the computer immediately. </P>
<P>You must restart before using the Telnet server service.</P>
<P>After the Telnet server service is installed, Remote Session Manager and Telnet Server are included in the list of installed network software.</P>
<P>Removing the Telnet Server Service</P>
<P>The Network option in the Control Panel can also be used to remove Telnet server service and Remote Session Manager<I>. </I>You must remove the Telnet server service component first, and then remove the Remote Session Manager. </P>
<P>To remove the Telnet server service or Remote Session Manager</P>
<P>Double-click the Network icon in Control Panel to display the Network Settings dialog box.</P>
<P>In the Installed Network Software list box, select the component you want to remove.</P>
<P>Choose the Remove button.</P>
<P>For information about the two components of the Telnet server service (Remote Session Manager and Telnetd), how they operate, and what environment variables you can set for them, see Appendix D, "Telnet Server Service". Appendix D also contains a discussion of the limitations of the Telnet server service.</P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
