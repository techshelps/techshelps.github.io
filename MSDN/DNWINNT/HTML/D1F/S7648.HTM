<H2>Using DHCP Manager</H2><P>The DHCP Manager icon is added to the Network Administration Tools group in Program Manager when you set up a Windows&nbsp;NT Server computer to be a DHCP server. You must use DHCP Manager to perform the following basic tasks:</P>
<UL><LI>Create one or more DHCP scopes to begin providing DHCP services</LI><LI>Define properties for the scope, including the lease duration and IP address ranges to be distributed to potential DHCP clients in the scope</LI><LI>Define default values for options such as the default gateway, DNS server, or WINS server to be assigned together with an IP address, or add any custom options</LI></UL><P>The procedures for completing these tasks are described in the following sections.</P>
<P>To start DHCP Manager</P>

<P>At the command prompt, type the <B>start dhcpadmn</B> command, and then press Enter.</P>

<P><B>Important    </B>When you are working with DHCP Manager, all computer names are DNS host names only. The full path specification might be used, such as <B>accounting.trey.com</B>, or a name might be specified relative to the local domain. In the previous example, other computers in the <B>trey.com </B>DNS domain can refer simply to <B>accounting</B>. The DNS host name is not necessarily the same as the NetBIOS computer name used in Windows-based networking.</P>
