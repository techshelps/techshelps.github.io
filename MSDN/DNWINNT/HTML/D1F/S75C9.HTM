<H2>Loading the DLC Driver on Windows&nbsp;NT</H2><P>The DLC driver can be loaded when the system is first installed, or any time thereafter, using the Network option in Control Panel.</P>
<P>The order of the bindings section is significant to DLC because an adapter is specified at the DLC interface as a number—typically 0 or 1 (although Windows&nbsp;NT DLC can support up to 16 physical adapters). The number corresponds to the index of the adapter in the DLC bindings section. If you have only one network adapter card installed, DLC applications use a value of 0 to refer to this adapter, and you need not make any changes to the bindings. </P>
<P>If you have more than one adapter card, you might want to modify the bindings. </P>
<H3><A NAME="sec0"></A>To change the order of the bindings</H3><OL><LI>    From the Network Control Panel, choose Bindings.</LI><LI>    From the Show Bindings For box, choose DLC Protocol.</LI></OL><P>You will see a list of bindings, such as the following:</P>
<P>DLC Protocol -&gt; ARC Built-in Ethernet Adapter Driver -&gt;    [01] ARC Built-in Ethernet Adapter</P>
<P>DLC Protocol -&gt; IBM Token Ring Adapter Driver -&gt;    [02] IBM Token Ring Adapter</P>
<P>The numbers in brackets refer to the order in which the adapters were installed. In this example, DLC currently refers to the Ethernet adapter as adapter #0 and the Token Ring adapter as adapter #1. </P>
<P>If you have software (such as a 3270 emulator program) that allows you to specify an adapter number at run time, you might decide to keep the current setup and change the adapter number when you run the software. Typically, however, the software uses adapter #0, expecting an IBM Token Ring card to be the primary adapter. In this case, you will need to change the order of the bindings list. </P>
<OL start=3><LI>    To change the order of an item in the list, highlight the item, and then use the up- and down-arrow buttons to reposition it in the list. </LI></OL><P>For example, suppose you wanted to change the above bindings so that the IBM Token Ring adapter corresponds to adapter #0 and the ARC Ethernet adapter corresponds to adapter #1. Highlight the line containing IBM Token Ring Adapter Driver, and click once on the up-arrow button. The bindings are now correctly ordered for your application software, and you do not need to modify the program configuration.</P>
<OL start=4><LI>    Choose OK to keep the modified bindings list.</LI></OL></FONT></BODY></HTML>
