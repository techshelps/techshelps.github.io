<H2>Home Directories</H2><P>A home directory is a private storage space assigned to a user or group of users. Users typically store their private data in their home directory, and they can normally restrict or grant access to other users. When a user opens a Command Prompt window, the default directory is the user's home directory. The home directory can also be specified as the default working directory for applications.</P>
<P>If hard disk space on your network's client workstations is limited, you might want to assign each user a home directory on a Windows&nbsp;NT Server computer. Or, if you want to limit a user's access to the files and directories on a workstation, you can create a home directory on the workstation and give the user only List permission on all other directories. </P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
