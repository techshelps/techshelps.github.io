<H3>Windows&nbsp;NT Clients on a NetWare Network</H3><P>Windows&nbsp;NT was designed from the start with integrated network support in mind. Because the network support built into Windows&nbsp;NT is independent of the underlying network system, the same user interface and tools work with all networks that run on Windows&nbsp;NT. For example, with File Manager the user can browse and connect to any NetWare or Windows-networking server on the network. </P>
<P>With the Client Service for NetWare, a Windows&nbsp;NT Workstation computer can access file and print resources on NetWare servers as easily as it accesses resources on Windows-based networking servers. With the Gateway Service for NetWare, a Windows&nbsp;NT Server computer can not only access NetWare file and print resources, but also share these resources with Windows-based networking clients that have no NetWare connectivity software. To the Microsoft networking clients, the NetWare resource looks like any other shared resource on the Windows&nbsp;NT Server computer.</P>
<P>The Windows&nbsp;NT architecture includes an open interface called the multiple provider router (MPR) that enables consistent access to third-party network file systems. The MPR makes all file systems, regardless of type and physical location, accessible through the same set of file-system application programming interfaces (APIs). Applications (and components of the Windows&nbsp;NT shell) make file-system requests through the Windows&nbsp;NT Win32 API. The MPR ensures that requests are directed to the proper file system: local file requests are sent to the local disk, remote requests to Windows-based servers are sent to the proper server by the Windows&nbsp;NT redirector, and requests to NetWare servers are sent to the appropriate server by the Client or Gateway Service for NetWare.</P>
