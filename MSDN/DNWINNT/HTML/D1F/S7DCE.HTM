<H3>TCP/IP for Heterogeneous Networking</H3><P>Because most modern operating systems (in addition to Windows&nbsp;NT) support TCP/IP protocols, an internetwork with mixed system types can share information using simple networking applications and utilities. With TCP/IP as a connectivity protocol, Windows&nbsp;NT can communicate with many non-Microsoft systems, including:</P>
<UL><LI>     Internet hosts</LI><LI>     Apple&reg; Macintosh&reg; systems</LI><LI>     IBM mainframes</LI><LI>     UNIX systems</LI><LI>     Open VMS&trade; systems</LI><LI>     Printers with network adapters connected directly to the network </LI></UL><P><img src="XTC01_03.gif"></P>

<P>Microsoft TCP/IP provides a framework for interoperable heterogeneous networking. The modular architecture of Windows&nbsp;NT networking with its transport-independent services contributes to the strength of this framework. For example, Windows&nbsp;NT supports these transport protocols, among many others:</P>
<UL><LI>     IPX/SPX for use in NetWare environments, using the Microsoft NWLink transport. Besides providing interoperability with NetWare networks, IPX/SPX is a fast LAN transport for Windows-based networking as well.</LI><LI>     TCP/IP for internetworks based on IP technologies. TCP/IP is the preferred transport for internetworks and provides interoperability with UNIX and other TCP/IP-based networks.</LI><LI>     NetBEUI as the protocol for local area networking on smaller networks and compatibility with existing LAN Manager and IBM LAN Server networks.</LI><LI>     AppleTalk for connecting to and sharing resources with Macintosh systems.</LI></UL><P>Other transport protocols provided by third-party vendors, such as DECnet and OSI, can also be used by Windows&nbsp;NT networking services.</P>
<P>Windows&nbsp;NT provides standard network programming interfaces through the Windows Sockets, RPC, and NetBIOS interfaces. Developers can take advantage of this heterogeneous client-server platform to create custom applications that will run on any system in the enterprise. An example of such a service is Microsoft SQL Server, which uses Windows Sockets 1.1 to provide access to NetWare, MS-DOS–based, Windows&nbsp;NT, and UNIX clients. </P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
