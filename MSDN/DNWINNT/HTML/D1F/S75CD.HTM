<H2>Using DLC to Connect to HP Printers</H2><P>DLC is used to provide connectivity to local area network printers that are directly attached to the network, not to a specific computer. </P>
<P>Printing via the DLC protocol device driver starts by creating a printer that uses the HPMON.DLL printer driver. All commands are performed in the Print Manager utility. </P>
<H3><A NAME="sec0"></A>To connect to a printer that is directly attached to the network</H3><OL><LI>    From the Printer menu in Print Manager, choose Create Printer.</LI><LI>    In the Print To box, select Other.</LI><LI>    In the Print Destinations dialog box, select Hewlett-Packard Network Port.</LI><LI>    In the Add Hewlett-Packard Network Peripheral Port dialog box, select the network adapter card that will communicate with the printer.</LI></OL><P>From the Add Hewlett-Packard Network Peripheral Port dialog box, you can cause Windows&nbsp;NT to automatically search for printers connected to your network. You can also adjust the DLC Timers for this application. DLC timers are described in "DLC Driver Parameters in the Registry," earlier in this chapter. </P>
