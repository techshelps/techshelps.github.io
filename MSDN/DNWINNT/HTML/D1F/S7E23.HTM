<H2>Benefits of Using WINS</H2><P>WINS servers offer the following benefits for your internetwork:</P>
<UL><LI>Dynamic database maintenance to support computer name registration and name resolution. Although WINS provides dynamic name services, it offers a NetBIOS namespace, making it much more flexible than the Domain Name System (DNS) for name resolution. </LI><LI>Centralized management of the computer name database and the database replication policies, alleviating the need for managing LMHOSTS files.</LI><LI>Dramatic reduction of IP broadcast traffic in Microsoft internetworks, while allowing client computers to easily locate remote systems across local or wide area networks.</LI><LI>The ability for clients on a Windows NT Server network (including Windows&nbsp;NT, Windows for Workgroups, and LAN Manager 2.<I>x</I>) to browse domains on the far side of a router without a local domain controller being present on the other side of the router.</LI><LI>A scalable design, making it a good choice for name resolution for medium to very large internetworks.</LI></UL><P><B>Note   </B>WINS client software is part of the Microsoft TCP/IP-32 for Windows for Workgroups and the Microsoft Network Client 2.0 software that is included on the Windows NT Server compact disc. For information about installing these clients, see the <I>Windows NT Server Installation Guide</I>.</P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
