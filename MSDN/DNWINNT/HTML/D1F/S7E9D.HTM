<H3>Network Protocols and LANs</H3><P>As the name implies, the Internet is a group of interconnected networks. When you create an Internet server, you are adding another network to the network of networks. The network you add to the Internet can be one computer, a small workgroup, or your entire corporation's local area network.</P>
<P>The protocol used on a network configures the packets of data sent over the network cable. </P>

<P>The Internet is primarily a TCP/IP network. That means your computer must use the TCP/IP network protocol (it is actually a suite of protocols) to participate. Internet Protocol (IP) is one of the protocols in the suite of protocols. You can install TCP/IP during or after installation of Windows&nbsp;NT.</P>
<P>If your computer uses TCP/IP on both your LAN and the Internet, and you configure Windows&nbsp;NT as a TCP/IP as a router, your computer acts as a gateway to the Internet, passing packets of information in both directions — to the Internet from the LAN, and from the Internet into your LAN.</P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
