<H2>Advantages of Adding TCP/IP to a Windows&nbsp;NT Configuration</H2><P>The TCP/IP protocol family is a standard set of networking protocols, or rules, that govern how data is passed between computers on a network. TCP/IP is used to connect the Internet, the worldwide internetwork connecting over two million universities, research labs, U.S. defense installations, and corporations. These same protocols can be used in private internetworks that connect several local area networks.</P>
<P>Microsoft TCP/IP for Windows&nbsp;NT enables enterprise networking and connectivity on Windows&nbsp;NT computers. Adding TCP/IP to a Windows&nbsp;NT configuration offers the following advantages:</P>
<UL><LI>A standard, routable enterprise networking protocol that is the most complete and accepted protocol available. All modern operating systems offer TCP/IP support, and most large networks rely on TCP/IP for much of their network traffic.</LI><LI>A technology for connecting dissimilar systems. Many standard connectivity utilities are available to access and transfer data between dissimilar systems, including File Transfer Protocol (FTP) and Terminal Emulation Protocol (Telnet). Several of these standard utilities are included with Windows&nbsp;NT. </LI><LI>A robust, scalable, cross-platform client-server framework. Microsoft TCP/IP supports the Windows Sockets 1.1 interface, which is ideal for developing client-server applications that can run with Windows Sockets-compliant stacks from other vendors. Many public-domain Internet tools are also written to the Windows Sockets standard. Windows Sockets applications can also take advantage of other networking protocols such as Microsoft NWLink, the Microsoft implementation of the IPX/SPX protocols used in Novell&reg; NetWare&reg; networks.</LI><LI>The enabling technology necessary to connect Windows NT to the global Internet. TCP/IP, Point to Point Protocol (PPP), and Windows Sockets 1.1 provide the foundation needed to connect and use Internet services.</LI></UL></FONT></BODY></HTML>
