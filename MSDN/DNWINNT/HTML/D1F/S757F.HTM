<H1>Network Security and Administration</H1><P>Each domain and computer in a workgroup maintains its own user accounts information. Even on a multidomain network, if account information for an individual user is coordinated across all parts of the network, the user can access any server or domain with a single logon. If the user's accounts are allowed to become unsynchronized, the following problems can occur:</P>
<UL><LI>The user can't browse a domain or server for which he or she has permissions.</LI><LI>The user can't access a shared resource. </LI><LI>The user must type a password each time he or she browses or tries to access a resource.</LI></UL><P>This chapter provides tips for helping you avoid problems related to network logon. It describes how user accounts and other security information are maintained within workgroups and domains and how security information can be shared by trusted domains. </P>
<P>Before reading this chapter, be sure to read the <I>Windows&nbsp;NT Server Concepts and Planning Guide</I> for a thorough discussion of domain organization strategies and user environment management techniques. </P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
