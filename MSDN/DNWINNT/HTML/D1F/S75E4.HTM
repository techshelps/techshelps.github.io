<H3>RAS Features in Windows&nbsp;NT 3.5</H3><P>Microsoft's Remote Access Server first shipped with LAN Manager 2.1 in 1991. It was included with the Windows&nbsp;NT 3.1 operating system, and has now been significantly enhanced for Windows&nbsp;NT 3.5. RAS features the following capabilities:</P>
<UL><LI>     Multiprotocol routing via PPP support</LI><LI>     Internet support</LI><LI>     Improved integration with NetWare<FONT FACE="Symbol">Ò</FONT> networks</LI><LI>     Increased number of simultaneous connections</LI><LI>     Software data compression</LI><LI>     Data encryption</LI><LI>     Availability of the RAS APIs</LI></UL><H4><A NAME="sec0"></A>Multi-protocol Routing via PPP Support</H4><P>The underlying RAS architecture allows clients to run any combination of the network protocols NetBEUI, TCP/IP, or IPX during a RAS session. This means that Windows Sockets and NetWare-aware, as well as NetBIOS applications, can be run remotely. The Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) is used as the framing mechanism on the wire. Using PPP enables a high degree of interoperability with existing remote access services.</P>
<H4><A NAME="sec1"></A>Internet Support</H4><P>RAS enables Windows&nbsp;NT and the next version of Windows, Windows95, to provide complete services to the Internet. A Windows&nbsp;NT Server 3.5-based computer can be configured as an Internet service provider, offering dial-up Internet connections to a client workstation running Windows&nbsp;NT 3.5 or Windows95. A computer running Windows&nbsp;NT Workstation 3.5 can dial into an Internet-connected computer running Windows&nbsp;NT Server 3.5, or to any one of a variety of industry-standard PPP or SLIP-based Internet servers.</P>
<H4><A NAME="sec2"></A>Improved Integration with NetWare Networks</H4><P>Windows&nbsp;NT 3.5 and RAS fully integrate into a NetWare network. The RAS clients are running IPX and/or NetBIOS, so all applications that typically work when directly connected to the network, continue to work when remotely connected. The RAS server now supports IPX routing, enabling remote clients to gain access to all NetWare resources via the RAS server.</P>
<H4><A NAME="sec3"></A>Increased Number of Simultaneous Connections</H4><P>Windows&nbsp;NT Server 3.5 supports up to 256 simultaneous connections. The Windows&nbsp;NT Workstation provides a single RAS connection, primarily for personal use or for very small networks.</P>
<H4><A NAME="sec4"></A>Software Data Compression</H4><P>Software data compression in RAS allows users to boost their effective throughput. Data is compressed by the RAS client, sent over the wire in a compressed format, and then decompressed by the server. In typical use, RAS software compression doubles effective throughput.</P>
<H4><A NAME="sec5"></A>Data Encryption</H4><P>Remote Access Service provides data encryption, in addition to password encryption, to provide privacy for sensitive data. While most RAS users do not need encryption, government agencies, law enforcement organizations, financial institutions, and others benefit from it. Microsoft RAS uses the RC4 encryption algorithm of RSA Data Security Inc. </P>
<H4><A NAME="sec6"></A>RAS APIs</H4><P>In April 1994, Microsoft published the 16-bit and 32-bit RAS APIs, which allow corporate developers and solution providers to create custom, remote-enabled applications that can establish a remote connection, use network resources, and re-connect in the event of a communications link failure. Applications developed using these tools will be compatible with Windows95, Windows&nbsp;NT Workstation and Server 3.5, and Windows for Workgroups 3.11.</P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
