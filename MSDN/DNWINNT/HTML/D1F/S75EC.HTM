<H3>Security</H3><P>Microsoft's RAS provides security at the operating system, file system, and network layers, as well as data encryption and event auditing. Some of the security features are inherited from the Windows&nbsp;NT operating system, while others are specific to RAS itself. Every stage of the process — such as user authentication, data transmission, resource access, logoff and auditing — can be secured. The next section describes RAS security in detail.</P>
<H4><A NAME="sec0"></A>Windows&nbsp;NT Security</H4><P>Windows&nbsp;NT, the host for RAS, is a secure operating environment. Windows&nbsp;NT was designed to meet the requirements for C-2 level (U.S. Department of Defense) security, meaning that access to system resources can be discretely controlled, and all access to the system can be recorded and audited. A Windows&nbsp;NT Server-based computer, provided it is secured physically, can be locked-down using software. Any access to the system requires a password and leaves an audit trail.</P>
<P>Windows&nbsp;NT Server provides for enterprise-wide security using a <I>trusted domain, single-network logon</I> model. A domain is simply a collection of servers that are administered together. Trusted domains establish relationships whereby the users and groups of one domain can be granted access to resources in a trusting domain. This eliminates the need for duplicate entry of user accounts across a multi-server network. Finally, under the single-network-logon model, once a user is authenticated, the user carries access credentials. Anytime the user attempts to gain access to a resource anywhere on the network, Windows&nbsp;NT automatically presents the user's credentials. If trusted domains are used, the user may never have to present a password after initial logon, even though his account exists on one server in one domain only.</P>
<P>The single-network logon model extends to RAS users. RAS access is granted from the pool of all Windows&nbsp;NT user accounts. An administrator grants a single user, group of users, or all users the right to dial into the network. Then, users use their domain login to connect via RAS. Once the user has been authenticated by RAS, they can use resources throughout the domain and in any trusted domains.</P>
<P>Finally, Windows&nbsp;NT provides the Event Viewer for auditing. All system, application, and security events are recorded to a central secure database which, with proper privileges, can be viewed from anywhere on the network. Any attempts to violate system security, start or stop services without authorization, or gain access to protected resources, is recorded in the Event Log and can be viewed by the administrator. </P>
<H4><A NAME="sec1"></A>Authentication</H4><P>Authentication is an important concern for many corporations. This section answers some of the most frequently-asked questions, such as:</P>
<UL><LI>     How can our system insure the privacy of passwords?</LI><LI>     Can our system include a security mechanism in addition to that provided by RAS and Windows&nbsp;NT?</LI><LI>     Is the call-back feature supported?</LI></UL><H5><A NAME="sec2"></A>Authentication Protocols</H5><P>The Challenge Handshake Authentication Protocol (CHAP) is used by the Remote Access Server to negotiate the most secure form of encrypted authentication supported by both server and client. CHAP uses a challenge-response mechanism with one-way encryption on the response. CHAP allows the RAS server to negotiate downward from the most-secure to the least-secure encryption mechanism, and protects passwords transmitted in the process. </P>

<P><BR></P><P>CHAP allows different types of encryption algorithms to be used. Specifically, RAS uses DES and RSA Security Inc.'s MD5. Microsoft RAS uses DES encryption when both the client and the server are using RAS.<B> </B>DES encryption, the U.S. government standard, was designed to protect against password discovery and playback. Windows&nbsp;NT 3.5, Windows for Workgroups, and Windows95 will <I>always</I> negotiate DES-encrypted authentication when communicating with each other. When connecting to third-party remote access servers or client software, RAS can negotiate SPAP or clear-text authentication if the third party product does not support encrypted authentication.</P>
<P>MD5, an encryption scheme used by various PPP vendors for encrypted authentication, can be negotiated by the Microsoft RAS client when connecting to other vendors' remote access servers. MD5 is not available in the RAS server.</P>
<P>SPAP, the Shiva Password Authentication Protocol, is a two-way (reversible) encryption mechanism employed by Shiva. Windows&nbsp;NT Workstation 3.5, when connecting to a Shiva LAN Rover, uses SPAP; as does a Shiva client connecting to a Windows&nbsp;NT Server 3.5. This form of authentication is more secure than clear text, but less secure than CHAP.</P>
<P>PAP uses clear-text passwords and is the least sophisticated authentication protocol. It is typically negotiated if the remote workstation and server cannot negotiate a more secure form of validation. </P>
<P>The Microsoft RAS server has an option that prevents clear-text passwords from being negotiated. This option enables system administrators to enforce a high level of security.</P>
<H5><A NAME="sec3"></A>Third-party Security Hosts</H5><P>RAS supports third-party security hosts. The security host sits between the remote user and the RAS Server.</P>
<P>The security host generally provides an extra layer of security by requiring a hardware key of some sort in order to provide authentication. Verification that the remote user is in physical possession of the key takes place before they are given access to the RAS Server. This open architecture allows customers to choose from a variety of security hosts to augment the security in RAS.</P>
<P>As an additional measure of security, RAS offers call-back. Call-back security enables administrators to require remote users to dial from a specific predetermined location (e.g. telephone number at home) or to call back a user from any location, in order to use low-cost communications lines. In the case of secured call back, the user initiates a call, and connects with the RAS Server. The RAS Server then drops the call, and calls back a moment later to the pre-assigned call-back number. This security method will generally thwart most impersonators.</P>
<H4><A NAME="sec4"></A>Network Access Restrictions</H4><P>Remote access to the network under RAS is controlled by the system administrator. In addition to the tools provided with Windows&nbsp;NT Server (authentication, trusted domains, event auditing, C2 security design, etc.), the RAS Admin tool gives an administrator the ability to grant or revoke remote access privileges on a user-by-user basis. This means that even though RAS is running on a Windows&nbsp;NT Server-based computer, access to the network must be explicitly granted for each user who is to be authorized to enter the network via RAS.</P>
<P>This process ensures that remote access must be explicitly granted, and provides a convenient means for setting call back restrictions.</P>
<P>Microsoft's RAS provides an additional measure of security. The RAS Administrator provides a switch that allows access to be granted to all resources that the RAS host computer can see, or just resources local to the computer. This allows a customer to tightly control what information is available to remote users, and to limit their exposure in the event of a security breach.</P>
<H4><A NAME="sec5"></A>Data Encryption</H4><P>Data encryption protects data and ensures secure dial-up communications. This is especially important for financial institutions, law-enforcement and government agencies, and corporations that require secure data transfer. For installations where total security is required, the RAS administrator can set the RAS server to force encrypted communications. Users connecting to that server automatically encrypt all data sent.</P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
