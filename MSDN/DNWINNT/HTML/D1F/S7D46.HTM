<H3>NDIS-Compatible Network Adapter Card Drivers</H3><P>Until the late 1980s, many of the implementations of transport protocols were tied to a proprietary implementation of a MAC-Layer interface defining how the protocol would converse with the network adapter card. This made it difficult for network adapter card vendors to support the different network operating systems available on the market. Each network adapter card vendor had to create proprietary interface drivers to support a variety of protocol implementations for use with several network operating system environments.</P>
<P>In 1989, Microsoft and 3Com jointly developed a standard defining an interface for communication between the MAC Layer and protocol drivers higher in the OSI model. This standard is known as the Network Device Interface Specification (NDIS). NDIS allows for a flexible environment of data exchange. It defines the software interface — called the NDIS interface — used by transport protocols to communicate with the network adapter card driver.</P>
<P>The flexibility of NDIS comes from the standardized implementation used by the network industry. Any NDIS-conformant protocol can pass data to any NDIS-conformant network adapter card driver, and vice versa. A process called <I>binding </I>is used to establish the initial communication channel between the protocol driver and the network adapter card driver. </P>
<P>Windows&nbsp;NT currently supports device drivers and transport protocols written to NDIS version 3.0. </P>
<P>NDIS allows multiple network adapter cards on a single computer. Each network adapter card can support multiple transport protocols. The advantage of supporting multiple protocol drivers on a single network card is that Windows&nbsp;NT computers can have simultaneous access to different types of network servers, each using a different transport protocol. For example, a computer can have access to both a Windows&nbsp;NT Server using NBF (the Windows&nbsp;NT implementation of NetBEUI) and a UNIX server via TCP/IP simultaneously.</P>
<P>Unlike previous NDIS implementations, Windows&nbsp;NT does not need a protocol manager module to link the various components at each layer together. Instead, Windows&nbsp;NT uses the information in the Registry (described in Chapter 10, "Overview of the Windows&nbsp;NT Registry" of the <I>Windows NT Resource Guide</I>) and a small piece of code called the <I>NDIS wrapper</I> that surrounds the network adapter card driver.</P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
