<H2>Configuring the FTP Server Service</H2><P>After the FTP Server service software is installed on your computer, you must configure it to operate. When you configure the FTP Server service, your settings result in one of the following situations:</P>
<UL><LI>No anonymous FTP connection allowed. In this case, each user must provide a valid Windows&nbsp;NT username and password. To configure the FTP Server service for this, make sure the Allow Anonymous Connection box is cleared in the FTP Service dialog box.</LI><LI>Allow both anonymous and Windows&nbsp;NT users to connect. In this case, a user can choose to use either an anonymous connection or a Windows&nbsp;NT username and password. To configure the FTP Server service for this, make sure only the Allow Anonymous Connection box is selected in the FTP Service dialog box.</LI><LI>Allow only anonymous FTP connections. In this case, a user cannot connect using a Windows&nbsp;NT username and password. To configure the FTP Server service for this, make sure both the Allow Anonymous Connections and the Allow Anonymous Connections Only boxes are selected in the FTP Service dialog box.</LI></UL><P>If anonymous connections are allowed, you must supply the Windows&nbsp;NT username and password to be used for anonymous FTP. When an anonymous FTP transfer takes place, Windows&nbsp;NT checks the username assigned in this dialog box to determine whether access is allowed to the files. </P>

<P>    If you are reconfiguring the FTP Server service, double-click the Network option in Control Panel to display the Network Settings dialog box. In the Installed Network Software box, select FTP Server, and then choose the Configure button to display the FTP Service dialog box. </P>

A password is not necessary, but the user is prompted to supply a mail address as the password. By default, anonymous connections are not allowed. Notice that you cannot use a Windows&nbsp;NT user account with the name <B>anonymous</B> with the FTP Server. The <B>anonymous</B> user name is reserved in the FTP Server for the anonymous logon function. Users logging on with the username <B>anonymous</B> receive permissions based on the FTP Server configuration for anonymous logons.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP"><P>Username</P></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP"><P>Specifies which local user account to use for FTP Server users who log on under <B>anonymous</B>.

<P><B>Note    </B>When you first install the FTP Server service, you must also complete the security configuration as described in the following procedure for users to access volumes on your computer.</P>
<H3><A NAME="sec1"></A>To configure FTP Server security</H3><OL><LI>    After the FTP Server has been installed and you have restarted Control Panel, double-click the FTP Server option in Control Panel. </LI></OL><P>    Windows&nbsp;NT Server users can also use the FTP menu in Server Manager. </P>
<P>    <img src="xsgw40.gif"></P>
<OL start=2><LI>    In the FTP User Sessions dialog box, choose the Security button to display the FTP Server Security dialog box. </LI></OL><P>    <img src="xsgw39.gif"></P>
<OL start=3><LI>    In the Partition box, select the drive letter on which you want to set security, and then select the Allow Read or Allow Write check box, or both check boxes, depending on the security you want for the selected partition.</LI></OL><P>    Repeat this step for each partition.</P>
<P>    Setting these permissions affects all files across the entire partition on file allocation table (FAT) and high-performance file system (HPFS) partitions. On NTFS partitions, this feature can be used to remove read or write access (or both) on the entire partition.</P>
<P>    Any restrictions set in this dialog box are enforced in addition to any security that might be part of the file system. That is, an administrator can use this dialog box to remove permissions on specific volumes but cannot use it to grant permissions beyond those maintained by the file system. For example, if a partition is marked as read-only, no one can write to the partition via FTP regardless of any permissions set in this dialog box. </P>
<OL start=4><LI>    Choose the OK button when you are finished setting security access on partitions. </LI></OL><P>    The changes take effect immediately. The FTP Server service is now ready to operate.</P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
