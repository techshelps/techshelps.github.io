<H2>Administering WINS Servers</H2><P>When you install a WINS server, an icon for WINS Manager is added to the Network Administration group in Program Manager. You can use this tool to view and change parameters for any WINS server on the internetwork. To administer a WINS server remotely, you can run WINS Manager on a Windows&nbsp;NT Server computer that is not a WINS server.</P>
<P>You can also administer a WINS server remotely using SNMP. When you do so, if some WINS queries from SNMP work and others time out, you should increase the timeout on the SNMP tool you are using.</P>
<P>You must be logged on as a member of the Administrators group for a WINS server to configure that server. </P>
<H3><A NAME="sec0"></A>To start WINS Manager</H3><P><img src="winsicon.gif"></P>
<OL><LI>Double-click the WINS Manager icon in Program Manager. </LI></OL><P>– Or –</P>
<P>At the command prompt, type the <B>start winsadmn</B> command, and then press Enter. </P>
<P>You can include a WINS server name or IP address with the command, for example, <B>start winsadmn 11.103.41.12</B> or <B>start winsadmn myserver</B>.</P>
<OL start=2><LI>If the Windows Internet Name Service is running on the local computer, that WINS server is opened automatically for administration. If the Windows Internet Name Service is not running when you start WINS, the Add WINS Server dialog box appears, as described in the following procedure.</LI></OL><P><img src="xtc5_3a.gif"></P>
<P><B>Note   </B>If you specify an IP address when connecting to a WINS server, the connection is made using the TCP/IP protocol. If you specify a computer name, the connection is made over NetBIOS. The list that appears in the WINS Server window shows the IP address first if you connected using TCP/IP, or the computer name first, if the connection was made over NetBIOS.</P>
<H3><A NAME="sec1"></A>To connect to a WINS server for administration</H3><UL><LI>In the WINS Manager window, select a server in the WINS Servers list. </LI></UL><P>This list contains all WINS servers that you previously connected to or that have been reported by partners of this WINS server.</P>
<H3><A NAME="sec2"></A>To connect to a server to which you have not previously been connected</H3><OL><LI>Choose the Add WINS Server command from the Server menu to display the Add WINS Server dialog box.</LI></OL><P><img src="xtc5_18.gif"></P>
<OL start=2><LI>In the WINS Server box, type the IP address or computer name of the WINS server you want to work with, and then choose the OK button. </LI></OL><P><B>Note</B>   You do not have to include double backslashes (\\)before the name. WINS Manager adds these for you.</P>
<P>The title bar in the WINS Manager window shows the IP address or computer name for the currently selected server, depending on whether you used the address or name to connect to the server. WINS Manager also shows some basic statistics for the selected server, as described in the following table. Additional statistics can be displayed by choosing the Detailed Information command from the Server menu.</P>
