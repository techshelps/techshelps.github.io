<H3>Changing the Locally Administered Address</H3><P>There might be times when you want to change or override the network address of the network adapter card when running the DLC protocol. You might want to do this, for example, when communicating directly to a mainframe. Certain configurations of mainframe software require the network address of the devices connecting to it to follow a set format, so it might be necessary to change the card's network address. You can do this through the Registry Editor.</P>
<P></P>
<P><b>Note</b></P>
<P>The following example is for an IBM Token Ring adapter. This parameter is supported on other network adapters as well, but not necessarily all.</P>
<P>The following instructions do not apply when connecting to a mainframe via SNA Server. The modifications needed to the network address are handled during the installation process.</P>

If you don't know this address, see your network administrator or operations group.</LI><LI>    Exit the Registry Editor and restart your computer. </LI></OL><P>(You must restart the computer for the modification to take effect.)</P>
<OL start=7><LI>    From the command prompt, run the following command to report the active MAC address:</LI></OL><P>net config rdr</P>
<P>If the MAC address is the one you entered in the Registry Editor, the LAA has taken effect. </P>
