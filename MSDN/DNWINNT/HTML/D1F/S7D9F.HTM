<H2>Overview</H2><P>The Data Link Control (DLC) protocol driver provided with Windows&nbsp;NT allows the computer to communicate with other computers running the DLC protocol stack (for example, an IBM mainframe) and other network peripherals (for example, printers such as a Hewlett-Packard HP 4Si that use a network adapter card to connect directly to the network).</P>
<P>Windows&nbsp;NT DLC contains an 802.2 Logical Link Control (LLC) Finite State Machine, which is used when transmitting and receiving type 2 connection-oriented frames. DLC can also transmit and receive type 1 connectionless frames, such as Unnumbered Information (UI) frames. Type 1 and 2 frames can be transmitted and received simultaneously.</P>
<P>Windows&nbsp;NT DLC works with either token ring or Ethernet MAC drivers and can transmit and receive Digital.Intel.Xerox (DIX) format frames when bound to an Ethernet MAC.</P>
<P>The DLC interface can be accessed from 32-bit Windows&nbsp;NT-based programs and from 16-bit MS-DOS–based and 16-bit Windows-based programs. The 32-bit interface conforms largely to the CCB2 interface, the segmented 16-bit pointers being replaced with flat 32-bit pointers. The 16-bit interface conforms to the CCB1 interface. </P>
