<H2>Managing the WINS Database</H2><P>The following files are stored in the \<I>systemroot</I>\SYSTEM32\WINS directory that is created when you set up a WINS server:</P>
<UL><LI>JET.LOG is a log of all transactions done with the database. This file is used by WINS to recover data if necessary.</LI><LI>SYSTEM.MDB is used by WINS for holding information about the structure of its database.</LI><LI>WINS.MDB is the WINS database file.</LI><LI>WINSTMP.MDB is a temporary file that WINS creates. This file may remain in the \WINS directory after a crash.</LI></UL><P>You should back up these files when you back up other files on the WINS server.</P>
<P><B>Caution   </B>The JET.LOG, SYSTEM.MDB, WINS.MDB, and WINSTMP.MDB files should not be removed or tampered with in any manner. </P>
<P>Like any database, the WINS database of address mappings needs to be periodically cleaned and backed up. WINS Manager provides the tools you need for maintaining the database. This section describes how to scavenge (clean), view, and back up the database. For information on restoring and moving the WINS database, see "Troubleshooting WINS" later in this chapter.</P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
