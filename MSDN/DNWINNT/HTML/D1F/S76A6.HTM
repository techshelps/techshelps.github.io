<H2>Managing Static Mappings</H2><P>Static mappings are permanent lists of computer name-to-IP address mappings that cannot be challenged or removed, except when the administrator removes the specific mapping. You use the Static Mappings command in WINS Manager to add, edit, import, or delete static mappings for clients on the network that are not WINS enabled.</P>
<P><B>Important   </B>If DHCP is also used on the network, a reserved (or static) IP address will override any WINS server settings. Static mappings should not be assigned to WINS-enabled computers.</P>
<H3><A NAME="sec0"></A>To view static mappings</H3><OL><LI>From the Mappings menu, choose the Static Mappings command to display the Static Mappings dialog box. </LI></OL><P><img src="xtc5_11a.gif"></P>
<P><B>Caution</B>   All changes made to the WINS database using the Static Mappings dialog box take effect immediately. For this reason, you cannot cancel changes made to the WINS database while working in the Static Mappings dialog box. You must manually delete any entries that are added in error or manually add back any entries that you mistakenly delete.</P>
<OL start=2><LI>In the Sort Order group box, indicate whether you want to sort static mappings by IP address or computer name. </LI></OL><P>This selection determines the order in which entries appear in the list of static mappings.</P>
<OL start=3><LI>Complete any of the following tasks:

<UL><LI>To edit or add a mapping, follow the procedures described in "Adding Static Mappings" and "Editing Static Mappings" later in this chapter.</LI><LI>To remove existing static mappings, select the mappings you want to delete from the list, and then choose the Delete Mapping button. </LI><LI>To limit the range of mappings displayed in the list of static mappings, choose the Set Filter button, and then follow the procedure in "Filtering the Range of Mappings" later in this chapter. </LI><LI>To turn off filtering, choose the Clear Filter button.</LI></UL></LI><LI>When you have finished viewing or changing the static mappings, choose the Close button.</LI></OL></FONT></BODY></HTML>
