<H3>Connecting Windows&nbsp;NT to the Internet</H3><P>With Windows&nbsp;NT and Windows95 workstations, connecting to the Internet is easy. The connection process is as follows:</P>
<OL><LI>The remote user dials a phone number.</LI><LI>PPP negotiation occurs.</LI></OL><P>First user authentication takes place, and then PPP protocol configuration occurs.</P>
<P>If the remote workstation is running Windows&nbsp;NT 3.5 or Windows95, PPP negotiation automatically assigns an IP address, subnet mask, default gateway address, Domain Name System (DNS), and Windows Internet Name Service (WINS) address. </P>
<P>For more details on IP address, DNS, and default gateway, see the following sections in this chapter. For more information about PPP protocols and authentication, see Chapter 9, "Using Remote Access Service."</P>
<P><B>Note</B>   Non-Microsoft PPP client software may not negotiate all the necessary IP configuration information. In this case, users need to manually configure their TCP/IP protocol with the appropriate information.</P>
<OL><LI>The remote workstation is then connected to the Internet. </LI></OL><P>The remote workstation is now a node on the network. The remote user can now run any Windows Sockets-compliant application to browse for information, exchange electronic mail, or download files from the Internet.</P>
<P>It's that simple. If the remote workstation is running Windows&nbsp;NT 3.5 or Windows95, PPP negotiation automatically assigns an IP address, subnet mask, default gateway address, Domain Name System (DNS) address, and Windows Internet Name Service (WINS). With Windows&nbsp;NT and Windows95 workstations, dialing into the Internet is very easy.</P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
