<H3>Using TCP/IP for Connectivity to the Internet</H3><P>Microsoft TCP/IP provides Windows-based networking with a set of internetworking protocols based on open standards. </P>
<P>Microsoft TCP/IP for Windows&nbsp;NT includes many common connectivity applications such as <B>ftp</B>,<B> rsh</B>, and <B>telnet</B> that support file transfer, remote process execution, and terminal emulation for communication on the Internet and between non-Microsoft network systems. </P>
<P>TCP/IP applications created by researchers and other users, such as Gopher and NCSA Mosaic, are in the public domain or are available through other vendors as both 16-bit and 32-bit Windows-based applications. Any of these applications that follow the Windows Sockets 1.1 standard are compatible with Windows&nbsp;NT. Such applications allow a Windows&nbsp;NT computer to act as a powerful Internet client using the extensive internetworking components with public-domain viewers and applications to access Internet resources.</P>

<P><B>Tip</B>   Public-domain Windows-based utilities such as LPR and Gopher can be obtained on the Internet via ftp.cica.indiana.edu in the /pub/win3/nt or /pub/win3/winsock directory, or via the same directories on ftp.cdrom.com.</P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
