<H2>Remote Access Service</H2><P>Windows NT 3.5 Remote Access Service (RAS) connects remote or mobile workers to corporate networks. Optimized for client-server computing, RAS is implemented primarily as a software solution, and is available on all of Microsoft's operating systems.</P>
<P>To understand the RAS architecture, it is important to make the distinction between RAS and remote control solutions, such as Cubix and pcANYWHERE&reg;. RAS is a software-based multi-protocol router; remote control solutions work by sharing screen, keyboard and mouse control over a WAN connection. In a remote control solution, users share a CPU or multiple CPU's on the server. In contrast, a Windows NT RAS server's CPU is dedicated to communications, not to running applications.</P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
