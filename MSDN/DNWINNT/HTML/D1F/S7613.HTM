<H2>Installing TCP/IP</H2><P>You must be logged on as a member of the Administrators group for the local computer to install and configure TCP/IP.</P>
<H3><A NAME="sec0"></A>To install Microsoft TCP/IP on a Windows&nbsp;NT computer</H3><OL><LI>    Double-click the Network icon in Control Panel to display the Network Settings dialog box. </LI><LI>    Choose the Add Software button to display the Add Network Software dialog box. </LI><LI>    Select TCP/IP Protocol And Related Components from the Network Software box, and then choose the Continue button. </LI><LI>    In the Windows&nbsp;NT TCP/IP Installation Options dialog box, select the options for the TCP/IP components you want to install, as described in the table that follows this procedure. If any TCP/IP elements have been installed previously, they are dimmed and not available. When you have selected the options you want, choose the Continue button.</LI></OL><P>While you are installing or configuring TCP/IP, you can read the hint bar at the bottom of each TCP/IP dialog box for information about a selected item, or choose the Help button to get detailed online information.</P>
<P>Windows&nbsp;NT Setup displays a message prompting for the full path to the Windows&nbsp;NT distribution files.</P>
<OL start=5><LI>    In the Windows&nbsp;NT Setup dialog box, enter the full path to the Windows&nbsp;NT distribution files, and then choose the Continue button. </LI></OL><P>You can specify a drive letter for floppy disks, a CD-ROM drive, or a shared network directory, or you can specify the Universal Naming Convention (UNC) path name for a network resource, such as \\NTSETUP\MASTER.</P>
<P>All necessary files are copied to your hard disk.</P>
<P><b>Note</b></P>
<P>If you are installing from floppy disks, Windows&nbsp;NT Setup might request disks more than once. This behavior is normal and not an error condition.</P>
<P></P>
<OL start=6><LI>    If you selected the options for installing the SNMP and FTP Server services, you are automatically requested to configure these services. </LI></OL><P>Follow the directions provided in the online Help for these dialog boxes. For additional details, see "Configuring SNMP" later in this chapter, and see also Chapter&nbsp;16, "Using the Microsoft FTP Server Service."</P>
<OL start =7><LI>    In the Network Settings dialog box, choose the OK button.</LI></OL><P>If you selected the Enable Automatic DHCP Configuration option and a DHCP server is available on your network, all configuration settings for TCP/IP are completed automatically, as described in "Using Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol" later in this chapter.</P>
<P>If you did not check the Enable Automatic DHCP Configuration option, continue with the configuration procedures described in "Configuring TCP/IP Manually" later in this chapter. TCP/IP must be configured in order to operate.</P>
<P>If you checked the DHCP Server Service or WINS Server Service options, you must complete the configuration steps described in Chapter&nbsp;13, "Installing and Configuring DHCP Servers," and Chapter&nbsp;14, "Installing and Configuring WINS Servers."</P>
