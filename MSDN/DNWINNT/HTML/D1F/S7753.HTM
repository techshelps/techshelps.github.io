<H2>Windows&nbsp;NT on the Internet</H2><P>Now you can use Windows&nbsp;NT to connect to the Internet without having to remember arcane commands. You can even set up an Internet server on a Windows&nbsp;NT computer, taking advantage of Windows&nbsp;NT's scalability, easy interface, and ease of configuration. All you need is Windows&nbsp;NT, the Internet server services that are included in this resource kit, and a connection to the Internet. </P>
<P>Software for many client and server Internet services is also available in the public domain (free) software. In the case of client software especially, more powerful and better-supported commercial programs have been written based on the public domain tools, and are available through the usual software outlets and also through the Internet itself.</P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
