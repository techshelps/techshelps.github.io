<H3>Transmission Control Protocol and Internet Protocol</H3><P>Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and Internet Protocol (IP) are only two members of the IP protocol suite. IP is a protocol that provides packet delivery for all other protocols within the TCP/IP family. IP provides a best-effort, connectionless delivery system for computer data. That is, IP packets are not guaranteed to arrive at their destination, nor are they guaranteed to be received in the sequence in which they were sent. The protocol's checksum feature confirms only the IP header's integrity. Thus, responsibility for the data contained within the IP packet (and the sequencing) is assured only by using higher- level protocols.</P>
<P>Perhaps the most common higher-level IP protocol is TCP. TCP supplies a reliable, connection-based protocol over (or encapsulated within) IP. TCP guarantees the delivery of packets, ensures proper sequencing of the data, and provides a checksum feature that validates both the packet header and its data for accuracy. In the event that the network either corrupts or loses a TCP/IP packet during transmission, TCP is responsible for retransmitting the faulty packet. This reliability makes TCP/IP the protocol of choice for session-based data transmission, client-server applications, and critical services, such as electronic mail.</P>
<P>This reliability has a price. TCP headers require the use of additional bits to provide proper sequencing of information, as well as a mandatory checksum to ensure reliability of both the TCP header and the packet data. To guarantee successful data delivery, the protocol also requires the recipient to acknowledge successful receipt of data. </P>
<P>Such acknowledgments (or ACKs) generate additional network traffic, diminishing the level of data throughput in favor of reliability. To reduce the impact on performance, most hosts send an acknowledgment for every other segment or when an ACK timeout expires.</P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
