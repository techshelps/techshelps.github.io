<H3>Planning Replication Partners and Proxies</H3><P>In one possible configuration, one WINS server can be designated as the central server, and all other WINS servers can be configured as both push partner and pull partner of this central server. Such a configuration ensures that the WINS database on each server contains addresses for every node on the WAN.</P>
<P>Another option is to set up a chain of WINS servers, where each server is both the push partner and pull partner with a nearby WINS server. In such a configuration, the two servers at the ends of the chain would also be push and pull partners with each other. Other replication partner configurations can be established for your site's needs.</P>
<P>Only a limited number of WINS proxies should be designated on each domain, so that a limited number of computers are using resources to respond to broadcast name requests.</P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
