<H2>Configuring RAS for Use with TCP/IP</H2><P>Windows&nbsp;NT users who install Remote Access Service (RAS) for remote networking maintain all the benefits of TCP/IP networking, including access to the WINS and DNS capabilities of Microsoft TCP/IP. RAS clients can be configured to use Point to Point Protocol (PPP) or Serial Line Internet Protocol (SLIP) to allow TCP/IP dial-up support for existing TCP/IP internetworks and the Internet. When PPP is configured on a Windows&nbsp;NT Remote Access server, it can function as a router for RAS clients. SLIP client software is provided to support older implementations; it does not support multiple protocols.</P>
<P>As with all network services, you install RAS by using the Network option in Control Panel. During RAS installation and configuration, you can specify the network protocol settings to use for RAS connections, which also enables you to specify TCP/IP configuration settings. When the network administrator installs a Microsoft RAS server, IP addresses are reserved for use by RAS clients.</P>
<P>Users with RAS client computers can use the Remote Access program to enter and maintain names and telephone numbers of remote networks. RAS clients can connect to and disconnect from these networks through the Remote Access program. You can also use the Remote Access Phone Book application to select the network protocols to use for a specific Phone Book entry. If TCP/IP is installed, the Phone Book automatically selects TCP/IP over PPP as the protocol. </P>
<P>If a RAS client computer has a serial COM port, you can use the Remote Access Phone Book application to configure SLIP for use with a selected Phone Book entry. If you configure a RAS client computer to use the SLIP option, when you dial in for a connection to the selected Phone Book entry, the Terminal screen appears, and you can begin an interactive session with a SLIP server. When you use SLIP, Remote Access Phone Book bypasses user authentication. You will not be asked for a username and password.</P>
