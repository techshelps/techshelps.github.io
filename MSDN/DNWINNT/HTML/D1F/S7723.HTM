<H2>Troubleshooting IP Configuration</H2><P>If you have trouble installing Microsoft TCP/IP on your computer, follow the suggestions in the error messages. You can also use the <B>ping</B> utility to isolate network hardware problems and incompatible configurations, allowing you to verify a physical connection to a remote computer.</P>
<P>Use the <B>ping</B> utility to test both the host name and the IP address of the host. For the syntax and description of the <B>ping</B> command, see Appendix A, "TCP/IP Utilities Reference."</P>
<H3><A NAME="sec0"></A>To test TCP/IP using the ping utility</H3><OL><LI>If the computer was configured using DHCP, use <B>ipconfig</B> to learn the IP address.</LI><LI>Use <B>ping</B> to check the loopback address by typing <B>ping 127.0.0.1</B> and pressing ENTER at the command prompt. The computer should respond immediately. 
<P>If <B>ping</B> is not found or the command fails, check the event log with Event Viewer and look for problems reported by Setup or the TCP/IP service. </P></LI><LI>To determine whether you configured IP properly, use <B>ping </B>with the IP address of your computer, your default gateway, and a remote host.</LI></OL><P>If you cannot use <B>ping</B> successfully at any point, check the following:</P>
<UL><LI>The computer was restarted after TCP/IP was installed and configured</LI><LI>The local computer's IP address is valid and appears correctly in the TCP/IP Configuration dialog box</LI><LI>The IP address of the default gateway and remote host are correct</LI><LI>IP routing is enabled and the link between routers is operational</LI></UL><P>If you can use <B>ping</B> to connect to other Windows&nbsp;NT computers on a different subnet but cannot connect through File Manager or with <B>net use</B> <I>\\server\share</I>, check the following:</P>
<UL><LI>The computer is WINS-enabled (if the network includes WINS servers).</LI><LI>The WINS server addresses are correct, and the WINS servers are functioning.</LI><LI>The correct computer name was used.</LI><LI>The target host uses NetBIOS. If not, you must use FTP or Telnet to make a connection; in this case, the target host must be configured with the FTP server daemon or Telnet server daemon, and you must have correct permissions on the target host. </LI><LI>The scope ID on the target host is the same as the local computer.</LI><LI>A router exists between your system and the target system.</LI><LI>LMHOSTS contains correct entries, so that the computer name can be resolved. For more information, see "Troubleshooting Name Resolution Problems" later in this chapter.</LI><LI>The computer is not configured to use WINS.</LI></UL></FONT></BODY></HTML>
