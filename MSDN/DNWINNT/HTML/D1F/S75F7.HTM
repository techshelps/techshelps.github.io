<H3>Using RAS Terminal for Remote Logons</H3><P>If a remote computer you dial in to requires a log on procedure, you must configure the Security settings for that RAS entry to use a RAS Terminal log on as described in the procedure below. After RAS connects to the remote system, a character-based window will appear and display the log on sequence from the remote computer. You use this screen to interact with the remote computer for logging on. Alternatively, you can automate the manual log on through RAS Terminal as described in the next section, "Automating Remote Log Ons Using SWITCH.INF Scripts."</P>
