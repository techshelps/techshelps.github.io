<p>Use the MacFile Permissions menu in File Manager to reassign the owner or group permissions to a new account.
<p><i>address</i><b> is not a valid default gateway. The service could not be started.</b>
<p>[Netevent]
<p>The IP address specified for the default gateway is invalid.
<p>Use the Network option in Control Panel to correct the default gateway parameter for the TCP/IP protocol. Select TCP/IP protocol and then choose Configure. Restart the computer once you have reconfigured the protocol.
<p><i>application</i><b> - OS/2 Subsystem Bound Application Load Failure</b>
<p>[OS/2 Subsystem]
<p>You cannot run this application under the OS/2 subsystem, because it uses an OS/2 API that is not supported by the subsystem. However, you might be able to run it using Forcedos.
<p>After the application terminates, try again using Forcedos.
<p><i>application</i><b> : ' </b><i>name</i><b> ' is a directory!</b>
<p>[TFTP]
<p>When you use the Tftp command to transfer files from a remote computer to your computer, you cannot specify the directory name as the destination on your local computer. You must use a filename.
<p>Retype the Tftp command, specifying a filename for the local destination instead of a directory.
<p><i>application</i><b> : Argument missing after / </b><i>text</i>
<p>[FINDSTR]
<p>In the Findstr command line, if you specify the c:/, f:/, or /g: switches, they must be followed immediately by some text (a literal string, text pattern, or filename, depending on the switch).
<p>Correct your usage of these switches in the Findstr command line and retry the command. To see what item of text to follow these switches with, type HELP followed by the command line (in this case, Findstr).
<p><i>application</i><b> : bad argument </b><i>text</i>
<p>[TCP/IP]
<p>You specified an invalid Internet (IP) address in the Route command.
<p>Make sure the Internet address arguments are typed correctly, and then retry the Route command.
<p><i>application</i><b> : Bad command line</b>
<p>[FINDSTR]
<p>You have entered a bad command. For instance, you may not have specified any strings to search for in the Findstr command line.
<p>To see the correct syntax for the command line, type HELP followed by the command name (in this case, Findstr).
<p><i>application</i><b> : bad gateway address </b><i>address</i>
<p>[TCP/IP]
<p>If you used a network name or alias for the destination parameter in the Route command and you get this message, then the Route command was unable to find the name or alias in the HOSTS file on the local computer (the path to the HOSTS file is \systemroot\system32\drivers\etc). If you used an IP address, you specified an invalid format. For example, you may not have used a dotted decimal form, such as 11.1.12.17.
<p>Make sure the gateway is physically attached to the network adapter that is in your computer (is part of the same subnet). Then retry the Route command, using a valid gateway address.
<p><i>application</i><b> : bad port number-- </b><i>number</i>
<p>[FTP Server]
<p>The port number parameter you used in an Ftp command is not valid.
<p>Retry the command using a different port number.
<p><i>application</i><b> : can't establish connection</b>
<p>[TCP/IP]
<p>The TCP/IP utility named at the beginning of the message could not establish a connection with the remote host, either because there is no networking software on the remote computer, the corresponding server is not running on the remote computer, or no route can be found between your computer and the remote computer.
<p>Make sure you are using the right remote host. If so, wait, and then retry the remote command. If you still get this message, ask your network administrator to check the condition of the remote computer and the routers between the two computers.
<p><i>application</i><b> : can't establish stderr</b>
<p>[TCP/IP]
<p>The TCP/IP utility cannot establish a stderr connection with a remote host. There may be no networking software on the remote computer, the corresponding server may not be running on the remote computer, or no route can be found between your computer and the remote computer.
<p>Make sure you are trying to use the right remote host. If you are, wait, and then retry the remote command. If you still get this message, ask your network administrator to check the condition of the remote computer and the routers between the two computers.
<p><i>application</i><b> : can't open local file ' </b><i>filename</i><b> ' unable to open file for read </b><i>text.</i>
<p>[TFTP]
<p>The TCP/IP utility, Tftp, was transferring a file from your computer to a remote computer, but was unable to open the file on your computer.
<p>Make sure you specified the correct path to the file in the Tftp command, and that you did not mistype it. Also, check that you have permission to read the file. Then, retry the Tftp command.
<p><i>application</i><b> : can't read from local file ' </b><i>filename</i><b> '</b>
<p>[TFTP]
<p>You specified a file to transfer to a remote computer, but you do not have read access to that particular file.
<p>Ask your system administrator to give you the needed access.
<p><i>application</i><b> : Cannot read file list from </b><i>filename</i>
<p>[FINDSTR]
<p>The Findstr utility was unable to open the file that contains the list of files to search.
<p>Check the Findstr command line and make sure that you specified the correct path and that there are no misspellings. You may need to use File Manager to search for the file. Also, check that you have access rights to the file.
<p><i>application</i><b> : Cannot read strings from </b><i>filename</i>
<p>[FINDSTR]
<p>The Findstr utility was unable to open the file that contains the search strings.
<p>Check the Findstr command line and make sure that you specified the correct path and that there are no misspellings. You may need to use File Manager to search for the file. Also, check that you have access rights to the file.
<p><i>application</i><b> : don't know host ' </b><i>name</i><b> '</b>
<p>[TFTP]
<p>Your computer cannot resolve the host name you used as a parameter in the Tftp command into a remote network hardware address.
<p>Make sure you typed the parameter correctly in the Tftp command. If you did, there may be several reasons why your computer cannot resolve the remote computer name. Contact your network administrator to sort out the problem.
<p><i>application</i><b> : Error reading file </b><i>filename</i><b>.</b>
<p>[FINDSTR]
<p>There are probably bad sectors in this file.
<p>Restore the file from a backup copy. Then try again.
<p><i>Application</i><b> - FROZEN</b>
<p>[Virtual DOS Machine (VDM)]
<p>This is a status message. For instance, NTVDM might display this message in the title bar of the Command Prompt window when the user minimizes an application while it is displaying a full-screen graphic display. This message reminds the user that as long as the application is minimized, it is not running.
<p><i>application</i><b> : No search strings</b>
<p>[FINDSTR]
<p>Probably, in using the Findstr command, you specified a file that is to contain the string(s) to search for, but that file is empty. Or you may not have specified strings to search for in the Findstr command line.
<p>Retry the Findstr command, but this time specify the strings to search for.
<p><i>application</i><b> : not a plain file. </b><i>filename</i>
<p>[FTP Server]
<p>Using the Ftp command, you attempted to retrieve the file named in the message, but the file is either a directory or a special device.
<p>Verify the name of the file you want to retrieve and retry the Ftp command, using that name.
<p><i>application</i><b> : Out of memory</b>
<p>[FINDSTR]
<p>The Findstr utility has run out of memory.
<p>Quit some unneeded applications, then retry the Findstr command.
<p><i>application</i><b> : Read file failed. (Cannot create file mapping.)</b>
<p>[FINDSTR]
<p>You do not have enough Windows NT quota right now to carry out the Findstr command, which uses memory-mapped files.
<p>This is a dynamic situation. Either wait a few seconds and retry the Findstr command, or quit some unneeded applications which may be using up some of your quota. If you still get this message, you may have to ask your system administrator to increase your quota.
<p><i>application</i><b> : remote terminal session not supported</b>
<p>[TCP/IP]
<p>You must specify a command parameter with the Rsh command. Initiating a remote login session by using the Rsh command with no parameter is not supported by Windows NT.
<p>Use the TCP/IP utility, Telnet, to initiate a remote login session. Or, if you just forgot to use the command parameter with the Rsh command, retry the Rsh command.
<p><i>application</i><b> : </b><i>text</i><b> ignored</b>
<p>[FINDSTR]
<p>You used a switch in the Findstr command line that is not recognized by the Findstr utility. The utility ignored the parameter and went ahead with its task. This can happen if you forget the colon (:) suffix required of some Findstr switches.
<p>To avoid this message in the future, stop using the parameter named in the message. To see which switches are recognized by the Findstr utility, and which ones require the trailing colon, type HELP followed by the command name (in this case, Findstr).
<p><i>application</i><b> : tftp/udp: unknown service</b>
<p>[TFTP]
<p>To transfer files to or from a remote computer using the TCP/IP Tftp command, the remote computer must have Ftp server running. It does not.
<p>If you can transfer the files to a different computer, try using it. Similarly, if the files you are getting from the remote computer also reside on another computer, try using it. Otherwise, you will have to contact someone at the remote computer, or your network administrator, to get the Ftp server running on the remote computer.
<p><i>application</i><b> : transfer aborted</b>
<p>[TFTP]
<p>The process receiving the file transfer has ended before the file transfer was completed.
<p>Retry the file transfer. If you still get this message, contact your network administrator.
<p><i>application</i><b> : unexpected M_PROTO type: </b><i>code</i>
<p>[TCP/IP]
<p>The Netstat utility was gathering statistics about a protocol (TCP, UDP, or IP) and received a reply that had the wrong format (a format not consistent with the protocol).
<p>No direct user action is necessary. The Netstat utility will continue executing. If you get this message often, ask your network administrator to interpret the protocol type code that is displayed at the end of the message, and take appropriate action.
<p><i>application</i><b> : Write error</b>
<p>[FINDSTR]
<p>You may have tried to redirect the output of the Findstr command to a file (from the console) and the disk the file is on is full.
<p>If you must redirect the output of the Findstr command to a disk file, either first delete some unneeded files from the disk or use a different disk when you retry the Findstr command.
<p><i>application</i><b> :TLI Error </b><i>code</i>
<p>[FTP Server] [TCP/IP]
<p>The TCP/IP utility named at the start of the message had a data connection fail due to an unexpected TLI error.
<p>Retry the operation. If you get this message again, contact your network administrator to interpret the meaning of the TLI error code displayed at the end of the message and take corrective action.
<p><i>application</i><b> :TLOOK returned </b><i>code</i>
<p>[FTP Server] [TCP/IP]
<p>The TCP/IP utility named at the start of the message had a data connection fail due to an unexpected event.
<p>Retry the operation. If you still get this message, contact your network administrator to interpret the meaning of the event number that is displayed at the end of the message and take corrective action.
<p><i>application</i><b> could not copy all files to the Emergency Repair Disk. One or more configuration file was not found.</b>
<p>[Repair Disk]
<p>The Rdisk utility could not find one or more necessary files in your \&lt;systemroot&gt;\repair directory and therefore could not copy the files to your Emergency Repair Disk. If the SETUP.LOG file is missing, the Emergency Repair Disk is unusable. If any other file is missing, the Emergency Repair Disk might be partially usable.
<p>If SETUP.LOG, DEFAULT.*, SECURITY.*, or SAM.* are missing, reinstall Windows NT because the Rdisk utility cannot recreate these files. If the missing files are SYSTEM.* and/or SOFTWARE.*, run Rdisk to update the repair information and recreate the missing files. Then create the Emergency Repair Disk again.
<p><i>application</i><b> could not copy all files to the Emergency Repair Disk. The Emergency Repair Disk is full. The configuration files were saved in your hard disk.</b>
<p>[Repair Disk]
<p>The repair disk might not be usable. During the repair process, use the repair information on the hard disk rather than the repair information on the Emergency Repair Disk.
<p><i>application</i><b> could not save all configuration files.</b>
<p>[Repair Disk]
<p>Some of the repair information in your \&lt;systemroot&gt;\repair directory could not be saved to an Emergency Repair disk. A repair disk created after you see this message might not be usable unless you are attempting to repair system files.
<p><i>application</i><b> is unable to get configuration information for the selected floppy disk drive.</b>
<p>[Repair Disk]
<p>A hardware problem might be preventing the repair disk from detecting the type of floppy drive on your computer.
<p>Check the Hardware Compatibility List to verify that your floppy drive is compatible with Windows NT. If so, contact the hardware manufacturer. You might also want to contact technical support.
<p><i>application</i><b> was unable to format the disk.</b>
<p>[Repair Disk]
<p>The disk is probably bad.
<p>Try again, using a different disk.
<p><i>application</i><b> was unable to load required floppy disk operation support.</b>
<p>[Repair Disk]
<p>The dynamic link library that operates on the floppy drive could not be loaded. The system may be corrupted.
<p>Run Setup to repair the system files.
<p><i>code</i><b> is not a valid Windows NT network message number.</b>
<p>[Network]  Net Message ID: 3871
<p>The specified message number does not represent a Windows NT message.
<p>Check that you typed the correct message number. To see more information about system messages, type NET HELPMSG &lt;message&gt;#, where &lt;message&gt;# is the message number or error code.
<p><i>command</i><b> : bad destination address </b><i>address</i>
<p>[TCP/IP]
<p>If you used a network name or alias for the destination parameter in the Route command and you get this message, then the Route command was unable to find the name or alias in the NETWORKS file on the local computer (the path to the NETWORKS file is \systemroot\system32\drivers\etc). If you used an IP address, you specified an invalid format. For example, you may not have used a dotted decimal format, such as 127, 284.122.107, or 284.122.108).
<p>Retry the Route command, specifying a valid destination.
<p><i>command</i><b> : internal error - unknown remote command service</b>
<p>[TCP/IP]
<p>Retry the remote command. If you still get this message, contact your technical support group.
<p><i>computer name</i><b> is a domain controller of domain </b><i>name</i><b>. Focus will be set to domain </b><i>name</i><b>.</b>
<p>[User Manager]
<p>You specified a domain controller rather than a domain in the Domain text box of the Select Domain dialog. The domain for which that computer is a controller will be selected.
<p>Choose OK.
<p><i>computer name</i><b> is not a valid computer name.</b>
<p>[Network]  Net Message ID: 3870
<p>The computer name you specified is invalid.
<p>Check the spelling of the computer name.
<p><i>computer name</i><b> received an ICMP error packet on a nonexistent connection. Type </b><i>text</i><b>, Code </b><i>code</i><b>, Source </b><i>address</i><b>, Destination </b><i>address</i><b>.</b>
<p>[Netevent]
<p>An endpoint that no longer exists received an ICMP error packet.
<p>No action is needed.
<p><i>day</i><b> is not a recognized day of the week.</b>
<p>[Network]  Net Message ID: 3760
<p>The day you specified is invalid. Valid days are Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday. Valid abbreviations are M, T, W, Th, F, Sa, and Su.
<p>Retype the command using valid names or abbreviations.
<p><i>drive letter</i><b> does not contain a tape.</b>
<p>[Backup]
<p>You attempted to back up files to a backup drive that does not contain a tape.
<p>Insert a tape in the specified backup drive, then choose OK.
<p><i>drive letter</i><b> has a remembered connection to </b><i>name</i><b>. Do you want to overwrite the remembered connection? </b><i>name</i><b> : </b><i>text</i>
<p>[Network]
<p>You have attempted to assign a remote resource to a drive letter or port name that has been used for a different remote resource. The remote resource usually assigned to this driver letter or port name is not currently connected, but there would normally be an attempt to connect to it the next time you log on.
<p>If you want to change the remote resource assigned to this drive letter or port name, choose Yes. To keep the old assignment, choose No, and then assign the new resource to a different drive letter or port name.
<p><i>drive letter :</i><b> </b><i>text</i><b> failed, error = </b><i>number</i>

<p><i> drive letter :</i><b> Device Not Ready!</b>
<p>[CD Player]
<p>Your CD-ROM device is not ready.
<p>Make sure that there is a disc in the drive, and that the drive door is closed.
<p><i> drive letter :</i><b> Invalid Device Request!</b>
<p>[CD Player]
<p>CD Player does not support your drive. Or CD Player does support the drive, but the CDAUDIO.SYS needs to be enabled. The following are the drives that CD Player supports:  NEC&#174;, Denon&#174;, Pioneer&#174;, and Hitachi&#174;.
<p>If your drive is a supported drive, use the Services option in Control Panel to enable CDAUDIO.SYS.
<p><i> drive letter :</i><b> No Media in Drive!</b>
<p>[CD Player]
<p>You attempted to use CD Player to read an empty drive.
<p>Insert a valid disc.
<p><i> drive letter :</i><b> Sector Not Found!</b>
<p>[CD Player]
<p>CD Player attempted to play something that does not exist on the disc that is currently in the CD-ROM. For example, if you remove a disc, its titles may still appear in the CD Player window. If you insert another disc, then select a title from the first disc and choose Play, CD Player will generate this message.
<p>Exit and restart CD Player.
<p><i> drive letter :</i><b> Unrecognized Media!</b>
<p>[CD Player]
<p>You attempted to use CD Player to read a drive that is empty, or that contains damaged disc, or a disk that is not an audio disk.
<p>Insert a valid audio disc, then try again.
<p><i>file system</i><b> is not a valid file system</b>
<p>[Convert]
<p>The Convert utility does not support the target file system you specified in the second parameter of the Convert command. In version 1.0 of Windows NT, the only valid target file system for the Convert utility is NTFS.
<p>If you want to convert the drive to the NTFS file system, retype the Convert command and specify NTFS as the target file system. To check the syntax of the Convert command, type HELP CONVERT at the command prompt.
<p><i>file system</i><b> is not available for </b><i>drive letter</i><b> drives.</b>
<p>[Utilities]
<p>For example, the HPFS file system is not available on floppy disk drives.
<p>Use a different file system.
<p><i>filename</i><b>      </b><i>filename</i><b> Could not expand second filename so as to match first</b>
<p>[File Compare]
<p>The Fc command expanded the wild cards in the second file you specified, but was unable to find a file on the path you specified to use. In other words, no filenames on the path satisfied the wild cards. Therefore, the Fc command did not compare any files.
<p>Retry the command, either using a different path or a different set of wild cards in the second file specification parameter.
<p><i>filename</i><b>  Invalid time stamp.</b>
<p>[Chkdsk]
<p>The file allocation table stores the time as year, month, day, hour, minute, and second. The minute and second must be less than 60. The hour must be less than 34. The day must be less than 32. And the month must be less than 13.
<p>Contact technical support.
<p><i>filename</i><b>  Is cross linked on allocation unit </b><i>number</i>

<p><i>filename</i><b> Another file already exists by this name. Use a different file name.</b>
<p>[Paintbrush]
<p>You have attempted to save a file under the name of a file that has been previously saved.
<p>Assign a name to the file that has not already been used.
<p><i>filename</i><b> Cannot access this file. Check security privileges over the network drive.</b>
<p>[Common Dialog]
<p>You have specified a file that you do not have access to.
<p>Check the privileges on this file and on the directory in which it resides, or ask the administrator to check it for you. The administrator might need to change the permissions on the file or directory so that you have access to it.
<p><i>filename</i><b> Cannot access this file. Please verify security privileges on the network drive.</b>
<p>[Common Dialog]
<p>You cannot access this file, probably because you do not have the necessary permissions on the shared directory in which it resides.
<p>Ask the network administrator to make sure you have the necessary permissions on the shared directory that you have assigned this drive letter to. When that is done, try again.
<p><i>filename</i><b> Cannot find this file. Either something has happened to the network or possibly the file has been renamed or moved. Do you want to try again?</b>
<p>[Write]
<p>You attempted to open or to save a file that cannot currently be located.
