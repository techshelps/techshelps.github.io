<P>[Cardfile]</P>
<P>Cardfile was unable to load the Object Linking and Embedding libraries, so it cannot support the Cardfile 3.1 format. If Cardfile saves your file in a Cardfile 3.0 format, be aware that any embedded object becomes a static object, which means that you cannot edit it from within Cardfile. Also, if the object is in color, saving it in Cardfile 3.0 converts the object to black-and-white.</P>

<P>[Disk Administrator]</P>
<P>This is not a fatal error. However, a bad spot has developed on the disk. The information that was on this block has been mapped to one of the disk's spare blocks, using the redundant data.</P>

<P>[Disk Administrator]</P>
<P>The specified name is a fault tolerance set member name; it refers to a fault tolerance partition. There is a bad sector on one of the disks on one side of the mirror set. Your data security is at some risk. There is still a good sector on the other side of the mirror set, and the probability that the same sector number will go bad on both sides of the mirror is quite low.</P>
<P>To regain complete data security, do the following: (1) examine the event logs to identify which drive has the bad sector; (2) back up all data on that drive; (3) reformat the drive, using the verify switch to map out the bad sector; and (4) restore the backed up data.</P>

Your user name was not added as a new message alias for one of the following reasons:  the Messenger service is not started on your workstation; your user name and your workstation's computer name are the same, and your workstation's computer name is already a message alias; or your user name is in use as a message alias on another computer on the network. In this case, you cannot receive messages at the local workstation using this name.</P>
<P>Start the Messenger service on your workstation if it is not already started. Then use the Net Name command to add your user name as a message alias. If your user name is being used as a message alias on another computer, delete the alias on that computer. Then use the Net Name command to add your user name as a message alias on this computer.</P>

<P>The link has been disconnected for one of the following reasons:  an unrecoverable phone line error; a noisy line; or disconnection by the system administrator.</P>
<P>To re-establish the link, redial. If you have enabled the Redial on link failure option, the entry is redialed automatically. You can enable automatic redialing through Redial Settings on the Options menu. For more information see "Setting Options" in the Remote Access Service online Help. If this error persists, lower the modem's initial speed (bps) setting, and dial again. Also see "Setting Modem Features" in the Remote Access Service online Help.</P>

<P>[Remote Access Service]</P>
<P>The link has been disconnected for one of the following reasons: an unrecoverable error occurred in your modem (or other communication device); an unrecoverable error occurred on your communications port; or your modem cable has come unplugged.</P>
<P>To diagnose and correct the problem make sure your modem is on and your cable is securely attached or make sure your modem is functioning properly. For instructions on testing your modem through Windows NT Terminal, see "Testing Your Modem" in the Remote Access Service online Help.</P>
<P><B>The port was disconnected.</B></P>
<P>[Remote Access Service]</P>
<P>Redial the entry. If you continue to get this message, reduce the modem's initial speed, and turn off the advanced modem features. For more information see "Setting Modem Features" in the Remote Access Service online Help. If the problem persists, contact your system administrator.</P>

<P>The Remote Access Phone Book file and the current Remote Access configuration are probably inconsistent.</P>
<P>If you have changed your communications equipment (such as your serial port or modem), be sure to reconfigure Remote Access. Use the Network option in Control Panel to reconfigure RAS. For more information see "Reconfiguring Remote Access" in the Remote Access Service online Help. If the error persists, remove and recreate the affected Phone Book entry or, reinstall the Remote Access Service.
