<H3>Remaining STOP Messages</H3><P>A typical user will not be able to diagnose the cause of any of the remaining STOP messages. When you get one of these messages, first record the top few lines of the STOP message and then restart the computer. If the STOP message occurs again, you have four options for diagnosing the STOP condition, all of which should be handled by a trained technician at your own site: </P>
<UL><LI>     Diagnose the problem using the information displayed in the STOP message and any pertinent information from the Windows&nbsp;NT forum on CompuServe&reg;, where Microsoft maintains an up-to-date list of causes for these STOP messages.</LI><LI>     Use the Windows&nbsp;NT debugger to get more information about the problem. 
<P>If you use this option or the next one, be sure to switch Windows&nbsp;NT to debug mode before you restart your computer. See "Windows&nbsp;NT Debugger," later in this chapter, for information on how to prepare your computer for debugging.</P></LI><LI>     Contact your own or another technical support group for assistance in using the Windows&nbsp;NT debugger remotely.</LI><LI>     Contact your own or another technical support group to discuss the information in the STOP message. They may see a familiar pattern in the information and save everyone time.</LI></UL><P>The following list provides the ranges of unique hexadecimal numbers for the STOP messages that are least likely to happen. However, if one does occur, it will be after Windows&nbsp;NT Executive startup is complete and will not be caused by hardware or software traps in a processor. If you want more information about these messages, you can refer to the alphabetical list provided in Chapter 4, "Message Reference." However, most trained technicians will only need the unique hexadecimal number. </P>
