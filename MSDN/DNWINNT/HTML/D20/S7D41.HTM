<P>[Remote Access Service]</P>
<P>One of the Remote Access configuration files probably contains invalid information.</P>
<P>The easiest way to resolve this problem is to reinstall Remote Access. Use the Network option in Control Panel to remove and reinstall RAS. If you are using a modem that is not supported by Remote Access, switch to a supported modem, or see "Modem Script File" in the Remote Access Service online Help for information about modifying the modem script file for your modem. The Remote Access script files (PAD.INF, MODEM.INF, and SWITCH.INF) are in the \SYSTEM32\RAS subdirectory of your Windows NT directory.</P>

<P><B>Disk Administrator cannot convert the active partition on disk 0 into a volume set. </B></P>
<P>[Disk Administrator]</P>
<P>X86 computers use the active partition on disk 0 to initiate starting the system. The system BIOS does not know how to support volume sets on this partition. Therefore, the partition cannot be part of a volume set.</P>
<P>Select a different partition for the volume set.</P>
<P><B>Disk Administrator cannot create extended partitions on removable media.</B></P>
<P>[Disk Administrator]</P>
<P>If you create a partition that does not use the entire disk, you will not be able to use the remaining free space.</P>
<P><B>Disk Administrator cannot delete the active partition on disk 0.</B></P>
<P>[Disk Administrator]</P>

<P><B>Disk Administrator cannot delete the partition containing Windows NT system files.</B></P>
<P>[Disk Administrator]</P>
<P>Windows NT is using the system files on the partition to run. In order to delete the partition where the system files are located, you would have to start another operating system and then delete the partition. If you delete the partition that contains Windows NT system files, Windows NT may not be able to start.</P>

<P><B>Do you want to capture this AppleTalk printing device?</B></P>
<P>[Services for Macintosh (SFM)]</P>
<P>Capturing a printing device means that you are configuring the device for your network. When the printing device (printer) was uncaptured, it could receive only one print job at a time. Once the device is captured, it will spool print jobs.</P>
<P>If you choose No, all users (including Apple&reg; Macintosh users) will continue to be able to see the AppleTalk printing device on the network, but the device will not spool print jobs. If you select Yes, and decide to capture the printing device, Macintosh users will be able to see the printing device only under the new name given it when you selected Yes and configured the printer for the network.</P>

<P>To free memory, delete an existing printer queue. Then create and share the new queue. You can also reconfigure the server to allow more printer queues by increasing the value of the MAXQUEUES entry in the server's configuration file.

<P><B>One of your NetBIOS names is already registered on the remote network.</B></P>
<P>[Remote Access Service]</P>
<P>Networking architecture requires each computer on the network to be registered with a unique name. This rule applies to both the LAN and remote workstations. Because unique names are required, you cannot have both a Remote Access and a direct connection (such as Ethernet connector) to the same network. If you are evaluating Remote Access in such a situation, you need to unplug the network connector before attempting to connect through Remote Access.</P>
<P>Make sure your computer name is different from all other computer names on the network. To change your computer name, use the Network option in Control Panel. If the name is not your computer name, another computer may have registered a computer name matching your domain name, or you are running a NetBIOS application that has added a conflicting name. If the problem persists after changing the name, contact your system administrator.</P>
