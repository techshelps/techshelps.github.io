<H3>FTP, Gopher, WWW, or RAS Server</H3><P>To set up an FTP, Gopher, or WWW (World Wide Web) site, you only need to purchase a Server License. You do not need to make sure that every user has a Client Access License from Microsoft. Microsoft includes an FTP server with the Windows&nbsp;NT Server product, and you can use any public-domain or commercially available Gopher or Web server or the ones shipped with this <I>Windows&nbsp;NT Resource Kit</I>.</P>
<P>If you also want to use the Microsoft Remote Access Service for PPP or SLIP dial-in support, then you also need one Client Access License per connection. In other words, if the site supports 10 concurrent connections, you need to purchase a Server License and 10 Client Access Licenses for basic network services in the Per Server mode. If the site supports workstations in the Per Seat mode, you need to purchase a Server License and Client Access Licenses for basic network services for each workstation. If you increase the number of concurrent connections allowed, you must then purchase additional Client Access Licenses in the Per Server mode up to the maximum number of concurrent users of the Remote Access Service.</P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
