<H2>Chapter 9  Using Remote Access Service</H2><P>This section replaces "Using Terminal and Script Setting for Remote Logons," and includes new information on scripting.</P>
<H3 CLASS="h3"><A NAME="sec0"></A>Logging on to Remote Computers Using RAS Terminal and Scripts</H3><P>The exact logon process for remote computers varies as widely as the remote computers themselves. Remote computers you might log on to include a Windows Remote Access Service (RAS) server giving you access to your corporate network or the Internet, a UNIX computer in a commercial network that gives you an Internet connection, or a proprietary security computer that protects your corporate network from intruders. </P>
<P>Most remote logons require you to provide a username (frequently called login) and a password. This chapter covers how you provide the username, password, and any other information required by remote computers before you log on.</P>
<P>This chapter also describes how to connect to Microsoft, Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP), and Serial Line Internet Protocol (SLIP) servers, when and how to use RAS Terminal, how to create and activate scripts that automate remote logons, and how to debug your scripts.</P>
<P>Most of the information regarding Terminal screens, scripts, and DEVICE.LOG also applies to RAS for Windows for Workgroups version 3.11. However, the PPP, SLIP, and &lt;username&gt; and &lt;password&gt; macro information does not apply.</P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
