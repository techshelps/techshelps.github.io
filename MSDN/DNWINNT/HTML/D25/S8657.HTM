<H3>Configuring SNMP</H3><P>After the SNMP service software is installed on your computer, you must configure it with valid information for SNMP to operate. </P>
<P CLASS="proch"><B>To configure the SNMP Service</B></P>
<P CLASS="ls">    1.    Double-click the Network icon in Control Panel to display the Network Settings dialog box. </P>
<P CLASS="ls">    2.    In the Installed Network Software list box, select SNMP Service, and click the Configure button. The SNMP Service Configuration dialog box appears.</P>
<P CLASS="lt1">    <img src="XUPF_01.gif"></P>
<P CLASS="ls">    3.    To identify each community to which you want this computer to send traps, type the name in the Community Names box. After typing each name, choose the Add button to move the name to the Send Traps With Community Names list on the left.</P>
<P CLASS="lt1">You might want to use SNMP for statistics, but may not care about identifying communities or traps. In this case, you can specify the "public" community name when you configure the SNMP service.</P>
<P CLASS="lt1">To delete an entry in the list, select it and choose the Remove button.</P>
<P></P>
<P CLASS="nh"><B>Note</B></P>
<P>Community names are case sensitive.</P>
<P></P>
<P CLASS="ls">    4.    To specify hosts for each community you send traps to, after you have added the community and while it is still highlighted, type the hosts in the IP Host/Address Or IPX Address box. Then choose the Add button to move the host name, IP address, or IPX address to the Trap Destination for the selected communit<I>y</I> list on the left. </P>
<P CLASS="lt1">You can enter a host name, its IP address, or its IPX address. </P>
<P CLASS="lt1">Enter each IP address as four octets, AAA.BBB.CCC.DDD. You do not need to enter leading zeroes.</P>
<P CLASS="lt1">Enter each IPX address in 8.12 format, XXXXXXXX.YYYYYYYYYYYY, where X represents the network number and Y represents the network address of the computer. </P>
<P CLASS="lt1">To delete an entry in the list, select it and choose the Remove button.</P>
<P CLASS="ls">    5.    To enable additional security for the SNMP service, choose the Security button. Continue with the configuration procedure, as described in the next section, "Configuring SNMP Security."</P>
<P CLASS="ls">    6.    To specify Agent information (comments about the user, location, and services), choose the Agent button. Continue with the configuration procedure, as described in "Configuring SNMP Agent Information" later in this chapter.</P>
<P CLASS="ls">    7.    When you have completed all procedures, choose the OK button. When the Network Settings dialog box reappears, choose the OK button. </P>

<P>The Microsoft SNMP service has been configured and is ready to start. It is not necessary to restart the computer.</P>
<H4><A NAME="sec0"></A>Configuring SNMP Security</H4><P>SNMP security allows you to specify the communities and hosts a computer will accept requests from, and to specify whether to send an authentication trap when an unauthorized community or host requests information.</P>

<P CLASS="ls">    1.    Double-click the Network icon in Control Panel to display the Network Settings dialog box. </P>

<P CLASS="lt1"><img src="XUPF_02.gif"></P>
<P CLASS="ls">    4.    If you want to send a trap for failed authentications, select the Send Authentication Trap check box in the SNMP Security Configuration dialog box. </P>
<P CLASS="ls">    5.    In the Community Name box, type the community names from which you will accept requests. Choose the Add button after typing each name to move the name to the Accepted Community Names list on the left. </P>
<P CLASS="lt1">A host must belong to a community that appears on this list for the SNMP agent to accept requests from that host. Typically, all hosts belong to public, which is the standard name for the common community of all hosts. </P>
<P CLASS="lt1">To delete an entry in the list, select it and choose the Remove button.</P>
<P CLASS="ls">    6.    Select an option to specify whether to accept SNMP packets from any host or from only specified hosts.</P>
<UL><LI> <FONT FACE="symbol">•</FONT>    If the Accept SNMP Packets From Any Host option is selected, no SNMP packets are rejected on the basis of source host ID.

In the IP Host/Address Or IPX Address box, type the host names, IP addresses, or IPX addresses of the hosts from which you will accept requests. Then choose the Add button to move the host name, IP address, or IPX address to the list box on the left. To delete an entry in the list, select it and choose the Remove button.</LI></UL><P></P>
