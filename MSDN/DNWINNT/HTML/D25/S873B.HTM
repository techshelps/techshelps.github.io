<H2>Situations That Use Up Licenses</H2><P>The following is a list of many common situations that use up one or more licenses from the pool of available licenses in either Per Seat or Per Server mode or both modes. These are situations under which License Manager assigns licenses. They do not always coincide with when you legally use a license, such as what happens with license groups.</P>
<UL><LI> <FONT FACE="symbol">•</FONT>    Disconnecting from a connection to basic network services on a Windows&nbsp;NT Server using the IPX protocol results in a license being held upon disconnection for up to the time value of the ConnectionlessAutoDisc function, which is a minimum of 15 minutes. In other words, this is the amount of time that it will take to free up that license for use by others, and you cannot shorten it. However, if you reconnect within that 15-minute period, you will use the same license and not consume another one. (Per Server only)</LI><LI> <FONT FACE="symbol">•</FONT>    If you connect to a server from two different computers using the same username, that is considered two connections. (Per Server only)</LI><LI> <FONT FACE="symbol">•</FONT>    If you are using SQL Server 6.0, to avoid incorrect license counts, you must use DBLIB 6.0 instead of DBLIB 4.2x, which requires updated DBLIB DLLs on the client computer. (Per Server only)</LI><LI> <FONT FACE="symbol">•</FONT>    In Windows&nbsp;NT Workstation and Windows&nbsp;NT Server, using the <B>net use</B> command with the <B>/u</B> option could result in another license being assigned. This depends on the name you specify with the <B>/u</B> option, and only happens when a name other than the user's domain name is used. For an example, see the "Counting Connections Twice for Licensing" section later in this chapter. (Per Seat only)</LI><LI> <FONT FACE="symbol">•</FONT>    The following list provides several examples of services whose connections use up from one to many licenses:
