<H3>Gateway 2000 CD-ROM Drives</H3><P>This problem occured in Windows&nbsp;NT 3.5 and was fixed in Service Pack 2. There is no problem with these CD-ROM drives in Windows&nbsp;NT 3.51.</P>
<P>Windows&nbsp;NT 3.5 had problems with Gateway 2000 CD-ROM drives manufactured by Mitsumi. The CD-ROM drives manufactured after early 1995 were not fully compatible with Windows&nbsp;NT, which occasionally reports read errors when copying data from a CD-ROM. The problem occurred on Gateway 2000 Pentium PCI bus PCs using the ATAPI 1.2 IDE driver with the Windows&nbsp;NT 3.5 Server.</P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
