<H4><A NAME="sec0"></A>Common Event Record Data</H4><P>Audit event records include header information that is present in all event records. The following list describes this common information.</P>
<UL><LI>    The time the event was generated.</LI><LI>    The SID of the subject that caused the event to be generated. If possible, Event Viewer translates this SID to an account name for display. The SID is the impersonation ID if the subject is impersonating a client, or the primary ID if the subject is not impersonating.</LI><LI>    The name of the system component or module that submitted the event. For security audits this is always Security.</LI><LI>    The module-specific ID of the specific event.</LI><LI>    The event type, either Success Audit or Failure Audit.</LI><LI>    The event category, used to group related events such as logon audits, object access audits, and policy change audits.</LI></UL><P></P>

These audit categories are listed in the following table, and discussed in detail in the Audit Categories Help file (AUDITCAT.HLP).</P>
