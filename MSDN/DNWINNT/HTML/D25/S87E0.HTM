<H3>Network Traffic Regulation</H3><P>The network administrator has new settings to control the amount of account replication traffic over the WAN or RAS. Windows&nbsp;NT Server version 3.5/3.51 now has a parameter for BDCs, called <B>ReplicationGovernor</B>, that defines both the size of the data transferred on each call to the PDC and the frequency of those calls. Adjusting the <B>ReplicationGovernor</B> percentage affects both the amount of traffic sent and the frequency of sending the information. </P>
<P>The <B>ReplicationGovernor</B> parameter trades off the ability to regulate network traffic with the time it takes to complete replication by: </P>
<UL><LI> <FONT FACE="symbol">•</FONT>    Reducing the size of the buffer used on each call from the BDC to the PDC, ensuring that a single call does not consume the WAN link for too long.</LI><LI> <FONT FACE="symbol">•</FONT>    Causing Net Logon to essentially "sleep" between calls, allowing other applications to access the WAN link between calls to the PDC. </LI></UL><P></P>
<P>The NetLogon service can now be paused on any Windows&nbsp;NT Server version 3.5/3.51 machine, including the PDC of a domain. When paused, the NetLogon service will not be the target of any pass-through authentication, allowing the machine to be available for other purposes. For example, one might pause the NetLogon service on the PDC of the domain to allow it to replicate to more BDCs. Both the PDC and BDC must be running Windows&nbsp;NT Server version 3.5/3.51 in order to take advantage of this improvement.</P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
