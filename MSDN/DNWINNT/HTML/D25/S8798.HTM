<H3>Viruses</H3><P>This section describes two problems that are caused by viruses.</P>
<P>Several boot sector viruses can cause the processor to stop after the Blue Screen appears showing the Windows&nbsp;NT version. The error is:</P>
<P>Stop 0x0000007B</P>
<P>Inaccessible_boot_device</P>
<P>Scan with a good virus scanner if this occurs.</P>
<P>The second problem occurred when trying to upgrade from Windows&nbsp;NT 3.5 to 3.51. Upon rebooting, there was an additional entry in BOOT.INI that displays "Windows&nbsp;NT 3.51 installation/upgrade" and will start in 5 seconds. NTLDR entered in an endless loop of displaying BOOT.INI and restarting. </P>
<P>The solution was to run the latest version of f-prot, which, at the time, was 2.16 dated 2/2/95.</P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
