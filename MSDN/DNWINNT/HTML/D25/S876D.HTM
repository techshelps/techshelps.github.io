<H2>Security and the Internet </H2><P>While a computer is open to the Internet, it is open to a wide range of computer users. Some of these users might want to access data you do not intend to share, or might try to use your computer as an entry point to sensitive data elsewhere on the Internet. Therefore, you might want to maintain a higher level of security on a computer that connects to the Internet than you would if the computer were used on your local network only. Chapter&nbsp;3, "Security," in this <I>Windows&nbsp;NT Update&nbsp;1 </I>book provides a discussion of various levels of security and how to implement them.</P>
