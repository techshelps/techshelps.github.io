<H3>DUMPEXAM.EXE</H3><P>DUMPEXAM.EXE is a command-line utility that examines a memory dump file, extracts information from it, and writes it to a text file. This text file can then be used by support personnel to determine the cause of the STOP error. In many cases, the analysis provided by DUMPEXAM provides enough information for support personnel to determine the cause of the error, without direct access to the dump file. </P>
<P>Three files are required to run DUMPEXAM, and they all must be in the same directory. You can find them on the Windows&nbsp;NT Server or Windows&nbsp;NT Workstation CD in the directory \SUPPORT\DEBUG\<I>platform</I>, where <I>platform</I> is I386, ALPHA, MIPS, or PPC. The first two files are:</P>
<UL><LI> <FONT FACE="symbol">•</FONT>    DUMPEXAM.EXE</LI><LI> <FONT FACE="symbol">•</FONT>    IMAGEHLP.DLL</LI></UL><P></P>
<P>The third file is one of the following, depending on the type of computer on which the dump file was generated:</P>
<UL><LI> <FONT FACE="symbol">•</FONT>    KDEXTX86.DLL</LI><LI> <FONT FACE="symbol">•</FONT>    KDEXTALP.DLL</LI><LI> <FONT FACE="symbol">•</FONT>    KDEXTMIP.DLL</LI><LI> <FONT FACE="symbol">•</FONT>    KDEXTPPC.DLL</LI></UL><P></P>
<P>If you have not applied any hotfixes or service packs to Windows&nbsp;NT 3.51, and the memory dump file you want to examine is in the location specified in the Recovery dialog box in the System option in Control Panel, then you can simply run DUMPEXAM directly off the CD with no parameters. This creates a text file called MEMORY.TXT, located in the same directory as the MEMORY.DMP file, that contains information extracted from the dump file. </P>
<P>You can also use DUMPEXAM  to examine dump files created on computers running earlier versions of Windows&nbsp;NT. However, it will only run on a system running Windows&nbsp;NT 3.51, so you will need to move the dump file or access it over the network. Additionally, you will need to replace the KDEXT*.DLL files listed above with copies from the version of Windows&nbsp;NT that was running on the trapping (or target) system. These files contain debug information specific to that version of Windows&nbsp;NT.</P>
<P>The syntax for DUMPEXAM is as follows:</P>
<P CLASS="syn"><B>dumpexam</B> <I>[options] [CrashDumpFile]</I></P>
<P>where</P>
<P CLASS="term1"><B>-?</B></P>
<P CLASS="dt1">Displays the command syntax.</P>
<P CLASS="term1"><B>-v</B></P>
<P CLASS="dt1">Specifies verbose mode.</P>
<P CLASS="term1"><B>-p</B></P>
<P CLASS="dt1">Prints the header only.</P>
<P CLASS="term1"><B>-f </B><B><I>filename</I></B></P>
<P CLASS="dt1">Specifies the output file name.</P>
<P CLASS="term1"><B>-y </B><B><I>path</I></B></P>
<P CLASS="dt1">Sets the symbol search path.</P>
<P></P>
<P>You need to specify the dump file path (using the <B>-f</B> option) only if you have moved the dump file. </P>
<P>You need to specify the symbol search path (using the <B>-y</B> option) only if you are using an alternate symbol path. The symbol path for DUMPEXAM can contain several directories, separated by semicolons(;). These directories are searched in the order in which they are listed, so you should list directories with the most recently installed hotfixes or service packs first. </P>
<H4><A NAME="sec0"></A>Examples</H4><P>In our first example, the memory dump was created on a computer with Windows&nbsp;NT Workstation 3.51 and no service packs. The symbols are all in the directory C:\SYMBOLS. The dump file is in the directory C:\DUMP and is called MACHINE1.DMP. The command line reads as follows:</P>
<P><BR></P>
<pre><code>dumpexam -y c:\symbols c:\dump\machine1.dmp
</code></pre>
<P>The results of the exam will be in <I>\systemroot</I>\MEMORY.TXT.</P>
<P>In the next example, the memory dump was created on a DEC Alpha computer running Windows&nbsp;NT Server 3.5, with Service Pack 2 installed. The Service Pack 2 symbols are in D:\SP2\SYMBOLS. The Windows&nbsp;NT Server 3.5 symbols are on the product CD, which is in the E drive. The dump file MEMORY.DMP, is in D:\TEMP. The output file is to be put in the same directory as the dump file. The command line reads as follows:</P>
<P><BR></P>
<pre><code>dumpexam -y d:\sp2\symbols;e:\support\debug\alpha -f d:\temp\memory.txt d:\temp\memory.dmp
</code></pre></FONT></BODY></HTML>
