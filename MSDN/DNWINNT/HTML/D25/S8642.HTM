<P>The easiest way to become an information content provider on the Internet is with a Windows&nbsp;NT Server and the software included in the <I>Windows&nbsp;NT 3.51 Resource Kit</I>. This platform is transparent to your Internet clients—connections are made in the same way as with any other information provider. But as the administrator of the Internet server, you'll appreciate the ease of administration that you get with Windows&nbsp;NT. Also, with Windows&nbsp;NT you are not tied to any particular manufacturer for the computer you use as an Internet server. And, of course, a computer running Windows&nbsp;NT can be used for a wide variety of tasks. </P>
<P>Any computer with the hardware requirements to run Windows&nbsp;NT Server can be used as an Internet information provider. The only additional items you need are a modem, an account with an Internet provider supporting PPP or SLIP, and ideally an ISDN line, frame relay, or dedicated leased line to support the traffic an information provider might encounter. Depending on the usage your server handles, you might choose to exceed the minimums for memory and disk space recommended for a Windows&nbsp;NT Server.</P>
<P>To set up your Internet server, install the following software from the <I>Windows&nbsp;NT 3.51 Resource Kit</I> CD. </P>
