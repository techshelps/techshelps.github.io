<H3>Problems in WINDIFF.EXE</H3><P>The following problems existed with the WINDIFF.EXE utility shipped on the <I>Windows&nbsp;NT 3.5 Resource Kit</I> CD.</P>
<P>There is a problem in the working set in the WINDIFF.EXE utility when doing a large compare. The working set grows to large values. The memory is finally freed up when WINDIFF terminates. If you monitor the working set using Performance Monitor while doing a large compare, you will see a steady climb in the size. When the compare finishes, the size will suddenly drop down to a base value of around 3 to 4 MB.</P>
<P>Command line switches for this utility do not have any effect on the files listed or their order.</P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
