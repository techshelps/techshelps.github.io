<H3>Connecting to Remote Servers</H3><P>The three most common remote connections are to:</P>
<UL><LI>    Microsoft RAS servers. These include LAN Manager 2.1, Windows for Workgroups 3.11 with server extension, Windows NT 3.1 or later, and Windows 95.</LI><LI>    Non-Microsoft PPP servers</LI><LI>    SLIP servers  </LI></UL><P></P>
<P>Connecting to a Microsoft RAS server is a simple process that uses the credentials you specified when you logged on to Windows&nbsp;NT. If you use Windows&nbsp;NT RAS to connect to computers that are not running Windows&nbsp;NT RAS, the remote computer may require a specific sequence of commands and responses through a terminal window to successfully log you on to the remote system. </P>
<H4><A NAME="sec0"></A>Microsoft RAS Servers</H4><P>If the client is a Windows&nbsp;NT computer and the remote server is any Microsoft RAS server, logon is completely automated using Windows&nbsp;NT security. By default, you are authenticated using the credentials (username, password, and domain) you specified when you logged on to Windows&nbsp;NT.</P>
<P>If you wish to authenticate using different credentials, clear the Authenticate Using Current User Name and Password check box in the Edit Phone Book Entry dialog box. You will then be prompted for credentials when you dial.</P>
<H4><A NAME="sec1"></A>PPP Servers</H4><P>Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) is a newer protocol used to negotiate connections between remote computers. Remote server and client software that support PPP authentication protocols automatically negotiate network and authentication settings. The following steps are necessary to connect to a PPP server.</P>
<P CLASS="ls">1.    The currently logged-on user's credentials will not work with any non-Microsoft server, so clear the Authenticate Using Current User Name and Password check box in the Edit Phone Book Entry dialog box. You will then be prompted for credentials when you dial.</P>
<P CLASS="ls">2.    In the Edit Phone Book Entry dialog box, choose the Network button. In the Network Protocol Settings dialog box, select the PPP option. This is the default selection.</P>
<P CLASS="ls">3.    In the Security Settings dialog box, if the server you are calling requires a text-based logon exchange, select the Use Clear Text Terminal Login Only option.  Now, during the connect sequence, a terminal dialog pops up that allows you to perform the text-based logon exchange, and the Authentication dialog box does not appear.</P>
<P CLASS="lt1">The PPP standard provides for fully automated authentication, using encrypted or clear-text authentication protocols. Most PPP providers today do not implement the PPP authentication protocols and instead require a text-based exchange prior to starting PPP.</P>
<P></P>
<P>It is possible to automate the text-based exchange by using a SWITCH.INF script instead of the clear-text logon dialog. For more information, see the next section, "Automating Remote Logons Using SWITCH.INF Scripts," and "Activating SWITCH.INF Scripts," and "Troubleshooting Scripts Using DEVICE.LOG" later in this chapter.</P>
<H4><A NAME="sec2"></A>SLIP Servers</H4><P>Serial Line Internet Protocol (SLIP) is an older protocol that does not support authentication as part of the protocol. SLIP connections typically rely on text-based logon sessions. Encryption and automatic network parameter negotiations are not supported. The following steps are important when you are connecting to a SLIP server.</P>
<P CLASS="ls">    1.    SLIP always prompts you for credentials when you dial, so the Authenticate Using Current User Name and Password check box in the Edit Phone Book Entry dialog box is ignored. </P>
<P CLASS="ls">    2.    Windows&nbsp;NT RAS is not a SLIP server, but Windows&nbsp;NT RAS clients can connect to SLIP servers. In the Edit Phone Book Entry dialog box, select the Network button, and then select the SLIP option in the Network Protocol Settings dialog box for the entry. </P>
<P CLASS="ls">    3.    SLIP is programmed to always use Terminal.  Thus, to connect to a SLIP server, you do not need to select Terminal in the After Dialing box or to configure any Security settings. You will need to change only the After Dialing box when you are selecting a script to use for automating remote logons.</P>
