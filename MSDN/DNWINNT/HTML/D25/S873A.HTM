<H3>Per Seat Licensing</H3><P>The Per Seat licensing mode requires a Client Access License for each computer that will access, on any Windows&nbsp;NT Server, a particular service, such as basic network services (file, print, and communications). Once a computer is licensed, it may be used to access any Windows&nbsp;NT Server computer at no additional charge. Multiple users may also log on to that single computer. </P>
<P>However, having a valid Per Seat mode Client Access License does <I>not</I> guarantee you access to a server that is licensed in the Per Server mode and has reached its specified limit. Such a connection would also consume one of the licenses assigned to the pool of available Per Server licenses, and so you would only be able to connect if there were Per Server licenses available. </P>
<P>For example, if a server in Per Server mode has 50 Client Access Licenses dedicated to that server and has less than 50 simultaneously connected clients, then additional clients can connect. If, however, that server has reached its specified limit, then additional clients <I>cannot</I> connect, even if they have a valid Per Seat mode license for that service.</P>
<P>If you select the Per Seat licensing mode, any number of licensed computers can be used to connect at any time to any Windows&nbsp;NT Server. However, remember that you must purchase a separate Client Access License for each computer even if you use client operating-system software from Microsoft (including Microsoft Windows for Workgroups, Microsoft Windows 95, or Microsoft Windows&nbsp;NT Workstation) or from a third-party vendor, or use any of the other client software supported by Windows&nbsp;NT Server. The Per Seat option is often the most economical one for networks in which clients tend to connect to more than one server.</P>

<P CLASS="nh"><B>Note</B></P>
<P>A Client Access License is <I>not</I> included when you acquire Windows for Workgroups, Windows&nbsp;NT Workstation, and Windows 95. The license must be purchased separately in addition to the operating-system software.</P>
