<P>Windows&nbsp;NT Server 3.51 provides a new tool, License Manager, in the Network Administration program group to assist administrators in managing licensing for computers running Windows&nbsp;NT Server on which they have administrative rights. There is also a new Licensing option under Control Panel for users to manage certain aspects of licensing on their own computers. </P>
<P>Both of these tools are extensively documented in Chapter 5, "Licensing and License Manager," of the <I>Windows&nbsp;NT Server Update Information for Version 3.51</I> book. For more information on the licensing changes to the Setup process in Windows&nbsp;NT Server 3.51 and for detailed definitions with graphic descriptions of the Per Server and Per Seat licensing modes, along with more examples of when to use each mode, see Chapter 1, "New Programs and Features," in that same book.</P>
<P>This chapter assumes that you have already read all the information on licensing included in the product documentation. The purpose of this chapter is to provide even more information to help you in choosing the appropriate licensing mode, a list of many common situations that use up licenses from the pool of available licenses, some of the license purchasing requirements for specific Microsoft BackOffice server products, and additional technical information.</P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
