<H2>Using Windows&nbsp;NT Workstation as an Internet Client</H2><P>From the client side, Windows&nbsp;NT Workstation is an easy way to access the Internet. All you need is Windows&nbsp;NT Workstation installed on a computer with at least the minimum hardware requirements, a modem, and an account with an Internet provider that supports PPP or SLIP. You can then use Remote Access Service (RAS) to access the Internet.</P>
<P>When you add the phone number for your Internet provider to your RAS phone book, you'll need to either enter the IP address assigned to you by your provider or specify that the IP address is received from the host. Unless you are sure your provider is using Windows&nbsp;NT Server to receive your connection, you'll also need to make sure that the Domain Name field is blank for your provider's phone number.</P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
