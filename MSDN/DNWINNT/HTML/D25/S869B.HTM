<H3>Troubleshooting Scripts Using DEVICE.LOG</H3><P>Windows&nbsp;NT allows you to log all information passed between RAS, the modem, and the remote device, including errors reported by the remote device. This allows you to find errors that prevent your scripts from working.</P>
<P>The DEVICE.LOG file is created by enabling logging in the Registry. The DEVICE.LOG file is in the <I>systemroot</I>\SYSTEM32\RAS directory.</P>
<P CLASS="proch"><B>To create the DEVICE.LOG file</B></P>
<P CLASS="ls">    1.    Hang up any connections, and then exit from Remote Access.</P>
<P CLASS="ls">    2.    Start the Registry Editor by running the REGEDT32.EXE program.</P>
<P CLASS="ls">    3.    Locate HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE, and then access the following key:<BR>\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\RasMan\Parameters</P>
<P CLASS="ls">    4.    Change the value of the Logging parameter to 1. When changed, the parameter should look like this:</P>
<P CLASS="lt1">Logging:REG_DWORD:0x1</P>
<P CLASS="ls">    5.    Close the Registry Editor.</P>
<P></P>
<P>Logging begins when you restart Remote Access or start the Remote Access Server service (if your computer is receiving calls). You do not need to shut down and restart Windows&nbsp;NT.</P>
<P>After you dial a number and connect, a script will start. If an error is encountered during script execution, execution halts. You should exit RAS, and then determine the problem by using any text editor to view DEVICE.LOG. The following topic is an example of an incomplete script that failed and the DEVICE.LOG file created when a connection was attempted.</P>
<P></P>
<P CLASS="nh"><B>Note</B></P>
<P>The traces from all calls will be appended to DEVICE.LOG as long as RAS or the Remote Access Server service are not stopped and restarted. So, if you need to save a DEVICE.LOG file with useful information for later review or troubleshooting, make a copy of the file, giving the file another name before you restart RAS or the Remote Access Server service.</P>

<H4><A NAME="sec0"></A>Example of an Incomplete SWITCH.INF Script</H4><P>The following script is incomplete for the service to which the user tried to connect. This script was used with DEVICE.LOG to discover that the remote computer expected additional commands from the script. See the sample DEVICE.LOG for the complete output that was generated.</P>

<P>This script would be complete for many remote computers, but the remote computer sent more responses and expected a command to start a service. To complete the script you must know the remainder of the responses from the remote computer.

<P>If the generic script in RAS does not work, these guidelines should help you modify the generic script to work for your connections. It is suggested you first copy the generic script to the end of SWITCH.INF, then modify the copy to work with your connections.</P>
