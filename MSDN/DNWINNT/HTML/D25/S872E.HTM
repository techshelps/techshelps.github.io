<H2>Computer Profile Setup Versus the WINNT Command</H2><P>Two different applications, Computer Profile Setup (CPS) and Setup Manager/<B>winnt</B>, are available to make it easier to install Windows&nbsp;NT Workstation or Windows&nbsp;NT Server on large numbers of computers. Which one you use depends on whether you want identical or individualized installations.</P>
<P>CPS is used to pre-install <I>identical</I> copies of Windows&nbsp;NT on multiple Intel-based computers. CPS is used by hardware manufacturers and others who need to supply computers with Windows&nbsp;NT Workstation or Windows&nbsp;NT Server pre-installed. </P>
<P>CPS is documented in Chapter 3, "Customizing Windows&nbsp;NT Setup," in the <I>Windows&nbsp;NT Resource Guide</I>, and in the online Help. The online Help also has information on new features.</P>
<P>The <B>winnt</B> (or <B>winnt32</B>) command is used to install Windows&nbsp;NT over a network. It simplifies the task of installing Windows&nbsp;NT throughout an organization that has multiple Windows&nbsp;NT licenses. With this command, some or all of the questions the user is normally prompted for can be answered by an "answer file," which is created using the Setup Manager application. The user is prompted for any questions that are not answered in the answer file. You can create as many answer files as necessary — for example, you can tailor one to each user, or you can create one for each Group of users. In the latter case, the user's name would be left out of the answer file, and the user would be prompted for this information during setup.</P>
<P>The <B>winnt</B> (or <B>winnt32</B>) command and Setup Manager are documented in Chapter&nbsp;3, "Customizing Windows&nbsp;NT Setup," in the <I>Windows&nbsp;NT Resource Guide</I>, and in the online Help.</P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
