<H2>Overview</H2><P>The information in this appendix supersedes the paper, "<I>Microsoft Windows&nbsp;NT Enterprise Planning Guide: Windows&nbsp;NT Domains and Domain Strategies</I>," which was written for Windows&nbsp;NT Advanced Server 3.1. This appendix covers the enhancements to domains and domain planning for Windows&nbsp;NT Server version 3.5 and 3.51.</P>
<P>This planning guide provides in-depth information on the implementation of Microsoft Windows&nbsp;NT Server 3.51, with a focus on domains and domain strategies. It is intended for networking groups who are going to implement a networking solution and may need assistance in planning the design and implementation of domains. The goal of this document is to provide an understanding of the various domain models, the business and technical reasons for selecting one model as opposed to the others, as well as the advantages and tradeoffs associated with each of the domain models.</P>
<P>This guide discuss the following topics:</P>
