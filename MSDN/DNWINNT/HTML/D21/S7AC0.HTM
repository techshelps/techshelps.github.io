This information can be used to detect the unnecessary consumption of computer resources. Each object requires memory to store basic information about the object.</P>
<H3><A NAME="sec1"></A>Events<I>     Expert</I></H3><P>Events is the number of events in the computer at the time of data collection. Notice that this is an instantaneous count, not an average over the time interval. An event is used when two or more threads wish to synchronize execution.</P>
