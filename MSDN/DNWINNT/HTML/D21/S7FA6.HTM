<H3>How Performance Counters Are Structured</H3><P>If you've played around with Performance Monitor at all, you've noticed it has a few counters. And a few more. And then some. To cope with this flood of data, the counters are organized into a logical hierarchy. This hierarchy is defined by the structure of the (measurable) hardware equipment and (measurable) software elements.</P>
<P>At the top of the hierarchy is the Domain. Each Domain contains computers. For our purposes, each computer has distinct elements called <I>objects.</I> There are objects for physical components such as Processors, Physical Disks, and Memory. There are other objects, such as Process and Paging File. Each object has a set of <I>counters</I> defined for it. An object's counters record the activity level of the object. We use the following typographical convention to name a counter of a particular object:  <I>object: counter.</I></P>
<P>Some objects have multiple <I>instances</I>. For example, a computer can have multiple physical disk drives. Each such disk drive is an instance of the Physical Disk object. Each such disk drive has a name; in the case of Physical Disks it is its physical unit number. All the instances of a particular object have the same counters defined for them. The % Disk Time counter is the main indicator of how busy a disk is. Each physical disk drive has a counter that measures % Disk Time. We use the following typographical convention to denote a particular counter of an object with instances:  <I>object: counter[instance name]</I></P>
<P>This structure is used in the dialog box where you select counters for measurement. This dialog box is shown in the following section.</P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
