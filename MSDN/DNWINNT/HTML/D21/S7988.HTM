<H3><A NAME="sec15"></A>Packets Received/sec     Advanced</H3><P>Packets Received/sec is the rate that the Redirector is receiving packets (also called SMBs or Server Message Blocks). Network transmissions are divided into packets. The average number of bytes received in a packet can be obtained by dividing Bytes Received/sec by this counter. Some packets received may not contain incoming data, for example an acknowledgment to a write made by the Redirector would count as an incoming packet.</P>

<H3><A NAME="sec18"></A>Read Operations Random/sec     Advanced</H3><P>Read Operations Random/sec counts the rate that, on a file-by-file basis, reads are made that are not sequential. If a read is made using a particular file handle, and then is followed by another read that is not immediately the contiguous next byte, this counter is incremented by one.</P>

<H3><A NAME="sec21"></A>Server Reconnects     Advanced</H3><P>Server Reconnects counts the number of times your Redirector has had to reconnect to a server in order to complete a new active request. You can be disconnected by the Server if you remain inactive for too long. Locally even if all your remote files are closed, the Redirector will keep your connections intact for (nominally) ten minutes. Such inactive connections are called Dormant Connections. Reconnecting is expensive in time.</P>

<H3><A NAME="sec22"></A>Server Sessions     Novice</H3><P>Server Sessions counts the number of active security objects the Redirector is managing. For example, a Logon to a server followed by a network access to the same server will establish one connection, but two sessions.</P>
