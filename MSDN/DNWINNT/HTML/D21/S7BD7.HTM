<H2>CurrentControlSet\Services Subkeys</H2><P>The Services<I> </I>subkeys under the following Registry path contain parameters for the device drivers, file system drivers, and Win32 service drivers:</P>
<P>|<P><BR></P>
<pre><code>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services</code></pre>
<P>The name of each Services subkey is the name of the service, which is also the root of the name of the file from which the service is loaded. For example, for the serial mouse, the service name and Services<I> </I>subkey name is Sermouse. The file from which this is loaded is <I>SystemRoot</I>\SYSTEM32\DRIVERS\SERMOUSE.SYS.</P>
<P>All service names are defined under HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE. The names of the Windows NT built-in network services such as the Alerter and Browser services are defined under the Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion subkey in the Software area of the Registry.</P>
<P>Each Services subkey can have additional subkeys. Many services have a Linkage subkey, which provides data for binding network components, as described in "Linkage Subkey Entries for Network Components," later in this chapter. Many services also have a Parameters subkey that contains entries defined by the service with values for configuring the specific service.</P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
