<H2>Processor Object</H2><H3><A NAME="sec0"></A>Object: "Processor"  Index: 238 <I>        Novice</I></H3><P>The Processor object type includes as instances all processors on the computer. A processor is the part in the computer that performs arithmetic and logical computations, and initiates operations on peripherals. It executes (runs) programs on the computer.</P>
<H3><A NAME="sec1"></A>% Privileged Time<I>     Advanced</I></H3><P>Privileged Time is the percentage of processor time spent in Privileged Mode in non-Idle threads. The Windows&nbsp;NT service layer, the Executive routines, and the Windows&nbsp;NT Kernel execute in Privileged Mode. Device drivers for most devices other than graphics adapters and printers also execute in Privileged Mode. Unlike some early operating systems, Windows&nbsp;NT uses process boundaries for subsystem protection in addition to the traditional protection of User and Privileged modes. These subsystem processes provide additional protection. Therefore, some work done by Windows&nbsp;NT on behalf of your application may appear in other subsystem processes in addition to the Privileged Time in your process.</P>

<H3><A NAME="sec2"></A>% Processor Time<I>     Novice</I></H3><P>Processor Time is expressed as a percentage of the elapsed time that a processor is busy executing a non-Idle thread. It can be viewed as the fraction of the time spent doing useful work. Each processor is assigned an Idle thread in the Idle process which consumes those unproductive processor cycles not used by any other threads.</P>

<H3><A NAME="sec3"></A>% User Time<I>     Advanced</I></H3><P>User Time is the percentage of processor time spent in User Mode in non-Idle threads. All application code and subsystem code execute in User Mode. The graphics engine, graphics device drivers, printer device drivers, and the window manager also execute in User Mode. Code executing in User Mode cannot damage the integrity of the Windows&nbsp;NT Executive, Kernel, and device drivers. Unlike some early operating systems, Windows&nbsp;NT uses process boundaries for subsystem protection in addition to the traditional protection of User and Privileged modes. These subsystem processes provide additional protection. Therefore, some work done by Windows&nbsp;NT on behalf of your application may appear in other subsystem processes in addition to the Privileged Time in your process.</P>

<H3><A NAME="sec4"></A>Interrupts/sec<I>     Novice</I></H3><P>Interrupts/sec is the number of device interrupts the processor is experiencing. A device interrupts the processor when it has completed a task or when it otherwise requires attention. Normal thread execution is suspended during interrupts. An interrupt may cause the processor to switch to another, higher priority thread. Clock interrupts are frequent and periodic and create a background of interrupt activity.</P>
