<H2>Setting Up the Registry</H2><P>To enable performance counters for your application, there are two ways you must modify the Registry.</P>
<UL><LI>     Create a Performance<B> </B>key in the application's Services node, and add value entries under it specifying the name of the application's performance DLL and the names of the DLL functions.</LI><LI>     Use the <B>lodctr</B> utility to install counter names and descriptions into the Registry.</LI></UL><P>The following sections explain how you can manually enable performance counters for use as you develop and tune your application.</P>
<P>If you include performance counters with your finished product, you'll want to include enough information in your application's OEMSETUP.INF file so that the necessary modifications to the Registry are made automatically when the application is installed. For more information about this process, see "Installing Your Application," later in this chapter.</P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
