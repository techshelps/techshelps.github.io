<H2>Network Interface Object</H2><H3><A NAME="sec0"></A>Object: Network Interface     Index: 510<I>        Advanced</I></H3><P>The Network Interface Object Type includes those counters that describe the rates that bytes and packets are received and sent over a Network TCP/IP connection. It also describes various error counts for the same connection.</P>
<H3><A NAME="sec1"></A>Bytes Received/sec<I>     Advanced</I></H3><P>Bytes Received/sec is the rate that bytes are received on the interface, including framing characters.</P>

<H3><A NAME="sec4"></A>Current Bandwidth<I>     Advanced</I></H3><P>Current Bandwidth is an estimate of the interface's current bandwidth in bits per second (bps). For interfaces that do not vary in bandwidth or for those where no accurate estimation can be made, this value is the nominal bandwidth.</P>

<P>Counter Type: PERF_COUNTER_RAWCOUNT     Counter Size: 4 bytes</P>
<H3><A NAME="sec5"></A>Output Queue Length<I>     Advanced</I></H3><P>Output Queue Length is the length of the output packet queue (in packets.) If this is longer than 2, delays are being experienced and the bottleneck should be found and eliminated if possible. Since the requests are queued by NDIS in this implementation, this will always be 0.</P>

One possible reason for discarding such a packet could be to free up buffer space.</P>
