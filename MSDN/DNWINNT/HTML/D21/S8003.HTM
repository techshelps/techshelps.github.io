<H2>Capview:  a Visual Form of CAP</H2><P>Looking at Figures 10.7 and 10.8 is educational but a mite tedious if you have a large program with hundreds or thousands of functions. There is a great alternative:  Capview. Figures 10.9 through 10.11 show some of the data from running the repaired Solitaire as it is seen by Capview. </P>

<P>Figure 10.10    Capview tree profile of Solitaire cascade, zoomed in</P>
<P>Each box in the Capview tree represents a line in the SOL.CAP file. If you zoom out you get the overview, and if you zoom in you can see the details of each line.</P>
<P>The first figure in the box is the number of calls made to that routine. </P>
<P>The rightmost number in the next line of figures is the time spent in the function itself, expressed in microseconds. The left number is the <I>attributed time</I>. This is the time spent in the function expressed as a percentage of the time in the function plus the time in the functions it calls. The middle figure is time in the function as a percentage of time in the entire program. </P>
<P>In the last line, the rightmost number is the attributed time. The middle number is the attributed time in this function as a percentage of time in the program. And the leftmost number is the time in this function as a percentage of attributed time in the calling function.</P>

<P>The List view of Capview is illustrated in Figure 10.11. The attributed columns are shown but the function-only columns are also available. </P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
