<H3>COMPUTE State</H3><P>During this state, processor time is consumed for the amount of time you specify. When Response Probe begins, it calibrates itself to the processor to determine the amount of processor cycles executed per unit of real time. Thereafter, when you specify Response Probe to consume the processor for a certain amount of time, it does so by consuming the appropriate number of processor cycles. Processor calibration is done at High Priority class. </P>
<P>During the processor time consumption period, code and data pages are touched. Response Probe simulates code pages by reading during computation a file you create. To simulate data pages, Response Probe uses a section of virtual memory backed by the paging file that is written during computation.</P>
<P>The pages being touched (both code pages and data pages) are selected as normally distributed values based on the supplied mean and standard deviation for code and data pages. These values control the paging activities during the compute state.</P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
