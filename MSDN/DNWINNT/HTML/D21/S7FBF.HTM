<H3>Ways to Print Performance Data</H3><P>Can't find a Print command on the File menu? That's because it isn't there! All of the screen shots of Performance Monitor that you see in this book were made by pressing the SHIFT+ALT+PRINT SCREEN key on the keyboard. This places the screen image of the active application in the clipboard. You can then start Paintbrush (it's in the Accessories Group) and choose Paste from the Edit menu. Then you can save the image as a file or print it directly.</P>
<P>Pressing ALT+PRINT SCREEN places the entire screen's contents into the clipboard for similar processing.</P>
<P>You may not be happy with this clever trick. In that case, you might consider exporting Performance Monitor data using the Export command on the File menu. The resulting file can be printed by your favorite spreadsheet program. </P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
