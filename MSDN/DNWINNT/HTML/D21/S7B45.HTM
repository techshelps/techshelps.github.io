We say hopefully here because each packet has protocol overhead. You can determine the efficiency of this path by dividing the Bytes/sec by this counter to determine the average number of bytes transferred/packet.

Network transmissions are divided into packets. The average number of bytes received in a packet can be obtained by dividing Bytes Received/sec by this counter. Some packets received may not contain incoming data, for example an acknowledgment to a write made by the Redirector would count as an incoming packet.</P>

Some of these data requests may be satisfied by merely retrieving the data from the system Cache on your own computer if it happened to be used recently and there was room to keep it in the Cache. Requests that miss the Cache will cause a page fault (see Read Bytes Paging/sec).</P>

For one reason or another the data was not in the system Cache, and these bytes actually came across the network. Dividing this number by Bytes Received/sec will indicate the 'efficiency' of data coming in from the network, since all of these bytes are real application data (see Bytes Received/sec).</P>

In addition to file requests, this counter includes other methods of reading across the network such as Named Pipes and Transactions.

Page faults are caused by loading of modules (such as programs and libraries), by a miss in the Cache (see Read Bytes Cache/sec), or by files directly mapped into the address space of applications (a high-performance feature of Windows&nbsp;NT).</P>

Too many of these could indicate a waste of buffers on the server. This counter is incremented once for each read. It does not count packets.</P>

<H3><A NAME="sec23"></A>Reads Denied/sec<I>     Advanced</I></H3><P>Reads Denied/sec is the rate that the server is unable to accommodate requests for Raw Reads. When a read is much larger than the server's negotiated buffer size, the Redirector requests a Raw Read which, if granted, would permit the transfer of the data without lots of protocol overhead on each packet. To accomplish this the server must lock out other requests, so the request is denied if the server is really busy.</P>

<H3><A NAME="sec26"></A>Server Reconnects<I>     Advanced</I></H3><P>Server Reconnects counts the number of times your Redirector has had to reconnect to a server in order to complete a new active request. You can be disconnected by the Server if you remain inactive for too long. Locally even if all your remote files are closed, the Redirector will keep your connections intact for (nominally) ten minutes. Such inactive connections are called Dormant Connections. Reconnecting is expensive in time.</P>

Each write of a byte into the Cache is counted here.</P>
