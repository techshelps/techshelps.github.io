<H3><A NAME="sec1"></A>% Privileged Time<I>     Advanced</I></H3><P>Privileged Time is the percentage of elapsed time that this process's threads have spent executing code in Privileged Mode. When a Windows&nbsp;NT system service is called, the service will often run in Privileged Mode to gain access to system-private data. Such data is protected from access by threads executing in User Mode. Calls to the system may be explicit, or they may be implicit such as when a page fault or an interrupt occurs. Unlike some early operating systems, Windows&nbsp;NT uses process boundaries for subsystem protection in addition to the traditional protection of User and Privileged modes. These subsystem processes provide additional protection. Therefore, some work done by Windows&nbsp;NT on behalf of your application may appear in other subsystem processes in addition to the Privileged Time in your process.</P>

<H3><A NAME="sec2"></A>% Processor Time<I>     Novice</I></H3><P>Processor Time is the percentage of elapsed time that all of the threads of this process used the processor to execute instructions. An instruction is the basic unit of execution in a computer, a thread is the object that executes instructions, and a process is the object created when a program is run. Code executed to handle certain hardware interrupts or trap conditions may be counted for this process.</P>

<H3><A NAME="sec3"></A>% User Time<I>     Advanced</I></H3><P>User Time is the percentage of elapsed time that this process's threads have spent executing code in User Mode. Applications execute in User Mode, as do subsystems like the window manager and the graphics engine. Code executing in User Mode cannot damage the integrity of the Windows&nbsp;NT Executive, Kernel, and device drivers. Unlike some early operating systems, Windows&nbsp;NT uses process boundaries for subsystem protection in addition to the traditional protection of User and Privileged modes. These subsystem processes provide additional protection. Therefore, some work done by Windows&nbsp;NT on behalf of your application may appear in other subsystem processes in addition to the Privileged Time in your process.</P>

A page fault occurs when a thread refers to a virtual memory page that is not in its working set in main memory. This will not cause the page to be fetched from disk if it is on the standby list and hence already in main memory, or if it is in use by another process with whom the page is shared.</P>

Paging files are used to store pages of memory used by the process that are not contained in other files. Paging files are shared by all processes, and lack of space in paging files can prevent other processes from allocating memory.</P>
