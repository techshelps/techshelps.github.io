<H1>Registry Value Entries</H1><P>This appendix lists value entries from the Windows NT Registry that can have an effect on system performance. These values are set to appropriate defaults when Windows NT is installed, and in almost all cases you do not need to change them.</P>
<P>Each section of this appendix represents a key or subkey in the Registry. Not all values in each subkey are listed. Only those values that may have a significant effect on system performance are shown. For a complete reference of Registry entries, see the <I>Microsoft Windows NT Resource Guide</I>.</P>
<H4><B>Caution</B>   Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems, including corruptions that may make it necessary to reinstall Windows NT. Wherever possible, you should use Control Panel and the applications in the Administrative Tools program group to make changes to the system configuration.</P>
<P>Not all entries that appear here may be found in the Registry for a particular computer. For many entries, the system uses the default value unless you add the entry to the Registry and specify another value.</P>
<P>In general, if you change values for any entries in the CurrentControlSet, you must restart the computer for the changes to take effect. </P>
<P>If you change values for entries under HKEY_CURRENT_USER using Registry Editor, you may have to log off and log back on for the changes to take effect. </P>
<P>The information in this appendix appears in the following format:</P>
<P><B>Entry Name     REG_type    </B><I> Range for value entry</I></P>
<P>A description of the entry, usually including the conditions under which you might change the value.</P>
<P>Default: <I>value <BR></I>(For value ranges that are Boolean, the value can be <B>1</B> for true or "enabled," or <B>0</B> for false or "disabled.") </P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
