<P>You've convinced me, the disk is the bottleneck here. Now what can we do about it? It's not going to do us a great deal of good to use the tools we've shown so far, although we might be able to deduce which files are in play by seeing which functions of the program are busy. (There's a bit of fun detective work to try.) We have an easier, softer way.</P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
