<H3>Microsoft Mail Entries</H3><P>This subkey is used to define the appearance and behavior of the Mail program. This is the Registry path for this subkey:</P>
<P>|<P><BR></P>
<pre><code>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Mail\Microsoft Mail</code></pre>
<P>This key also appears under HKEY_USERS\.DEFAULT, but its only contents are <B>MigrateIni and MigrateIniPrint.</B></P>
<P>These are the value entries that can appear in this key:</P>
<P><B>CheckLatencyInterval     REG_SZ      </B><I>seconds</I>    </P>
<P>Affects the mail spooler's latency checking, which is intended to prevent spooler background processing from interfering with foreground work. If the specified length of time passes without the spooler having any work to do, the latency algorithm is reinitialized. </P>
<P>Default:  30 seconds</P>
<P><B>ForceScanInterval     REG_SZ      </B><I>seconds</I></P>
<P>Affects the mail spooler's latency checking, which is intended to prevent the spooler background processing from interfering with foreground work. If the designated length of time passes without the spooler getting an opportunity to do outstanding work, idle time is requested more frequently (based on the value of <B>ScanAgainInterval</B>), and eventually idle time is used whenever it can. </P>
<P>Default: 300 seconds (5 minutes)</P>
<P><B>IdleRequiredInterval     REG_SZ      </B><I>seconds</I></P>
<P>Affects the mail spooler's latency checking, which is intended to prevent the spooler's background processing from interfering with foreground work. The spooler defers its work temporarily if the system has serviced an interactive request such as a keyboard entry or mouse movement within this interval, to avoid starting a transfer when the user is busy. </P>
<P>Default: 2 seconds</P>
<P><B>NetBios     REG_SZ      </B><I>0 or 1</I></P>
<P>Enables NetBIOS notification of new mail delivery. When NetBIOS notification is used, the Windows NT computer sending a mail message to another Windows NT computer sends a NetBIOS notification message to the destination computer to tell the Mail program running on that machine that a new mail message was sent to the computer. The Mail program on the destination computer can then check the workgroup postoffice for the new mail message. This entry set to 1 to enable NetBIOS notification also provides quicker response to the arrival of new mail from users on your local postoffice. If this entry is 0 to disable NetBIOS notification, the Mail client needs to regularly check for the arrival of new mail messages on the postoffice.</P>
<P>Default: 1</P>
<P><B>NewMsgsAtStartup     REG_SZ      </B><I>0 or 1</I></P>
<P>Specifies whether Mail is to check for new mail messages in the foreground as soon as the user logs in. Set this entry to 1 to have Mail download new messages as quickly as possible when it is started. If this entry is 0, Mail checks for new messages in the background (as is usually the case when the Mail application is being used). </P>
<P>Default: 0</P>
<P><B>NextOnMoveDelete     REG_SZ      </B><I>0 or 1</I> <I>or </I>–<I>1</I></P>
<P>If this entry is 1, Mail automatically opens the next message in a folder after you delete or move an open message. If set to –1, mail automatically opens the previous message. This facilitates quick scanning through the Inbox. If set to 0, Mail closes the Read Note window after you move or delete the message, and you must press Enter or double-click to open the next message. Use 1 for messages sorted in ascending order (in the order received) and –1 for messages sorted in descending order (most recent message first). </P>
<P>Default:  1</P>
<P><B>PollingInterval     REG_SZ      </B><I>minutes</I></P>
<P>Gives the default for the Check for New Mail Every <I>n</I> Minutes option in the Mail Options dialog box. The value the user enters in the dialog box is written to the user's mail message file (.MMF)—this value is used to define how often the Mail spooler checks for new mail messages. </P>
<P>Default: 10</P>
<P><B>PumpCycleInterval     REG_SZ      </B><I>seconds</I></P>
<P>Permits the spooler to check for new mail more often than once per minute, or to override the polling interval value defined in the user's mail message file. </P>
<P>Default: 60 seconds, or the number of minutes specified in the Mail Options dialog box </P>
<P><B>ScanAgainInterval     REG_SZ      </B><I>seconds</I></P>
<P>Affects the mail spooler latency checking to prevent spooler background processing from interfering unduly with foreground work. When the spooler defers work because of higher priority, interactive tasks, it rechecks the availability of the system at this interval. </P>
<P>Default: 2</P>
<P><B>SpoolerBackoffInterval     REG_SZ      </B><I>milliseconds</I></P>
<P>Specifies the amount of time the mail spooler waits before retrying an operation that has failed because of a transient mail server error condition, such as a locked file. </P>
<P>Default:  2000 (two seconds)</P>
<P><B>SpoolerReconnectInterval     REG_SZ      </B><I>seconds</I></P>
<P>Specifies the amount of time the mail spooler waits before retrying an operation that has failed because of a fatal mail server error condition, such as a lost network connection. </P>
<P>Default:  60 (one minute)</P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
