<H2>IP Object</H2><H3><A NAME="sec0"></A>Object: IP     Index: 546 <I>        Advanced</I></H3><P>The IP Object Type includes those counters that describe the rates that IP datagrams are received and sent by a certain computer using the IP protocol. It also describes various error counts for the IP protocol.</P>
<H3><A NAME="sec1"></A>Datagrams Forwarded/sec<I>     Advanced</I></H3><P>Datagrams Forwarded/sec is the rate of input datagrams for that this entity was not their final IP destination, as a result of which an attempt was made to find a route to forward them to that final destination. In entities that do not act as IP Gateways, this rate will include only those packets that were Source-Routed via this entity, and the Source-Route option processing was successful.</P>

<H3><A NAME="sec2"></A>Datagrams Outbound Discarded     <I>Advanced</I></H3><P>Datagrams Outbound Discarded is the number of output IP datagrams for which no problems were encountered to prevent their transmission to their destination, but which were discarded (for example, for lack of buffer space.) This counter would include datagrams counted in Datagrams Forwarded if any such packets met this (discretionary) discard criterion.</P>
<P>Index: 566     Default Scale: 1</P>
<P>Counter Type: PERF_COUNTER_RAWCOUNT     Counter Size: 4 bytes</P>
<H3><A NAME="sec3"></A>Datagrams Outbound No Route     <I>Advanced</I></H3><P>Datagrams Outbound No Route is the number of IP datagrams discarded because no route could be found to transmit them to their destination. This counter includes any packets counted in Datagrams Forwarded that meet this 'no route' criterion.</P>
<P>Index: 568     Default Scale: 1</P>
<P>Counter Type: PERF_COUNTER_RAWCOUNT     Counter Size: 4 bytes</P>
<H3><A NAME="sec4"></A>Datagrams Received Header Errors<I>     Advanced</I></H3><P>Datagrams Received Header Errors is the number of input datagrams discarded due to errors in their IP headers, including bad checksums, version number mismatch, other format errors, time-to-live exceeded, errors discovered in processing their IP options, and so on.</P>
<P>Index: 552     Default Scale: 1</P>
<P>Counter Type: PERF_COUNTER_RAWCOUNT     Counter Size: 4 bytes</P>
<H3><A NAME="sec5"></A>Datagrams Received Address Errors<I>     Advanced</I></H3><P>Datagrams Received Address Errors is the number of input datagrams discarded because the IP address in their IP header's destination field was not a valid address to be received at this entity. This count includes invalid addresses (for example, 0.0. 0.0) and addresses of unsupported Classes (for example, Class E). For entities that are not IP Gateways and therefore do not forward datagrams, this counter includes datagrams discarded because the destination address was not a local address.</P>

<P>Counter Type: PERF_COUNTER_COUNTER     Counter Size: 4 bytes</P>
<H3><A NAME="sec7"></A>Datagrams Received Discarded     <I>Advanced</I></H3><P>Datagrams Received Discarded is the number of input IP datagrams for which no problems were encountered to prevent their continued processing, but which were discarded (for example, for lack of buffer space). This counter does not include any datagrams discarded while awaiting re-assembly.</P>
<P>Index: 560     Default Scale: 1</P>
<P>Counter Type: PERF_COUNTER_RAWCOUNT     Counter Size: 4 bytes</P>
<H3><A NAME="sec8"></A>Datagrams Received Unknown Protocol     <I>Advanced</I></H3><P>Datagrams Received Unknown Protocol is the number of locally-addressed datagrams received successfully but discarded because of an unknown or unsupported protocol.</P>

<H3><A NAME="sec10"></A>Datagrams Sent/sec     <I>Advanced</I></H3><P>Datagrams Sent/sec is the rate that IP datagrams are supplied to IP for transmission by local IP user-protocols (including ICMP). That this counter does not include any datagrams counted in Datagrams Forwarded.</P>

<H3><A NAME="sec11"></A>Datagrams/sec<I>     Advanced</I></H3><P>Datagrams/sec is the rate that IP datagrams are received from or sent to the interfaces, including those in error. Any forwarded datagrams are not included in this rate.</P>

<P>Counter Type: PERF_COUNTER_COUNTER     Counter Size: 4 bytes</P>
<H3><A NAME="sec12"></A>Fragmentation Failures     <I>Advanced</I></H3><P>Fragmentation Failures is the number of IP datagrams that have been discarded because they needed to be fragmented at this entity but could not be, for example, because their 'Don't Fragment' flag was set.</P>
<P>Index: 578     Default Scale: 1</P>
<P>Counter Type: PERF_COUNTER_RAWCOUNT     Counter Size: 4 bytes</P>
<H3><A NAME="sec13"></A>Fragments Received/sec     <I>Advanced</I></H3><P>Fragments Received/sec is the rate that IP fragments that need to be re-assembled at this entity are received.</P>

<H3><A NAME="sec15"></A>Fragment Re-assembly Failures     <I>Advanced</I></H3><P>Fragment Re-assembly Failures is the number of failures detected by the IP re-assembly algorithm (for whatever reason: timed out, errors, and so on.). This is not necessarily a count of discarded IP fragments since some algorithms (notably RFC 815) can lose track of the number of fragments by combining them as they are received.</P>
