<h2><a name="progagentcontrol2zip_8"></a>Accessing Speech Support for Microsoft Agent</h2>
<p>
Although Microsoft Agent's services include support for speech recognition, a compatible speech engine must be installed to access Agent's speech recognition support. Your license for Microsoft Agent includes a license for the Microsoft Command and Control speech recognition engine when used as part of a Microsoft Agent client application.</p>
<p>
To support automatic downloading and installation of Microsoft Command and Control from an HTML page, include a separate &lt;OBJECT&gt; tag specifying the CLSID of the engine. In addition, include a CODEBASE parameter to specify the location of the installation file as well as the version number, as shown in the following example. For the current location and version number to use for autodownloading the Microsoft Command and Control speech engine, consult the information posted on the Microsoft Agent download site at <u>http://www.microsoft.com/workshop/prog/agent/agentdl.htm</u>. </p>
<pre><code>&lt;OBJECT
classid="clsid:161FA781-A52C-11d0-8D7C-00A0C9034A7E" 
CODEBASE = http://www.research.microsoft.com/research/srg/actcnc.exe#VERSION=3,0,0,1831
&gt;
&lt;/OBJECT&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>
The license for Microsoft Command and Control does not permit redistribution of the speech engine independently. For information on licensing the engine separately from Microsoft Agent, contact the Microsoft Speech Research group e-mail alias: voicebug@microsoft.com. The Microsoft Command and Control engine is currently available only for English language input; however, other speech recognition vendors supporting the Microsoft Speech API may provide support for other languages. If you use another speech engine, contact its vendor for compatibility, installation, and licensing information.</p>
<p>
Similarly, if you want to use Microsoft Agent's synthesized speech services, you must install a compatible text-to-speech (TTS) speech engine for your character's output. Your license for Microsoft Agent includes a license to use a special version of the Lernout &amp; Hauspie® TruVoice engine, but only when used with Microsoft Agent. </p>
<p>
To support automatic downloading and installation of this engine from an HTML page, include the engine's CLSID in the &lt;OBJECT&gt; tag. In addition, include a CODEBASE parameter to specify the location of the installation file as well as the version number, such as shown in the following example. For the current location and version number to use for autodownloading the Lernout &amp; Hauspie Text to Speech Engine for Microsoft Agent, consult the information posted on the Microsoft Agent download site at <u>http://www.microsoft.com/workshop/prog/agent/agentdl.htm</u>. </p>
<pre><code>&lt;OBJECT

CODEBASE = "http://activex.microsoft.com/controls/agent/cgram.exe#VERSION=1,5,0,0"
&gt;
&lt;/OBJECT&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>
This speech output engine supports only English language output. However, because Microsoft Agent uses the Microsoft Speech API, other languages may be available. If you want to use another compatible speech engine, contact its vendor for further information about their installation and licensing. Note that if you want to downloaded sound (.WAV) files for your character's voice output, you do not have to install a TTS engine.</p>
