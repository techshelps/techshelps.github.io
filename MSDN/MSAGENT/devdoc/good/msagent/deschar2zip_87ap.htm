<h2><a name="deschar2zip_11"></a>Suggested Animations</h2>

The following table lists the animations defined for the Microsoft Agent sample characters and can be used as a guide for designing your own characters. How you plan to use a character determines the names and number of animations you support for a character.</p>
<p>
An asterisk after an animation indicates a speaking animation that includes mouth overlay images for the last frame of the animation.</p>
