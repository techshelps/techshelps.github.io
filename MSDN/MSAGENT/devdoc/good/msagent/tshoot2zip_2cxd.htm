<h2><a name="tshoot2zip_11"></a>The character does not respond to voice commands that I used to train it.</h2>
<p>
Voice training does not teach the character new commands. It does help the speech engine better recognize your voice input. The only way to teach the character new commands is to define voice commands as part of your Web page (application). Consult <i>Programming the Microsoft Agent Control</i> for further information on how to do this.</p>
