<h2><a name="techfaq2zip_4"></a>Programming/Scripting Troubleshooting Information</h2>
<p>
When I use Microsoft Visual Basic (or other development tools) for scripting Microsoft Agent, I do not see all the properties and events used in your samples. How do I access them?</p>
<p>
When I try to host the Microsoft Agent control on the same page as a Java applet, it doesn't seem to work.</p>
<p>
The Map tag (or some other tag) doesn't seem to work.</p>
<p>
I seem to get RequestStart and RequestComplete events in my scripts even though I don't set any requests.</p>
<p>
I don't seem to get RequestStart and RequestComplete events in my script (or program).</p>
<p>
I am using the Microsoft Agent control with other ActiveX™ controls on my Web page and I don't seem to get any events.</p>
<p>
What programming languages can I use to program the Microsoft Agent control?</p>
<p>
Can I access the parameters returned from Microsoft Agent using JavaScript™ (JScript™)?</p>
<p>
Can Microsoft Agent be used with speech recognition or speech synthesis (text-to-speech, or TTS) engines other than those supplied by Microsoft?</p>
<p>
When I attempt to access the Lernout &amp; Hauspie TruVoice Text-To-Speech Engine modes from the Microsoft Speech SDK tools, I get a message indicating that a password is required.</p>
<p>
After calling the <b>MoveTo</b> method, my character seems to freeze even though I have <b>Return</b> animations assigned to <b>Moving</b> state animations.</p>
<p>
When running under Internet Explorer 4.0 Preview 1 or 2, events don't fire after Microsoft Agent has been running, or the character leaves behind parts of its animation.</p>
<p>
I cannot load a character when the URL includes a tilde (~) character.</p>
<p>
When I retry loading a character that failed to load, the call fails with a "Character already loaded" error. </p>
