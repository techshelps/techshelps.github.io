<h2><a name="deschar2zip_16"></a>The Showing and Hiding States</h2>
<p>
The <b>Showing</b> and <b>Hiding</b> states play the assigned animations when the user or the host application requests to show or hide the character. These states also appropriately set the character frame's <b>Visible</b> state. When defining animations for these states, keep in mind that a character can appear or depart at any screen location. Because the user can show or hide any character, always support at least one animation for these states.</p>
<p>
Animations that you assign to the <b>Showing</b> state typically end with a frame containing the character's neutral position image. Conversely, <b>Hiding</b> state animations typically begin with the neutral position. <b>Showing</b> and <b>Hiding</b> state animations can include an empty frame at the beginning or end, respectively, to provide a transition from the character's current state.</p>
