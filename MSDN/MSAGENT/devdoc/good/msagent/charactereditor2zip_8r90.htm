<h1><a name="charactereditor2zip_4"></a>Installing the Agent Character Editor</h1>
<p>
To install the Microsoft Agent Character Editor, open its self-extracting cabinet file. This will automatically install the appropriate files on your system. If you are downloading the Agent Character Editor from the Microsoft Web site, the downloading software gives you the option to save the file and open it or open it automatically as soon as the download completes. </p>
<p>
If you plan to use a TTS engine for your character's output, you need to install that engine before you begin creating your character. A special version of the Lernout &amp; Hauspie® TruVoice text-to-speech engine (American English language) can be downloaded from the Microsoft Agent Web site. You can use and distribute this engine as part of a Microsoft Agent application, subject to the conditions described in the End User Licensing Agreement that displays when you install the engine. If you plan to use another TTS engine, contact that vendor to confirm their support for Microsoft Agent and for information on their licensing provisions for use and redistribution.</p>
