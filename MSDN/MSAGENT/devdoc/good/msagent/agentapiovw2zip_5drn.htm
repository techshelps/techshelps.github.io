<p>
The Microsoft Agent API provides services that support the display and animation of animated characters. Implemented as an OLE Automation (Component Object Model [COM]) server, Microsoft Agent enables multiple applications, called <i>clients </i>or <i>client applications</i>, to host and access its animation, input, and output services at the same time. A client can be any application that supports the Microsoft Agent's COM interfaces.</p>
<p>
Although you can call Microsoft Agent's COM interfaces directly, Microsoft Agent also includes an ActiveX™ control. This control makes it easy to access Microsoft Agent's services from programming languages that support the ActiveX control interface. For information, see <i>Programming the Microsoft Agent Server Interface</i> and<i> Programming the Microsoft Agent Control</i>.</p>
<p>
As a COM server, Microsoft Agent starts up only when a client application requests to connect to it. It remains running until all clients close their connection. When no connected clients remain, Microsoft Agent automatically exits. Microsoft Agent also exits when a user explicitly chooses the Exit command on the pop-up menu of Microsoft Agent's taskbar icon and confirms exiting in the warning message box. This action causes the server to send a <b>Shutdown</b> event to all connected clients advising them that the server is exiting. </p>
