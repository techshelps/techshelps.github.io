<h2><a name="tshoot2zip_16"></a>The character doesn't produce any audio output when it speaks.</h2>
<p>
This symptom could have several causes. Try the following to isolate the problem:
<ul>
<li>
Verify that your speakers are plugged in and your sound card is compatible with Windows. It is a good idea to test them with another sound application to confirm that audio output is working properly.</li>
<li>
Verify that no other application is currently using the audio output device.</li>
<li>
Verify that the character you are using has been configured for spoken output. (You may need to check with the Web site or application supplier.)</li>
<li>
Verify that your Microsoft Agent settings are enabled for spoken output using the following procedure:</li>
</ul>
<p>
1.  Load a page scripted for Microsoft Agent. When the Microsoft Agent icon appears in the taskbar, right-click it and choose Microsoft Agent Properties from the pop-up menu. </p>
<p>
2.  When the property sheet displays, select the Output page. </p>
<p>
3.  Set the Play Spoken Output option and click OK.
<ul>
<li>
If the character uses a text-to-speech (TTS) engine to produce spoken output, verify that you have installed a compatible TTS engine. For example, when installed as an IE4 add-on component, only the core components of Microsoft Agent are installed.  The core components do not include the Lernout &amp;amp; Hauspie TruVoice Text-To-Speech engine. Without this TTS engine (or a Microsoft Speech API-compatible engine), Microsoft Agent sample characters will not produce spoken output.  The Lernout &amp;amp; Hauspie TruVoice TTS engine can be found at the Microsoft Agent download page at http://www.microsoft.com/workshop/prog/agent/agendl.htm#speech. </li>
<li>
Verify that Microsoft Agent's use of MIDI is not blocking the audio channel (see the next topic, "Applications that play MIDI have no audio output when Microsoft Agent is running").</li>
</ul>
