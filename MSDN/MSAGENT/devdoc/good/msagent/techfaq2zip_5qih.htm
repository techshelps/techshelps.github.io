This could be caused by one of the following problems:
<ul>
<li>
Your programming language doesn't support ActiveX™ controls. Check your documentation to ensure that it supports the ActiveX interface and events for ActiveX objects.</li>
<li>
On a scripted Web page, another control has failed to install or load. Check to ensure that all other controls are installed and loading properly without Microsoft Agent.</li>
<li>
On a scripted Web page with frames, you have the &amp;lt;OBJECT&amp;gt; tag for the Microsoft Agent control on one page, and the events scripted on another page. Events are sent only to the page that hosts the control.</li>
</ul>
