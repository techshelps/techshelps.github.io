<p>
A character's animations reflect its gender, age, personality, and behavior. The number and types of animations you create for a character depend on what your character does and how it responds to different situations. </p>
<p>
Like traditional animations, digital animations involve creating a series of slightly differing images that, when displayed sequentially, provide the illusion of action. Creating high-quality animation images may require a skilled animator, but the style and presentation of the character you create also affect quality. Two-dimensional characters with simple shapes and features can sometimes be as effective as (or more effective than) highly rendered characters. It is not necessary to create a realistic image to portray an effective character. Many popular cartoon characters are not realistic in their presentation, yet they are effective because the animator understands how to convey action and emotion. The Appendix provides general information about fundamental animation design principles.</p>
