<h2><a name="deschar2zip_19"></a>The Moving States</h2>
<p>
The <b>Moving</b> states play when an application calls the <b>MoveTo</b> method. The animation services determine which animation to play based on the character's current location and the specified coordinates. Movement direction is based on the character's position. Therefore, the animation you assign to the <b>MovingLeft</b> animation should be based on the character's left. If you don't use the <b>MoveTo</b> method, you can skip creating and assigning an animation.</p>
<p>
<b>Moving</b> state animations should animate the character into its moving position. The last frame of this animation is displayed as the character's frame is moved on the screen. There is no support for animating the character while its frame moves. </p>
