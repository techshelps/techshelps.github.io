<h2><a name="progagentcontrol2zip_69"></a>The Commands Collection Object</h2>
<p>
The Microsoft Agent server maintains a list of commands that are currently available to the user. This list includes commands that the server defines for general interaction (such as Hide and Microsoft Agent Properties), the list of available (but non-input-active) clients, and the commands defined by the current active client. The first two sets of commands are global commands; that is, they are available at any time, regardless of the input-active client. Client-defined commands are available only when that client is input-active. </p>
<p>
Each client application can define a collection of commands called the <b>Commands</b> collection. To add a command to the collection, use the <b>Add</b> or <b>Insert</b> method. Although you can specify a command's properties with separate statements, for optimum code performance, specify all of a command's properties in the <b>Add</b> or <b>Insert</b> method statement. For each command in the collection, you can determine whether user access to the command appears in the character's pop-up menu, in the Commands Window, in both, or in neither. For example, if you want a command to appear on the pop-up menu for the character, set the command's <b>Caption</b> and <b>Visible</b> properties. To display the command in the Commands Window, set the command's <b>Caption</b> and <b>Voice</b> properties. </p>
<p>
A user can access the individual commands in your <b>Commands</b> collection only when your client application is input-active. Therefore, you'll typically want to set the <b>Caption</b> and <b>Voice</b> properties for the <b>Commands</b> collection object as well as for the commands in the collection, which places an entry for your <b>Commands</b> collection in a character's pop-up menu and in the Commands Window. When the user switches to your client by choosing its entry, the server automatically makes your client input-active and makes the commands in its collection available. This enables the server to present and accept only the commands that apply to the current input-active client's context. It also serves to avoid command-name collisions between clients. </p>
<p>
When a character's pop-up menu displays, changes to the properties of a <b>Commands</b> collection or the commands in its collection do not appear until the user redisplays the menu. However, the Commands Window does display changes as they happen.</p>
