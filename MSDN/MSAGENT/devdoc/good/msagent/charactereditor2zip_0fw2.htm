<p>
To create a smooth transition from one animation to the next, design your animation sequences to begin and end with a neutral image. For more information, see Designing Characters for Microsoft Agent(http://www.microsoft.com/workshop/prog/agent/deschar.htm. However, this does not mean that every animation must end at the neutral position. You can animate a character through a sequence of frames, have it speak during the last frame, and create a separate, complementary animation that returns the character to the neutral position. This complementary animation is called a <b>Return</b> animation. Define a <b>Return</b> animation like any other animation. To assign the <b>Return</b> animation, select an animation in the tree, and select the <b>Return</b> animation you created from the <b>Return</b> Animation drop-down list on the Properties page.</p>
<p>
Creating and assigning a <b>Return</b> animation has an added benefit: When the server gets a request to play another animation, it will attempt to play the <b>Return</b> animation for the last animation it played, if a <b>Return</b> animation is assigned. This ensures a smooth transition. If an animation begins and ends at the neutral position, you don't need to define a <b>Return</b> animation. Similarly, if you intend to handle transitions from one animation to another yourself, you may not need to assign a <b>Return</b> animation.</p>
