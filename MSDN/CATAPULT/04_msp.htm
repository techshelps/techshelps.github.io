<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">Microsoft Proxy Server
provides: </font></p>

<ul>
    <li><p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica"><b>Extensive
        protocol support.</b> Microsoft Proxy Server is
        compatible with most Internet protocols and Windows
        Sockets-based applications. On your private network it
        supports both Internet Packet Exchange/Sequenced Packet
        Exchange (IPX/SPX) and Transport Control
        Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP). </font></p>
    </li>
    <li><p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica"><b>Security.</b>
        It prevents unauthorized external access to your private
        network, and eliminates the need to connect clients
        directly to the Internet. It provides user-level security
        and Windows&nbsp;NT Challenge/Response authentication.
        Data encryption is supported by means of Secure Sockets
        Layer (SSL) tunneling. </font></p>
    </li>
    <li><p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica"><b>Access
        control.</b> Access can be managed by user, service,
        port, and Internet domain, for both inbound and outbound
        connections. </font></p>
    </li>
    <li><p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica"><b>Ease
        of use.</b> Microsoft Proxy Server is easy to install,
        manage, and monitor. </font></p>

face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">Web Proxy Basics</font></a></h2>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica"><i>Proxy</i> is defined
in general terms as &#147;authority or power to act for
another.&#148; In the context of network computing, a <i>proxy
service</i> is a service provided by a computer that assumes
authority and power to act for computers to which it is
connected. Such a service is useful in situations that require
computers on networks that are not directly connected to each
other to exchange information. A proxy service allows information
exchange while maintaining security for individual computers. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">Proxy services are
particularly appropriate for today&#146;s environment, in which
the popularity and growth of the Internet has created a need for
corporations, organizations, and schools to allow Internet access
from client computers on their private network. At the same time,
these entities need to isolate their private network from the
Internet for a variety of reasons, including security, private
addressing, and transport incompatibility. A proxy service
reconciles these potentially incompatible needs. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">A proxy service runs on
a computer with at least two network adapter cards, one for each
network to which it is connected. Typically, this computer is the
only computer to which both networks are connected. The computer
running the proxy service thus serves as a <i>gateway computer</i>
between the two networks. Larger networks may have multiple
gateway computers, each running the proxy service. The following
figure shows a common scenario implemented using Microsoft Proxy
Server. The Web Proxy service provides a private network client
with access to the Internet. </font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica"><img
src="xag_f02.gif" width="449" height="70"> </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">With Microsoft Proxy
Server, if both networks are running Transmission Control
Protocol over Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) you should disable
routing by clearing the <b>Enable IP Routing</b> check box in the
Windows&nbsp;NT Server <b>TCP/IP Advanced Configuration</b>
dialog box. Disabling this feature means that there can be no
direct routing between the two networks: All information must
pass through the proxy service. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">The Web Proxy service
supports proxy requests from any browser that is compatible with
the standard CERN proxy protocol, such as Microsoft Internet
Explorer or Netscape Navigator. The browser can be on a computer
running any operating system platform, such as Windows,
Windows&nbsp;NT, Macintosh, or UNIX. The browsers must be
configured to use the proxy server, but the Web Proxy service
requires no client-side components (because all client support
needed for this standard protocol is built into most popular
browsers). </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">The Web Proxy service
includes such features as domain filtering, Internet resource
caching, and client authentication. The Secure Sockets Layer
(SSL) tunneling protocol is also supported. SSL Tunneling allows
a client to create a connection to a server through the proxy for
sending and receiving encrypted data that cannot be interpreted
by the proxy. This is used for SSL with the HTTPS protocol, and
the secure news protocol, SNEWS. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">The Web Proxy service
has built-in request logging that allows log records to be
written to a flat file or to a database by using Open Database
Connectivity (ODBC). This logging is separate from the logging
built into the WWW service of Internet Information Service (IIS)
and includes proxy-specific information. </font></p>

<h2><a href="#Top"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica"><img
src="up.gif" alt="To Top" align="middle" border="0" width="14"
height="11"></font></a><a name="1h2"><font size="2"
face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">Client Authentication</font></a></h2>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">Microsoft Proxy Server
can be configured to allow anonymous requests by users, or to
require users to be authenticated (validated) by the server. Once
users are authenticated, access control configuration determines
which protocols (Web, FTP, or Gopher) are accessible for each
user. Users can be granted access to selected protocols. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">Access control is
integrated into Windows&nbsp;NT security and administration. The
user accounts used for logon, or authentication, are created with
User Manager, the standard User Account administration tool. Each
Internet protocol (Web, FTP, Gopher) is represented within
Microsoft Proxy Server by an object on which Access Control
Entries (ACEs) can be applied, indicating which users have access
to the protocol, and which users do not. Assignment of Access
Control Entries is done in Internet Service Manager. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">A convenient way to
configure user-level access control is with Local Groups. With
User Manager, an administrator can create groups, and add user
accounts to these groups. Within Internet Service Manager, the
site would assign Access Control to each group, as appropriate.
For example, one group may have HTTP access only, and no FTP
access. When a user joins or leaves, no changes would be
necessary in Internet Service Manager; the user account can be
added or removed from a group by using User Manager. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">Microsoft Proxy Server
supports two forms of user authentication: HTTP Basic
authentication, and Windows&nbsp;NT Challenge/Response
authentication. When using Basic authentication, the user sends a
request by typing in a URL or clicking a hyperlink. The server
responds with an &#147;authentication failure&#148; message to
the client, and clients typically display a user name/password
dialog box in response. The user enters a valid user name and
password, and the browser reissues the same request, but this
time the header contains user information, which is used by the
server to authenticate the user. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">In order for basic
authentication to work with Microsoft Proxy Server, the browser
being used must support the new &#147;proxy-authenticate&#148;
HTTP header; Internet Explorer 3.0 supports this. Earlier
versions of Internet Explorer do not support this header, and
therefore do not support HTTP Basic Authentication through a
proxy. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">Basic authentication
does not encrypt your user name and password before transmission.
Basic authentication is encoded only by using UUencode, and can
be decoded easily by anyone with access to your network, or to a
segment of the Internet that transfers your packets. </font></p>

<hr>

<p><font color="#FF0000" size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica"><b>Warning</b></font><font
size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica"><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>If you
use Basic authentication, you will send your Windows&nbsp;NT user
name and password in clear text (unencrypted) over public
networks. Intruders could easily learn user names and passwords. </font></p>

<hr>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">Windows&nbsp;NT
Challenge/Response authentication uses the same secure mechanism
for Microsoft Proxy Server logon that is used by clients that log
on to a Windows&nbsp;NT-based computer. When this mechanism is
used, the user needs to be logged on to the client computer, with
a computer or domain user account that is valid on the computer
running Microsoft Proxy Server . When the user issues a request,
the Windows&nbsp;NT Challenge/Response protocol is used between
client and server. Windows&nbsp;NT Challenge/Response
authentication requires that the browser support the
&#147;proxy-authenticate&#148; HTTP header, as well as HTTP
Keep-Alives to a proxy, and NT Challenge/Response. Once a user is
authenticated, the user remains authenticated for the life of the
TCP connection (by use of the Keep-Alive mechanism). Internet
Explorer 3.0 supports these requirements; earlier versions of
Internet Explorer do not. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">The Microsoft
ActiveX&trade; Software Development Kit (SDK) includes
information for third parties on how to support the
Windows&nbsp;NT Challenge/Response protocol in Web browsers,
whether they directly connect to Web servers or use proxy
servers.</font></p>

<h2><a href="#Top"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica"><img
src="up.gif" alt="To Top" align="middle" border="0" width="14"
height="11"></font></a><a name="2h2"><font size="2"
face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">Domain Filtering</font></a></h2>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">Microsoft Proxy Server
offers the ability to control which Internet sites are accessible
to private network clients. The Web Proxy service can be
configured to grant access to all Internet sites except for the
ones specified, or it can be configured to deny access to all
Internet sites except for the ones specified. In either case, the
list of sites applies to all requests issued to the Web Proxy
service on that server. It is currently not possible to specify
domain filtering on a user-level basis, although different
Microsoft Proxy Servers on your network can offer access to
different sites and for different users. (Also, the open,
documented Internet Server API (ISAPI) provides an extensible
means for third parties to provide customized filtering.) </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">Each entry in the
grant/deny list can be an IP address, an IP subnet, or a domain
name. A domain name can be a computer name (such as
www.microsoft.com), or a domain name that represents multiple
computers (such as microsoft.com), in which case the entry
applies to all computers in the domain. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">If domain filtering is
enabled, the Proxy ISAPI application verifies that each WWW, FTP,
and Gopher request is directed to an Internet site to which
access is permitted, before issuing the request to the site. If
access is not permitted, an error message is returned to the
client. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">If the request
specifies a Domain Name System (DNS) site name, the site name is
resolved to an Internet Protocol (IP) address, and both the DNS
name and IP address are searched for in the domain filtering site
list. If a client request is received that specifies an IP
address rather than a DNS name, the IP address is searched for in
the domain filtering site list, and if at least one entry in the
site list contains a domain name, the request&#146;s IP address
is converted to a DNS name by doing a DNS reverse resolution, and
the domain name is searched for in the site list.</font></p>

height="11"></font></a><a name="3h2"><font size="2"
face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">Caching</font></a></h2>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">The Web Proxy service
uses caching to maintain local copies of Web objects. Subsequent
requests for these objects can be serviced from a local disk copy
rather than issuing the request over the Internet, which improves
user-perceived performance and reduces bandwidth consumption on
the site&#146;s Internet connection. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">The Web Proxy service
caching provides the following features: </font></p>

<ul>
    <li><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">Passive caching of
        appropriate Web objects served by HTTP. </font></li>
    <li><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">Active caching of
        HTTP-served objects by popularity. </font></li>
    <li><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">Sends expired
        cache objects when the originating server is unavailable.
        </font></li>
</ul>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">Passive caching uses
the cache to store all cacheable objects returned to Microsoft
Proxy Server by Internet servers. Many objects on the Web have
characteristics that make them difficult or impossible to cache
properly (for example, they might be dynamically generated, or
require authentication for access). For this reason, the caching
system only caches appropriate objects. Microsoft Proxy Server
calculates a Time-To-Live (TTL) for all objects in the cache.
When an object&#146;s TTL has expired, the next request for the
object is serviced on the Internet instead of the cache. For more
information about caching, see </font><a href="DD_msp.HTM#Top"><font
size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">Appendix D,
&#147;Architecture.&#148;</font></a><font size="2"
face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica"> </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">Active caching uses the
cache to proactively ensure the freshness and availability of
popular objects. In this mechanism, the cache manager creates its
own request for an object, without client prompting, when the TTL
has expired or is near expiration. Web objects are subject to
active caching on the basis of their popularity relative to their
rate of change. Additionally, the active caching algorithm
incorporates calculations of current server load in order to
process requests to the Internet at times of low usage. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">Returning expired
objects when an Internet site is unavailable maintains
potentially stale data in the cache. Expired objects can be used
to service client requests sent to a remote server when that
remote server is temporarily inaccessible. </font></p>

face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">WinSock Proxy Service Features</font></a></h1>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">Windows Sockets is a
mechanism for interprocess communication (IPC) between
applications running on the same computer, or on different
computers connected by a local area network (LAN) or wide area
network (WAN). Windows Sockets defines a set of standard APIs
that an application uses to communicate with one or more other
applications, usually across a network. Windows Sockets supports
initiating an outbound connection (for clients), accepting an
inbound connection (for servers), sending and receiving data on
those connections, and terminating the connection. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">WinSock Proxy is a
mechanism that makes a Windows Sockets-compatible application
running on a private network perform as if it were directly
connected to the Internet, when actually there is a gateway
computer connecting the two networks. The client application
calls Windows Sockets APIs to communicate with an application
running on an Internet computer. The WinSock Proxy components
redirect the necessary APIs to the gateway computer, thus
establishing a communication path from the internal application
to the Internet application through the gateway computer. This is
totally transparent to the two applications. </font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica"><img
src="xag_A03.gif" width="379" height="128"> </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">The WinSock Proxy
service provides the following features: </font></p>

<ul>
    <li><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">Supports TCP/IP
        and IPX/SPX on the private network. </font><p><font
        size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">WinSock Proxy supports
        communication over TCP/IP and IPX/SPX on the private
        network. However, only applications that are written to
        use Windows Sockets over TCP/IP (Internet applications)
        can be redirected. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">Because Winsock
        Proxy Supports communication on the private network by
        use of the IPX/SPX transport protocol, it allows access
        to Internet sites from Internet applications on IPX/SPX
        networks by using IPX/SPX communications between the
        client and Microsoft Proxy Server. It also allows access
        to internal Web sites from Web browsers on IPX/SPX
        networks by using IPX/SPX communications between the
        client and Microsoft Proxy Server, with Microsoft Proxy
        Server running on the same computer as the Web server. </font></p>
    </li>
    <li><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">Uses
        Windows&nbsp;NT Challenge/Response authentication between
        the client and the server. </font><p><font size="2"
        face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">No application support is needed.
        The WinSock Proxy service provides Windows&nbsp;NT
        Challenge/Response authentication (a secure, encrypted
        logon process) whether or not the client application
        supports it. You can use Windows&nbsp;NT
        Challenge/Response authentication between WinSock Proxy
        clients and the WinSock Proxy service to avoid sending
        passwords across the internal network. Once
        authentication is done, the WinSock Proxy service uses
        the logon user name to verify that the user has
        permission to do the network operations attempted by the
        application. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">Authentication
        for an application is done one time only, when the
        application first links to Windows Sockets. Use of the
        WinSock Proxy client dynamic-link library (DLL). This
        avoids the overhead of authentication on each network
        connection. Authentication is done between the WinSock
        Proxy service and the WinSock Proxy client DLL on the
        internal computer, regardless of whether the internal
        application will be initiating outbound connections to
        the Internet or receiving inbound connections from the
        Internet. This means that special support on external
        (Internet) computers is not needed. </font></p>

        number, protocol, and user or group. Each port can be
        enabled or disabled for communications by a specific list
        of users or user groups. The list of users allowed to
        initiate outbound connections on a port can be a
        different list than the list of users allowed to listen
        for inbound connections on the same port. Access for TCP
        protocols is controlled separately from User Datagram
        Protocol (UDP) protocols. </font></p>
