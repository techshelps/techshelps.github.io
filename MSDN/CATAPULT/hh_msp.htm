<hr>

<p>The server Setup and client Setup programs create log files
with information about the setup process. The Microsoft Proxy
Server setup log is created as a file named C:\Mpssetup.log on
the server computer. The client setup log is created as a file
named C:\Mpcsetup.log the client computer.</p>

<p>Customers calling their support provider for assistance should
have these log files available when calling. They contain
valuable information beyond any error messages that are displayed
to users.</p>

<p>The following is an alphabetized listing of messages that can
be returned from the server and client Setup programs of
Microsoft Proxy Server.</p>

<p><strong>Call to LoadString with ID </strong><em>number</em><strong>
failed.</strong></p>

<blockquote>
    <p>[Client Setup]</p>
    <p>An unexplained error in setup occurred.</p>
    <p>Consult with your technical support team or network
    administrator for further assistance. If you contact your
    support provider regarding this error, be sure to have the
    setup log file, typically C:\Mpssetup.log, available when you
    call, and reference the ID number displayed with this
    message.</p>
