face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">What is the Internet?</font></a></h1>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">The Internet can be
described as a worldwide network of computers connected together
and configured to share information. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">Originally, the
Internet started as a research project of the Advanced Research
Projects Agency (ARPA). The original intent of the ARPA network
was to create a means of connecting computers at its regionally
based research centers. To achieve this intent, ARPA funded new
work that included specifying standards for communications
between networked computers, as well as establishing conventions
for handling and routing network traffic. This work evolved into
the development of the TCP/IP protocol suite, a family of
standards for networking computers.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">As the original ARPA
network grew in scope, its membership and purpose grew as well.
The first ARPA network, created in 1969, was a small number of
leased telephone lines used to interconnect four ARPA sites.
Later designs included the addition of other research sites for
use by academic and military organizations, as well as by schools
and universities throughout the world. By the 1980s, the original
ARPA network term, &#147;ARPANet,&#148; no longer applied. As
network membership expanded considerably beyond the original ARPA
sites, the network became increasingly called &#147;the
Internet,&#148; to indicate an internetwork connecting government
agencies, and later private industries. Private industries are
the largest group of contributors to the current and recent
growth of the Internet.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">Today, the Internet is
continuing to grow rapidly. Because of its development through
public funding and the global participation of over 61 countries
worldwide, the Internet is not owned by any one business or
organization. Instead, it can be seen as the internetwork formed
by all the businesses and organizations that choose to link their
computers to a global public network. The Internet is now a
universal carrier of electronic mail, text files, multimedia
objects, and real-time audio. In the future, even more
information will be available in these and other formats. </font></p>

height="11"></font></a><a name="6h2"><font size="2"
face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">What is TCP/IP?</font></a></h1>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">TCP/IP refers to<em> </em>a
family of standards for connecting computers together to form
networks.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">The original ARPA
network design team saw the difficulty in implementing reliable
communications between computers that used different hardware and
software. Because of differences in vendor designs, a common set
of openly published standards was seen as the best solution to
resolving this problem. All vendors could then have access to the
standard specifications and new products could be designed to
operate for networked use in predictable ways. These standards
have come to be known collectively as TCP/IP.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">TCP/IP refers to all of
the established protocols approved and published by the Internet
Engineering Task Force (IETF) that support two basic protocols:</font></p>

<ul>
    <li><p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica"><strong>Transmission
        Control Protocol (TCP)</strong>. This is the main
        protocol that is used to handle connection-based service
        between networked computers. It specifies methods for
        reliable delivery of data between networked computers. </font></p>
    </li>
    <li><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica"><strong>Internet
        Protocol (IP)</strong>. This is the protocol that is used
        to move data through the network. It uses a standard
        addressing scheme of unique addresses to determine how
        data is routed through the network.</font></li>
</ul>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">In order to see how
TCP/IP works, it is useful to look at an example, such as how
TCP/IP supports e-mail service. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">For example, if some
information (such as an e-mail message) is composed and sent to
your computer as text-based data, this data is sent in chunks
called packets, which are fixed-length parcels of the data
contained within the message. These packets are then forwarded to
your computer by using its Internet Protocol (IP) address. An IP
address consists of four numbers between 0 and 255, separated by
periods. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">The use of TCP and IP
in this way, combined with other TCP/IP member protocol sets,
allows your computer to communicate with other computers on the
Internet. In the preceding example, the other member protocols
might include either the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) or
the Post Office Protocol (POP), which are specific standards
within TCP/IP for e-mail messaging services. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">Another method of
TCP/IP addressing beyond IP addressing is the Domain Name System
(DNS), which uses conventional names to identify computers and
services available on the network. Domain names, which are easier
to remember than IP addresses, are mapped to IP addresses. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">Domain names consist of
the following elements, separated by periods:</font></p>

<ul>
    <li><p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">A
        host name. The host name often indicates the protocol
        used by the Internet site, such as File Transfer Protocol
        (FTP). </font></p>
    </li>
    <li><p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">A
        subdomain name. The subdomain name is usually the name of
        the private organization that manages the site. These
        domain names are registered and administered through the
        Internet Network Information Center (InterNIC). </font></p>
    </li>
    <li><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">A top-level domain
        name. The top-level domain, which indicates the type of
        organization that hosts the Web site, is assigned by
        InterNIC. </font></li>
</ul>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">For example,
www.microsoft.com is the domain name for the Microsoft World Wide
Web site. The host name, www, indicates that it is a World Wide
Web site. The subdomain, .microsoft, is the name registered with
InterNIC by the owner of the site. In this case, the owner is the
Microsoft Corporation. The top-level domain, .com, indicates that
the Web site is operated by a commercial organization. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">Some common Internet
host names are: </font></p>

<ul>
    <li><p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica"><b>www&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>World
        Wide Web. A browser can download multimedia and HTML
        (Hypertext Markup Language) scripted pages from this
        site. </font></p>
    </li>
    <li><p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica"><b>ftp&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>File
        Transfer Protocol. This protocol indicates that an FTP
        application can download files from this site. </font></p>
    </li>
    <li><p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica"><b>gopher&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>Gopher.
        This protocol permits a browser to be used to view text
        documents and directory listings from this type of site. </font></p>
    </li>
    <li><p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica"><b>irc&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>Internet
        Relay Chat. This protocol supports interactive text chat
        between two or more users who are connected to the IRC
        site, sometimes called a &#147;chat room.&#148; </font></p>
    </li>
    <li><p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica"><b>ra&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>RealAudio.
        This protocol supports real-time (or
        &#147;streamed&#148;) continuous audio transmission from
        a connected site to a RealAudio client. </font></p>
    </li>
</ul>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">Some Internet top-level
domain names include: </font></p>

<ul>
    <li><p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica"><b>com&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>Commercial.
        Used by all businesses and individual subscribers who use
        a commercial Internet Service Provider (ISP). </font></p>
    </li>
    <li><p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica"><b>edu&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>Educational.
        Used by all public schools, colleges, and universities. </font></p>
    </li>
    <li><p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica"><b>org&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>Nonprofit
        organization. Used by nonprofit organizations only. </font></p>
    </li>
    <li><p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica"><b>mil&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>Military.
        Used by member agencies of the U.S. Department of Defense
        only. </font></p>
    </li>
    <li><p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica"><b>net&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>Network.
        A more recent addition to the list of top-level domains,
        possibly added because of growth in the commercial
        domain. This domain is reserved for ISPs providing
        large-scale access to the Internet backbone. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">The World Wide Web
(WWW, or simply &#147;the Web&#148;) is an Internet service based
on the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), a recent addition to
the TCP/IP protocol suite. HTTP delivers multimedia
objects&#151;text, sound, video, images, database access, and
interactive applications&#151;to your computer. These objects are
grouped together into pages using a scripting language called
Hypertext Markup Language (HTML). Each HTML page is also called a
&#147;Web page.&#148;</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">A Web page is viewed
with a browser. A browser is an application, such as Microsoft
Internet Explorer, that requests a page on the Web by using HTTP
and then displays the page on your screen. HTML pages are text
files that include special codes called tags. These tags control
text formatting, the placement of objects on the page, and
hyperlinks to other Web pages. Hyperlinks can be clicked on with
a pointing device, such as a mouse, to jump from one Web page to
another. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">The content for the Web
is created and maintained on computers that are configured to act
as Web sites. A Web site responds to requests from browsers and
returns HTML pages. Web sites are typically maintained by
organizations. Individuals sometimes run their own Web sites, or
they create HTML pages and copy them onto public sites. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">The content of the Web
is dynamic. It changes daily, or even hourly. The number of Web
sites and the scope and richness of content is growing
astronomically. The Web offers business information, online
shopping, and searchable databases. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">An intranet is<em> </em>another
name for a private network. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">A TCP/IP intranet is an
organization&#146;s internal network of computers based on the
Internet model. This internal network can be as small as a local
area network (LAN) that connects two PCs over a serial link, or
as large as a wide area network (WAN) that connects hundreds of
computers worldwide. An intranet can be thought of as any network
whose computers and network hardware are under the responsibility
of a single organization. Many organizations use intranets to
publish information for their network users. An intranet can be
connected to the Internet with a gateway, such as Microsoft Proxy
Server.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">Throughout this guide,
the term &#147;private network&#148; is used as a synonym for the
terms &#147;intranet,&#148; &#147;corporate network,&#148; and
&#147;internal network.&#148; </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">The main trunks of the
Internet, or &#147;backbones,&#148; are run by the major
telecommunications carriers. These carriers provide access to the
Internet through smaller companies called Internet Service
Providers (ISPs). Users can get access to the Internet through an
ISP to browse the World Wide Web, to download files, and to send
and receive e-mail. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">A proxy server is a
server configured to act on behalf of assigned clients. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">When a client
application makes a request for an object on the Internet, a
proxy server on the private network responds by translating the
request and passing it to the Internet. When a computer on the
Internet responds, the proxy server passes that response back to
the client application on the computer that made the request. The
proxy server is a gateway between the private network and the
Internet.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">A gateway is special
software, or a computer running special software, that enables
two different networks to communicate. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">A proxy server provides
a gateway between your private network to the Internet. You
configure a proxy server to enable your workstations to
communicate with remote services on the Internet. You select the
appropriate hardware for a gateway computer, adequate bandwidth
for the Internet connection, and choose the level of security for
protecting your private network. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">A client is a computer
that sends a request for data over a network to a server
computer. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">For example, when a
computer running Microsoft® Internet Explorer on an private
network makes a request to an Internet Information Server Web
site, this computer is acting as a client. In this example,
Internet Information Server responds by sending out HTTP objects
addressed to the private network. Microsoft Proxy Server then
receives these objects and passes them to the client computer
running Internet Explorer, which displays the objects in a Web
page. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">Here are a few examples
of Internet-based client software: </font></p>

<ul>
    <li><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">A Web browser

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">A server is software
that listens for requests and performs a service in response.
Microsoft Proxy Server listens to the computers on your private
network. When a client application makes a request, Microsoft
Proxy Server responds by translating the request and passing it
to the Internet. When a computer on the Internet responds,
Microsoft Proxy Server passes that response back to the client
application on the computer that made the request.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">Microsoft Proxy Server
supports all Internet protocols, including WWW (HTTP), FTP,
RealAudio (streaming audio), VDOLive (streaming video), IRC
(Internet Relay Chat), and mail and news protocols. Support for
Novell&#146;s IPX/SPX transport means that deployment of TCP/IP
on a private network is unnecessary. Internet sites can be
accessed by Web browsers running on any operating system, and by
all 16-bit and 32-bit Windows Sockets applications, with no
modifications to the applications. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">With Microsoft Proxy

        size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">You can use Microsoft
        Proxy Server to establish access for all of your private
        network clients quickly and easily. Clients can be set up
        for proxy access in minutes. In some cases, Microsoft
        Proxy Server can also eliminate the need to install and
        support additional protocol drivers for each
        client&#146;s desktop. </font></p>
