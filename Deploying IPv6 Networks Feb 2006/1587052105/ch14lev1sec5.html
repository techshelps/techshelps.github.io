<h3 class="docSection1Title">Operating and Troubleshooting the Network</H3>
<p class="docText">Now that all services are in effect operational at this point, it is time to take a look at the new RTPCom network through the eyes of those who will operate it. In truth, deploying the new services is rather easy; managing them is a different story. Then there is the important aspect of securing the infrastructure. New protocols and new services open new doors to possible attacks. These attacks could endanger both IPv4 and IPv6 infrastructures.</P>
<a name="ch14lev2sec10"></a>
<h4 class="docSection2Title">Securing the IPv6 Network</H4>
<p class="docText">Until its expansion into IPv6 under the design presented so far, RTPCom was relatively protected from security threats. In the case of IPv4 service, RTPCom is not concerned at all with the customer traffic at layer 3, it is all encapsulated in PPP and L2TP. RTPCom has <a name="iddle1857"></a><a name="iddle1981"></a>minimal provisioning responsibilities and user protection against attacks, if any is provided by the ISPs. In this context, RTPCom's infrastructure is not exposed to outside traffic and attacks.</p>
<p class="docText">The IPv6 service deployment changes completely the service model and with that it changes the security challenges. RTPCom is now switching the customer traffic at layer 3 throughout its network. This mode of operation exposes its infrastructure to attacks from the Internet as well as attacks sourced by its own customers. RTPCom is now responsible for customer provisioning and also for protecting him to a certain extent. The additional services, such as multicast, open the door to multiple types of threats. In this case, RTPCom has to implement a consistent and complete set of security policies that protects the IPv6 services as well as the IPv4 ones.</p>
<p class="docText">RTPCom's main concern is to secure its infrastructure. It will secure its access layer from attacks originated by its customers and it will secure its Edge from attacks originated by Internet hosts. Another area of concern is the data center in each L1 POP. It contains resources that are vital to the proper operation of various services and their management.</P>
<a name="ch14lev3sec18"></a>
<H5 class="docSection3Title">Securing the Access</H5>
<p class="docText">RTPCom identified the following security concerns at the access layer:</p>
<ul><li><p class="docList">Attacks on its infrastructure (prefixes 2600:A000::/28 and 2600:A080::/28), attempts to access or impair network elements</P></li><li><p class="docList">Spoofing attacks sourced by its customers using spoofed source addresses</P></LI><li><p class="docList">Link-local multicast attacks that would flood access routers with control traffic</p></li><li><p class="docList">Multicast attacks where RTPCom's multicast enabled network is flooded with traffic sourced by its own customers</P></li></ul>
<p class="docText">The important thing to remember is that in RTPCom's case, IPv4 facilitates IPv6 attacks sourced through its customers. IPv6 over IPv4 tunnels set up through the IPv4 service are invisible to RTPCom. Such tunnels can prove to be back doors to its IPv6 service for external hackers.</P>
<p class="docText">These four threats are addressed through the following policies and their respective implementations:</p>
<UL><li><p class="docList">Block all traffic destined to prefixes 2600:A000::/28 and 2600:A080::/28. This requirement was already built in to the two service ACLs used to implement unicast and Internet connectivity: Basic-Service and Internet-Service.</p></li><li><p class="docList">To prevent spoofing attacks RTPCom enables uRPF on all customer facing interfaces (or subinterfaces) as shown in <a class="docLink" href="ch09.html#ch09">Chapter 9</a>, &quot;Securing IPv6 Networks.&quot;</p></li><li><p class="docList">The link-local multicast is important to the proper operation of IPv6, so it cannot just be filtered out. A user could impair the access router by bombarding it with Router Solicitations, for example. The router can be protected by policing the link-local multicast traffic down to reasonable values.</p></li><li><p class="docList">RTPCom is under no obligation to allow its customers to become sources of multicast traffic or to transport their multicast traffic for that matter. RTPCom could filter out customer traffic with multicast destinations. The ACL might turn out to be rather complex as it will have to permit link-local multicast as well as some of the well known control-plane multicast groups. A simpler way would be to disable PIM on all customer interfaces. The later approach does rely on the assumption that the CPE router does not need to use PIM to provide multicast service to hosts behind it. This is a reasonable assumption for the time being. Considering the limited resources of such devices, it is expected that they will more likely implement MLD proxy routing rather than PIM.</p></li></ul>
<p class="docText">The implementation of these policies is shown in the configuration of NY-10-12-16 in <a class="docLink" href="#ch14ex13">Example 14-13</a>.</p>

<p class="docText"><a name="iddle1860"></a><a name="iddle1861"></a><a name="iddle1982"></a><a name="iddle1983"></a>RTPCom's operations team is also concerned with attack vectors enabled by IPv6's extension headers. Routing headers are a particular concern. They intend to filter out packets with Type 0 (Source Route) routing header while the Type 2 (MIPv6) RH are allowed for Mobile IPv6 service. This security policy is implemented by adding the following line under all security ACLs defined:</p>
<div class="docText"><pre><span class="docEmphMark">deny ipv6 any any routing-type 0</span></pre></div><BR>
<p class="docText">RTPCom decided to delay defining policies that address the other extension header threats until those threats are better understood.</p>

<a name="ch14lev3sec19"></a>
<h5 class="docSection3Title">Securing the Edge</H5>
<p class="docText">At the network edge, RTPCom peers with various ISPs. In their case, link-local attacks are less likely, even though they still are possible. On the other hand, attacks in a global scope are significant because of the exposure to the Internet. RTPCom identified the following threats in this part of its network:</P>
<UL><li><p class="docList">Attacks on its infrastructure network elements</p></li><LI><p class="docList">Multicast traffic flooding</p></li><LI><p class="docList">Link-local attacks in a smaller measure</P></li></ul>
<p class="docText">These threats were already addressed while implementing various IPv6 services, so it is just a matter of adding the following final touches:</p>
<ul><LI><p class="docList">While implementing the IPv6 Internet access service, RTPCom specifically blocked the infrastructure prefixes from being advertised outside its network. This policy will also be supported with inbound ACLs that will specifically block traffic destined to these prefixes.</p></li><LI><p class="docList">Considering the service model for its multicast service, RTPCom was able to safely disable it on the routers that provide access to the outside world. RTPCom can complement this measure with explicit filters applied inbound to its edge router interfaces.</p></LI><li><p class="docList">Despite being less likely, link-local attacks are still possible if the network of its institutional partner with whom it is sharing the link was compromised. As a measure of precaution, RTPCom can apply the policing methods used at the access layer.</p></li></ul>
<p class="docText">The practical implementation of these policies is straightforward based on the examples already given for the access layer.</p>

<a name="ch14lev3sec20"></a>
<h5 class="docSection3Title">Securing the Data Center</h5>
<p class="docText">A third area of security concern in RTPCom's network is the data center that hosts resources critical to its service offering. A first level of defense is provided by the perimeter <a name="iddle1742"></a><a name="iddle1980"></a>security policies implemented at the access and edge layers. On the other hand, these resources require specific protection beyond layer 3, too.</p>
<p class="docText">To prevent attacks on the data center servers, RTPCom leverages PIX Firewalls upgraded to release 7.0 for IPv6 support. It also deploys the standard host protection policies on each of the servers. For more details on these mechanisms, see <a class="docLink" href="ch09.html#ch09">Chapter 9</a> of this book.</p>
<p class="docText">The multicast servers require particular attention because they can be accessed by the content providers. This is done over dedicated circuits to an access router connecting to server interfaces different than the ones used to transmit the multicast traffic. RTPCom has to treat the server as an unsecured resource. For this reason it will have to control the unicast traffic it receives from the servers. The same ACLs used at the access layer can be applied in this case.</p>
<p class="docText">RTPCom will have to continuously update its security policies based on the experiences learned operating IPv6. The dynamic character of these policies is also driven by the evolution of the existent IPv6 services and the emergence of new ones with their own security threats.</p>


<a name="ch14lev2sec11"></a>
<h4 class="docSection2Title">Managing the Network</h4>
<p class="docText">Because most of the network elements are dual stack, RTPCom will continue to manage its network mostly over IPv4. The CiscoWorks NMS currently in use is upgraded to the latest release to leverage its IPv6 capabilities. NetFlow will be particularly used to monitor the traffic while Cisco IP SLA will be used for performance management. NetFlow captured data is sent to the collectors located in the data centers over IPv4. For topology mapping and IPv6 connectivity, the NOC team is testing Nagios. See <a class="docLink" href="ch10.html#ch10">Chapter 10</a>, &quot;IPv6 Network Management,&quot; for details on all these tools and their use.</p>

<a name="ch14lev2sec12"></a>
<h4 class="docSection2Title">Troubleshooting</H4>
<p class="docText">After running the IPv4 for several years, RTPCom's network operations team defined clear processes for troubleshooting and resolving most common problems. IPv6's characteristics and the design of the services deployed require new troubleshooting methodologies that are significantly different from the ones used for the IPv4 services.</p>
<a name="ch14lev3sec21"></a>
<h5 class="docSection3Title">Provisioning</h5>
<p class="docText">One of the rather new aspects of the IPv6 services is RTPCom's responsibility for customer provisioning. After a customer's line was configured based on the services it subscribed to and the physical interface is verified to be up, the first step in gaining access is to acquire the prefixes assigned. The investigation of the proper completion of this step should be at the top of the list when troubleshooting customer connectivity.</P>
<p class="docText">For customers that are assigned /64 prefixes, the operator can use the following troubleshooting steps:</p>
<a name="ch14pro01"></a><ul class="doclist" start=""><LI>Verify the ND cache to see whether link-local control messages are exchanged with a subscriber's host. For NY-10-12-16 on the ATM1/0.10 interface where the customer is using stateless autoconfiguration:<BR><br>

<p class="docText">Debugs are useful tools in troubleshooting the dynamic aspects of problems. However, they should be used with care because of their impact on the network equipment resources. Other tools, such as sniffers, can prove useful in providing the answer to what exactly is happening on a link.</P>
