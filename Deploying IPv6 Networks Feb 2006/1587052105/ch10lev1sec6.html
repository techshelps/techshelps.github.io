<p class="docText">Configuration and provisioning management are key network-management functions to control network operation.</P>
<p class="docText">Configuration management handles hardware and software changes, provides inventory of equipment and programs, and manages configuration deltas. Besides integrated platforms (CiscoWorks, for instance, includes Resource Manager Essentials with a set of applications to perform function such as inventory, configuration management, and software), RANCID has become a major player in this arena.</p>
<p class="docText">Really Awesome New Cisco confIg Differ (RANCID) is a configuration archival management tool for Cisco routers and switches, as well as equipment from other vendors. RANCID monitors a router's configuration, including software and hardware (cards, serial numbers, and so on). It works by periodically connecting to the router (using Telnet, SSH, or rlogin) and recording the configuration. Any differences are flagged using diff and e-mailed to the operator and saved in Concurrent Versions System (CVS).</P>
<p class="docText">Cisco Resource Manager Essentials (RME) is part of CiscoWorks, reviewed in the section &quot;<a class="docLink" href="ch10lev1sec7.html#ch10lev1sec7">Management Platforms</a>.&quot; It provides a GUI for managing the configuration and inventory. It includes a configuration viewer with IPv6 support (both IPv6 addresses and commands), facility to compare archive versions of the configuration (with IPv6 address and commands), and facility to set up configuration templates (which accept IPv6 addresses). An example of an RME screen capture is shown in the section &quot;<a class="docLink" href="ch10lev1sec7.html#ch10lev2sec13">CiscoWorks</a>.&quot;</p>
<p class="docText">Network provisioning is the operation where network resources are allocated to nodes (or clients) to enable them to access the network services. As far as IPv6 is concerned, address provisioning is one important aspect to look at. As reviewed in the section &quot;<a class="docLink" href="ch10lev1sec1.html#ch10lev2sec1">Allocating IPv6 Addresses to Managed Nodes</a>,&quot; several methods can be used to allocate IPv6 addresses to nodes, and stateful DHCP is one that provides centralized address provisioning. Cisco Network Registrar (CNR) is a DNS and DHCP server product that supports IPv6 addressing for DHCP (starting at version 6.2). It includes capability for the following:</p>
<UL><LI><p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Stateless autoconfiguration (RFC 3736)</span> The DHCPv6 server does not assign addresses, but instead provides configuration parameters, such as DNS server data, to clients.</P></li><li><p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Stateful autoconfiguration (RFC 3315)</span> The DHCPv6 server assigns (nontemporary or temporary) addresses and provides configuration parameters to clients.</p></LI><li><p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Prefix delegation (RFC 3633)</span> The DHCPv6 server does prefix delegation to clients (routers).</p></LI></UL>
