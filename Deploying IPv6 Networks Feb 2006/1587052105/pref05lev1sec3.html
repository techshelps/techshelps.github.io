<H3 class="docSection1Title">How This Book Is Organized</h3>
<p class="docText">Although each chapter of this book can be used independently to learn a certain aspect of IPv6, the book's structure has a clear didactic dimension. It intends to build the knowledge layer by layer, or IP service by IP service, and in closing to offer a set of exercises in the form of case studies.</p>
<p class="docText"><a class="docLink" href="part01.html#part01">Part I</a> provides the technology tools needed to approach the design and deployment of an IPv6 network. The knowledge is grouped around IP services, each mapped to a chapter. It starts with enabling unicast connectivity, the foundation of any network, and follows with QoS, multicast, VPNs, IP mobility, security, and network management. The second part of the book, ushered in by a discussion of deployment planning, covers three complete case studies that map to three distinct environments: MPLS-based service provider, IP-based service provider, and enterprise.</p>
<p class="docText"><a class="docLink" href="ch01.html#ch01">Chapters 1</a> through <a class="docLink" href="ch15.html#ch15">15</a> cover the following topics:</p>

<h4 class="docSection2Title">Part I</h4>
<ul><li><p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong"><a class="docLink" href="ch01.html#ch01">Chapter 1</a>, &quot;The Case for IPv6An Updated Perspective&quot;</span> This chapter builds the case for IPv6 from a technical perspective. It summarizes the differences between IPv4 and IPv6, and in the process of drawing a parallel between the two versions of IP, this chapter reviews the major concepts and challenges that people manage in their current network. Thus, it provides a framework for the IPv6 discussion in the rest of the book.</p></li><li><p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong"><a class="docLink" href="ch02.html#ch02">Chapter 2</a>, &quot;An IPv6 Refresher&quot;</span> This chapter discusses the fundamentals of IPv6 and some of the areas that saw significant changes from IPv4. It covers the new addressing architecture, the new header format and structure, the enhanced functions of ICMP, and the layer 2 address-resolution mechanisms. These are concepts fundamental to understanding any IPv6-related topic. For this reason, they are presented in detail here.</p></LI><li><p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong"><a class="docLink" href="ch03.html#ch03">Chapter 3</a>, &quot;Delivering IPv6 Unicast Services&quot;</span> This chapter discusses the elements necessary for establishing unicast IPv6 connectivity, the foundation of all other IPv6 services. It covers the relevant protocols at the access, edge, and core of the network. The mechanisms enabling the transition from IPv4 to IPv6 are discussed along with recommendations on what IPv6 deployment approach to follow in relation to the existent IPv4 infrastructure that will have to host the deployment.</p></LI><LI><p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong"><a class="docLink" href="ch04.html#ch04">Chapter 4</a>, &quot;IPv6 Routing Protocols&quot;</span> This chapter covers the routing protocols available in IPv6. It parallels their implementation and operation to their IPv4 counterparts.</p></li><li><p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong"><a class="docLink" href="ch05.html#ch05">Chapter 5</a>, &quot;Implementing QoS&quot;</span> This chapter reviews, from the perspective of IPv6, the concepts relevant to implementing quality of service in IP- and MPLS-based networks. It also discusses deployment considerations relevant to the coexistence of IPv4 and IPv6.</p></LI><li><p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong"><a class="docLink" href="ch06.html#ch06">Chapter 6</a>, &quot;Providing IPv6 Multicast Services&quot;</span> This chapter reviews the IP multicast concepts and protocols. It draws a parallel between IPv4 and IPv6 features, it explains the new mechanisms available in IPv6, and it provides examples that capture the various deployment options. Multicast deployment in conjunction with the various transition mechanisms is also discussed.</p></li><li><p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong"><a class="docLink" href="ch07.html#ch07">Chapter 7</a>, &quot;VPN IPv6 Architecture and Services&quot;</span> This chapter covers the topic of deploying VPN services in an IPv6 network. It reviews the VPN-related concepts and the deployment models. In closing, the chapter shows several topology examples with relevant configuration examples.</P></LI><LI><p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong"><a class="docLink" href="ch08.html#ch08">Chapter 8</a>, &quot;Advanced ServicesIPv6 Mobility&quot;</span> This chapter covers the concepts of IP mobility and their implementation in IPv6. It discusses the improvements made, the remaining open issues, and various examples of applying the protocol to novel services.</p></li><li><p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong"><a class="docLink" href="ch09.html#ch09">Chapter 9</a>, &quot;Securing IPv6 Networks&quot;</span> This chapter starts with an analysis of the security threats faced by IPv6, the ones specific to the new protocol, and the ones shared with IPv4. The dual perspective is critical because the coexistence of the two protocols can provide new attack vectors on the IPv6-enabled network. The chapter also presents the tools and best practices available to secure IPv6 networks.</p></li><li><p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong"><a class="docLink" href="ch10.html#ch10">Chapter 10</a>, &quot;Managing IPv6 Networks&quot;</span> This chapter discusses the challenges faced in managing IPv6 networks; some challenges are rooted in the protocol specifics, whereas others stem from the availability of tools. It covers the applications and management systems that can be leveraged today to operate IPv6 infrastructures and services.</p></li><li><p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong"><a class="docLink" href="ch11.html#ch11">Chapter 11</a>, &quot;<a class="docLink" href="ch11.html#ch11">Network Performance Consideration: Coexistence of IPv4 and IPv6</a>&quot;</span> This chapter provides relevant answers to the natural concern about the impact that IPv6 services will have on existing, revenue-generating IPv4 services and infrastructures. It provides guidelines on how to evaluate the IPv6 performance of network elements, and reviews the areas where the coexistence of the two protocols could lead to resource contention.</p></li></ul>

It provides guidelines on estimating the cost of deployment. It also provides references to resources relevant to planning the deployment, such as getting IPv6 address space. The chapter also discusses the important aspect of education and training.</P></LI><LI><p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong"><a class="docLink" href="ch13.html#ch13">Chapter 13</a>, &quot;Deploying IPv6 in an MPLS Service Provider Network&quot;</span> This chapter covers the planning, designing, and deployment of IPv6 in an MPLS service provider network. Internet access and VPN services are rolled out in stages, and configuration examples are provided for each one of them. The chapter closes with examples on troubleshooting the IPv6 network and the services supported.</p></li><li><p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong"><a class="docLink" href="ch14.html#ch14">Chapter 14</a>, &quot;Deploying IPv6 in an IP Service Provider Network&quot;</span> This chapter covers the planning, designing, and deployment of IPv6 in an IP service provider network. The ensuing infrastructure is dual stack, end to end. The various services are built in stages, and configuration examples are provided for each one of them.
