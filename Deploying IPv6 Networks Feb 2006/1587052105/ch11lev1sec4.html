<p class="docText">For the time being, the IPv6 networks are small compared with IPv4, and the IPv6 traffic most likely represents a fraction of the existent IPv4 traffic. For these reasons, operators would tend to look at IPv6 performance in terms of its impact on the revenue-generating IPv4 services. As focus moves toward large-scale deployments, router IPv6 performance becomes an important factor in network planning and design.</P>
<p class="docText">This chapter underlines the relevant aspects of router performance while showing the importance of keeping in balance all the other factors relevant in router selection, such as feature richness and cost. It also discusses the impact of IPv6 protocol specificities on router performance. The chapter provides guidelines on practical and objective evaluation methodologies of router IPv6 performance. From a practical perspective, this information can be summarized in a checklist of major items to be verified when evaluating a router's IPv6 performance. <a class="docLink" href="#ch11table08">Table 11-8</a> shows this list.</p>

<p class="docText">This chapter is also making the point that today's routers and layer 3 switches are ready to support large-scale, high-performance IPv6 networks. They deliver line-rate forwarding of IPv6 traffic in the range of packet sizes relevant for most applications. The data presented supports this statement in the case of platforms of various designs that address the entire market spectrum. IPv6 router performance meets the high standards set by IPv4.</p>
