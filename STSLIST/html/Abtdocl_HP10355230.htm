<ul><li>You can add and upload documents to the library the same way you add and upload documents in All Documents view or in any other Standard view.

</li><li>If the view’s folder setting is set to <b class="ui">Show documents inside folders</b>, you can add new folders, and navigate to different folders in the library.

</li><li>You can open, edit, and check in or check out a document. 

</li><li>You can delete documents and folders in Datasheet view. When you delete a folder, the contents of the folder, including subfolders, are deleted from the library.

</li><li>You can add columns, or delete and modify a column that you or another user added to the view. You can also enter and edit data stored in such columns in rows that contain documents. Rows corresponding to folders cannot be edited. Note that columns such as Type and Modified By are read-only. You cannot modify or delete them, nor can you enter or edit the contents of such columns.

</li><li>You can show or hide the Total row.

</li><li>You can sort and filter the library based on different columns, including the Type column. 

</li><li>Datasheet view does not display the star (*) row for a document library. 

</li><li>You cannot enter a value in the Name column either by dragging the fill handle, or by selecting a value from the cell’s drop-down list.
