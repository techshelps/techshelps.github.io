When you
		move a selection, the selection is removed from the list and is moved to the
		Clipboard. When you copy a selection, the selection remains in the list, and a
		copy is placed in the Clipboard. Pasting the contents of the Clipboard transfers it to the destination. </p><p><a href="#1">Moving or copying parts of a list</a></p><p><a href="#2">Pasting contents of the Clipboard into a

		  blank or are read-only, the move operation will fail. Columns with the
		  following data types cannot be left blank, so they are not cleared as a result
		  of a move operation: Checkbox
		  and Calculated. </p><p>The following table lists the contents of the Clipboard following a
		  move or copy operation.</p><table>
					<tr><th>Move or copy...</th><th>Contents of the clipboard</th>
					</tr>
					<tr><td>Data or one or more cells (selection does not include entire
				rows or a column)</td><td>Cell contents are cleared or copied and placed in the
				Clipboard.</td>
					</tr>
					<tr><td>One or more rows</td><td>Selected rows will be deleted or copied
				and placed in the Clipboard.</td>
					</tr>
					<tr><td>A column (can only be copied, cannot be
				moved)</td><td>Selection will be placed in the Clipboard.</td>
					</tr>
					<tr><td>Total row</td><td>If moving, expression for the cells in the
				Total row is set to None. The Total row is not affected by a copy operation. 
				<p>Aggregate values are placed in the Clipboard.</p></td>
					</tr>

		list</h2><p>When you paste the contents of the Clipboard, new rows
		will be added to the bottom of the Datasheet view  if necessary. However, if the view does not have
		sufficient columns, the paste operation will fail. A paste
		operation will also fail in the following situations: 
		</p><ul>
					<li>Some or all of the destination cells are read-only </li>
					<li>Pasting the contents into the selected cells will make them fail
			 the validation rules </li>
					<li>Attempting to paste data that does not match the data type of the
			 destination cells </li><li>Attempting to paste data into a calculated column</li>
				</ul><p>When you attempt to paste data of one type into a column of
		  a different type, the list will try to convert the source data to match the type
		  of the destination column. For example, if the source data is numeric, and the
		  destination cells support text, source data will be converted to text and then
		  placed in the destination cells. If the source data cannot be converted to
		  match the destination cell type, the paste operation will fail. </p><p>The following table lists the result of different paste

				cell becomes the top left cell of the destination range.</td>
