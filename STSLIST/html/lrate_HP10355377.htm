Typically, pmt includes principal and interest but no other fees or taxes. If pmt is omitted, you must include the fv argument.</p><p><b class="runinhead">Pv</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; is the present value â€” the total amount that a series of future payments is worth now.</p><p><b class="runinhead">Fv</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; is the future value, or a cash balance you want to attain after the last payment is made. If fv is omitted, it is assumed to be 0 (the future value of a loan, for example, is 0).</p><p><b class="runinhead">Type</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; is the number 0 or 1 and indicates when payments are due.</p><table>

If you make monthly payments on a four-year loan at 12 percent annual interest, use 12%/12 for guess and 4*12 for nper. If you make annual payments on the same loan, use 12% for guess and 4 for nper.</p><p><b class="bterm">Example</b></p><table>
