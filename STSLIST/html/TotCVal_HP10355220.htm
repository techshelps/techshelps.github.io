You can
		display aggregate values, such as sum and average, for a column in the list.
		You can add calculated columns that use a formula to calculate values for
		each row in the list. You can also use formulas when specifying a default value for a column.</p><p>The following illustration shows the Employee-Payroll list in Access Web Datasheet. The list
		displays the aggregate values in the Total row at the bottom of the list, and a
		calculated column titled 
		Net Pay. </p><p><img border="0" src="../img/lstCalc3_ZA10100379.gif" alt="Datasheet with a calculation and totals"></p><p>The Total row displays a count of the rows in the Person column and the
		sum of values in the Net Pay column. The Net Pay column uses the formula that
		is displayed in the ScreenTip to calculate values for each row.</p><p><a href="#1">About displaying aggregate values</a></p><p><a href="#2">About displaying calculated values in a
		column</a></p><p><a href="#3">About using a formula to calculate default values for a column</a></p><a id="1" name="1"></a><h2 id="">About displaying aggregate values</h2><p>In Datasheet View, you can show and hide the Total row by clicking <b class="ui">Show Totals</b> in the 
			 <b class="ui">List</b> tab of the ribbon. Initially, the Total row displays the sum for each numeric column in the list. If
			 the list does not have any numeric columns, it displays a count of the items in
			 the last column of the list. You cannot edit the values displayed in the Total
			 row. </p><p>After enabling the Total row, you can show or hide the aggregate
			 values for a specific column. You can also change the aggregate function that
			 is used by a column by simply selecting a different function from the drop-down
			 list in the Total row. The ScreenTip that appears when you hover your mouse pointer over an
			 aggregate value specifies the aggregate function that is used by the
			 column.</p><p>You cannot filter data in a list based on aggregate values.
			 However, if a list is filtered, the aggregate values are calculated based only
			 on the items that are included in the return set. The Total row does not get sorted along with the other rows in the list.</p><p>The following table lists the aggregate functions that are supported in a list, and the data types that support each function.</p><table>
						<tr><th>Function name</th><th>Description</th><th>Data types that
				  support function</th>
						</tr>
						<tr><td>Average</td><td>Returns the average of the values in the
				  column being aggregated.</td><td>Number, Currency, DateTime</td></tr><tr><td>Count</td><td>Tallies the number of values. For Boolean,
				  Attachment, and DocIcon columns, only Yes values are included.</td><td>
				  Number, Currency, DateTime, Boolean, Attachment, DocIcon, ShortText,
				  MultiLineText, SingleChoice, MultiChoice, Lookup, Hyperlink</td>
						</tr>
						<tr><td>Maximum</td><td>Returns the largest value in the column being
				  aggregated.</td><td>Number, Currency, DateTime</td>
						</tr>
						
						<tr><td>Minimum</td><td>Returns the smallest value in the column being
				  aggregated.</td><td>Number, Currency, DateTime</td>
						</tr>
						<tr><td>Sum</td><td>Calculates the sum of the values in a
				  column.</td><td>Number, Currency </td>
						</tr>
						<tr><td>Standard Deviation</td><td>Returns the standard deviation of the values
				  in the column being summarized, assuming the values are a sample of a larger
				  population.</td><td>Number, Currency</td>
						</tr>
						<tr><td>Variance</td><td>Returns the variance of the values in the
				  column being summarized, assuming the values are a sample of a larger
				  population.</td><td>Number, Currency</td>
						</tr></table><p>When you click the drop-down arrow in a cell in
			 the Total row, you will see 
			 <b class="ui">None</b> displayed in the list, along with other
			 aggregate functions. Select 
			 <b class="ui">None</b> for a column that you do not want to
			 aggregate.</p><p>You can aggregate values in a calculated column. The list of functions that will be available for the column depends the data type of the value resulting from the calculation.</p><p><img border="0" src="../img/TopPageIcon_ZA10077668.gif"> <a href="#backtotop">Top of Page</a></p><h2 id=""><a id="2" name="2">About displaying calculated values in a
		column</a></h2><p>You can add a calculated column to a list to calculate values by
		  using a formula. A formula can only refer to values in other columns within the
		  same row. You cannot refer to a specific cell or a range of cells in a formula.
		  </p><p>The calculated values are stored in the column, but you cannot edit
		  the values. When the values referenced by the formula change, the list
		  automatically recalculates the value for the calculated column. </p><p>The ScreenTip that appears when you rest your mouse pointer on a calculated
		  value specifies the formula that is being used by the column. You can edit a
		  formula by selecting a cell that uses the formula and entering edit mode.
		  After you finish editing the formula, and exit edit mode, the new values are
		  automatically calculated and displayed in the column. </p><p>You can sort and filter values in a calculated column.

When you add a new row, the list will evaluate the formula and show the result as the default value in the column. </p><p>When you specify a formula as a default value, you can call any of the supported functions,  but the formula cannot reference other columns. Since the formula will be evaluated before you enter data in other columns, column references are not allowed.</p><p><img border="0" src="../img/TopPageIcon_ZA10077668.gif"> <a href="#backtotop">Top of Page</a></p><META NAME="CreationDate" CONTENT="2003-08-15"></body></html>
