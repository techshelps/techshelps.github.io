By applying multiple filters to a list, you can find specific list entries quickly.</p><p>For example, the Managers view of the Employee list is created by
		filtering for employees whose Manager column is set to Yes. You can further
		filter this list to view managers whose Country/region column is set to <b class="ui">USA</b> and State
		column is set to <b class="ui">California</b>. The following illustration shows managers who work in
		California.</p><img border="0" src="../img/lstFilt_ZA10100387.gif" alt="Managers view of the Employee list"><p>Note the appearance of the drop-down arrow in the header of the <b class="ui">State</b> and <b class="ui">Country/region</b> columns. </p><p>When you switch views or close the Managers view, the Country/region and
		State filters will not be saved. When you open the list in Managers view next
		time, the list will show all managers. </p><p>You can apply a filter to a list in two ways:<ul><li>A filter can be applied to a list in Datasheet View. The filter is reset when you navigate to a different page and must be reapplied the next time you want to view the same results.</li><li>When you specify a filter as part of
		the view definition, filter criteria are saved and are applied each time you open the list in the specified view.</li></ul></p><p>Columns of type multiple lines of
		text and hyperlink or picture do not support filtering. For columns of type attachment, you
		can filter for Yes and No values. For columns of type multi-choice, cells that
		contain the selected value will be included.</p><META NAME="CreationDate" CONTENT="2003-08-15"></body></html>
