This topic lists a few guidelines for improving view performance. </p><p>The following operations might take some time to complete, so keep them to the minimum:<ul><li>Refreshing a view that contains a large amount of data.  </li><li>Moving or copying large sets of data.</li><li>Filling large numbers of cells by dragging the fill handle.</li><li>Changing the formula in a calculated column.</li><li>Attaching large documents.</li><li>Exporting from and linking to Microsoft Excel 2010.</li><li>Resolving large numbers of errors.</li></ul></p><p>Do the following to improve performance of a view:<ul><li>Remove unnecessary columns from the view. In the <b class="ui">Edit Datasheet View</b> page, clear the <b class="ui">Display</b> check box for columns that are not necessary in the view. But do not remove columns that are marked <b class="ui">Required</b>. You will not be able to add data if the view does not include all required columns.</li><li>Apply one or more filters to remove rows that are not necessary. For example, you could edit the definition of the Managers view to include a filter that hides rows of employeers who are not managers. <p>In addition to saved filters, you could apply filters during a session to further reduce the amount of data in the view.  For example, if you are currently updating rows of managers in Washington, hide the rows of managers from other states.</p> </li><li>Configure the SharePoint server to improve performance.
