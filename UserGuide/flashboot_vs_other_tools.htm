<p>Unlike other tools, FlashBoot can create FAT32 filesystems on USB thumdrives larger than 32 Gb. This is especially important in UEFI environment, where filesystem on USB thumbdrive must be recognized by motherboard firmware, and so NTFS is not supported.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unlike other tools, FlashBoot can work with USB thumdrives which have no drive letter assigned or have no partitions. If capacity of USB thumdrive was reduced by other tools (for example, 64 Gb USB thumbdrive has become 32 Gb USB thumbdrive), then FlashBoot will automatically recover it to full capacity.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unlike other tools, FlashBoot supports ESD format of source Windows installation images (in addition to ISO image files and directly-accessed DVD disks).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unlike other tools, FlashBoot remains fully functional under Windows XP. This is because FlashBoot does not mount registry hives, FAT filesystems, WIM and VHD images via Windows kernel. These features are implemented inside FlashBoot, without invocation of platform-specific tools.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For specific formatting scenarios, where compatibility with older computers matters, FlashBoot formats USB thumbdrives in such way that they will boot both in USB-ZIP and USB-HDD mode, regardless of BIOS settings. For such cases, FlashBoot also allows to specify disk CHS geometry explicitly at format time, as well as target drive letter, i.e. A: or C:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>FlashBoot supports command line interface as alternative to GUI for power users who need automation or unattended operation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Last but not the least: FlashBoot is a good old-fashioned software. FlashBoot has free updates for lifetime. FlashBoot stands against the always-online, spy-on-everything, everything-is-a-service, subscribe-not-buy, force-updates-you-don't-want madness of recent years. FlashBoot does not interact with the internet in any way — it's up to you to decide if update is necessary. No toolbars, no ads, no spamming through e-mail database and no other crap in the installer and software. </p>
