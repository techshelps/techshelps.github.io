<p>USB storage devices are extremely useful, but they would be so much more useful if they did more than just store your data. Imagine being able to install an entire operating system of your choice onto a USB device, then boot from that device on any machine. Now imagine that dream coming true, and you have FlashBoot.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>FlashBoot enables you to install an instance of the Windows OS onto a USB device, empowering you to boot any PC from that device. With FlashBoot, you’ll be able to walk about with a fully-functional installation of Windows 10, 8.1 or 8 in your pocket, ready to go under any circumstance. Need your favorite app, document, game, or browser when you’re sitting in front of a strange computer? Just break out your USB device formatted using FlashBoot!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also FlashBoot can create installable clone of Windows 7, Windows 8/8.1 or Windows 10 which can be used to instantly copy all your apps, settings, documents, games and browsers from old computer to a new computer (even with dissimilar hardware), move operating system from HDD to SSD, move it from/to RAID array, copy OS between virtual machine and real hardware (or between virtual machines of different vendors), or switch Windows boot method between UEFI and non-UEFI. This feature can be used to gain unpartitioned disk space for dual-boot configurations (such as Windows 10 and Windows 7, Windows 10 and Linux) by reinstalling your OEM copy of Windows in-place. Additionally, this self-extracting backup of Windows will be of good use in the case of next ransomware virus attack, failed Windows update, or accidently deleted file.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you dislike Windows 10 because you don't want forced updates with untimely reboots, you don't want privacy intrusions like telemetry which can't be disabled, and you don't want your system preferences to reset on every major OS upgrade, then way to go is to return to Windows 7.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But hardware marches on, and older operating systems hardly can play catch-up. If you try to install Windows 7 on the contemporary laptop, you even won't get past the first screen: lack of builtin USB 3.0 support makes USB mouse, keyboard and source USB thumbdrive inaccessible to Windows 7 setup.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fortunately, FlashBoot can not only convert Windows setup DVD or image file to USB thumbdrive, but also integrate any drivers to it. Windows 7, supercharged with proper drivers, will support USB 3.0, NVMe, RAID, and any other modern hardware. For your convenience, FlashBoot already contains all necessary drivers for most popular hardware. FlashBoot can also integrate user-supplied drivers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also FlashBoot facilitates installation of older operating systems, such as Windows XP, from USB thumdrive, and running minified version of it (known as BartPE) from USB thumbdrive. You can even use FlashBoot to build self-extracting standalone EXE files that contain exactly what you want, for rapid deployment whenever you need it.</p>
