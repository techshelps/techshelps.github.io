<P>Windows uses two methods to route messages to a window procedure: posting messages to a first-in, first-out queue called a <I>message queue</I>, a system-defined memory object that temporarily stores messages, and sending messages directly to a window procedure. </P>

<P>Messages posted to a message queue are called <I>queued messages</I>. They are primarily the result of user input entered through the mouse or keyboard, such as <A HREF="1mq_iq2.htm">WM_MOUSEMOVE</A>, <A HREF="065j6u.htm">WM_LBUTTONDOWN</A>, <A HREF="cxjo_p.htm">WM_KEYDOWN</A>, and <A HREF="4gep_o2.htm">WM_CHAR</A> messages. Other queued messages include the timer, paint, and quit messages: <A HREF="303bzxe.htm">WM_TIMER</A>, <A HREF="f55xz2.htm">WM_PAINT</A>, and <A HREF="d9amku.htm">WM_QUIT</A>. Most other messages, which are sent directly to a window procedure, are called <I>nonqueued messages</I>. </P>
