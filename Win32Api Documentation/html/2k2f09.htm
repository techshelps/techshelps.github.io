<P><A NAME="2k2f09"></A><B>Tables</B></P>

<P>The file parser can add tables to text output by using the <A HREF="1xix5n7.htm"><B>SOBeginTable</B></A> and <A HREF="7gordw.htm"><B>SOEndTable</B></A> functions to mark the start and end of the table definition and can format the rows and cells in tables by using the <A HREF="54ttk7.htm"><B>SOPutTableRowFormat</B></A> and <A HREF="s6kpx6.htm"><B>SOPutTableCellInfo</B></A> functions. The file parser uses the character and paragraph functions to output the text for each cell and set the attributes. </P>

<P>The file parser marks the end of each cell and each row by using the <A HREF="3hla_lt.htm"><B>SOPutBreak</B></A> function with the SO_TABLECELLBREAK and SO_TABLEROWBREAK values. A file parser must insert a cell break after each cell and a row break at the end of each row. If a file parser inserts a row break before inserting as many cells as were defined for the row, the remaining cells are assumed to be empty. Empty cells may be inserted in the middle of a row by inserting consecutive cell breaks. </P>

<P>Row and cell formats must be defined before the last cell of a row. After defining the row properties by using the <A HREF="54ttk7.htm"><B>SOPutTableRowFormat</B></A> function, the parser must call the <A HREF="s6kpx6.htm"><B>SOPutTableCellInfo</B></A> function for each cell in the row. After a row is defined, the row properties are assumed to apply to subsequent rows until new row properties are specified. A filter may, thus, define an entire table by specifying the row and cell properties once and then using the appropriate row and cell breaks.</P>

<P>You can add borders to cells by setting the <B>pLeftBorder</B>, <B>pRightBorder</B>, <B>pTopBorder</B>, and <B>pBottomBorder</B> members of the <A HREF="ic11fg.htm"><B>SOTABLECELLINFO</B></A> structure to appropriate values when setting the cell format.</P>

<P>You can add tabs to cells by using the special character, the SO_CHCELLTAB value. This character is defined for cells that are merged with their neighbors and acts as a tab that moves the current text position to the location of the next boundary that would have existed if the cells had not been merged.</P>
