<P><A NAME="rgvu82"></A><B>Verifying Signatures</B></P>

<P>To verify a signature, a hash object must first be created using the <B>CryptCreateHash</B> function. This object will accumulate the data to be verified. The data is then added to the hash object with the <B>CryptHashData</B> function. </P>

<P>After the last block of data is added to the hash, the <B>CryptVerifySignature</B> function is used to verify the signature. The signature data, a handle to the hash object, and the description string must all be supplied to <B>CryptVerifySignature</B>. A handle to the key pair that was used to sign the data must also be specified.</P>

<P>Once the signature has been verified (or has failed the verification) the hash object should be destroyed with the <B>CryptDestroyHash</B> function.</P>
