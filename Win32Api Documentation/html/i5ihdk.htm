<P><B>Parameters</B></P>

<P><I>uExitCode</I></P>

<P>Specifies the exit code for the process, and for all threads that are terminated as a result of this call. Use the <A HREF="2mm.i..htm"><B>GetExitCodeProcess</B></A> function to retrieve the process's exit value. Use the <A HREF="3yyt_hx.htm"><B>GetExitCodeThread</B></A> function to retrieve a thread's exit value. </P>

<P></P>

<P><B>Return Values</B></P>

<P>This function does not return a value. </P>

<P><B>Remarks</B></P>

<P><B>ExitProcess</B> is the preferred method of ending a process. This function provides a clean process shutdown. This includes calling the entry-point function of all attached dynamic-link libraries (DLLs) with a value indicating that the process is detaching from the DLL. If a process terminates by calling <A HREF=".d3m14.htm"><B>TerminateProcess</B></A>, the DLLs that the process is attached to are not notified of the process termination. </P>

<P>After all attached DLLs have executed any process termination value, this function terminates the current process. </P>

<P>Terminating a process causes the following: </P>

<P>1.All of the object handles opened by the process are closed. </P>

<P>2.All of the threads in the process terminate their execution. </P>

<P>3.The state of the process object becomes signaled, satisfying any threads that had been waiting for the process to terminate. </P>

<P>4.The states of all threads of the process become signaled, satisfying any threads that had been waiting for the threads to terminate. </P>

<P>5.The termination status of the process changes from STILL_ACTIVE to the exit value of the process. </P>

<P></P>

<P>Terminating a process does not cause child processes to be terminated. </P>

<P>Terminating a process does not necessarily remove the process object from the operating system. A process object is deleted when the last handle to the process is closed. </P>

<P>The <B>ExitProcess</B>, <A HREF="c.xq03.htm"><B>ExitThread</B></A>, <A HREF="70ts0y.htm"><B>CreateThread</B></A>, <A HREF="19iu6kt.htm"><B>CreateRemoteThread</B></A> functions, and a process that is starting (as the result of a call by <A HREF="5fbj_xx.htm"><B>CreateProcess</B></A>) are serialized between each other within a process. Only one of these events can happen in an address space at a time. This means the following restrictions hold: </P>

<P>·During process startup and DLL initialization routines, new threads can be created, but they do not begin execution until DLL initialization is done for the process. </P>

<P>·Only one thread in a process can be in a DLL initialization or detach routine at a time. </P>

<P>·<B>ExitProcess</B> does not return until no threads are in their DLL initialization or detach routines. </P>
