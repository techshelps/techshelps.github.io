<P><A NAME="2bq0zqe"></A><B>ACE Inheritance</B></P>

<P>Each ACE in an ACL begins with an <A HREF="1xdlo53.htm"><B>ACE_HEADER</B></A> structure structure specifying how that ACE is inherited. Among other things, the flags in an <B>ACE_HEADER</B> structure specify whether the ACE is inherited by container objects (directories or registry keys) or by non-container objects, such as files. </P>

<P><B>ACE Inheritance in Container Objects</B></P>

<P>This section outlines the rules governing the inheritance of ACEs by container objects. </P>

<P>If the CONTAINER_INHERIT_ACE flag is set in the <A HREF="1xdlo53.htm"><B>ACE_HEADER</B></A> structure of the parent ACE, a copy of the ACE is added to the end of the inherited ACL and the following actions are performed on the inherited ACE: </P>

<P>·All inheritance flags in the inherited ACE are cleared. </P>

<P>·If the ACE contains an <A HREF="a48e53.htm">access mask</A> and any generic access flags are set, the generic rights are mapped to the standard and specific rights for the child object type. </P>

<P></P>

<P>If neither the CONTAINER_INHERIT_ACE flag nor the NO_PROPAGATE_INHERIT_ACE flag is set, the OBJECT_INHERIT_ACE and INHERIT_ONLY_ACE flags are set. If both the CONTAINER_INHERIT_ACE and the NO_PROPAGATE_INHERIT_ACE are set, the ACE is added to the end of the inherited ACL. </P>

<P>If neither the NO_PROPAGATE_INHERIT_ACE nor the CONTAINER_INHERIT_ACE flag is set in the <B>ACE_HEADER</B> structure of the parent ACE, a copy of the ACE is added to the end of the inherited ACL and its INHERIT_ONLY_ACE flag is set. </P>

<P>Otherwise, the ACE is not inherited. </P>

<P><B>ACE Inheritance in Non-container Objects</B></P>

<P>The following rules govern the inheritance of ACEs in objects other than containers. </P>

<P>If the OBJECT_INHERIT_ACE flag is set in the <A HREF="1xdlo53.htm"><B>ACE_HEADER</B></A> structure of the parent ACE, the ACE is copied to the end of the inherited ACL and: </P>

<P>·The INHERIT_ONLY_ACE flag in the inherited ACE is cleared. </P>

<P>·The NO_PROPAGATE_INHERIT_ACE, OBJECT_INHERIT_ACE, and CONTAINER_INHERIT_ACE flags in the inherited ACE are cleared. </P>

<P>·If the ACE contains an <A HREF="a48e53.htm">access mask</A> and, if any generic access flags are set, the generic rights are mapped to the standard and specific rights for the child object type. </P>

<P></P>

<P>Otherwise, the ACE is not inherited. </P>
