<P>The Quick View program (QUIKVIEW.EXE) acts on behalf of the shell to locate and activate a file viewer for a given path. There is a one to one correspondence between each running instance of Quick View and each file being displayed in a file viewer. Each instance of Quick View defines a process for a file viewer, giving the file viewer its own message queue. Quick View turns over execution of the process to the file viewer until the file viewer shuts down.</P>
