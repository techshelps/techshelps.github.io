<P>List view controls can display their contents in four different <I>views</I>. The current view is specified by the control's window style. Additional window styles specify the alignment of items and control-specific functionality of the list view control. Information about the four views follows.</P>

<TABLE cols=2>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=24%><B>View</B></TD>
<TD width=76%><B>Description</B></TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=24%>Icon view</TD>
<TD width=76%>Specified by the LVS_ICON window style.
<P>Each item appears as a full-sized icon with a label below it. The user can drag the items to any location in the list view window.</P>
</TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=24%>Small icon view</TD>
<TD width=76%>Specified by the LVS_SMALLICON window style.

</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=24%>List view</TD>
<TD width=76%>Specified by the LVS_LIST window style.

</TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=24%>Report view</TD>
<TD width=76%>Specified by the LVS_REPORT window style.
<P>Each item appears on its own line with information arranged in columns. The leftmost column contains the small icon and label, and subsequent columns contain subitems as specified by the application. Unless the LVS_NOCOLUMNHEADER window style is also specified, each column has a header.</P>
</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE><BR>

<P></P>

<P>You can change the view type after a list view control is created. To retrieve and change the window style, use the <A HREF="vb50yw.htm"><B>GetWindowLong</B></A> and <A HREF="d2okir.htm"><B>SetWindowLong</B></A> functions. To determine the window styles that correspond to the current view, use the LVS_TYPEMASK value.</P>

<P>You can control the way items are arranged in icon or small icon view by specifying either the LVS_ALIGNTOP (default) or LVS_ALIGNLEFT window style. You can change the alignment after a list view control is created. To isolate the window styles that specify the alignment of items, use the LVS_ALIGNMASK value.</P>

<P>Additional window styles control other options ¾ for example, whether a user can edit labels in place, whether more than one item can be selected at a time, and so on. For a complete list of the list view window styles, see <A HREF="6in8.gg.htm">List View Window Styles</A>. </P>
