<P><A NAME=".vnmlz"></A><B>Security Editor</B></P>

<P>Both File Manager and the Microsoft Windows NT Registry Editor (REGEDT32.EXE) include a security editor that allows a user with the appropriate <A HREF="134kpv4.htm">privileges</A> and <A HREF="a48e53.htm">access rights</A> to change the security attributes of files and registry keys. This security editor imposes guidelines on the form of the security information. Applications that modify the security of files, directories, or registry keys can follow these guidelines so the security editor will function correctly after the modifications. </P>

<P>The security editor accepts discretionary ACLs having either zero or more ACCESS_DENIED_ACE access-control entries (ACEs) or zero or more ACCESS_ALLOWED_ACE ACEs. The two ACE types cannot be mixed in a discretionary ACL. Neither does the security editor accept ACCESS_DENIED_ACE ACEs that deny only partial access. For example, it would reject an ACE that denies only read access to a file. </P>

<P>The security editor also imposes a requirement on inheritance flags. These flags are ignored for noncontainer objects, such as files, but are important for container objects, such as directories and registry keys. For container objects that support permissions on objects in the container, make sure that each security identifier (SID) has an ACE inherited by objects and an ACE inherited by containers. Accordingly, the discretionary ACL should contain ACEs in which the <B>AceFlags</B> member of the <A HREF="1xdlo53.htm"><B>ACE_HEADER</B></A> structure structure contains the OBJECT_INHERIT_ACE and CONTAINER_INHERIT_ACE flags. Sometimes these flags can be combined in a single ACE. For example, a discretionary ACL that grants read access to a directory can contain a CONTAINER_INHERIT_ACE ACE that grants GENERIC_READ access to the user or group as well as an ACE with the OBJECT_INHERIT_ACE and INHERIT_ONLY_ACE flags that also grants GENERIC_READ access. In this case, the required flags could be combined into an ACE that grants GENERIC_READ access and combines the CONTAINER_INHERIT_ACE and OBJECT_INHERIT_ACE flags. </P>

<P>The same rules for inheritance flags apply to system ACLs. The security editor does not support the SYSTEM_ALARM_ACE type and will not edit a system ACL containing one. As noted earlier, this ACE type is not supported by the current version of Windows NT. </P>
