<P><A NAME="17s3htk"></A><B>Shell Extension Terms</B></P>

<P>You should be familiar with the following shell extension terms before proceeding.</P>

<P><I>file object</I></P>

<P>A file object is an item within the shell. The most familiar file objects are files and directories. However, a file object may not actually be a part of the file system; it may only appear that way. For example, printers, Control Panel applications, and network shares, servers, and workgroups are also considered to be file objects.</P>

<P><I>file class</I></P>

<P>Each file object is a member of a file class. The file class refers to the code that "owns" the manipulation of files belonging to the class. For example, text files and Microsoft Word documents are examples of file classes. Each file class has specific shell extensions associated with it. When the shell is about to take an action involving a file object, it uses the file class to determine the shell extensions to load.</P>

<P><I>handler</I></P>

<P>A handler is the code that implements a particular shell extension.</P>
