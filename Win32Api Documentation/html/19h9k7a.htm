<P><A NAME="19h9k7a"></A><B>Menu Bars and Menus</B></P>

<P>A menu is arranged in a hierarchy. At the top level of the hierarchy is the <I>menu bar</I>; <I>menus</I> drop down from the menu bar, and at the lower levels are <I>submenus</I>. A menu bar is sometimes called a <I>top-level menu</I>, and the menus and submenus are also known as <I>pop-up menus</I>.</P>

<P>A menu item can either carry out a command or open a submenu. An item that carries out a command is called a <I>command item</I> or a <I>command</I>. </P>

<P>An item on the menu bar almost always opens a menu. Menu bars rarely contain command items. A menu opened from the menu bar drops down from the menu bar and is sometimes called a <I>drop-down menu</I>. When a drop-down menu is displayed, it is attached to the menu bar. A menu item on the menu bar that opens a drop-down menu is also called a <I>menu name</I>.</P>

<P>The menu names on a menu bar represent the main categories of commands that an application provides. Selecting a menu name from the menu bar typically opens a menu whose menu items correspond to the commands in a given category. For example, a menu bar might contain a <B>File</B> menu name that, when selected by the user, activates a menu with menu items such as <B>New</B>, <B>Open</B>, and <B>Save</B>.</P>

<P>Only an overlapped or pop-up window can contain a menu bar; a child window cannot contain one. If the window has a title bar, Windows positions the menu bar just below it. A menu bar is always visible. A submenu is not visible, however, until the user selects a menu item that activates it. For more information about overlapped and pop-up windows, see <A HREF="1ob61wo.htm">General Window Styles</A>.</P>

<P>Each menu must have an owner window. Windows sends messages to a menu's owner window when the user selects the menu or chooses an item from the menu. These messages are described in <A HREF="1_283ge.htm">Messages Used with Menus</A>. </P>
