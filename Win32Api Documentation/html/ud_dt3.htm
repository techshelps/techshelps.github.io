<P>Each event can have event-specific data associated with it. Event Viewer has no information of any of the events, and only displays extra data in a combined hexadecimal and text dump format. Use event-specific data sparingly, including it only if you are sure it will be useful to a support technician or a developer. You might include, for example, data containing a structure filled with information that could help a technician debug an application failure. </P>

<P>Examples of event-specific data are found in many network events; network control blocks (NCBs) are included as event-specific data. In all cases, the last part of the description string should include a note about what information is available as event-specific data. Third-party applications can use the Data field to store information the application can process independently of Event Viewer. For example, you could write your own viewer specific to your events, or write a program that scans the logfiles and makes reports, including information from the event-specific data. </P>
