<P><A NAME="bxskua"></A><B>File Viewer File Menu Items</B></P>

<P>The standard file viewer File menu has the following four items (as well as separators), two of which are optional. A file viewer can add other items to the menu, but in most cases there is no need for other items. </P>

<TABLE cols=2>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=35%><B>Menu item string</B></TD>
<TD width=65%><B>Result of selecting the menu item</B></TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=35%>"&amp;Open File for Editing"</TD>
<TD width=65%>Locates and starts the application that can open and edit the file. After successfully starting the application, the file viewer should hide its window immediately, shut down, and eventually return from <A HREF="kloql3.htm"><B>IFileViewer::Show</B></A>, after which the Quick View process terminates. If the file viewer fails to start the application, it should display the following message.
<P>There is no application available that can open this file.</P>
</TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=35%>Separator</TD>
<TD width=65%>Not applicable.</TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=35%>"Page Set&amp;up" (optional)</TD>
<TD width=65%>Activates the standard Page Setup dialog box (or an application-specific dialog box if desired), the results of which affect the display of the file in the viewport window. The effects of the Page Setup command last only for the duration of the file viewer and do not affect the contents of the disk file. This menu item should appear if the file viewer supports printing and only if the Print menu item appears as well.</TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=35%>"&amp;Print\tCtrl+P" (optional)</TD>
<TD width=65%>Activates the standard Print/Printer Setup property sheet. Any changes made to the printer setup that would affect the display of the file in the viewport window last only for the duration of the file viewer and do not affect the contents of the disk file. This menu item should appear only if the file viewer supports printing a file without starting the full application.</TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=35%>Separator</TD>
<TD width=65%>Not applicable.</TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=35%>"E&amp;xit"</TD>
<TD width=65%>Hides the window, closes the file, destroys all the windows, performs other necessary cleanup, and returns with the NOERROR error code from <A HREF="kloql3.htm"><B>IFileViewer::Show</B></A>. The window should be hidden before cleanup happens to avoid marring its appearance, when the system destroys the toolbar and other controls.</TD>
