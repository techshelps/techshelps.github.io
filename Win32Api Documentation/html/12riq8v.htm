<P>The New Technology file system (NTFS) organizes data on fixed disks. This file system supports object-oriented applications by treating all files as objects with user- and system-defined attributes. NTFS provides all the capabilities of the FAT file system without many of its limitations. Accessing files under NTFS is often faster than accessing similar files under the FAT file system. </P>

<P>NTFS is a fully recoverable file system. It is designed to restore consistency to a disk after a CPU failure, system crash, or I/O error. NTFS allows the operating system to recover without your having to use disk-checking utilities. However, NTFS provides these utilities in case recovery fails or corruption occurs outside the control of the file system. NTFS also includes features not present in FAT, such as security, Unicode filenames, automatic creation of MS-DOS® aliases, multiple data streams, and unique functionality specific to the POSIX subsystem. For more information about security, see <A HREF="1966ja.htm">Security</A>. For more information about Unicode, see <A HREF="3seko4e.htm">Unicode and Character Sets</A>. </P>

<P>NTFS filenames can be any practical length (up to 255 characters). There is no requirement that NTFS filenames have extensions; however, many applications still create and use them. For more information, see <A HREF="btm8w1.htm">Filename Conventions</A>. </P>
