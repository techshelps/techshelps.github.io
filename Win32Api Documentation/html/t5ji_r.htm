<P><A NAME="t5ji_r"></A><B>Network Interface Object</B></P>

<P>The Network Interface performance object consists of counters that measure the rates at which bytes and packets are sent and received over a TCP/IP connection. It includes counters that monitor connection errors.</P>

<P><B>Bytes Total/sec</B></P>

<P>Bytes Total/sec is the rate at which bytes are sent and received on the interface, including framing characters.</P>

<P>Detail Level: Advanced<BR>
Counter Type: PERF_COUNTER_COUNTER</P>

<P><B>Packets/sec</B></P>

<P>Packets/sec is the rate at which packets are sent and received on the network interface.</P>

<P>Detail Level: Advanced<BR>
Counter Type: PERF_COUNTER_COUNTER</P>

<P><B>Packets Received/sec</B></P>

<P>Packets Received/sec is the rate at which packets are received on the network interface.</P>

<P>Detail Level: Advanced<BR>
Counter Type: PERF_COUNTER_COUNTER</P>

<P><B>Packets Sent/sec</B></P>

<P>Packets Sent/sec is the rate at which packets are sent on the network interface.</P>

<P>Detail Level: Advanced<BR>
Counter Type: PERF_COUNTER_COUNTER</P>

<P><B>Current Bandwidth</B></P>

<P>Current Bandwidth is an estimate of the interface's current bandwidth in bits per second (BPS). For interfaces that do not vary in bandwidth or for those where no accurate estimation can be made, this value is the nominal bandwidth.</P>

<P>Detail Level: Advanced<BR>
Counter Type: PERF_COUNTER_RAWCOUNT</P>

<P><B>Bytes Received/sec</B></P>

<P>Bytes Received/sec is the rate at which bytes are received on the interface, including framing characters. </P>

<P>Detail Level: Advanced<BR>
Counter Type: PERF_COUNTER_COUNTER</P>

<P><B>Packets Received Unicast/sec</B></P>

<P>Packets Received Unicast/sec is the rate at which (subnet) unicast packets are delivered to a higher-layer protocol.</P>

<P>Detail Level: Expert<BR>
Counter Type: PERF_COUNTER_COUNTER</P>

<P><B>Packets Received Non-Unicast/sec</B></P>

<P>Packets Received Non-Unicast/sec is the rate at which non-unicast (i.e., subnet broadcast or subnet multicast) packets are delivered to a higher-layer protocol.</P>

<P>Detail Level: Expert<BR>
Counter Type: PERF_COUNTER_COUNTER</P>

<P><B>Packets Received Discarded</B></P>

<P>Packets Received Discarded is the number of inbound packets that were chosen to be discarded even though no errors had been detected to prevent their being deliverable to a higher-layer protocol. One possible reason for discarding such a packet could be to free up buffer space.</P>

<P>Detail Level: Advanced<BR>
Counter Type: PERF_COUNTER_RAWCOUNT</P>

<P><B>Packets Received Errors</B></P>

<P>Packets Received Errors is the number of inbound packets that contained errors preventing them from being deliverable to a higher-layer protocol.</P>

<P>Detail Level: Advanced<BR>
Counter Type: PERF_COUNTER_RAWCOUNT</P>

<P><B>Packets Received Unknown</B></P>

<P>Packets Received Unknown is the number of packets received via the interface that were discarded because of an unknown or unsupported protocol.</P>

<P>Detail Level: Advanced<BR>
Counter Type: PERF_COUNTER_RAWCOUNT</P>

<P><B>Bytes Sent/sec</B></P>

<P>Bytes Sent/sec is the rate at which bytes are sent on the interface, including framing characters.</P>

<P>Detail Level: Advanced<BR>
Counter Type: PERF_COUNTER_COUNTER</P>

<P><B>Packets Sent Unicast/sec</B></P>

<P>Packets Sent Unicast/sec is the rate at which packets are requested to be transmitted to subnet-unicast addresses by higher-level protocols. The rate includes the packets that were discarded or not sent.</P>

<P>Detail Level: Expert<BR>
Counter Type: PERF_COUNTER_COUNTER</P>

<P><B>Packets Sent Non-Unicast/sec</B></P>

<P>Packets Sent Non-Unicast/sec is the rate at which packets are requested to be transmitted to non-unicast (i.e., subnet broadcast or subnet multicast) addresses by higher-level protocols. The rate includes the packets that were discarded or not sent.</P>

<P>Detail Level: Expert<BR>
Counter Type: PERF_COUNTER_COUNTER</P>

<P><B>Packets Outbound Discarded</B></P>

<P>Packets Outbound Discarded is the number of outbound packets that were chosen to be discarded even though no errors had been detected to prevent their being transmitted. One possible reason for discarding such a packet could be to free up buffer space.</P>

<P>Detail Level: Advanced<BR>
Counter Type: PERF_COUNTER_RAWCOUNT</P>

<P><B>Packets Outbound Errors</B></P>

<P>Packets Outbound Errors is the number of outbound packets that could not be transmitted because of errors. </P>

<P>Detail Level: Advanced<BR>
Counter Type: PERF_COUNTER_RAWCOUNT</P>

<P><B>Output Queue Length</B></P>

<P>Output Queue Length is the length of the output packet queue (in packets.) If this is longer than 2, delays are being experienced and the bottleneck should be found and eliminated if possible. Since the requests are queued by NDIS in this implementations, this will always be 0.</P>

Counter Type: PERF_COUNTER_RAWCOUNT</P>
