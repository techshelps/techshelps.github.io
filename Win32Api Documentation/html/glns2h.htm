<P>An application written for Microsoft® Windows® consists of one or more processes. A <I>process</I>, in the simplest terms, is an executing program. One or more threads run in the context of the process. A <I>thread</I> is the basic unit to which the operating system allocates processor time. A thread can execute any part of the process code, including parts currently being executed by another thread. </P>
