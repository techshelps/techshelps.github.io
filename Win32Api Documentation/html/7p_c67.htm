<P>Windows also provides <I>shortcut menus</I>. A shortcut menu is not attached to the menu bar; it can appear anywhere on the screen. An application typically associates a shortcut menu with a portion of a window, such as the client area, or with a specific object, such as an icon. For this reason, these menus are also called "context menus."</P>

<P>A shortcut menu remains hidden until the user activates it, typically by right-clicking a selection, a toolbar, or a taskbar button, for example. The menu is usually displayed at the position of the caret or mouse cursor.</P>
