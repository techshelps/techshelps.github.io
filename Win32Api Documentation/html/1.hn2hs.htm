<P><A NAME="1.hn2hs"></A><B>About File Installation</B></P>

<P>The functions included in the file installation library determine where a file should be installed, identify conflicts with currently installed files, and perform the installation process. These functions enable installation programs to avoid the following problems: </P>

<P>·Installing older versions of components over newer versions </P>

<P>·Changing the language in a mixed-language system without notification </P>

<P>·Installing multiple copies of a library in different directories </P>

<P>·Copying files to network directories shared by multiple users </P>

<P></P>

<P>The file installation library also includes functions that enable applications to query a version resource for file information and present the information in a clear format. This information includes the file's purpose, author, version number, and so on. </P>

<P>Version information can be added to any Microsoft® Windows® file that can have Windows resources, such as a dynamic-link library (DLL), an executable file, or a font file. To add the information, a developer must create a version resource and add the resource to the file by using a resource compiler and specifying VS_FILE_INFO as the resource type.</P>
