<P>The dimensions of a cosmetic pen are specified in device units. Therefore, lines drawn with a cosmetic pen always have a fixed width. Lines drawn with a cosmetic pen are generally drawn three to ten times faster than lines drawn with a geometric pen. Cosmetic pens have three attributes: width, style, and color. For more information about these attributes, see <A HREF="3xih_yb.htm">Pen Attributes</A>. </P>

<P>To create a cosmetic pen, an application uses the <A HREF="10xg29a.htm"><B>CreatePen</B></A>, <A HREF="5f44_m_.htm"><B>CreatePenIndirect</B></A>, or <A HREF="6kg3d6.htm"><B>ExtCreatePen</B></A> function. To retrieve one of the three <I>stock</I> cosmetic pens managed by window manager, the application uses the <A HREF="d50dne.htm"><B>GetStockObject</B></A> function. </P>

<P>After a pen is created (or a handle identifying one of the stock pens is obtained), the pen is selected into the application's device context (DC) by calling the <A HREF="4n4gw4.htm"><B>SelectObject</B></A> function. From this point on, the application uses this pen for any line-drawing operations in its client area. </P>
