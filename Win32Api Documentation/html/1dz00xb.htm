<P><B>Parameters</B></P>

<P><I>pncb</I></P>

<P>Pointer to an <A HREF="35heyl.htm"><B>NCB</B></A> structure describing the network control block. </P>

<P></P>

<P><B>Return Values</B></P>

<P>For synchronous requests, the return value is the return code of the <A HREF="35heyl.htm"><B>NCB</B></A><B> </B>structure. That value is also returned in the <B>ncb_retcode</B> member of the <B>NCB</B> structure. </P>

<P>There are two return value possibilities for accepted asynchronous requests. If the asynchronous command has already completed when <B>Netbios</B> returns to its caller, the return value is the return code of the <B>NCB </B>structure, just as if it were a synchronous <B>NCB </B>structure. If the asynchronous command is still pending when <B>Netbios</B> returns to its caller, the return value is zero. </P>

<P>If the address specified by the <I>pncb</I> parameter is invalid, the return value is NRC_BADNCB. </P>

<P><B>Remarks</B></P>

<P>The <B>Netbios</B> function is primarily for applications written for the IBM NetBIOS system that need to be ported to Windows. Applications that do not have this requirement typically use other interfaces, such as mailslots and named pipes, instead of <B>Netbios</B>. </P>

<P><B>Netbios</B> contains extensions to the standard IBM NetBIOS 3.0 specification to allow POST routines to be called from C and to operate efficiently in the Windows environment. </P>

<P>When an asynchronous network control block finishes and the <B>ncb_post</B> member is nonzero, the routine specified in <B>ncb_post</B> is called with a single parameter of type <B>PNCB</B>. This parameter contains the address of the finishing network control block. (In the standard IBM NetBIOS 3.0, the address of the network control block is supplied in a nonportable interface.) </P>

<P>Another extension to the <B>NCB</B> structure is a handle of an event (the <B>ncb_event </B>member). The event is set to the nonsignaled state by the system when an asynchronous NetBIOS command is accepted, and it is set to the signaled state when the asynchronous NetBIOS command finishes. </P>

<P>Using <B>ncb_event</B> to submit asynchronous requests requires fewer system resources than using <B>ncb_post</B>. Also, when <B>ncb_event</B> is nonzero, the pending request is canceled if the thread terminates before the request is processed. This is not true for requests sent by using <B>ncb_post</B>. </P>

<P>Only manual reset events should be used with <B>Netbios</B>. A specified event should not be associated with more than one active asynchronous NetBIOS command. </P>

<P>In Win32s, this function does not support features that conflict with the non-preemptive, shared-memory design of Windows 3.1. Because the system does not implement events, this function ignores the <B>ncb_event</B> member of the <B>NCB</B> structure. Also, the system maintains one systemwide name table rather the a per-process name table.</P>
