<P><A NAME="eo_9_z"></A><B>deadlock</B></P>

<P>A bug where the execution of thread A is blocked indefinitely waiting for thread B to perform some action, while thread B is blocked waiting for thread A. For example, two threads on opposite ends of a named pipe can become deadlocked if each thread waits to read data written by the other thread. A single thread can also deadlock itself. See also <A HREF="5_r.bz.htm"><B>named pipe</B></A>,<B> thread</B>.</P>
