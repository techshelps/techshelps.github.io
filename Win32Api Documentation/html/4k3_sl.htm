<P>A tagged-file specification used to define standard formats for multimedia files. Tagged-file structure helps prevent compatibility problems that often occur when file-format definitions change over time. Because each piece of data in the file is identified by a standard header, an application that does not recognize a given data element can skip over the unknown information.
