<P><A NAME="8kds_0d"></A><B>Description</B></P>

<P>Each event is associated with a description located in a message file that is registered by the <A HREF="1yel7v.htm">Source</A>. The description should help the user understand what went wrong and suggest what actions to take. Focus the description toward users solving their own problems, not toward support people or developers. Make the description clear and concise and avoid culture-specific phrases. If your event includes private data in the Data field, include at the end of the description an explanation about what the Data field contains. For example, the network software often notes: "(The SMB is the event data)." As a convention, use parentheses around such remarks, as indicated in this example. Several applications can share the same message file, and the message file can contain descriptions for both the <A HREF="lf4goi.htm">event identifier</A> and the event <A HREF="3eodv8.htm">category</A>. </P>

<P>The description strings are indexed by event identifier, enabling Event Viewer to display event-specific text for any event based on the event identifier. All descriptions are localized and language dependent. Description strings can optionally contain placeholders for insertion strings. Each placeholder is represented by a percent sign and an index number for the string to substitute. For example, the placeholder %1 is replaced by the first insertion string, %5 is replaced by the fifth insertion string, and so on. </P>
