<P>Nonqueued messages are sent immediately to the destination window procedure, bypassing the system message queue and thread message queue. Windows typically sends nonqueued messages to notify a window of events that affect it. For example, when the user activates a new application window, Windows sends the window a series of messages, including <A HREF="2yi0_zt.htm">WM_ACTIVATE</A>, <A HREF="1ml4f9e.htm">WM_SETFOCUS</A>, and <A HREF="3.0b0yt.htm">WM_SETCURSOR</A>. These messages notify the window that it has been activated, that keyboard input is being directed to the window, and that the mouse cursor has been moved within the borders of the window. Nonqueued messages can also result when an application calls certain Windows functions. For example, Windows sends the <A HREF="4d1zvu.htm">WM_WINDOWPOSCHANGED</A> message after an application uses the <A HREF="4557_v1.htm"><B>SetWindowPos</B></A> function to move a window. </P>
