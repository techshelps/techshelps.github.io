<P>A font whose glyphs are stored as a collection of line and curve commands plus a collection of hints. Windows uses the line and curve commands to define the outline of the glyph's bitmap. Windows uses the hints to adjust the length of the lines and shapes of the curves. These hints and the respective adjustments are based on the amount of scaling used to reduce or increase the size of the bitmap.
