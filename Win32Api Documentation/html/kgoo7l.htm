<P><A NAME="kgoo7l"></A><B>About Controls</B></P>

<P>Controls, like other windows, each belong to a window class, either predefined or application defined. The window class and the corresponding window procedure define the properties of the control, its appearance, behavior, and purpose. An application can create controls individually by specifying the name of the window class when calling the <A HREF="rpk.pc.htm"><B>CreateWindowEx</B></A><B> </B>function. An application can also direct Windows to create controls for a dialog box by specifying the controls in the dialog box template. </P>

<P>Controls are child windows. When Windows creates controls for a dialog box, each control is the child of the dialog box. When an application creates a control, the control is the child of a window identified by the application. This relationship is important because a control sends messages, called <I>notification messages</I>, to its parent window when events, such as input from the user, occur in the control. The application relies on these notification messages to determine what action the user wants the application to take. </P>

<P>Because controls are windows, an application can manipulate them by using the window-management functions, such as the <A HREF="3mejbzs.htm"><B>ShowWindow</B></A> and <A HREF="6v0r1k.htm"><B>EnableWindow</B></A> functions. If the window class for a control supports <I>control messages</I>, an application can also manipulate a control of that class by using the <A HREF="1724msn.htm"><B>SendMessage</B></A> function to send these messages to the control. The purpose and function of each control message is specific to the window class and is defined by the control's window procedure. </P>
