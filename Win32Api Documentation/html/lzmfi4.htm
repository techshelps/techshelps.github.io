<P>Tree-view styles govern aspects of a tree-view control's appearance. You set the initial styles when you create the tree-view control. You can retrieve and change the styles after creating the tree-view control by using the <A HREF="vb50yw.htm"><B>GetWindowLong</B></A> and <A HREF="d2okir.htm"><B>SetWindowLong</B></A> functions.</P>

<P>The TVS_HASLINES style enhances the graphic representation of a tree-view control's hierarchy by drawing lines that link child items to their corresponding parent item. This style does not link items at the root of the hierarchy. To do so, you need to combine the TVS_HASLINES and TVS_LINESATROOT styles. </P>

<P>The user can expand or collapse a parent item's list of child items by double-clicking the parent item. A tree-view control that has the TVS_HASBUTTONS style adds a button to the left side of each parent item. The user can click the button to expand or collapse the child items as an alternative to double-clicking the parent item. TVS_HASBUTTONS does not add buttons to items at the root of the hierarchy. To do so, you must combine TVS_HASLINES, TVS_LINESATROOT, and TVS_HASBUTTONS. </P>

<P>The TVS_EDITLABELS style makes it possible for the user to edit the labels of tree-view items. For more information about editing labels, see <A HREF="2o9zevr.htm">Tree-View Label Editing</A>.</P>

<P>The TVS_SHOWSELALWAYS style causes a selected item to remain selected when the tree-view control loses focus.</P>
