<P>A technique that enables some internal Musical Instrument Digital Interface (MIDI) synthesizer device drivers to preload their patch data, reducing the delay between the moment the synthesizer receives a MIDI program-change message and the moment it plays a note using the new patch. Patch caching also ensures that required patches are available (the synthesizer might load only a subset of its patches).
