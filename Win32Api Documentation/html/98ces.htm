<P>The Windows operating system uses power management to reduce the power consumption of a computer and the attached devices. Windows works in conjunction with the computer and its devices to monitor system operation and shut down devices or the computer itself when idle. To help applications and installable drivers take advantage of power management and to ensure that no data is lost when a device or the computer is shut down, Windows provides functions and messages that reveal the system power status and notify of power management events.</P>
