<P><A NAME="12xn.i."></A><B>Service Functions</B></P>

<P>A complete set of <A HREF="we4jtq.htm">service functions</A> are provided in the Win32 API. These should be used in place of the NetService functions, unless you need to control services on a LAN Manager 2.<I>x</I> server. </P>

<P>The service functions control services. A service is an application that an administrator can control using the Service Controller interfaces. The service functions are:</P>

<P><A HREF="302dgt.htm"><B>NetServiceControl</B></A><BR>
<A HREF="321xt8n.htm"><B>NetServiceEnum</B></A><BR>
<A HREF="c.abk2.htm"><B>NetServiceGetInfo</B></A><BR>
<A HREF="jjs75u.htm"><B>NetServiceInstall</B></A></P>

<P>Services allow administrators to control applications on the network and maintain the integrity of users' data. On a typical network, applications are shared by many users. If an administrator terminates an application running on a server, a user who has not finished working with that application can lose important data. When an application is implemented as a service, the service controller checks the status before changing the state of the service. Windows NT Networking provides several standard services, such as the Workstation, Server, and Messenger services.</P>

<P>A service can be started using the service functions. At startup time, the service defines whether it can be stopped, paused, and continued.</P>

<P>The <A HREF="302dgt.htm"><B>NetServiceControl</B></A> function controls the operations of network services, and it can provide time hints to controlling applications. The <A HREF="321xt8n.htm"><B>NetServiceEnum</B></A> function retrieves information about all started services. The <A HREF="c.abk2.htm"><B>NetServiceGetInfo</B></A> function retrieves information about a particular started service. The <A HREF="jjs75u.htm"><B>NetServiceInstall</B></A> function starts a network service. </P>

<P>The service functions provide service information at three levels:</P>

<P><A HREF="zylj5n.htm"><B>SERVICE_INFO_0</B></A><BR>
<A HREF="zplj5n.htm"><B>SERVICE_INFO_1</B></A><BR>
<A HREF="zqlj5n.htm"><B>SERVICE_INFO_2</B></A></P>
