<P><A NAME="1bjhddp"></A><B>Mailslots and Microsoft LAN Manager 2.x</B></P>

<P>Windows uses mailslots similar to those developed for Microsoft LAN Manager version 2.0. An application that uses LAN Manager 2.<I>x</I> mailslots can interact easily with mailslots created by Windows. There are significant differences, however, between Windows-based mailslots and LAN Manager mailslots: </P>

<P>·Windows-based mailslots all have the same class ¾ there are no "first class" and "second class" mailslots. </P>

<P>·All Windows-based mailslot messages have equal priority and are always appended to the mailslot buffer. When a Windows-based mailslot message is written to a mailslot on a computer that requires message priority, the system sets the priority to the lowest value (0). </P>

<P>·Write operations to Windows-based mailslots on local computers return an error value if an error occurs. Write operations to remote Windows-based mailslots do not return an error value when they fail. (Because there is no built-in limit to the size of the mailslot buffer failure is unlikely.) </P>

<P>·Write operations to Windows-based mailslots fail immediately if the message cannot be appended to the mailslot buffer (if the buffer is too small, for example). Immediate failure makes write time-outs irrelevant; contrary to LAN Manager mailslots, there are no write time-outs for Windows-based mailslots. </P>

<P>·A process that creates a Windows-based mailslot can specify that the mailslot handle be inherited by its child processes. (Mailslot handles in LAN Manager cannot be inherited.) </P>

<P></P>

<P>A process writes messages to a Windows-based mailslot by using standard file input and output functions. The following table shows LAN Manager mailslot functions and their corresponding Windows functions. </P>
