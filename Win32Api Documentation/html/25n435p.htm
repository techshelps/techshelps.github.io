<P>Before an application can create and resolve shortcuts, it must initialize the component object library by calling the <B>CoInitialize</B> function. Each call to <B>CoInitialize</B> requires a corresponding call to the <B>CoUninitialize </B>function, which an application should call when it terminates. The call to <B>CoUninitialize</B> ensures that the application does not terminate until it has received all of its pending messages. </P>
