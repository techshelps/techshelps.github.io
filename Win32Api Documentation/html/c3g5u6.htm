<P>The MD2, MD4, and MD5 hashing algorithms were all developed by RSA Data Security, Inc. These algorithms were developed in sequential order, with the later algorithms generally being better (more secure) than the earlier ones. All three generate 128-bit hash values. Of the three algorithms, MD5 is recommended.</P>

<P>These algorithms are well known and can be reviewed in detail in any reference on cryptography.</P>
