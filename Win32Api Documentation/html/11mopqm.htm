<P><A NAME="11mopqm"></A><B>IPC Mailslots</B></P>

<P>Mailslots provide a one-way interprocess communications capability. Any process can create a mailslot and become a mailslot server. Other processes, called mailslot clients, can gain access to the mailslot by its name and send messages to the mailslot server process. A process can be both a mailslot server and a mailslot client, so two-way IPC is possible with multiple mailslots. </P>

<P>Incoming messages are always appended to the mailslot. The mailslot saves the messages until the creating process has a chance to read them. </P>

<P>Mailslots are similar to named pipes, but with a somewhat simplified programming interface and the added ability to broadcast messages to all computers in a specified network domain. A mailslot client can send a message to a mailslot on its local computer, to a mailslot on another computer, or to all mailslots with the same name on all computers in a specified network domain. Messages broadcast to a domain can be no longer than 400 bytes; messages sent to a single mailslot are limited only by the maximum message size specified by the creator of the mailslot (which can be unlimited). </P>

<P></P>

<P><B>Key Point</B>  Mailslots offer an easy way for applications to send and receive short messages. They also provide the ability to broadcast messages across all computers in a network domain. For more information, see <A HREF="k7uhr6.htm">Mailslots</A>. </P>
