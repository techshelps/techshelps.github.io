<P>Windows provides user access to help information from the mouse by notifying the application whenever the user clicks the right mouse button or clicks a window, control, or menu after clicking the Question (?) button. The application responds by displaying help information associated with the given window, control, or menu.</P>

<P>The system sends a <A HREF="_1f8jj.htm">WM_CONTEXTMENU</A> message when the user clicks the right mouse button. The window that was clicked receives the message. If the window is a child window, such as a control, the <A HREF="32d1nbh.htm"><B>DefWindowProc</B></A> function passes the message to the parent window. The WM_CONTEXTMENU message specifies the coordinates of the mouse cursor. The x-coordinate is in the low-order word of the <I>lParam</I> parameter, and the y-coordinate is in the high-order word. If the user clicked a control, the <I>wParam</I> parameter is the handle of the control that received the button click.</P>

<P>The system sends a <A HREF="d98_nq.htm">WM_HELP</A> message when the user clicks an item in a window after clicking the Question (?) button that appears in the title bar of the window. You can add a Question button to a title bar by specifying the WS_EX_CONTEXTHELP style in the <A HREF="rpk.pc.htm"><B>CreateWindowEx</B></A> function when creating the window. The <I>lParam</I> parameter of WM_HELP is a pointer to a <A HREF="8ebbkx.htm"><B>HELPINFO</B></A> structure that contains detailed information about the item for which help is requested, including the coordinates of the mouse cursor at the time the user clicked the mouse button.</P>

<P>The Question button is recommended for use in dialog boxes only. In the past, applications have provided user access to help information about a dialog box by providing a Help button in the dialog box. This method is no longer recommended. Use the Question button instead. </P>
