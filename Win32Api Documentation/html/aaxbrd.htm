<P><A NAME="aaxbrd"></A><B>Dynamic Data Exchange Message Flow</B></P>

<P>A typical DDE conversation consists of the following events: </P>

<P>1.The client application initiates the conversation, and the server application responds. </P>

<P>2.The applications exchange data by any or all of the following methods: </P>

<P>톂he server application sends data to the client at the client's request. </P>

<P>톂he client application sends unsolicited data to the server application. </P>

<P>톂he client application requests the server application to notify the client whenever a data item changes (warm data link). </P>

<P>톂he client application requests the server application to send data whenever the data changes (hot data link). </P>

<P>톂he server application carries out a command at the client's request. </P>

<P></P>

<P>3.Either the client or server application terminates the conversation. </P>

<P></P>

<P>An application window that processes requests from a client or server must process them strictly in the order they are received. </P>

<P>A client can establish conversations with more than one server; a server can have conversations with more than one client. When handling messages from more than one source, a client or server must process the messages of a given conversation synchronously, but need not process all messages synchronously. In other words, it can shift from one conversation to another as needed. </P>

<P>If an application is unable to process an incoming request because it is waiting for a DDE response, it must prevent deadlock by posting a <A HREF="9k0..a.htm">WM_DDE_ACK</A> message with the <B>fBusy</B> member of the <A HREF="137c5ph.htm"><B>DDEACK</B></A> structure set to 1. An application can also send a busy WM_DDE_ACK message if, for any reason, it cannot process an incoming request within a reasonable amount of time. </P>

<P>An application should be able to handle the failure of a client or server to respond to a message within a certain time. Since the time-out interval may vary depending on the nature of the application and the configuration of the user's system (including whether it is connected to a network), the application should provide a way for the user to specify the interval. </P>
