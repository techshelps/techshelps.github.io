<P>Phone books provide a standard way to collect and specify the information that the Remote Access Connection Manager needs to establish a remote connection. Phone books associate entry names with information such as phone numbers, COM ports, and modem settings. Each phone-book entry contains the information needed to establish a RAS connection. </P>

<P><B>Windows NT:</B> Phone books are stored in phone-book files, which are text files that contain the entry names and associated information. RAS creates a phone-book file called RASPHONE.PBK. The user can use the main <B>Dial-Up Networking</B> dialog box to create personal phone-book files. The Win32 API does not currently provide support for creating a phone-book file. Some RAS functions, such as the <B>RasDial</B> function, have a parameter that specifies a phone-book file. If the caller does not specify a phone-book file, the function uses the default phone-book file, which is the one selected by the user in the <B>User Preferences</B> property sheet of the <B>Dial-Up Networking</B> dialog box.</P>

<P>Windows NT version 4.0 provides the <A HREF="5jvd_gz.htm"><B>RasPhonebookDlg</B></A> and <A HREF="2dv.0__.htm"><B>RasEntryDlg</B></A> functions that display the built-in RAS user interface that enable users to work with phone books and phone-book entries. </P>

<P><B>Windows 95: </B>Dial-up networking stores phonebook entries in the registry rather than in a phonebook file. Windows 95 does not support personal phone-book files. Windows 95 does not support the functions that display the built-in RAS dialog boxes.</P>
