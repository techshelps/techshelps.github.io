<P>Windows 95 does not support the concept of switching Windows character sets so the role of MS Shell Dlg is more limited. It does, however, facilitate localization in that Windows 95 is equipped with a static entry to replace the standard system font. For example, the system font, MS San Serif, is easily replaced with MS San Serif Greek or another language. This also ensures compatibility with the applets provided with Windows NT.</P>
