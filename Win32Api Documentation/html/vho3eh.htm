<P>When the user transfers a scrap into your application, it should integrate the scrap as if it were being transferred from its original source. For example, if a selected range of cells from a spreadsheet is transferred to the desktop, they become a scrap. If the user transfers the resulting scrap into a word processing document, the cells should be incorporated as if they were transferred directly from the spreadsheet. Similarly, if the user transfers the scrap back into the spreadsheet, the cells should be integrated as if they were originally transferred within that spreadsheet.</P>

<P>Your application must include code that integrates a scrap into a document; otherwise, the embedding object of the scrap is copied into the document rather than the data associated with the scrap. To retrieve the data for the scrap, your application must examine the class identifier, CLSID, of the scrap object by retrieving the CF_OBJECTEDESCRIPTOR file format data. If the application recognizes the CLSID, the application should transfer the native data into the document rather than calling the <B>OleCreateFromData</B> function. </P>
