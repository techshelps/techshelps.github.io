<P>There are seven pen attributes that define the type of pen and its characteristics: width, style, color, pattern, hatch, end style, and join style. Both cosmetic and geometric pens have the width, style, and color attributes. Only geometric pens have the pattern, hatch, end style, and join style attributes. The pattern and optional hatch attribute are usually associated with a brush, but can also be used with geometric pens. </P>
