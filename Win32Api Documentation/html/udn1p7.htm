<P>Windows NT™ defines five types of event logging. Each event must be of a single type, because types cannot be combined. </P>

<TABLE cols=2>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=23%><B>Event type</B></TD>
<TD width=77%><B>Description</B></TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=23%>Information</TD>
<TD width=77%>Information events are used to note infrequent but significant successful operations. For example, when Microsoft SQL Server successfully loads, it may be appropriate to log a "SQL Server has started" information event. Note that while this is appropriate for major server services, it is generally inappropriate for a desktop application (Microsoft Excel, for example) to log an event each time it is started. Information events should not be used as a trace facility.</TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=23%>Warning</TD>
<TD width=77%>Warning events are used to indicate problems that are not significant, but that may foretell of future errors or other problems. Resource consumption is a good candidate for a Warning event. For example, a warning could be logged if disk space is low. Errors that are recovered without loss of function or data can be classified as warnings.</TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=23%>Error</TD>
<TD width=77%>Error events are used to indicate significant problems that have occurred and that the user should know about. Errors usually indicate a loss of functionality or data. For example, if a service cannot be loaded as the system boots, an Error event can be logged.</TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=23%>Success Audit</TD>
<TD width=77%>Success Audit events are security events that occur when an audited access attempt is successful. For example, a successful logon attempt is a Success Audit event.</TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=23%>Failure Audit</TD>
<TD width=77%>Failure Audit events are security events that occur when an audited access attempt fails. For example, a failed attempt to open a file is a Failure Audit event.</TD>
</TR>
