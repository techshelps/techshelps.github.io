<P><A NAME="sfjez2"></A><B>Exception Handling</B></P>

<P>Exceptions can be initiated by hardware or software, and can occur in kernel-mode as well as user-mode code. Win32-based structured exception handling provides a single mechanism for the handling of kernel-mode and user-mode exceptions, both hardware- and software-generated. </P>

<P>The execution of certain instruction sequences can result in exceptions that are initiated by hardware. For example, an access violation is generated by the hardware when a process attempts to read from or write to a virtual address to which it does not have the appropriate access. </P>

<P>Events that require exception handling may also occur during execution of a software routine (for example, when an invalid parameter value is specified). When this happens, a thread can initiate an exception explicitly by calling the <A HREF="3wwjv5.htm"><B>RaiseException</B></A> function. This function enables the calling thread to specify information that describes the exception. </P>
