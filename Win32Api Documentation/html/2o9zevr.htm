<P><A NAME="2o9zevr"></A><B>Tree-View Label Editing</B></P>

<P>The user can directly edit the labels of items in a tree-view control that has the TVS_EDITLABELS style. The user begins editing by clicking the label of the item that has the focus. An application begins editing by using the <A HREF="18il_7m.htm">TVM_EDITLABEL</A> message. The tree-view control notifies the parent window when editing begins and when it is canceled or completed. When editing is completed, the parent window is responsible for updating the item's label, if appropriate. </P>

<P>When label editing begins, a tree-view control sends its parent window a <A HREF="fqh5i0.htm">TVN_BEGINLABELEDIT</A> notification message. By processing this notification, an application can allow editing of some labels and prevent editing of others. Returning zero allows editing, and returning nonzero prevents it. </P>

<P>When label editing is canceled or completed, a tree-view control sends its parent window a <A HREF="g0iav6.htm">TVN_ENDLABELEDIT</A> notification message. The <I>lParam</I> parameter is the address of a <A HREF="q6dvuj.htm"><B>TV_DISPINFO</B></A> structure. The <B>item</B> member is a <A HREF="2ihaq35.htm"><B>TV_ITEM</B></A> structure that identifies the item and includes the edited text. The parent window is responsible for updating the item's label, if appropriate, perhaps after validating the edited string. The <B>pszText</B> member of <B>TV_ITEM</B> is zero if editing is canceled. </P>

<P>During label editing, typically in response to the <A HREF="fqh5i0.htm">TVN_BEGINLABELEDIT</A> notification message, you can get the handle of the edit control used for label editing by using the <A HREF="1mr0k70.htm">TVM_GETEDITCONTROL</A> message. You can send the edit control an <A HREF="116_reb.htm">EM_SETLIMITTEXT</A> message to limit the amount of text a user can enter or subclass the edit control to intercept and discard invalid characters. Note, however, that the edit control is displayed only <I>after</I> TVN_BEGINLABELEDIT is sent.</P>
