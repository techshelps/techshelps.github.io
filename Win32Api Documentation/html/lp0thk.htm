<P>An application can flatten the curves in a path by calling the <A HREF="3vur4r.htm"><B>FlattenPath</B></A> function. This function is especially useful for applications that fit text onto the contour of a path which contains curves. To fit the text, the application must perform the following steps: </P>

<P>1.Create the path where the text appears. </P>

<P>2.Call the <B>FlattenPath</B> function to convert the curves in a path into line segments. </P>

<P>3.Call the <A HREF="ix2yxf.htm"><B>GetPath</B></A> function to retrieve those line segments. </P>

<P>4.Calculate the length of each line and the width of each character in the string. </P>

<P>5.Use line-width and character-width data to position each character along the curve. </P>
