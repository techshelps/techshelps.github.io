<P><A NAME="14b5_og"></A><B>System Configuration</B></P>

<P>Several of the functions in the Win32 API are specifically intended to describe or change the system configuration. At startup, for example, a computer is assigned the name listed in the registry. An application can retrieve this name by using the <A HREF="3188tg.htm"><B>GetComputerName</B></A> function and can change the name by using the <A HREF="86rpbw.htm"><B>SetComputerName</B></A> function. <B>SetComputerName</B> changes the registry, not the current computer name. As a result, the new name is not assigned until the computer is restarted. For more information about the registry, see <A HREF="1y7hnby.htm">Registry</A>. </P>

<P>The <A HREF="35qklh5.htm"><B>GetUserName</B></A> function retrieves the name of the user currently logged onto the system. The user name is either the logon name or the user's full name, if the latter is included in the registry. </P>

<P>The <A HREF="nh29xo.htm"><B>GetSystemInfo</B></A> function retrieves processor and memory information, such as the page size, original equipment manufacturer (OEM) identifier, number and type of processors, application address range, and so on. The <A HREF="3_iy_yv.htm"><B>GetVersionEx</B></A> function retrieves the major and minor revision numbers of the installed version of Microsoft Windows. The <A HREF="hsogn7.htm"><B>GetKeyboardType</B></A> function retrieves such information as the type of keyboard and the number of function keys on the current keyboard. </P>

<P>The <A HREF="flzd_g.htm"><B>SystemParametersInfo</B></A> function retrieves or sets various system attributes, such as double-click time, screen saver time-out, window border width, and desktop pattern. When an application uses <B>SystemParametersInfo</B> to set a parameter, the change takes place immediately. This function also enables applications to update the user profile, so changes to the system will be preserved when the system is restarted. </P>

<P>The <A HREF="kx2gty.htm"><B>GetThreadDesktop</B></A> function retrieves a handle of the desktop for a given thread. This handle can be used in calls to functions that retrieve and set security attributes. </P>

<P>The <I>Windows directory</I> is the directory that contains Windows-based applications, initialization files, and Help files. The <A HREF="1b6tycn.htm"><B>GetWindowsDirectory</B></A> function retrieves the path to this directory. Applications that create files should do so in the Windows directory. This is the only directory guaranteed to be private to a user running a shared version of Windows. </P>

<P>The <I>system directory</I> is the directory that contains Windows libraries, drivers, and font files. The <A HREF="3oj42sv.htm"><B>GetSystemDirectory</B></A> function retrieves the path to this directory. </P>

<P>An <I>environment variable</I> is a symbolic variable that represents some element of the system, such as a path, a filename, or other literal data. For example, the environment variable PATH represents the directories in which to search for executable files. When a user logs on, the system initializes environment variables based on the environment section of the registry. The <A HREF="m7a4u4.htm"><B>ExpandEnvironmentStrings</B></A> function retrieves the values of specified environment variables. </P>

<P><I>System metrics</I> are the dimensions of various Windows display elements. (<I>Display elements</I> are the parts of a window and the Windows display that appear on the system display screen.) Typical system metrics include the window border width, icon height, and so on. System metrics also describe other aspects of the system, such as whether a mouse is installed, double-byte characters are supported, or a debugging version of Windows is installed. The <A HREF="jolchi.htm"><B>GetSystemMetrics</B></A> function retrieves a specified system metric. </P>

<P>Applications can also retrieve and set the color of window elements such as menus, scroll bars, and buttons by using the <A HREF="9s7o1d.htm"><B>GetSysColor</B></A> and <A HREF="1n8lj_j.htm"><B>SetSysColors</B></A> functions, respectively. </P>
