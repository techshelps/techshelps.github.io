<P><B>Parameters</B></P>

<P><I>lpApplicationName</I></P>

<P>Pointer to a null-terminated string that specifies the module to execute.</P>

<P>The string can specify the full path and filename of the module to execute. </P>

<P>The string can specify a partial name. In that case, the function uses the current drive and current directory to complete the specification. </P>

<P>The <I>lpApplicationName</I> parameter can be NULL. In that case, the module name must be the first white space-delimited token in the <I>lpCommandLine</I> string. </P>

<P>The specified module can be a Win32-based application. It can be some other type of module (for example, MS-DOS or OS/2) if the appropriate subsystem is available on the local computer. </P>

<P><B>Windows NT: </B>If the executable module is a 16-bit application, <I>lpApplicationName</I> should be NULL, and the string pointed to by <I>lpCommandLine</I> should specify the executable module. A 16-bit application is one that executes as a VDM or WOW process.  </P>

<P><I>lpCommandLine</I></P>

<P>Pointer to a null-terminated string that specifies the command line to execute. </P>

<P>The <I>lpCommandLine</I> parameter can be NULL. In that case, the function uses the string pointed to by <I>lpApplicationName</I> as the command line. </P>

<P>If both <I>lpApplicationName</I> and <I>lpCommandLine</I> are non-NULL, *<I>lpApplicationName</I> specifies the module to execute, and *<I>lpCommandLine</I> specifies the command line. The new process can use <A HREF="1xs07zy.htm"><B>GetCommandLine</B></A> to retrieve the entire command line. C runtime processes can use the <B>argc</B> and <B>argv</B> arguments. </P>

<P>If <I>lpApplicationName</I> is NULL, the first white space-delimited token of the command line specifies the module name. If the filename does not contain an extension, .EXE is assumed. If the filename ends in a period (.) with no extension, or the filename contains a path, .EXE is not appended. If the filename does not contain a directory path, Windows searches for the executable file in the following sequence: </P>

<P>1.The directory from which the application loaded. </P>

<P>2.The current directory for the parent process. </P>

<P>3.<B>Windows 95:</B> The Windows system directory. Use the <A HREF="3oj42sv.htm"><B>GetSystemDirectory</B></A> function to get the path of this directory.</P>

<P><B>Windows NT:</B> The 32-bit Windows system directory. Use the <B>GetSystemDirectory</B> function to get the path of this directory. The name of this directory is SYSTEM32.</P>

<P>4.<B>Windows NT:</B> The 16-bit Windows system directory. There is no Win32 function that obtains the path of this directory, but it is searched. The name of this directory is SYSTEM.</P>

<P>5.The Windows directory. Use the <A HREF="1b6tycn.htm"><B>GetWindowsDirectory</B></A> function to get the path of this directory. </P>

<P>6.The directories that are listed in the PATH environment variable. </P>

<P></P>

<P>If the process to be created is an MS-DOS - based or Windows-based application, <I>lpCommandLine</I> should be a full command line in which the first element is the application name. Because this also works well for Win32-based applications, it is the most robust way to set <I>lpCommandLine</I>. </P>

<P><I>lpProcessAttributes</I></P>

<P>Pointer to a <A HREF="be53kg.htm"><B>SECURITY_ATTRIBUTES</B></A> structure that determines whether the returned handle can be inherited by child processes. If <I>lpProcessAttributes</I> is NULL, the handle cannot be inherited. </P>

<P><B>Windows NT:</B> The <B>lpSecurityDescriptor</B> member of the structure specifies a security descriptor for the new process. If <I>lpProcessAttributes</I> is NULL, the process gets a default security descriptor. </P>

<P><B>Windows 95:</B> The <B>lpSecurityDescriptor</B> member of the structure is ignored.</P>

<P><I>lpThreadAttributes</I></P>

<P>Pointer to a <A HREF="be53kg.htm"><B>SECURITY_ATTRIBUTES</B></A> structure that determines whether the returned handle can be inherited by child processes. If <I>lpThreadAttributes</I> is NULL, the handle cannot be inherited. </P>

<P><B>Windows NT:</B> The <B>lpSecurityDescriptor</B> member of the structure specifies a security descriptor for the main thread. If <I>lpThreadAttributes</I> is NULL, the thread gets a default security descriptor. </P>

<P><B>Windows 95:</B> The <B>lpSecurityDescriptor</B> member of the structure is ignored.</P>

<P><I>bInheritHandles</I></P>

<P>Indicates whether the new process inherits handles from the calling process. If TRUE, each inheritable open handle in the calling process is inherited by the new process. Inherited handles have the same value and access privileges as the original handles. </P>

<P><I>dwCreationFlags</I></P>

<P>Specifies additional flags that control the priority class and the creation of the process. The following creation flags can be specified in any combination, except as noted: </P>

</TABLE><BR>

<P></P>

<P><I>lpEnvironment</I></P>

<P>Points to an environment block for the new process. If this parameter is NULL, the new process uses the environment of the calling process. </P>

<P>An environment block consists of a null-terminated block of null-terminated strings. Each string is in the form: </P>

<P>name=value  </P>

<P></P>

<P>Because the equal sign is used as a separator, it must not be used in the name of an environment variable. </P>

<P>If an application provides an environment block, rather than passing NULL for this parameter, the current directory information of the system drives is not automatically propagated to the new process. For a discussion of this situation and how to handle it, see the following Remarks section. </P>

<P>An environment block can contain Unicode or ANSI characters. If the environment block pointed to by <I>lpEnvironment</I> contains Unicode characters, the <I>dwCreationFlags</I> field's CREATE_UNICODE_ENVIRONMENT flag will be set. If the block contains ANSI characters, that flag will be clear.</P>

<P>Note that an ANSI environment block is terminated by two zero bytes: one for the last string, one more to terminate the block. A Unicode environment block is terminated by four zero bytes: two for the last string, two more to terminate the block.</P>

<P><I>lpCurrentDirectory</I></P>

<P>Points to a null-terminated string that specifies the current drive and directory for the child process. The string must be a full path and filename that includes a drive letter. If this parameter is NULL, the new process is created with the same current drive and directory as the calling process. This option is provided primarily for shells that need to start an application and specify its initial drive and working directory. </P>

<P><I>lpStartupInfo</I></P>

<P>Points to a <A HREF="d.kh8s.htm"><B>STARTUPINFO</B></A> structure that specifies how the main window for the new process should appear. </P>

<P><I>lpProcessInformation</I></P>

<P>Points to a <A HREF="fneyqd.htm"><B>PROCESS_INFORMATION</B></A> structure that receives identification information about the new process. </P>

<P></P>

<P><B>Return Values</B></P>

<P>If the function succeeds, the return value is nonzero.</P>

<P>If the function fails, the return value is zero. To get extended error information, call <A HREF="11c2vs7.htm"><B>GetLastError</B></A>. </P>

<P><B>Remarks</B></P>

<P>The <B>CreateProcess</B> function is used to run a new program. The <A HREF="12sap3t.htm"><B>WinExec</B></A> and <A HREF="l7hy._.htm"><B>LoadModule</B></A> functions are still available, but they are implemented as calls to <B>CreateProcess</B>. </P>

<P>In addition to creating a process, <B>CreateProcess</B> also creates a thread object. The thread is created with an initial stack whose size is described in the image header of the specified program's executable file. The thread begins execution at the image's entry point. </P>

<P>The new process and the new thread handles are created with full access rights. For either handle, if a security descriptor is not provided, the handle can be used in any function that requires an object handle of that type. When a security descriptor is provided, an access check is performed on all subsequent uses of the handle before access is granted. If the access check denies access, the requesting process is not able to use the handle to gain access to the thread. </P>

<P>The process is assigned a 32-bit process identifier. The identifier is valid until the process terminates. It can be used to identify the process, or specified in the <A HREF="9mlgut.htm"><B>OpenProcess</B></A> function to open a handle to the process. The initial thread in the process is also assigned a 32-bit thread identifier. The identifier is valid until the thread terminates and can be used to uniquely identify the thread within the system. These identifiers are returned in the <A HREF="fneyqd.htm"><B>PROCESS_INFORMATION</B></A> structure. </P>

<P>When specifying an application name in the <I>lpApplicationName</I> or <I>lpCommandLine</I> strings, it doesn't matter whether the application name includes the filename extension, with one exception: an MS-DOS - based or Windows-based application whose filename extension is .COM must include the .COM extension. </P>

<P>The calling thread can use the <A HREF="11.xgys.htm"><B>WaitForInputIdle</B></A> function to wait until the new process has finished its initialization and is waiting for user input with no input pending. This can be useful for synchronization between parent and child processes, because <B>CreateProcess</B> returns without waiting for the new process to finish its initialization. For example, the creating process would use <B>WaitForInputIdle</B> before trying to find a window associated with the new process. </P>

<P>The preferred way to shut down a process is by using the <A HREF="i5ihdk.htm"><B>ExitProcess</B></A> function, because this function notifies all dynamic-link libraries (DLLs) attached to the process of the approaching termination. Other means of shutting down a process do not notify the attached DLLs. Note that when a thread calls <B>ExitProcess</B>, other threads of the process are terminated without an opportunity to execute any additional code (including the thread termination code of attached DLLs). </P>

<P><A HREF="i5ihdk.htm"><B>ExitProcess</B></A>, <A HREF="c.xq03.htm"><B>ExitThread</B></A>, <A HREF="70ts0y.htm"><B>CreateThread</B></A>, <A HREF="19iu6kt.htm"><B>CreateRemoteThread</B></A>, and a process that is starting (as the result of a call by <B>CreateProcess</B>) are serialized between each other within a process. Only one of these events can happen in an address space at a time. This means the following restrictions hold: </P>

<P>·During process startup and DLL initialization routines, new threads can be created, but they do not begin execution until DLL initialization is done for the process. </P>

<P>·Only one thread in a process can be in a DLL initialization or detach routine at a time. </P>

<P>·The <B>ExitProcess</B> function does not return until no threads are in their DLL initialization or detach routines. </P>

<P></P>

<P>The created process remains in the system until all threads within the process have terminated and all handles to the process and any of its threads have been closed through calls to <A HREF="ngwwie.htm"><B>CloseHandle</B></A>. The handles for both the process and the main thread must be closed through calls to <B>CloseHandle</B>. If these handles are not needed, it is best to close them immediately after the process is created. </P>

<P>When the last thread in a process terminates, the following events occur: </P>

<P>·All objects opened by the process are implicitly closed. </P>

<P>·The process's termination status (which is returned by <A HREF="2mm.i..htm"><B>GetExitCodeProcess</B></A>) changes from its initial value of STILL_ACTIVE to the termination status of the last thread to terminate. </P>

<P>·The thread object of the main thread is set to the signaled state, satisfying any threads that were waiting on the object. </P>

<P>·The process object is set to the signaled state, satisfying any threads that were waiting on the object. </P>

<P></P>

<P>If the current directory on drive C is \MSVC\MFC, there is an environment variable called =C: whose value is C:\MSVC\MFC. As noted in the previous description of <I>lpEnvironment</I>, such current directory information for a system's drives does not automatically propagate to a new process when the <B>CreateProcess</B> function's <I>lpEnvironment</I> parameter is non-NULL. An application must manually pass the current directory information to the new process. To do so, the application must explicitly create the =X environment variable strings, get them into alphabetical order (because Windows NT and Windows 95 use a sorted environment), and then put them into the environment block specified by <I>lpEnvironment</I>. Typically, they will go at the front of the environment block, due to the previously mentioned environment block sorting. </P>

<P>One way to obtain the current directory variable for a drive X is to call <A HREF="8n6hyc.htm"><B>GetFullPathName</B></A><B>(</B>"X:",. .<B>)</B>. That avoids an application having to scan the environment block. If the full path returned is X:\, there is no need to pass that value on as environment data, since the root directory is the default current directory for drive X of a new process. </P>

<P>The handle returned by the <B>CreateProcess</B> function has PROCESS_ALL_ACCESS access to the process object. </P>

<P>The current directory specified by the <I>lpcurrentDirectory</I> parameter is the current directory for the child process. The current directory specified in item 2 under the <I>lpCommandLine</I> parameter is the current directory for the parent process.</P>

<P><B>Windows NT:</B> When a process is created with CREATE_NEW_PROCESS_GROUP specified, an implicit call to <B>SetConsoleCtrlHandler</B>(NULL,TRUE) is made on behalf of the new process; this means that the new process has CTRL+C disabled. This lets good shells handle CTRL+C themselves, and selectively pass that signal on to sub-processes. CTRL+BREAK is not disabled, and may be used to interrupt the process/process group. </P>
