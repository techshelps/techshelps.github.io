<P><A NAME="3z5r6v"></A><B>Application Global Classes</B></P>

<P>An <I>application global class</I> is a window class registered by a dynamic-link library (DLL) and available to all applications in the system. For example, your DLL can call the <A HREF="bs3x4c.htm"><B>RegisterClassEx</B></A> function to register a window class that defines a custom control as an application global class so that all applications can create instances of the custom control. </P>

<P>In Windows, all window classes are process specific. An application can create a global class by creating the window class in a DLL and listing the name of the DLL in the registry under the appropriate keys. </P>

<P>Whenever a process starts, the system loads the specified DLL in the context of the newly started process before calling the <B>main</B> function in that process. The DLL must register the class during its initialization procedure and must specify the CS_GLOBALCLASS style. (For more information about class styles, see <A HREF="2n48a2s.htm">Class Styles</A>.) After a class has been registered, any application can use it to create any number of windows belonging to that class. </P>

<P>Windows does not automatically destroy a class when the DLL that registered it is unloaded. For this reason, the Windows exit procedure of the DLL should call the <A HREF="x.pz98.htm"><B>UnregisterClass</B></A> function to remove the class.</P>
