<P>Modem configuration functions enable you to configure a modem before making a connection. An application can set modem options and determine the features of a modem without using commands specific to any modem device. Following are the general features an application may set before making a call:</P>

<P>·Primary mode of operation (synchronous, asynchronous, and whether error control is enabled).</P>

<P>·V.42 error control (defined by CCITT recommendation V.42), including specific parameters. CCITT stands for the International Telegraph and Telephone Consultative Committee.</P>

<P>·V.42bis (defined by CCITT recommendation V.42bis) and MNP5 data compression.</P>

<P>·Time-out options, including call setup, inactivity, and buffered data delivery.</P>

<P></P>

<P>Before setting a modem's configuration, an application should determine the capabilities of the modem device by using the <A HREF="16dv39w.htm"><B>GetCommProperties</B></A> function. This function fills in a <A HREF="5rpezr.htm"><B>COMMPROP</B></A> structure. This structure contains both a general portion, which applies to all communications devices, and a portion that is specific to each provider subtype. For modem devices, the provider-specific portion of the <B>COMMPROP</B> structure is a <A HREF="0xbd43.htm"><B>MODEMDEVCAPS</B></A> structure.</P>

<P>An application can get and set the current configuration of a modem by using the <A HREF="i1ootm.htm"><B>GetCommConfig</B></A> and <A HREF="1f4w4h_.htm"><B>SetCommConfig</B></A> functions, both of which use a <A HREF="x9mh_b.htm"><B>COMMCONFIG</B></A> structure. This structure contains both a general portion, which applies to all communications devices, and a portion that is specific to each provider subtype. For modem devices, the provider-specific portion of the <B>COMMCONFIG</B> structure is a <A HREF="muyhwn.htm"><B>MODEMSETTINGS</B></A> structure.</P>

<P>After configuring a modem, an application can use the telephony application programming interface (TAPI) to actually establish a connection.</P>

<P>The modem configuration functions do not provide for long-term management and maintenance of a modem. Modem service providers should supply modem configuration dialog boxes for this purpose.</P>
