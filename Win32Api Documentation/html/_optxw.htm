<P><I>System shutdown</I> brings the system to a condition in which it is safe to turn off the computer. All file-system buffers are flushed to the disk, then a message box is displayed informing the user that the computer can be turned off. There is also a reboot option that will restart the computer, rather than display this system shutdown message box. </P>

<P><I>Logging off</I> stops all processes associated with the security context of the process that called the exit function, logs the current user off the system, and displays the logon dialog box. </P>
