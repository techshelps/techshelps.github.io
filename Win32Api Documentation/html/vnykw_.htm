<P>You create a hot-key control by using the <A HREF="rpk.pc.htm"><B>CreateWindowEx</B></A> function, specifying the HOTKEY_CLASS window class. When the function returns a handle to the hot-key control, an application typically sets some rules about invalid hot-key combinations and provides perhaps a default key combination. If an application does not set any rules, the user can choose any key or key combination as a hot key. Most applications, however, do not allow the user to use a common key (for example, the letter A) as a hot key.</P>
