<P><A NAME="5fc2bh"></A><B>Cursor Destruction</B></P>

<P>When you no longer need a cursor you created by using the <A HREF="cid8s7.htm"><B>CreateIconIndirect</B></A> function, you should destroy the cursor. The <A HREF="1c3krch.htm"><B>DestroyCursor</B></A> function destroys the cursor handle and frees any memory that it used. Use this function only on cursors that were created with <B>CreateIconIndirect</B>; it is not necessary to destroy other cursors. </P>

<P>The <B>DestroyCursor</B> function has no effect on a shared cursor; that is, a cursor that was loaded by using the LR_SHARED flag with the <A HREF="11o6jxc.htm"><B>LoadImage</B></A> function. A shared cursor is valid as long as the module from which it was loaded remains in memory.</P>
