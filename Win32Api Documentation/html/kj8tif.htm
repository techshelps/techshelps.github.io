<P>The system provides location-independent names for shell links to objects stored in shared folders. If the object is stored locally, the system provides the local path and filename for the object. If the object is stored remotely, the system provides the Universal Naming Convention (UNC) network resource name for the object. Because the system provides location-independent names, a shell link can serve as a universal name for a file that can be transferred to other machines. </P>
