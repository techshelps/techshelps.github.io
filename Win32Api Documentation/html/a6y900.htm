<P>Applications can use the Windows networking functions to add and cancel network connections and to retrieve information about the current configuration of the network. </P>

<P>The following figure shows the structure of a typical network.</P>

<P><IMG SRC="../images/bm126.gif" ALT="" BORDER=0></P>

<P>In the preceding figure, the hierarchy for Microsoft Windows NT Server resources is given in detail as Network provider #1. Network resources from other providers have different hierarchical systems. An application does not need information about the hierarchy before it begins to work with a network. It can proceed from the network root (that is, the topmost container resource) and retrieve information about the network's resources as the information is required. </P>

<P>Network resources that contain other resources are called <I>containers</I>. Container resources are in boxes in the preceding figure.</P>

<P>Resources that do not contain other resources are <I>objects</I>. Sharepoint #1 and Sharepoint #2 in the figure are objects. A <I>sharepoint</I> is an object that is accessible across the network, such as a printer or a shared directory. </P>
