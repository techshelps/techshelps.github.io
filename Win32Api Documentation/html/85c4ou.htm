<P><A NAME="85c4ou"></A><B>ICMP Object</B></P>

<P>The ICMP performance object consists of counters that measure the rates at which ICMP messages are sent and received by using the ICMP protocols. It also includes counters that monitor ICMP protocol errors.</P>

<P><B>Messages/sec</B></P>

<P>Messages/sec is the total rate at which ICMP messages are sent and received by the entity. The rate includes those messages received or sent in error.</P>

<P>Detail Level: Advanced<BR>
Counter Type: PERF_COUNTER_COUNTER</P>

<P><B>Messages Received/sec</B></P>

<P>Messages Received/sec is the rate at which ICMP messages are received by the entity. The rate includes those messages received in error.</P>

<P>Detail Level: Advanced<BR>
Counter Type: PERF_COUNTER_COUNTER</P>

<P><B>Messages Received Errors</B></P>

<P>Messages Received Errors is the number of ICMP messages that the entity received but determined as having errors (bad ICMP checksums, bad length, etc.).</P>
