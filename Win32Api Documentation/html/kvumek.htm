<P>In waveform audio, the amount by which the waveform audio driver scales the playback rate. Playback scaling is accomplished through software; the sample rate is not changed, but the driver interpolates by skipping or synthesizing samples. For example, if the playback rate is changed by a factor of two, the driver skips every other sample.</P>
