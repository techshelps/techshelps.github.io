<P>In Microsoft® Windows®, files are stored on storage media, such as disks or tapes, and can be organized into groups called directories. The Windows file input and output (I/O) functions enable applications to create, open, modify, and delete files. They also enable applications to obtain system information, such as what disk drives are present. </P>
