<P><A NAME="gn9f33"></A><B>Persistent View State</B></P>

<P>The Explorer defines a set of standard view states: </P>

<P>·View mode, such as large/small icon view (or detail view) </P>

<P>·View attributes, such as snap to grid. </P>

<P></P>

<P>The Explorer provides a persistent medium to store these states and though using them is not required, it is recommended. The setting is passed to the view object by using <B>IShellView::CreateViewWindow</B> and retrieved from it by using <A HREF="1.zz_n3.htm"><B>IShellView::GetCurrentInfo</B></A><B>.</B></P>

<P>The Explorer also provides a persistent medium (a stream) to let the view object store view-specific information (such as scroll positions or icon layout). The view object can access this stream by calling<B> <A HREF="1282ewf.htm">IShellBrowser::GetViewStateStream</A></B>.</P>

<P>When the user is browsing from one folder to another, the Explorer passes the pointer to the previously viewed <B>IShellView</B> instance as a parameter to <A HREF="1ji2vwv.htm"><B>IShellView::CreateViewWindow</B></A> (before calling its <B>DestroyViewWindow</B>). This allows the next view object to retrieve appropriate view state from the previous view object (such as column widths of its details view), typically by calling <B>IUnknown::QueryInterface</B> on a private interface.</P>
