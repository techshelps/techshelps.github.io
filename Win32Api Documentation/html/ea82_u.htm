<P>Keys lie near the center of almost every cryptographic operation. It is important to keep these secret because whoever possesses a given key then has access to any data that key is associated with. For example, if a key is used to encrypt a file, then anyone with a copy of that key can easily decrypt the file. Furthermore, if the key is used to sign messages, then anyone possessing that key can forge the signatures.</P>
