<P>A volume is a storage device, such as a fixed disk or floppy disk, formatted to store directories and files. Each volume has a root directory. Directories and files on the volume are organized in a tree structure that starts at the root directory. Each directory entry identifies the name, attributes, location, and size of a file or subdirectory. </P>

<P>A large volume can be divided into more than one logical volume, also called a partition. To the user and to the operating system, each partition appears to be a separate volume. </P>

<P>A file system is operating system software that manages the low-level organization of files on a volume. Windows supports one or more of the following file systems: </P>

<P>·File Allocation Table (FAT) </P>

<P>·New Technology File System (NTFS) </P>

<P></P>

<P>The type of file system defines the filename conventions on a volume and may also provide specific file system features, such as security, recoverability, and high I/O performance. Each volume can use a different file system. </P>

<P>For more information on FAT and New Technology file systems, see <A HREF="3762oa.htm">File Systems</A>. </P>
