<P><A NAME="4rigc1"></A><B>Style</B></P>

<P>The style attribute specifies the line pattern that appears when a particular cosmetic or geometric pen is used. There are eight predefined pen styles. The following illustration shows the seven of these styles that are defined by Windows. </P>

<P><IMG SRC="../images/bm91.gif" ALT="" BORDER=0></P>

<P>The inside-frame style is identical to the solid style for cosmetic pens. However, it operates differently when used with a geometric pen. If the geometric pen is wider than a single pixel and a drawing function uses the pen to draw a border around a filled object, Windows draws the border <I>inside</I> the object's frame. By using the inside-frame style, an application can ensure that an object appears entirely within the specified dimensions, regardless of the geometric pen width. </P>

<P>In addition to the seven styles defined by Windows, there is an eighth style that is user (or application) defined. A user-defined style generates lines with a customized series of dashes and dots. </P>

<P>Use the <A HREF="10xg29a.htm"><B>CreatePen</B></A>, <A HREF="5f44_m_.htm"><B>CreatePenIndirect</B></A>, or <A HREF="6kg3d6.htm"><B>ExtCreatePen</B></A> function to create a pen that has the Windows-defined styles. Use the <B>ExtCreatePen</B> function to create a pen that has a user-defined style. </P>
