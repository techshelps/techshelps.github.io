<P><A NAME="2yz5kj"></A><B>The main Function</B></P>

<P>Service programs are generally written as console applications. The entry point of a console application is the <B>main</B> function. The main function receives arguments from the <B>ImagePath</B> value from the registry key for the service. </P>

<P>When the SCM starts a service program, it waits for it to call the <A HREF="1qmq_hc.htm"><B>StartServiceCtrlDispatcher</B></A> function. Use the following guidelines. </P>

<P>·A service of type SERVICE_WIN32_OWN_PROCESS should call <B>StartServiceCtrlDispatcher</B> immediately, from its main thread. You can perform any initialization after the service starts, as described in <A HREF="2f9qas.htm">The ServiceMain Function</A>. </P>

<P>·If the service type is SERVICE_WIN32_SHARE_PROCESS and there is common initialization for all services in the program, you can perform the initialization in the main thread before calling <B>StartServiceCtrlDispatcher</B>, as long as it takes less than 30 seconds. Otherwise, you must create another thread to do the common initialization, while the main thread calls <B>StartServiceCtrlDispatcher</B>. You should still perform any service-specific initialization as described in <A HREF="2f9qas.htm">The ServiceMain Function</A>. </P>

<P></P>

<P>The <A HREF="1qmq_hc.htm"><B>StartServiceCtrlDispatcher</B></A> function takes a <A HREF="5a9q_6u.htm"><B>SERVICE_TABLE_ENTRY</B></A> structure for each service contained in the process. Each structure specifies the service name and the entry point for the service. </P>

<P>If <B>StartServiceCtrlDispatcher</B> succeeds, the calling thread does not return until all running services in the process have terminated. The SCM sends control requests to this thread through a named pipe. The thread acts as a <I>control dispatcher</I>, performing the following tasks: </P>

<P>·Create a new thread to call the appropriate entry point when a new service is started. </P>

<P>·Call the appropriate <A HREF="1eqr9ip.htm"><B>Handler</B></A> function to handle service control requests. </P>

<P></P>
