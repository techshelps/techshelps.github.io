<P><A NAME="5exm9j"></A><B>IP Object</B></P>

<P>The IP performance object includes those counters that describe the rates at which IP datagrams are sent and received by a certain computer using the IP protocol. It also describes various error counts for the IP protocol. </P>

<P><B>Datagrams/sec</B></P>

<P>Datagrams/sec is the rate at which IP datagrams are received from or sent to the interfaces, including those in error. Any forwarded datagrams are not included in this rate.</P>

<P>Detail Level: Advanced<BR>
Counter Type: PERF_COUNTER_COUNTER</P>

<P><B>Datagrams Received/sec</B></P>

<P>Datagrams Received/sec is the rate at which IP datagrams are received from the interfaces, including those in error.</P>

<P>Detail Level: Advanced<BR>
Counter Type: PERF_COUNTER_COUNTER</P>

<P><B>Datagrams Received Header Errors</B></P>

<P>Datagrams Received Header Errors is the number of input datagrams discarded due to errors in their IP headers, including bad checksums, version number mismatch, other format errors, time-to-live exceeded, errors discovered in processing their IP options, etc.</P>

<P>Detail Level: Advanced<BR>
Counter Type: PERF_COUNTER_RAWCOUNT</P>

<P><B>Datagrams Received Address Errors</B></P>

<P>Datagrams Received Address Errors is the number of input datagrams discarded because the IP address in their IP header's destination field was not a valid address to be received at this entity. This count includes invalid addresses (e.g., 0.0. 0.0) and addresses of unsupported Classes (e.g., Class E). For entities that are not IP Gateways and therefore do not forward datagrams, this counter includes datagrams discarded because the destination address was not a local address.</P>

<P>Detail Level: Advanced<BR>
Counter Type: PERF_COUNTER_RAWCOUNT</P>

<P><B>Datagrams Forwarded/sec</B></P>

<P>Datagrams Forwarded/sec is the rate of input datagrams for that this entity was not their final IP destination, as a result of which an attempt was made to find a route to forward them to that final destination. In entities that do not act as IP Gateways, this rate will include only those packets that were Source-Routed via this entity, and the Source-Route option processing was successful.</P>

<P>Detail Level: Advanced<BR>
Counter Type: PERF_COUNTER_COUNTER</P>

<P><B>Datagrams Received Unknown Protocol</B></P>

<P>Datagrams Received Unknown Protocol is the number of locally-addressed datagrams received successfully but discarded because of an unknown or unsupported protocol.</P>

<P>Detail Level: Advanced<BR>
Counter Type: PERF_COUNTER_RAWCOUNT</P>

<P><B>Datagrams Received Discarded</B></P>

<P>Datagrams Received Discarded is the number of input IP datagrams for which no problems were encountered to prevent their continued processing, but which were discarded (e.g., for lack of buffer space). This counter does not include any datagrams discarded while awaiting re-assembly.</P>

<P>Detail Level: Advanced<BR>
Counter Type: PERF_COUNTER_RAWCOUNT</P>

<P><B>Datagrams Received Delivered/sec</B></P>

<P>Datagrams Received Delivered/sec is the rate at which input datagrams are successfully delivered to IP user-protocols (including ICMP).</P>

<P>Detail Level: Advanced<BR>
Counter Type: PERF_COUNTER_COUNTER</P>

<P><B>Datagrams Sent/sec</B></P>

<P>Datagrams Sent/sec is the rate at which IP datagrams are supplied to IP for transmission by local IP user-protocols (including ICMP). That this counter does not include any datagrams counted in Datagrams Forwarded.</P>

<P>Detail Level: Advanced<BR>
Counter Type: PERF_COUNTER_COUNTER</P>

<P><B>Datagrams Outbound Discarded</B></P>

<P>Datagrams Outbound Discarded is the number of output IP datagrams for which no problems were encountered to prevent their transmission to their destination, but which were discarded (e.g., for lack of buffer space.) This counter would include datagrams counted in Datagrams Forwarded if any such packets met this (discretionary) discard criterion.</P>

<P>Detail Level: Advanced<BR>
Counter Type: PERF_COUNTER_RAWCOUNT</P>

<P><B>Datagrams Outbound No Route</B></P>

<P>Datagrams Outbound No Route is the number of IP datagrams discarded because no route could be found to transmit them to their destination. This counter includes any packets counted in Datagrams Forwarded that meet this `no route' criterion.</P>

<P>Detail Level: Advanced<BR>
Counter Type: PERF_COUNTER_RAWCOUNT</P>

<P><B>Fragments Received/sec</B></P>

<P>Fragments Received/sec is the rate at which IP fragments that need to be re-assembled at this entity are received.</P>

<P>Detail Level: Advanced<BR>
Counter Type: PERF_COUNTER_COUNTER</P>

<P><B>Fragments Re-assembled/sec</B></P>

<P>Fragments Re-assembled/sec is the rate at which IP fragments are successfully re-assembled.</P>

<P>Detail Level: Advanced<BR>
Counter Type: PERF_COUNTER_COUNTER</P>

<P><B>Fragment Re-assembly Failures</B></P>

<P>Fragment Re-assembly Failures is the number of failures detected by the IP re-assembly algorithm (for whatever reason: timed out, errors, etc.) This is not necessarily a count of discarded IP fragments since some algorithms (notably RFC 815) can lose track of the number of fragments by combining them as they are received.</P>

<P>Detail Level: Advanced<BR>
Counter Type: PERF_COUNTER_RAWCOUNT</P>

<P><B>Fragmented Datagrams/sec</B></P>

<P>Fragmented Datagrams/sec is the rate at which datagrams are successfully fragmented at this entity.</P>

<P>Detail Level: Advanced<BR>
Counter Type: PERF_COUNTER_COUNTER</P>

<P><B>Fragmentation Failures</B></P>

<P>Fragmentation Failures is the number of IP datagrams that have been discarded because they needed to be fragmented at this entity but could not be, e.g., because their `Don't Fragment' flag was set.</P>

<P>Detail Level: Advanced<BR>
Counter Type: PERF_COUNTER_RAWCOUNT</P>

<P><B>Fragments Created/sec</B></P>

<P>Fragments Created/sec is the rate at which IP datagram fragments have been generated as a result of fragmentation at this entity.</P>

<P>Detail Level: Advanced<BR>
Counter Type: PERF_COUNTER_COUNTER</P>
