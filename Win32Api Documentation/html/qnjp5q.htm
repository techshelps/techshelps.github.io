<P>Before returning a handle that identifies that DC, the window manager selects a drawing surface into the DC. If the application called the <A HREF="14cje25.htm"><B>CreateDC</B></A> function to create a device context for a VGA display, the dimensions of this drawing surface are 640 by 480 pixels. If the application called the <A HREF="4f0b0z.htm"><B>GetDC</B></A> function, the dimensions reflect the size of the client area. </P>

<P>When an application passes the handle returned by <B>CreateDC</B> or <B>GetDC</B> to one of the graphics device interface (GDI) drawing functions, the requested output appears on the drawing surface selected into the device context. </P>
