<P><A NAME="2jn_ogc"></A><B>Active Window</B></P>

<P>An <I>active window</I> is the top-level window of the application with which the user is currently working. To allow the user to easily identify the active window, Windows places it at the top of the Z order and changes the color of its title bar and border to the system-defined active window colors. Only a top-level window can be an active window. When the user is working with a child window, Windows activates the top-level parent window associated with the child window. </P>

<P>Only one top-level window in the system is active at a time. The user activates a top-level window by clicking it (or one of its child windows), or by using the ALT+ESC or ALT+TAB key combination. An application activates a top-level window by calling the <A HREF="5222pp.htm"><B>SetActiveWindow</B></A> function. A number of other functions can cause Windows to activate a different top-level window, including <A HREF="4557_v1.htm"><B>SetWindowPos</B></A>, <A HREF="17fgvwe.htm"><B>DeferWindowPos</B></A>, <A HREF="7wyp18.htm"><B>SetWindowPlacement</B></A>, and <A HREF="1vrgccm.htm"><B>DestroyWindow</B></A>. Although an application can activate a different top-level window at any time, to avoid confusing the user, it should do so only in response to a user action. An application uses the <A HREF="m5nenp.htm"><B>GetActiveWindow</B></A> function to retrieve the handle of the active window. </P>

<P>When the activation changes from a top-level window of one application to the top-level window of another, Windows sends a <A HREF="1ny17rn.htm">WM_ACTIVATEAPP</A> message to both applications, notifying them of the change. When the activation changes to a different top-level window in the same application, Windows sends both windows a <A HREF="2yi0_zt.htm">WM_ACTIVATE</A> message. </P>
