<P>An application can use the <A HREF="18gndlx.htm"><B>HideCaret</B></A> function to remove the caret from the screen. This is useful when your application must redraw the screen while processing a message, but must keep the caret out of the way. When the application finishes drawing, it can display the caret again by using the <A HREF="wvypvc.htm"><B>ShowCaret</B></A> function. Hiding the caret does not destroy its shape or invalidate the insertion point. Hiding the caret is cumulative; that is, if the application calls <B>HideCaret</B> five times, it must also call <B>ShowCaret</B> five times before the caret will reappear. </P>

<P>An application can remove the caret from the screen and destroy its shape by using the <A HREF="5ew_as.htm"><B>DestroyCaret</B></A> function. <B>DestroyCaret</B> destroys the caret only if the window involved in the current task owns the caret. </P>
