<P>Windows automatically displays a cursor for the mouse and updates its position on the screen. You can obtain current screen coordinates of the cursor and move the cursor to any location on the screen by using the <A HREF=".p..gr.htm"><B>GetCursorPos</B></A> and <A HREF="1mr5nzr.htm"><B>SetCursorPos</B></A> functions, respectively. </P>

<P>You can also retrieve the handle of the current cursor by using the <A HREF="17pw7ux.htm"><B>GetCursor</B></A> function and you can set the cursor by using the <A HREF="5j4u25.htm"><B>SetCursor</B></A> function. After you call <B>SetCursor</B>, the appearance of the cursor does not change until either the mouse moves, the cursor is explicitly set to a different cursor, or a system command is executed. </P>

<P>When the user moves the mouse, the system redraws the cursor at the new location. The system automatically redraws the cursor design associated with the window to which the cursor is pointing. </P>

<P>You can hide and redisplay the cursor, without changing the cursor design, by using the <A HREF="ewiss9.htm"><B>ShowCursor</B></A> function. This function uses an internal counter to determine when to hide or display the cursor. An attempt to show the cursor increments the counter; an attempt to hide the cursor decrements the counter. The cursor is visible only if this counter is greater than or equal to zero. </P>
