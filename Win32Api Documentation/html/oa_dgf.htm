<P>In addition to having an access key, a menu item can have a shortcut key associated with it. A shortcut key is different from an access key, because the menu does not have to be active for the shortcut key to work. Also, an access key is <I>always</I> associated with a menu item, while an shortcut key is <I>usually</I> (but does not have to be) associated with a menu item. </P>

<P>Text that identifies the shortcut key is added to the menu-item text string. The shortcut text appears to the right of the menu item name, after a backslash and tab character (\t). For example, "&amp;Close\tAlt+F4" represents a <B>Close</B> command with the ALT+F4 key combination as its shortcut key and with the letter "C" as its access key. For more information, see <A HREF="2n5q1vx.htm">Keyboard Accelerators</A>. </P>
