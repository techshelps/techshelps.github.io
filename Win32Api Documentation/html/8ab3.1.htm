<P>After selecting an edit control, the user can select text in the control by using the mouse or the keyboard. An application can retrieve the starting and ending character positions of the current selection in an edit control by sending the control an <A HREF="12tnb14.htm">EM_GETSEL</A> message. The return value for the ending position is one greater than the last character in the selection (that is, the position of the first character following the last selected character). </P>

<P>An application can also select text in an edit control by sending the control an <A HREF="lkbbdo.htm">EM_SETSEL</A> message with the starting and ending character indices for the selection. For example, the application can use EM_SETSEL with <A HREF="18cwwdp.htm">EM_REPLACESEL</A> to delete text from an edit control. </P>

<P>These three messages apply to both single-line and multiline edit controls. </P>
