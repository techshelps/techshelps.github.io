<P><A NAME="pp6xh_"></A><B>About Rich Edit Controls</B></P>

<P>Rich edit controls support almost all of the messages and notification messages used with multiline edit controls. Thus, applications that already use edit controls can be easily changed to use rich edit controls. Additional messages and notifications enable applications to access the functionality unique to rich edit controls. For information about edit controls, see <A HREF="1irjn9a.htm">Edit Controls</A>. </P>

<P>An application can send messages to a rich edit control to perform such operations as formatting text, printing, and saving. An application can process notification messages to monitor events in a rich edit control. For example, an application can process notifications to filter keyboard and mouse input, to permit or deny changes to protected text, or to resize the control as needed to fit its content.</P>

<P>You create a rich edit control by using the <A HREF="rpk.pc.htm"><B>CreateWindowEx</B></A> function, specifying the "RichEdit" window class. You must call the <A HREF="1vghbf8.htm"><B>LoadLibrary</B></A> function to ensure that the RICHED32.DLL library is loaded before the rich edit control is created.</P>

<P>Rich edit controls support most of the window styles used with edit controls as well as additional styles. You should specify the ES_MULTILINE window style if you want to allow more than one line of text in the control.</P>
