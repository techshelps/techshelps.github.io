<P><A NAME="11jbo0b"></A><B>Class Ownership</B></P>

<P>The owner of a class is the application or DLL that registered the class. Windows determines class ownership from the <B>hInstance</B> member of the <A HREF="2d0j0kl.htm"><B>WNDCLASSEX</B></A> structure passed to the <A HREF="bs3x4c.htm"><B>RegisterClassEx</B></A> function when the class is registered. For Windows DLLs, the <B>hInstance</B> member <I>must</I> be the instance handle of the DLL. The class is destroyed when the owner closes or is unloaded. For this reason, the application must destroy all windows using the class before it closes or the DLL is unloaded. </P>
