<P><A NAME="5va9t4"></A><B>About System Power Status</B></P>

<P>System power status indicates the source of power for a computer, that is, whether it uses a system battery or AC power. For computers that use batteries, the status also indicates how much battery life remains and whether the battery is currently charging. </P>

<P>You can retrieve the system power status by using the <A HREF="269saic.htm"><B>GetSystemPowerStatus</B></A> function. This copies information about the power supply and battery status to a <A HREF="ekbuqi.htm"><B>SYSTEM_POWER_STATUS</B></A> structure. This structure identifies whether the system has a battery, and if it does, whether the battery is being used and the percentage of charge remaining.</P>

<P>Applications and installable drivers typically use the system power status to make decisions about whether to continue operation. For example, an application that is beginning a lengthy operation may check the status to determine whether enough battery power exists to complete the operation. </P>

<P>If power is low, an application can request user intervention or request that the system to shut itself down. You can suspend the operation of the system by using the <A HREF="l1da37.htm"><B>SetSystemPowerState</B></A> function. This generates a power management event that, if approved by all applications and drivers in the system, shuts the system down until the user restores power. Even if a computer uses AC power, an application that determines that the system is idle and can request that the system shut itself down to save power.</P>
