<P><A NAME="15gj0ly"></A><B>Predefined Keys</B></P>

<P>An application must open a key before it can add data to the registry. To open a key, an application must supply the handle of another key in the registry that is already open. The system defines standard handles that are always open. An application can use these predefined handles as entry points to the registry. </P>

<P>The system provides two predefined keys at the root of the registry: <B>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE</B> and <B>HKEY_USERS</B>. In addition, the system defines two subkeys: <B>HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT</B> (a subkey of <B>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE</B>) and <B>HKEY_CURRENT_USER</B> (a subkey of <B>HKEY_USERS</B>). These registry handles are valid for all Win32 implementations of the registry, although the use of the handles may vary from platform to platform.</P>

<P>Predefined keys help an application navigate in the registry and make it possible to develop tools that allow a system administrator to manipulate categories of data. Applications that add data to the registry should always work within the framework of predefined keys, so administrative tools can find and use the new data. </P>

<P>These predefined keys are used as entry points to the registry.</P>
