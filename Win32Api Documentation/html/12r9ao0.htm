<P>The <B>CREATE_PROCESS_DEBUG_INFO</B> structure contains process creation information that can be used by a debugger. </P>

<P>typedef struct _CREATE_PROCESS_DEBUG_INFO { // cpdi  </P>

<P>HANDLE hFile; </P>

<P>HANDLE hProcess; </P>

<P>HANDLE hThread; </P>

<P>LPVOID lpBaseOfImage; </P>

<P>DWORD dwDebugInfoFileOffset; </P>

<P>DWORD nDebugInfoSize; </P>

<P>LPVOID lpThreadLocalBase; </P>

<P>LPTHREAD_START_ROUTINE lpStartAddress; </P>

<P>LPVOID lpImageName; </P>

<P>WORD fUnicode; </P>

<P>} CREATE_PROCESS_DEBUG_INFO; </P>

<P></P>

<P><B>Members</B></P>

<P><B>hFile</B></P>

<P>Identifies an open handle of the process's image file. If this member is NULL, the handle is not valid. Otherwise, the debugger can use the member to read from and write to the image file. </P>

<P><B>hProcess</B></P>

<P>Identifies an open handle of the process. If this member is NULL, the handle is not valid. Otherwise, the debugger can use the member to read from and write to the process's memory. </P>

<P><B>hThread</B></P>

<P>Identifies an open handle of the initial thread of the process identified by the <B>hProcess</B> member. If <B>hThread</B> is NULL, the handle is not valid. Otherwise, the debugger has THREAD_GET_CONTEXT, THREAD_SET_CONTEXT, and THREAD_SUSPEND_RESUME access to the thread, allowing the debugger to read from and write to the registers of the thread and to control execution of the thread. </P>

<P><B>lpBaseOfImage</B></P>

<P>Points to the base address of the executable image that the process is running. </P>

<P><B>dwDebugInfoFileOffset</B></P>

<P>Specifies the offset to the debugging information in the file identified by the <B>hFile</B> member. The kernel expects the debugging information to be in Microsoft® CodeView® version 4.0 format. This format is currently a derivative of COFF (Common Object File Format). </P>

<P><B>nDebugInfoSize</B></P>

<P>Specifies the size, in bytes, of the debugging information in the file. If this value is zero, there is no debugging information. </P>

<P><B>lpThreadLocalBase</B></P>

<P>Points to a block of data. At offset 0x2C into this block is another pointer, called ThreadLocalStoragePointer, that points to an array of per-module thread local storage blocks. This gives a debugger access to per-thread data in the threads of the process being debugged using the same algorithms that a compiler would use. </P>

<P><B>lpStartAddress</B></P>

<P>Points to the starting address of the thread. This value may only be an approximation of the thread's starting address, because any application with appropriate access to the thread can change the thread's context by using the <A HREF="0wtukc.htm"><B>SetThreadContext</B></A> function. </P>

<P><B>lpImageName</B></P>

<P>Points to the filename associated with the <I>hFile</I> parameter. This parameter may be NULL, or it may contain the address of a string pointer in the address space of the process being debugged. That address may, in turn, either be NULL or point to the actual filename. If <B>fUnicode</B> is a nonzero value, the name string is Unicode; otherwise, it is ANSI. </P>

<P>This member is strictly optional. Debuggers must be prepared to handle the case where <B>lpImageName</B> is NULL or *<B>lpImageName</B> (in the address space of the process being debugged) is NULL. Specifically, Windows does not provide an image name for a create process event, and will not likely pass an image name for the first DLL event. Windows also does not provide this information in the case of debug events that originate from a call to the <B>DebugActiveProcess</B> function. </P>

<P><B>fUnicode</B></P>

<P>Indicates whether a file name specified by the <B>lpImageName</B> member is Unicode or ANSI. A nonzero value indicates Unicode; zero indicates ANSI. </P>
