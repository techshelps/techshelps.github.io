<P><A NAME="12h4j5d"></A><B>File and Directory Objects</B></P>

<P>File and directory objects can be secured only when the New Technology file system (NTFS) is in use. </P>

<P>The <A HREF="a48e53.htm">access rights</A> for files and directories must be manipulated by using the generic access rights. </P>

<P>For file objects, the handle returned by the <A HREF="xn35yd.htm"><B>CreateFile</B></A> function has SYNCHRONIZE access and the right to read file attributes, in addition to the access rights specified in the call (GENERIC_READ, GENERIC_WRITE, or both). </P>

<P>GENERIC_READ access for file objects combines STANDARD_RIGHTS_READ and SYNCHRONIZE with rights that allow the process to read data from the file, read file attributes, and read extended attributes. </P>

<P>GENERIC_WRITE access for file objects combines STANDARD_RIGHTS_WRITE and SYNCHRONIZE with rights that allow the process to write data to the file, append data to it, write file attributes, and write extended attributes. </P>

<P>An application cannot use an access-denied ACE to deny only GENERIC_READ or GENERIC_WRITE access to a file. If an application denies GENERIC_WRITE access to a file, SYNCHRONIZE access is implicitly denied. When the <B>CreateFile</B> function is used in an attempt to open the file for read access, the function requests SYNCHRONIZE access and the operation fails. Instead of denying read or write access to a file, an application can explicitly allow the permitted access rights. </P>

<P>For directory objects, the handle returned by the <A HREF="f6nd8.htm"><B>CreateDirectory</B></A> function has SYNCHRONIZE access and the right to list the contents of the directory. </P>

<P>For more information about files and directories, see <A HREF="qnj9so.htm">Files</A>. </P>
