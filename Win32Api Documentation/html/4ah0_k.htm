<P><A NAME="4ah0_k"></A><B>Write-through to Remote Clients</B></P>

<P>The write-through mode of a named pipe handle affects the behavior of byte-type pipes when data is transmitted across a network. To enable write-through mode for a named pipe handle, a process specifies the FILE_FLAG_WRITE_THROUGH flag in the <A HREF="21dzyt.htm"><B>CreateNamedPipe</B></A> function for a server process or in the <A HREF="xn35yd.htm"><B>CreateFile</B></A> function for a client process. If this flag is not specified, write-through mode is disabled. The write-through mode of a pipe handle cannot be changed after the pipe handle has been created. The write-through mode can be different for server and client handles to the same pipe instance. </P>

<P>If write-through mode is not enabled, the system enhances the efficiency of network operations by buffering data until a minimum number of bytes have accumulated or until a maximum time period has elapsed. Buffering enables multiple write operations to be combined into a single network transmission. This means that a write operation can be successfully completed after the data is in the outbound buffer but before it is transmitted across the network. </P>

<P>A client process can use the <A HREF="ap5lb1.htm"><B>SetNamedPipeHandleState</B></A> function to control the number of bytes and the time-out period before transmission for a pipe on which write-through mode is disabled. </P>

<P>If write-through mode is enabled, the transmission across the network is not delayed and the write operation is not completed until the data is in the pipe buffer on the remote machine. Write-through mode is useful for applications that require synchronization for every write operation. </P>

<P>The system always performs write operations on message-type pipes as if write-through mode were enabled. </P>
