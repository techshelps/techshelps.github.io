<P><A NAME="xxb7qw"></A><B>List View Image Lists</B></P>

<P>The icons for list view items are contained in image lists, which you create and assign to the list view control. One image list contains the full-sized icons used in icon view, and a separate image list contains smaller versions of the same icons for use in other views. You can also specify a third image list that contains <I>state images,</I> which are displayed next to an item's icon to indicate an application-defined state.</P>

<P>You assign an image list to a list view control by using the <A HREF="fdtn44.htm">LVM_SETIMAGELIST</A> message, specifying whether the image list contains full-sized icons, small icons, or state images. You can use the <A HREF="jolchi.htm"><B>GetSystemMetrics</B></A> function to determine appropriate dimensions for the full-sized and small icons and the <A HREF="ctydoz.htm"><B>ImageList_Create</B></A> function to create the image lists. For more information about image lists, see <A HREF="mk1vkp.htm">Image Lists</A>. </P>

<P>You can retrieve the handle of an image list currently assigned to a list view control by using the <A HREF="duh0ot.htm">LVM_GETIMAGELIST</A> message.</P>

<P>The full-sized and small icon image lists typically contain icons for each type of list view item. You do not need to create both of these image lists if only one is used ¾ for example, if a list view control is never in icon view. If you create both image lists, they must contain the same images in the same order because a single value is used to identify a list view item's icon in both image lists.</P>

<P>The full-sized and small icon image lists can also contain <I>overlay images,</I> which are designed to be superimposed on item icons. A nonzero value in bits 8 through 11 of a list view item's state specifies the one-based index of an overlay image (zero indicates no overlay image). Because a 4-bit, one-based index is used, overlay images must be among the first 15 images in the image lists. For more information about list view item states, see <A HREF="kbxs8g.htm">Item States</A>.</P>

<P>If a state image list is specified, a list view control reserves space to the left of each item's icon for a state image. An application can use state images, such as checked and cleared check boxes, to indicate application-defined item states. A nonzero value in bits 12 through 15 specifies the one-based index of a state image (zero indicates no state image). State images are typically not used in icon view.</P>

<P>By default, a list view control destroys the image lists assigned to it when it is destroyed. However, if a list view control has the LVS_SHAREIMAGELISTS window style, the application is responsible for destroying the image lists when they are no longer in use. You should specify this style if you assign the same image lists to multiple list view controls; otherwise, more than one control might try to destroy the same image list.</P>
