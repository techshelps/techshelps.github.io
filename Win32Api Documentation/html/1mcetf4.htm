<P><A NAME="1mcetf4"></A><B>About Processes and Threads</B></P>

<P>Each process provides the resources needed to execute a program. A process has a virtual address space, executable code, data, object handles, environment variables, a base priority, and minimum and maximum working set sizes. Each process is started with a single thread, often called the <I>primary thread</I>, but can create additional threads from any of its threads. </P>

<P>All threads of a process share its virtual address space and system resources. In addition, each thread maintains exception handlers, a scheduling priority, and a set of structures the system will use to save the thread context until it is scheduled. The <I>thread context</I> includes the thread's set of machine registers, the kernel stack, a thread environment block, and a user stack in the address space of the thread's process. </P>

<P>Windows NT and Windows 95 support <I>preemptive multitasking</I>, which creates the effect of simultaneous execution of multiple threads from multiple processes. On a multiprocessor computer, Windows NT can simultaneously execute as many threads as there are processors on the computer.</P>
