<P><A NAME="sozhtp"></A><B>Clip Paths and Graphic Effects</B></P>

<P>An application can use clipping and paths to create special graphic effects. The following illustration shows a string of text drawn with a large Arial font. </P>

<P><IMG SRC="../images/bm89.gif" ALT="" BORDER=0></P>

<P>The next illustration shows the result of selecting the text as a clip path and drawing radial lines for a circle whose center is located above and left of the string. </P>

<P><IMG SRC="../images/bm90.gif" ALT="" BORDER=0></P>

<P></P>

<P><B>Note</B>  Before graphics device interface (GDI) adds text created with a bitmapped font to a path, it converts the font to an outline or vector font. </P>

<P></P>

<P>An application creates a clip path by generating a path bracket and then calling the <A HREF="3uheu35.htm"><B>SelectClipPath</B></A> function. After a clip path is selected into a DC, output only appears within the borders of the path. </P>

<P>In addition to creating special graphics effects, clip paths are also useful in applications that save images as enhanced metafiles. By using a clip path, an application is able to ensure device independence because the units used to specify a path are logical units (as opposed to device units that are used to specify a region). </P>
