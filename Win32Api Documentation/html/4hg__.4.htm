<P><A NAME="4hg__.4"></A><B>Color Profiles</B></P>

<P>A <I>color profile</I> is a file that contains information that defines the color capabilities of a device. A color profile for a display monitor, for example, defines the chromaticities of the phosphors for that monitor; one for a printer defines the chromaticities of the inks on a given type of paper. The system uses this information when mapping logical colors to the physical colors available on the device.</P>

<P>Color profiles exist for display monitors, printers, and scanners. By default, the system uses the color profile that best matches a given device, based on information in the profile and provided by the device driver. If a color profile is not present for a given device, the system uses a default profile for that device.</P>

<P>In some cases, it may be important to let the user choose the color profile to use for a given device. This can occur when the device configuration has changed in a way that the system cannot detect. You can enumerate all color profiles for a device by using the <A HREF="4yf74g.htm"><B>EnumICMProfiles</B></A> function. This identifies each color profile by passing its filename to an <A HREF="2jgbvzb.htm"><B>EnumICMProfilesProc</B></A> callback function that you supply. You can set the color profile for the device by using the <A HREF="zz4rmp.htm"><B>SetICMProfile</B></A> function. You can determine the current color profile for the device by using the <A HREF="2vxbz5.htm"><B>GetICMProfile</B></A> function. </P>

<P>A color profile is available only if it is listed in the registry. You can install or remove color profiles in the registry by using the <A HREF="2wohyre.htm"><B>UpdateICMRegKey</B></A> function. You can also use this function to query for printer profiles that match specified device settings, or to associate a color profile with a given color-matching DLL and output device.</P>
