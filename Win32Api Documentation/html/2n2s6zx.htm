<P><A NAME="2n2s6zx"></A><B>About Common Control Messages</B></P>

<P>Because common controls are windows, an application can manipulate them by using messages, such as <A HREF="1vgvkcu.htm">WM_GETFONT</A> or <A HREF="_0kjsb.htm">WM_SETTEXT</A>. In addition, the window class of each common control supports a set of control-specific messages that an application can use to manipulate the control. An application can use any of the message sending or posting functions to pass messages to the control. In addition, some common controls have a set of macros that an application can use instead of the sending or posting functions. The macros are typically easier to use than the functions. </P>

<P>When a change is made to the system color settings, Windows sends a <A HREF="11r.jvh.htm">WM_SYSCOLORCHANGE</A> message to all top level windows. Your top level window must forward the WM_SYSCOLORCHANGE message to its common controls; otherwise, the controls will not be notified of the color change. This ensures that the colors used by your common controls are consistent with those used by other user interface objects. For example, a toolbar control uses the "3D Objects" color to draw its buttons. If the user changes the 3D Objects color but the WM_SYSCOLORCHANGE message is not forwarded to the toolbar, the toolbar buttons will remain in their original color while the color of other buttons in the system changes.</P>
