<P><A NAME="ozsepn"></A><B>Gamut Matching Method</B></P>

<P>The <I>gamut matching method</I> determines how colors on a given device are "matched" with colors on another device. The type of matching needed depends on the image. There are some images for which users rarely want image color matching. For example, users like saturated, undithered colors in bar charts and highlights used in presentations ¾ the device colors are far superior to dithered patterns of primary colors. </P>

<P>Gamut-matching methods include the following:</P>

<P>·Business graphics</P>

<P>Preserves saturation (prevents dithering) if the requested color is not available. Useful for business charts and many computer-generated presentations.</P>

<P>·Colormetric</P>

<P>Produces exact colormetric matches. Dithers primary colors if necessary. Colormetric matching is important when named colors are wanted. </P>

<P>·Photographic</P>

<P>Produces the best perceptual match between devices. Takes advantage of the entire gamut of the device to maximize the number of distinct colors presented. This is best for photographic images.</P>

<P></P>

<P>You set the gamut-matching method for a device context by setting the <B>lcsIntent</B> member in the <A HREF="1nir.71.htm"><B>LOGCOLORSPACE</B></A> structure when creating the color space. The matching choices for the display and printer are global settings; they apply to all applications at all times.</P>

<P>In some cases, a user may want to use different matching methods in the same document. For example, the user may want to use the colormetric method to draw the company logo but the business graphics method for bar charts. You can mix gamut-matching methods on the same page of output by creating appropriate color spaces and using <A HREF="3lrf_ln.htm"><B>SetColorSpace</B></A> to switch between the spaces as needed. </P>
