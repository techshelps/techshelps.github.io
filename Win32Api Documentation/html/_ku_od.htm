<P><A NAME="_ku_od"></A><B>Class Menu</B></P>

<P>A <I>class menu</I> defines the default menu to be used by the windows in the class if no explicit menu is given when the windows are created. A menu is a list of commands from which a user can choose actions for the application to carry out. </P>

<P>You can assign a menu to a class by setting the <B>lpszMenuName</B> member of the <A HREF="2d0j0kl.htm"><B>WNDCLASSEX</B></A> structure to the address of a null-terminated string that specifies the resource name of the menu. The menu is assumed to be a resource in the given application. Windows automatically loads the menu when it is needed. Note that if the menu resource is identified by an integer and not by a name, the application can set the <B>lpszMenuName</B> member to that integer by applying the <A HREF="xfoy9_.htm"><B>MAKEINTRESOURCE</B></A> macro before assigning the value. </P>

<P>Windows does not require a class menu. If an application sets the <B>lpszMenuName</B> member of the <B>WNDCLASSEX</B> structure to NULL, Windows assumes the windows in the class have no menu bars. Even if no class menu is given, an application can still define a menu bar for a window when it creates the window. </P>

<P>Windows does not allow menu bars with child windows. If a menu is given for a class and a child window of that class is created, the menu is ignored. For more information, see <A HREF="quf.8o.htm">Menus</A>. </P>
