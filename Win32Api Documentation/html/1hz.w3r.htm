<P>A status window can have many different parts, each displaying a different line of text. You divide a status window into parts by sending the window an <A HREF="2b_k_fp.htm">SB_SETPARTS</A> message, specifying the number of parts to create and the pointer to an integer array. The array contains one element for each part, and each element specifies the client coordinate of the right edge of a part. </P>

<P>A status window can have a maximum of 255 parts, although applications typically use far fewer than that. You retrieve a count of the parts in a status window, as well as the coordinate of the right edge of each part, by sending the window an <A HREF="3cb.c2.htm">SB_GETPARTS</A> message. </P>
