<P>Word processing sections contain text organized as paragraphs, tables, and subdocuments. Of these, paragraphs and tables can have attributes, such as indentation, tab stops, and spacing. The text in word processing sections consists of characters having attributes, such as typeface, height, and weight. Word processing sections can also include embedded objects, allowing bitmapped art and other graphics to be included with the text.</P>

<P>A file parser processes the text associated with a word processing section when the display engine calls the <A HREF="22gc0au.htm"><B>VwStreamReadFunc</B></A> function. The file parser must set all attributes before calling the <A HREF="19e90d8.htm"><B>SOPutChar</B></A> function or other text output functions. The file parser must never automatically set an attribute as a default. If the state of a current attribute is not known, the file parser must not set it.</P>
