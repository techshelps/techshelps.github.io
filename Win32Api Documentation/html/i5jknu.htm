<P>A square box operated by the user to choose from a set of related but independent options. A checked check box contains an X. Repeatedly checking a check box toggles it from state to state. A standard check box has two states: checked and unchecked. A three-state check box has an additional state: disabled (grayed). In versions of standard and three-state check boxes, Windows is responsible for changing the state of the check box.</P>
