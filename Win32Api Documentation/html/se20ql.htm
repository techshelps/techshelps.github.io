<P><A NAME="se20ql"></A><B>Combined Lines and Curves</B></P>

<P>In addition to drawing lines or curves, Windows-based applications can draw combinations of line and curve output by calling a single function. For example, an application can draw the outline of a pie chart by calling the <A HREF="28jjz8z.htm"><B>AngleArc</B></A> function.</P>

<P>The <B>AngleArc</B> function draws an arc along a circle's perimeter and draws a line connecting the starting point of the arc to the circle's center. In addition to using the <B>AngleArc</B> function, a Windows-based application can also combine line and irregular curve output by using the <A HREF="62je.d.htm"><B>PolyDraw</B></A> function. </P>
