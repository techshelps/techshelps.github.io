<P>The mouse is an important, but optional, user-input device for applications written for Microsoft® Windows®. A well-written Windows-based application should include a mouse interface, but it should not depend on the mouse as the sole means of acquiring user input. The application should provide full keyboard support as well. </P>

<P>A Windows-based application receives mouse input in the form of messages that are sent or posted to its windows. </P>
