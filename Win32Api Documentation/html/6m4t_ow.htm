<P>Information structures will not contain embedded strings. This improves the alignment of the information structures and allows for OEM flexibility in the core functions. This does not change the feel of the LAN Manager 2.<I>x</I> functions that support string pointers. Code porting merely requires a pointer assignment rather than a string copy.</P>

<P>Any information field that is returned in an enumeration call that can be subsequently used as a key for a GetInfo call is guaranteed to be present in the enumeration buffer. If the variable-length information string that would specify the key field value will not fit, then the entire fixed-length structure for the entry is not returned. Other variable-length fields will be returned as a NULL pointer for the case in which the string does not fit as with LAN Manager 2.<I>x</I>.</P>
