<P><A NAME="32yyq3x"></A><B>About Carets</B></P>

<P>An application uses the <A HREF="1yn2nek.htm"><B>CreateCaret</B></A> function to specify the parameters for a caret. Windows forms a caret by inverting the pixel color within the rectangle specified by the caret's position, width, and height. The width and height are specified in logical units; therefore, the appearance of a caret is subject to the window's mapping mode. </P>

<P>After the caret is defined, an application uses the <A HREF="wvypvc.htm"><B>ShowCaret</B></A> function to make the caret visible. When the caret appears, it automatically begins flashing. To display a solid caret, Windows inverts every pixel in the rectangle; to display a gray caret, Windows inverts every other pixel; to display a bitmap caret, Windows inverts only the white bits of the bitmap. </P>

<P>The elapsed time, in milliseconds, required to invert the caret is called the <I>blink time</I>. The user can set the blink time of the caret using the Control Panel and applications should respect the settings that the user has chosen. An application can determine the caret's blink time by using the <A HREF="19b5_wz.htm"><B>GetCaretBlinkTime</B></A> function. If you are writing an application that allows the user to adjust the blink time, such as a Control Panel applet, use the <A HREF="32dx4w7.htm"><B>SetCaretBlinkTime</B></A> function to set the rate of the blink time to a specified number of milliseconds. The <I>flash time</I> is the elapsed time, in milliseconds, required to display, invert, and restore the caret's display. The flash time of a caret is twice as much as the blink time. </P>

<P>An application can determine the caret's position by using the <A HREF="x9qm8s.htm"><B>GetCaretPos</B></A> function. The position, in client coordinates, is copied to a <A HREF="44vp0_.htm"><B>POINT</B></A> structure specified by a parameter in <B>GetCaretPos</B>. An application can move a caret in a window by using the <A HREF=".agg3v.htm"><B>SetCaretPos</B></A> function. A window can move a caret only if it already owns the caret. <B>SetCaretPos</B> can move the caret whether it is visible or not. </P>
