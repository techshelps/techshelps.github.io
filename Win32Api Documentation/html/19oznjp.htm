<P><A NAME="19oznjp"></A><B>Filenames</B></P>

<P>In Windows, the ANSI character set is used in window manager and GDI; the MS-DOS FAT file system uses the OEM character set. Windows applications that create MS-DOS files have sometimes had to use the <A HREF="15jl0zq.htm"><B>CharToOem</B></A> and <A HREF="llrx4c.htm"><B>OemToChar</B></A> functions to translate between these character sets. However, the New Technology file system (NTFS) is capable of storing filenames in Unicode; no translation is necessary with NTFS. </P>

<P>With Unicode implementations of the file-system functions, it is not necessary to perform translations to and from ANSI and OEM character sets. Instead, a developer can use a single source file to compile non-Unicode versions of an application by providing macros for functions that are not invoked when compiling for Unicode, such as <B>CharToOem</B> and <B>OemToChar</B>. </P>

<P>The special filename characters in MS-DOS are unchanged in Unicode filenames: </P>

<P>"\," "/," ".," "?," "*." </P>

<P>These special characters are in the ASCII range of characters (0x00 through 0x7F) and their Unicode equivalents are simply the same values in a 2-byte form: 0x0000 through 0x007F. </P>
