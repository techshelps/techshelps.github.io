<P>Windows provides an application programming interface (API) that lets you take advantage of appbar services provided by the system. The services help ensure that application-defined appbars operate smoothly with one another and with the taskbar. The system maintains information about each appbar and sends the appbars messages to notify them about events that can effect their size, position, and appearance. </P>
