Document formats were initially developed to reflect the features and behavior of one or more applications (the features and behavior of productivity applications can be quite different). For example, OpenDocument Format (ODF) was originally developed to reflect the features and behavior of OpenOffice-based productivity suites and OpenXML was originally developed to reflect the features and behavior of Microsoft Office. Microsoft Office now provides support for ODF and gives Microsoft Office users the opportunity to save their documents in ODF. However, because Microsoft Office and OpenOffice features are not exactly the same or are not implemented the same way, Microsoft Office users who use the <b class="bterm">Unsupported Features</b> (see below for a list of links for these features) and save documents in ODF may experience changes in the editability of the document and sometimes see a loss of content.</p><p>For more information on the level of support in ODF 1.1 for commonly used features of Office, see the links below.  This shows which Office features are fully, partially, or not supported in the ODF 1.1 format.</p><ul><li>
				<b class="runinhead">Supported</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;   Both the relevant application in Office and the relevant part of ODF 1.1 support this feature.  Content, formatting and usability will not be lost.</li><li>
				<b class="runinhead">Partially Supported</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;   Both the relevant application in Office and the relevant part of ODF 1.1 supports this feature, but formatting and usability might be affected.  No text or data is lost, but formatting and how you work with text, graphics or aspects of the document might be different.</li><li><b class="runinhead">Not Supported</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;   The feature in the relevant application in Office is not supported in the relevant part of ODF 1.1.  If you plan to save your document in ODF 1.1, do not use this feature or you risk losing content, formatting and usability of that part of your document.</li></ul><p>To learn more about ODF generally, see:</p><ul><li><a href="http://r.office.microsoft.com/r/rlidAWSContentRedir?AssetID=XT103525541033&amp;CTT=11&amp;Origin=HA103874411033" target="_new">OASIS standards organization</a></li><li><a href="http://r.office.microsoft.com/r/rlidAWSContentRedir?AssetID=XT103525551033&amp;CTT=11&amp;Origin=HA103874411033" target="_new">ISO organization</a></li></ul><p>To learn more about the differences in file formats, see:</p><ul><li><a href="ossFeatureComparisonODFExcel_HA10387443.htm" id="HA10387443" lcid=" ">Differences between the OpenDocument Spreadsheet (.ods) format and the Excel (.xlsx) format</a></li><li><a href="ossFeatureComparisonODFPPT_HA10387442.htm" id="HA10387442" lcid=" ">Differences between the OpenDocument Presentation (.odp) format and the PowerPoint (.pptx) format</a></li><li><a href="ossFeatureComparisonODFWord_HA10387444.htm" id="HA10387444" lcid=" ">Differences between the OpenDocument Text (.odt) format and the Word  (.docx) format</a></li></ul><META NAME="CreationDate" CONTENT="2009-01-07"></body><script async src="https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=UA-83731338-2"></script><script>  window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || [];  function gtag(){dataLayer.push(arguments);}  gtag('js', new Date());  gtag('config', 'UA-83731338-1');</script><script async src="https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=UA-83731338-2"></script><script>  window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || [];  function gtag(){dataLayer.push(arguments);}  gtag('js', new Date());  gtag('config', 'UA-83731338-2');</script></html>
