			installation of   the Microsoft Office 2010. When you run OCT, you choose whether to create a new Setup customization file or open an existing one. If you are creating a new file, OCT  displays a list of the products available on the network installation point. You must select a single product that you want to customize. To start OCT, type
			<b class="bterm">setup.exe /admin</b> on the command line.</p><hr><p><b class="cntnote">&nbsp;Note&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;The Office 2010 OCT requires version 4.0 or later of Windows Installer on all computers running Office, including the computer you use to run OCT.</p><hr><p><h2 id="">Setup customization files</h2> By using OCT, you customize Office and  save your customizations
				in a Setup customization file (.msp file), and then place the file in the Updates folder on the network installation point. When you install Office, Setup looks for a Setup customization file in the Updates folder and, if found, applies those customizations. If you put the customization file somewhere other than the Updates folder, you can use the Setup command-line option
				<b class="bterm">/adminfile</b> to specify the fully qualified path to the file; for example, <b class="bterm">setup.exe /adminfile \\</b><i>server_name</i><b class="bterm">\</b><i>share_name</i><b class="bterm">\</b><i>subfolder</i><b class="bterm">\</b><i>custom.msp</i>.
			</p><p>For information about Setup command-line options, see  <i>Setup command-line options for Office 2010</i> in the Microsoft Office 2010 Resource Kit.</p><hr><p><b class="cntnote">&nbsp;Note&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;If you use a folder other than the Updates folder for your customization files, you can specify its location in the Config.xml file by using the <b class="bterm">SUpdateLocation</b> attribute of the <b class="bterm">SetupUpdates</b> element. For more information, see <i>Config.xml file in Office 2010</i> in the Microsoft Office 2010 Resource Kit.</p><hr><p>You also can use a Setup customization file to change an existing installation. Because a Setup customization file is an expanded form of a   Windows Installer .msp file, you apply the customization file to the user's computer just as you would a software update, and the user's existing Office installation is updated with your customizations. For example, if you change the installation states of some features to <b class="bterm">Not Available</b> and then apply the resulting customization file to an existing installation of Office, those features are removed from the user's computer.</p><p>If you use the OCT to modify an existing .msp customization file, we recommend that you select the .msp file for the same product you are customizing. For example, if you are customizing an existing Microsoft Office Professional Plus 2010 installation, select an   Office Professional Plus 2010    customization .msp file. </p><p> OCT provides support for importing Setup customization updates as follows: 
<ul><li>32-bit Setup customization updates can be imported into 64-bit OCT and can then be used to customize 64-bit Office products.</li><li>64-bit Setup customization updates can be imported to 32-bit OCT and can then be used to customize 32-bit Office products.
</li></ul></p><p>
A 32-bit Setup customization update that is imported to 64-bit OCT is converted to 64-bit, and a 64-bit customization update that is imported to 32-bit OCT is converted to 32-bit. To import a customization update (.msp file), in the Office Customization Tool, select <b class="bterm">Import</b> on the <b class="bterm">File</b> menu. In the <b class="bterm">Open</b> dialog box, select the .msp file that you want to convert, and then click <b class="bterm">Open</b> to start the conversion.
 </p><hr><p><b class="cntnote">&nbsp;&nbsp;Notes&nbsp;&nbsp;</b><p>Importing customization .msp files is intended for equivalent cross-architecture products only. You can import a 32-bit Microsoft Office Professional Plus 2010 customization .msp file into the 64-bit version of the OCT for a 64-bit Office Professional Plus 2010 .msp file. However, you cannot import a 32-bit Microsoft Word 2010 stand-alone customization .msp file into the 64-bit OCT for a 64-bit Office Professional Plus 2010 .msp file; doing so is prevented and displays an error message. For information about how to use the OCT to create a Setup customization file and about all the areas that you can configure with the OCT, see <i>Office Customization Tool in Office 2010</i> in the Microsoft Office 2010 Resource Kit.</p><p>You cannot import 2007 Office system Setup customization updates into Office 2010 OCT.</p></p><hr><p>The Import feature can also be used in cases where you have created an initial Setup customization .msp file for an Office 2010  product (for example, Microsoft Office Professional Plus 2010) and later you want to modify the installation to add language packs for that product. In such cases, you first add the language packs to the network installation point that contains the Office product source files. Then you run the OCT from the root of the network installation point, create a new Setup customization file for the same product, and import the original customization .msp file that you created previously for  the product (Office Professional Plus 2010 in this example). To import the .msp file, in the OCT, on the <b class="ui">File</b> menu, click <b class="ui">Import</b>. In the <b class="ui">Open</b> dialog box, select the previously created customization .msp file that you want to update. On the <b class="ui">File</b> menu, click <b class="ui">Save As</b>. Specify a unique name for the .msp file, and click <b class="ui">Save</b>. Importing the previously created customization .msp file into the OCT will update the .msp file and include the added languages.</p><p>For more information about how to import an .msp customization file, see <i>Import an Office 2010 Setup customization file</i> in the Microsoft Office 2010 Resource Kit. For information about how to create a network installation point, see <i>Create a network installation point for Office 2010</i> in the Microsoft Office 2010 Resource Kit.</p><p>There are some options in OCT that are applicable only on a new installation of Office. These options are identified in OCT and in the OCT Help file. For example, you can use the <b class="bterm">INSTALLLOCATION</b> element to specify the folder where Office is installed on the user's computer. If a customization file is applied to an existing installation, however, the <b class="bterm">INSTALLLOCATION</b> element is ignored. (You need to uninstall and reinstall Office to change the installation location.)</p><p>Select <b class="bterm">Save</b> on the <b class="bterm">File</b> menu to save the Setup customization file before you exit OCT.</p><p><h2 id="">Configuring OCT</h2>OCT consists of following four major sections, each of which is divided into a number of pages containing the following customizable options:</p><ul><li>
				<b class="bterm">Setup</b>
				<ul><li> Installation location and organization name</li><li>Additional network sources</li><li>Licensing and user interface</li><li>Remove previous installations</li><li>Add installations and run programs</li><li>Office security settings</li><li>Modify Setup properties</li></ul></li><li><b class="bterm">Features</b><ul><li> Modify user settings</li><li>Set feature installation states</li></ul>
