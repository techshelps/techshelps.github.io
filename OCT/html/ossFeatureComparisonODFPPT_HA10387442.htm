Likewise, you might also see formatting differences when you open an OpenDocument file in PowerPoint 2010. This is because of the different features that the file formats support.</p><p><b class="cntnote">&nbsp;Note&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;The differences you will experience when you work with the two file formats is generally constrained to formatting differences and feature availability. Data and content will convert, but how you format and interact with the data and content might be different between the formats.</p><p>If you want to switch your default file format to or from ODF or OpenXML (or other formats) , do the following:</p><ol><li>Click the <b class="ui">File</b>  tab.</li><li>Under <b class="ui">Help</b>, click <b class="ui">Options</b>.</li><li>Click<b class="ui"> Save</b>, and then under <b class="ui">Save presentations</b>, in the <b class="ui">Save files in this format</b> list, click the file format that you want to use by default.</li></ol><h2 id="">What happens when I save a PowerPoint 2010 presentation in the OpenDocument Presentation format?</h2><p>The table below shows which PowerPoint 2010 features are
