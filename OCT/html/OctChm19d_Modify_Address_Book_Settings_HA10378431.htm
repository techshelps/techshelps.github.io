Select among the following options:<dl><dd><b class="bterm">Download changes since last Send/Receive</b> – Outlook downloads only the changes that have been made to the Address Book since the last Send/Receive. This generally takes less time to download than downloading the entire Address Book.</dd><dd><b class="bterm">Full Details</b> – When downloading the Address Book, Outlook copies all of the details for each entry.</dd><dd><b class="bterm">No Details</b> – When the address book is downloaded, Outlook copies only essential information, such as the name and e-mail address for each entry. This takes less time to download, but address details are not included in the offline address book. This is a legacy option supported by Outlook Address Book (OAB) versions 2.0 and 3.0. If Outlook connects to a server that supports OAB 4.0 or later, the full details will be downloaded even if this option is checked.</dd></dl>
