This message has the following cause and solution:
<ul type=disc>
<li>
The server connection has been lost, so source control was disabled.<p class=tl>
Once the connection to the VSS database is restored, restart the program you were using integration with (for example, Visual C, Visual Basic, or Visual J) to use source control.</P></li>
