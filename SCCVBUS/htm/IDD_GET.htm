<p>
Retrieves a <a href="ssugglossary.htm#gloss_readonlyfile">read-only</a> copy of the selected VSS items. To get the most recent version, click <b>Get Latest Version</b> on the <b>VSS</b> menu. To get an older version, click <b>Get</b> in the <b>History of File</b> or <b>History of Project</b> dialog box.</p>
<h4>Access Rights</h4>
<p>
You must have the Read <a href="ssugglossary.htm#gloss_accessrights">access right</a> to use this command. You should have a working folder set before using this command.</p>
<h4>Remarks</h4>
<p>
The <b>Get Latest Version</b> command retrieves the most recent version of a file, a group of files, or an entire <a href="ssugglossary.htm#gloss_project">project</a> from VSS and creates read-only copies for viewing or compiling in your <a href="ssugglossary.htm#gloss_workingfolder">working folder</a>. </p>
<p class=indent>
<B><b>Note&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</b></B>You can choose a different working folder for the current Get operation by typing a new path in the <b>Get Latest Version</b> dialog box. Click <b>Browse</b> to navigate your folders.</p>
<p>
Getting a file does not replace the file that you currently have checked out in your working folder, unless you set the Replace advanced option.</p>
<h3>Results of a Get Operation</h3>
<p>
Using the <b>Get Latest Version</b> command has four possible outcomes:
<ul type=disc>
<li>
When the file you are retrieving is not already in your working folder, VSS simply gets the file.<br><br></li>
<li>
When the file in your working folder is identical to the file you are retrieving, VSS does not retrieve or modify the file in any way.<br><br></li>
<li>
When the file in your working folder is different from the VSS <a href="ssugglossary.htm#gloss_mastercopy">master copy</a>, and your local copy is read-only, VSS replaces your <a href="ssugglossary.htm#gloss_localcopy">local copy</a>.<br><br></li>
<li>
When the file in your working folder is not read-only, VSS assumes that you have the file checked out, and doesn't replace the file. You can change the way VSS behaves in this case with the Replace Writable option in the <b>Local Files</b> tab of the <b>Options</b> dialog box.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Merging with the Get Latest Version Command</h3>
<p>
In a <a href="ssugglossary.htm#gloss_multiplecheckout">multiple checkout</a> situation, you can use the <b>Get Latest Version</b> command to retrieve other users' changes before checking in your version of the file. You can tell VSS to merge the changes into your local copy of the file, or you can specify that you want to verify each change before permitting the merge. To do this, set the Replace Checked Out Files option to Merge on the <b>Local Files</b> tab in the <b>SourceSafe Options</b> dialog box.</p>
<h3>Dialog Box Options</h3>
<p>
If you enable the <b>Get Latest Version</b> command dialog box on the <b>Command Dialogs</b> tab in the <b>SourceSafe Options</b> dialog box on the <b>Tools</b> menu, or hold down the SHIFT key when you click the <b>Get Latest Version</b> command, you have the following options:</p>
<h4>To</h4>
<p>
Type the path where you want VSS to place the files.</p>
<h4>Recursive (project-level Get only)</h4>
<p>
Gets a project, all the files in the project, and its subprojects. Each file in a subproject is copied into its own working folder, which can be a folder anywhere on your computer or an accessible remote computer. To override the working folder settings, and create a file structure that mirrors the VSS project structure, use the Build Tree option.</p>
<h4>Build Tree<img src="endash.gif" border=0>Override Working Folders (project-level Get only)</h4>
<p>
Overrides the working folder set for the subprojects involved in a recursive operation, and builds a project tree on your local computer that mirrors the project organization. Working folder settings for individual subprojects are ignored. Available only when you select the <b>Recursive</b> check box.</p>
<h4>Make Writable</h4>
<p>
Sets the read/write flag so the file is writable. This is not the default behavior, but may be useful if you want to try a temporary change in the file, or want to rename the file after getting it.</p>
<h3>Advanced Options</h3>
<p>
You can also set the defaults for the first three advanced options on the <b>Local Files</b> tab in the <b>SourceSafe Options</b> dialog box on the <b>Tools</b> menu.</p>
<h4>Set File Time</h4>
<p>
Changes the time assigned to the get operation. Select one of the following in the list box: current time, last file modification time, last file check-in time, or the default time (set on the <b>Local Files</b> tab).</p>
<h4>Replace Writable</h4>
<p>
Determines how VSS behaves when you try to get a file that is already marked as writable in your working folder. Select one of the following in the list box:
<ul type=disc>
<li>
Ask. Asks you what to do when a writable version of a file is found.<br><br></li>
<li>
Replace. Replaces the writable file with a read-only version.<br><br></li>
<li>
Skip. Skips the get operation for the writable file. An error is displayed in the Results window if it is open.<br><br></li>
<li>
Merge. Merges the changes between the checked-out file and the one you are now getting. If the file cannot be merged (for example, it is a binary file), the get operation is skipped for that file, and an error is displayed in the Results window if it is open.<br><br></li>
<li>
Default. Uses defaults set on the <b>Local Files</b> tab or inherited from a parent project. </li>
</ul>
<h4>Skip This Dialog</h4>
<p>
Skips this dialog box during future get operations, and uses the settings you've entered as the default. To restore the dialog box, clear the appropriate box on the <b>Command Dialogs</b> tab in the <b>SourceSafe Options</b> dialog box. Pressing the SHIFT key when clicking the <b>Get Latest Version</b> command displays this dialog box, overriding the setting on the <b>Command Dialogs</b> tab.</p>
