<p>
Allows you to edit a source-controlled file by ensuring that it is checked out and then opening the file in the associated editor.</p>
<h4>Access Rights</h4>
<p>
You must have Write permission to use this command.</p>
<h4>Remarks</h4>
<p>
When you select <b>Edit File</b>, VSS first checks to be sure you have the file checked out. If you do not, the file is checked out to you unless something prevents this, such as the file being already checked out by another user (when your VSS administrator has not enabled multiple check outs for that project). </p>
<p>
After the file is checked out to you, VSS opens the file. You can select an editor by clicking the <b>Advanced</b> button on the <b>File</b> dialog box. </p>
<p>
The default editor is selected by one of the following means, in the following order:
<ol>
<li>
VSS looks in its initialization files for a line with the extension of the file being viewed. <br><br></li>
<li>
VSS uses Microsoft Windows Explorer (the registration database and Win.ini) to associate an application with the file extension.<br><br></li>
<li>
VSS looks for your entry in the File Viewer option on the <b>General</b> tab in the <b>SourceSafe Options</b> dialog box.<br><br></li>
<li>
If VSS cannot determine a file association after using these methods, it displays the file using its own editor. </li>
</ol>
<p class=indent>
<B><b>Note&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</b></B>If no editor can be found for a specific file type, the file will remain checked out to you in your working directory, so you can open the file normally with the editor of your choice.</p>
<p>
You can also set the double-click behavior of VSS on the <b>General</b> tab of the <b>Tools Options</b> dialog box. Setting the Double-click on a file option to Edit File will allow you to double-click on a file in VSS to edit it; however, setting the option to Ask is recommended (so you don't accidentally write over a local file during the check out operation). </p>
