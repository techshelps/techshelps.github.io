<p>
Copies all the changes made in one branch of a file to another branch. Works for files only, not projects.</p>
<h4>Access Rights</h4>
<p>
You must have the Check Out <a href="ssugglossary.htm#gloss_accessrights">access right</a> in the project being merged into, and the Read access right in the project being merged from, to use this command. You should have a working folder set before using this command.</p>
<h4>Remarks</h4>
<p>
Merge copies the changes made in one file into another file (on a separate development path) in VSS. If the merge creates <a href="ssugglossary.htm#gloss_conflict">conflicts</a>, VSS checks out the file to your <a href="ssugglossary.htm#gloss_workingfolder">working folder</a> if it wasn't already checked out. You can then modify the file and resolve any conflicts before checking the file back into VSS.</p>
<p>
For example, project $/Newapp is currently shipping version 5. The development team has started working on version 6, when suddenly a big customer calls with a serious bug in version 5. The Newapp project is branched at that point so that the development team can continue working on version 6 while a crack bug team works on fixing the version 5 bug (perhaps their project is named $/Bugfix). Up to the branch point, the projects are identical, but after the branch the code in each project differs. </p>
<p>
Just before version 6 ships, the Bugfix team announces they have corrected the bug. You decide to merge their code into the Newapp project so version 6 of your product has the fix. You select one file at a time in the Newapp project and choose the <b>Merge Branches</b> command.</p>
<p>
After the merge operation, you still have two independent development paths, but the changes made in $/Bugfix have been copied to $/Newapp. Before you choose the <b>Merge Branches</b> command, be sure you have the file selected that you want to merge changes <i>into</i>. (The file you are merging changes <i>from</i> will be unchanged.)</p>
<p class=indent>
<B><b>Note&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</b></B>You cannot merge binary files.</p>
