This message has the following cause and solution:
<ul type=disc>
<li>
The files you have selected, the VSS <a href="ssugglossary.htm#gloss_mastercopy">master copy</a> and the <a href="ssugglossary.htm#gloss_localcopy">local copy</a>, are identical. You may have selected a file in the <a href="ssugglossary.htm#gloss_filelist">file list</a> and tried to run the <b>Show Differences</b> command only on that file, in which case the file is being compared to itself and is by definition identical.<p class=tl>
In this case, before applying the <b>Show Differences</b> command again, specify two distinct files.</P></li>
