<p>
This message has the following cause and solution:
<ul>
<li>
You have not added source control programs to your computer.</li>
</ul>
<p>
The source code control commands are therefore not available.  Choose Yes to display this warning the next time you try to use source control commands, or No to disable this warning message.</p>
<p>
For VSS users, run NETSETUP.EXE from your VSS folder to get source control capabilities. For other source control providers, re-run Setup for your provider.</p>
