<p>
This message has the following cause and solution:
<ul type=disc>
<li>
This is an informational message only, generated while performing an Archive.&nbsp; Archive did not delete a file you asked it to, because it contains a portion of history for a file which is branched elsewhere and still active.<p class=tl>
If you need to delete the file, you'll need to track down all branches of the file (via the <b>Paths</b> tab on the <b>Properties</b> dialog box), then tell Archive to delete all branches of the file, too.</P></li>
