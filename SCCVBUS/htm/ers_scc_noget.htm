<h1><a name="ers_scc_noget"></a>No files are available to get from source code control.</h1>
<p>
This message has the following cause and solution:
<ul>
<li>
You chose the Get command, but after careful checking, no files were available for the operation.  </li>
</ul>
<p>
This error sometimes occurs if someone deletes the file that you wanted to operate on (or deletes the whole project, for that matter)- make sure your project is still there.  Next, make sure you have something checked out.</p>
