<h1><a name="idd_proj_diff"></a>Difference for Project Dialog Box</h1>
<p>
<img src="projdiff.gif" border=0></p>
<p>
Shows the differences between files in the selected <a href="ssugglossary.htm#gloss_vssdatabase">VSS database</a> project and the <a href="ssugglossary.htm#gloss_workingfolder">working folder</a> set for that project.&nbsp; You can also see what is different within a file, and reconcile differences if desired.</p>
<p class=label>
<b>To display the Differences For Project dialog box:</b>
<ol>
<li>
Select a project in the <a href="ssugglossary.htm#gloss_projectpane">project pane</a> of <a href="ssugglossary.htm#gloss_vssexplorer">VSS Explorer</a>.<br><br></li>
<li>
On the <b>Tools</b> menu, click <b>Show Differences</b>.&nbsp; Select options in the <b>Project Difference</b> dialog box (if it's enabled), then click <b>OK</b>.</li>
</ol>
<p class=indent>
<B><b>Note&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</b></B>To enable the display of the <b>Project Difference</b> dialog box, check the <b>Difference</b> checkbox in the <b>Project</b> column on the <b>Command Dialogs</b> tab in the <b>SourceSafe Options</b> dialog box (<b>Tools</b> menu).</p>
<p>
<b>Dialog Box Options</b></p>
<p>
This powerful dialog is composed of two panes, one showing the files in your current project (on the left) and the other showing files in the working folder assigned to the current project (on the right).&nbsp; This dialog also has its own toolbar, with buttons for adding files, deleting files, getting files, checking files out and in, undoing file check outs, viewing files, reconciling the differences between the project and working folder, and more.</p>
<p>
Files in both panes are sorted alphabetically, by file name or folder name (if there are subfolders).&nbsp; Remember that the list of files in the right and left panes is filtered by the choices you made in the <b>Show Differences</b> command dialog.&nbsp; For example, if you choose to show only files that are different in both places, you will not see files that are the same in both your working folder and your current project.&nbsp; You can size the columns in the left pane by dragging the column bar with your left mouse button.&nbsp; Pressing F5 will refresh your dialog box with current information (but may be slow for large projects).</p>
<p>
There are four types of files which may appear in the lists.
<ul type=disc>
<li>
Files that are the same in project and your working folder appear in black letters against a white background by default.&nbsp; There is no action you need to take for these files.<br><br></li>
<li>
Files that are in the project, but not in your working folder, appear in blue against a gray background by default.&nbsp; Such a file generally represents a file that another user added to the project (in which case you may wish to Get it), or a file that you deleted from your working folder (in which case you may wish to delete it from VSS).<br><br></li>
<li>
Files that are in your working folder, but not in the project, appear in green against a gray background by default.&nbsp; Such a file generally represents a file that you created (in which case you may wish to <b>Add</b> it to VSS), or which another user deleted from the project (in which case you may wish to delete your local copy).<br><br></li>
<li>
Files that are in both places, but <i>different,</i> appear in red against a gray background by default.&nbsp; Such a file generally represents a file which you have checked out (which you may wish to check in), or a file which another user has checked in (which you may wish to Get).</li>
</ul>
<p class=indent>
<B><b>Note&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</b></B>You can set your default colors for added, changed, and deleted text by using the <b>Difference</b> tab of the <b>Tools Options</b> dialog box.</p>
<p>
The above is a complete list of the four types of files, but not a complete list of the possibilities.&nbsp; For instance, if another user renames a file in VSS you will see a file you do not actually have, in the <b>File List</b> for that project in VSS Explorer; and in your working folder for the project there will be a file that is not present in the VSS database. So you would want to get VSS's file, and delete your local one, to reconcile the differences.</p>
<p>
File icons in the left pane of the dialog box represent the same things they do in the main Explorer window <img src="emdash.gif" border=0> a checkmark next to a file means the file is checked out, etc.&nbsp; File icons in the right pane represent conditions specific to you <img src="emdash.gif" border=0> for example, a checkmark in the right pane means the file is checked out to you specifically, in your working folder.&nbsp; Double-clicking a file views it.&nbsp; Double-clicking a folder does nothing.</p>
<p>
Toolbar commands in this dialog generally work in the same way as the standard VSS commands, but some work slightly different, as follows:
<ul type=disc>
<li>
<img src="addbutton.gif" border=0> The <b>Add</b> command moves a file or directory from the right pane to the left pane.&nbsp; In other words, it adds a file that is in your working folder to the VSS project.&nbsp; The keyboard shortcut for this command is the Windows95 application key + A.<br><br></li>
<li>
<img src="delbutton.gif" border=0> The <b>Delete</b> command works normally if a file in the left pane is selected.&nbsp; If a file in the right pane is selected, you can use the <b>Delete</b> command to delete the local file or directory from your working folder. The keyboard shortcut for this command is the <b>Delete</b> key.<br><br></li>
<li>
<img src="getbutton.gif" border=0> The <b>Get Latest Version</b> command works normally, getting a file or project from the left pane to the right pane.&nbsp; The keyboard shortcut for this command is the Windows95 application key + G.<br><br></li>
<li>
<img src="cobutton.gif" border=0> The <b>Check Out</b> command works normally, reconciling the differences between a file that is different between panes and is not checked out in the right pane, by checking out the file and overwriting the file in your local working folder. The keyboard shortcut for this command is the Windows95 application key + O.<br><br></li>
<li>
<img src="cibutton.gif" border=0> The <b>Check In</b> command works normally, reconciling a file that is in both panes, but different, and is checked out in both panes. With this command, you save the latest changes to the file in your working folder.&nbsp; The keyboard shortcut for this command is the Windows95 application key + I.<br><br></li>
<li>
<img src="ucobutton.gif" border=0> The <b>Undo Check Out</b> command works normally, reconciling a file that is different between panes and is checked out in both panes by undoing the check out on the file.&nbsp; With this command, you lose the latest changes to the file in your working folder.&nbsp; The keyboard shortcut for this command is the Windows95 application key + U.<br><br></li>
<li>
<img src="viewbutton.gif" border=0> The <b>View</b> command works on a file selected in the left pane just like the Explorer's <b>View</b> command <img src="emdash.gif" border=0> it displays the file in the VSS database. The <b>View</b> command works on a file selected in the right pane by opening the appropriate viewer directly on the file in the folder. The keyboard shortcut for this command is the Windows95 application key + V.<br><br></li>
<li>
<img src="diffbutton.gif" border=0> The <b>Difference</b> command compares two selected files.&nbsp; If only one file is selected, <b>Difference</b> compares it between the VSS project and the folder. The keyboard shortcut for this command is the Windows95 application key + S.<br><br></li>
<li>
<img src="refresh.gif" border=0> The <b>Refresh File List</b> command brings the file list up to date.<br><br></li>
<li>
<img src="reconbutton.gif" border=0> The <b>Reconcile All</b> command reconciles differences found in the compared projects.&nbsp; Reconciliation can mean several different things, depending on the settings you choose in the dialog boxes that are displayed after you choose this command.&nbsp; <br><br></li>
<li>
<img src="repbutton.gif" border=0> The <b>Report</b> command generates the standard <b>Report</b> dialog box. The keyboard shortcut for this command is the F5 key.</li>
</ul>
<p class=indent>
<B><b>Note&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</b></B>If you use a mouse, you can access many of the preceding commands with the right mouse button</p>
