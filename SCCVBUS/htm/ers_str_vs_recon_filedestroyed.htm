VSS may not be able to reproduce the file you requested. This error has the following cause and solution:
<ul type=disc>
<li>
You permanently destroyed a file or moved the file to another location. For example, there may have been a file in a project that you deleted or purged. Later, you attempt to go back to an earlier version of the project. VSS attempts to reconstruct the project exactly as it was in the past, but it cannot, because the file cannot be recovered.<p class=tl>
Click <b>Yes</b>, and VSS tries to restore the old file, but restoration is not guaranteed.</P><p class=tl>
Click <b>No</b>, and the attempt to restore an old file is halted. </P><p class=tl>
Click <b>Yes All</b>, and VSS does not notify you that other selected files may also be unrecoverable, but continues with the best possible reconstruction.</P></li>
