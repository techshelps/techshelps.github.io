<h1><a name="ers_str_url_cantcheckhtml"></a>An error occurred while checking hyperlinks for &lt;File&gt;</h1>
<p>
This error has the following cause and solution:
<ul type=disc>
<li>
The working folder path, VSS specification, or URL was too long.<p class=tl>
Check that you aren't exceeding path limits for folder, specification, or URL. Check that Htmlfilt.dll is still present on your system and registered properly (running the client installation again should fix this problem). </P></li>
