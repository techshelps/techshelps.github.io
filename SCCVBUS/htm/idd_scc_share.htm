<p>
Makes the selected file a member of the current project, or creates a new branch project.</p>
<p>
<b><img src="prcarrow.gif" border=0>To use the Share Files command</b></p>
<p>
<img src="doit.gif" border=0>After you've added a development environment project to your source code control provider, on the Tools SourceSafe menu, click Share Files.</p>
<p>
<b>Remark</b></p>
<p>
<b>Note&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>To share a file, you create a share linkGloss_sharelink among projectsGloss_project.  The file then exists simultaneously in two (or more) projects.  When you check in the file to any one of the projects, your changes are automatically checked in to all of them.   </p>
<p>
If you create a branch, changes made in the branched file no longer propagate to the originating project, and vice versa.</p>
<p>
When you share a project, you create a new project under the current project that is an exact duplicate of the specified project.  All the files in the new project are shared with the corresponding files in the originating project, and changes to one are reflected in the other during check in.</p>
<p>
<b>Note&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>When sharing a project with Visual Basic form files (.FRM), be sure to share the associated .FRX file created by Visual Basic.  If you don't, the shared project will not have all the files it needs and will not work correctly.</p>
