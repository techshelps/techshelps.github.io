<h5>Multiple controls handling</h5> 
<p>You can cut, copy, paste and delete multiple controls at once.
<p>When you select multiple controls, you can change some properties, that common for all selected controls, at once.

<h5>Container controls</h5>
<p>Two controls in Koda realization are container controls - Tab and Group. This meaning that any other control placed onto them will have it as parent. This result into some features: 

<p>- subcontrols will move together with container control;<br>
- position of subcontrols is relative to container control;<br>
- if you want to place controls that was created outside container control onto container control, you have to copy/cut those controls and paste them onto container control, drag'n'drop will not work in this case;
