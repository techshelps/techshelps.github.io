<p>Update function allow you easily update one or more GUI part(s) in the script.
<p>When you first time generate code, each Koda GUI have ident at block beginning. This looks like:
<p><b>### Koda GUI section start ### Form=c:\scripts\project\myform.kxf</b>
<p>Forms saved in separated files, so this ident will be unique and allow Koda know, where to find GUI block for each form. 
<p>After that, when you open script file in the Koda, Koda will find all GUIs in this script and open corresponding forms for editing. If you open Koda form directly, Koda will try to find references to this form in all scripts in the same folder. If multiple scripts will be found, Koda show dialog, where you can select which script should be updated. 
<p>If Koda will find associated script, "Update" menu item will be active and allow you update corresponding GUI part when form change. Forms, that have associated script, marked with green mark in form list, when hovering mouse on the form list item tip with form and script name will be shown.
