<p><b>Container controls</b></p>
<p>Two controls in Koda realization are container controls - Tab and Group. This meaning that any other control placed onto them will have it as parent. This result into some features: 
<ul>
	<li>subcontrols will move together with container control;
	<li>position of subcontrols is relative to container control;
	<li>if you want to place controls that was created outside container control onto container control, you have to copy/cut those controls and paste them onto container control, drag'n'drop will not work in this case; 
</ul>
