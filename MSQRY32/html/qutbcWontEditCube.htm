Check the location of this database to make sure it hasn't been renamed or moved. Make sure the server is available, and that you can connect to it.</p><p><b class="bterm">Check for changes to the original database</b>   Tables in the database might have been renamed or deleted, so the cube can no longer locate the original data. Check for any changes to the organization, or schema, of the database. To do this, you can <a href="quhowOpenQuery1.htm" id="HP05206672" lcid=" ">open the database query</a> if you saved the query that you created when you first created the cube, or you can <a href="qutbcCreateNewQuery1.htm" id="HP05206400" lcid=" ">create a new query</a>. On the <b class="ui">Table</b> menu, click <b class="ui">Add Tables</b> to see what tables are available. If you cannot open an existing query or create a new one, contact the database administrator for information about how the database has changed.</p></body></html>
