For example, if you develop a Microsoft Excel program in Microsoft Visual Basic to get external data and distribute your program to Microsoft Excel version 5.<i>x</i> users, the program may not run with the 16-bit ODBC drivers on the Microsoft Excel version 5.<i>x</i> systems.</p><p><b class="bterm">Make sure Microsoft drivers are version 3.0 or later</b>   If you install Microsoft ODBC drivers other than the ones included with the most recent versions of Microsoft Excel or Microsoft Office, make sure you install version 3.0 or later of these drivers. Earlier versions of the Microsoft ODBC drivers may not work with Query 2000 and later. The drivers supplied with Microsoft Excel 97 and Microsoft Office 97 are version 3.0 or later. When you install these drivers, any old versions on your system should be replaced automatically.</p><p><b class="bterm">Make sure you have the correct version of a third-party driver</b>   If you are working with a third-party ODBC driver, you may also need to install a new ODBC driver for Microsoft Query when you upgrade your database or install a new version of the database. To determine whether this is necessary, check the documentation for your database.</p><p><b class="bterm">Make sure you set up the data source for the driver with Microsoft Query</b>   You can't use Query to access data sources set up with the Data Connection Wizard.</p></body></html>
