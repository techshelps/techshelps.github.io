When you specify the location of the database file, don't select the mapped drive for the shared network directory. Instead, type the <a href="#" class="glossary" onclick="AppendPopup(this,'IDH_qudefAddress')" onkeypress="AppendPopup(this,'IDH_qudefAddress')">UNC address</a> of the shared network directory, and then locate the database file. For example, if your database file is stored on a server named Shared, you could type <b class="ui">\\Shared\public</b> and then select the file Inventory.mdb.</p><p><b class="bterm">Map the same network drive letter before using the data source</b>   For other ODBC drivers, before you use a data source or run a query created with that data source, make sure the same drive is mapped to the shared network directory where the database is located as was mapped when the data source was created.</p></body></html>
