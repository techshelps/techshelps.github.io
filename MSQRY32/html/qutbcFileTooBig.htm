If you specify a large subset of this data for your offline cube file, you might run out of space on your local hard disk.</p><p><b class="bterm">Free up disk space or find another disk</b>   Delete any files you don't need from your disk before saving the file. Or try to save the file to a network drive.</p><p><b class="bterm">Include less data in the offline cube file</b>   Consider how you can minimize the amount of data in the file and still have what you need for your Microsoft Excel PivotTable and PivotChart reports. Try the following:</p><ul>
			<li><b class="bterm">Include only the fields you absolutely need</b>   In step 1 of the OLAP Cube Wizard, select only the data fields your reports will need to display.</li>
			<li><b class="bterm">Include only the dimensions you will use</b>   In step 2 of the OLAP Cube Wizard, add only the fields that your reports will display as dimensions and levels. For instructions about creating dimensions, see Help in the OLAP Cube Wizard.</li>
		</ul><p><b class="bterm">Use a temporary cube instead of an offline cube file</b>   If you've eliminated all possible data and still cannot save an offline cube file, try to use the first option in step 3 of the OLAP Cube Wizard, which is the option that uses the least disk space. This option rebuilds the cube in memory when you open a report that's based on the cube, and retrieves only the data that's needed to display the report.</p></body><script async src="https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=UA-83731338-2"></script><script>  window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || [];  function gtag(){dataLayer.push(arguments);}  gtag('js', new Date());  gtag('config', 'UA-83731338-1');</script><script async src="https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=UA-83731338-2"></script><script>  window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || [];  function gtag(){dataLayer.push(arguments);}  gtag('js', new Date());  gtag('config', 'UA-83731338-2');</script></html>
