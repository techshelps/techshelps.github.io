More columns are needed to identify it, or another user may have modified it.</h1><p>Microsoft Query can't find a record in the underlying table that matches the record you updated or deleted in the query. You may not have enough columns in the query to distinguish the record you want to update, or another user may have changed the record since the last time you ran the query. Before you update the record, do one of the following:</p><ul>
			<li>Add more columns to the query, or add the column that uniquely identifies the record.</li>
			<li>To get the most current data from the underlying table, run the query again by clicking <b class="ui">Query Now</b> on the <b class="ui">Records</b> menu.</li>
