If you're creating queries to more than one database during a Microsoft Query session, the open connections can tie up resources and expensive connect time.</p><p><b class="bterm">Close connections when you close query windows</b>   If you want to minimize connect time, you can have Microsoft Query close the connection when you don't have a query window open for a database. To keep the connection open only as long as you have a query window open, click <b class="ui">Options</b> on the <b class="ui">Edit</b> menu, and then clear the <b class="ui">Keep connections open until MS Query is closed</b> check box.</p></body></html>
