 Interactive Graph Customization</h1>
<p>The customization options in <span style="font-style: italic;">STATISTICA</span> 
 Graphs include hundreds of features, and they are used to customize every 
 detail of the display and associated data processing so that even the 
 default appearance and behavior of <span style="font-style: italic;">STATISTICA</span> 
 Graphs will match your specific needs and/or will require very little 
 intervention on your part.</p>
<p>All graph customizations can be divided into two groups: before and 
 after creation of the graph. The custom characteristics that can be defined 
 prior to graph creation include numerous defaults in the <span style="font-style: italic;"><a 
 href="Common.chm::/CommonDialogs/Options.htm">Options</a></span> dialog 
 (accessible by selecting <span style="font-style: italic;">Options</span> 
 from the <span style="font-style: italic;">Tools</span> menu) and the 
 use of graph styles. See <a href="CustomizingGraphsDefaultSettings.htm" 
 style="font-style: normal;">Graph Customization Default Settings</a> and 
 <a HREF="../../ModifyingGraphs/Dialogs/GraphicsStyles.htm">Graphics Styles</a> 
 for more details. The customization features that are available after 
 graph creation are accessible by clicking on graph components (described 
 below) and via the <span style="font-style: italic;"><a href="../../ModifyingGraphs/Dialogs/GraphOptions.htm">Graph 
 Options</a></span> dialog.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Customizing the structural components 
 of a graph. </span>The components of <span style="font-style: italic;">STATISTICA</span> 
 Graphs are readily customizable after creation. The options controlling 
 nearly all aspects of the appearance of <span style="font-style: italic;">STATISTICA</span> 
 Graphs are interactively accessible in a variety of ways. They are arranged 
 in a hierarchical manner, so those used most often are accessible directly 
 via shortcuts by clicking on the respective element of the graph. You 
 can also double-click on the graph feature or component you want to change, 
 right-click the graph component and select options from the shortcut menu, 
 or access the <span style="font-style: italic;"><a href="../../ModifyingGraphs/Dialogs/GraphOptions.htm">Graph 
 Options</a></span> customization dialog. (See below for a discussion of 
 the <span style="font-style: italic;">Graph Options</span> dialog.) Only 
 a few, very fundamental graph features, specifically those that control 
 how data are extracted and processed from the data source (e.g., general 
 graph type, variable selections, case selection, and weighting) cannot 
 be altered through this on-screen customization after a graph has been 
 produced.</p>
<p>The same plot customization options are available for all graph types. 
 In general, all graph customization options available in <span style="font-style: italic;">STATISTICA</span> 
 can be used to customize a graph, regardless of how that graph was requested 
 or defined. For example, you can use the same set of options to customize 
 a histogram made via <span style="font-style: italic;">Graphs of Block 
 Data - Histogram: Block Columns</span> and a histogram made via <span 
 style="font-style: italic;">Graphs - 2D Graphs - Histogram</span>. The 
 exceptions to this general rule are certain highly specialized and unusual 
 graph types produced as options from buttons on statistical analysis dialogs. 
 The latter graphs are still customizable in most respects, but can contain 
 unique features that cannot be altered.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Graph customization dialogs</span>. 
 <span style="font-style: italic;">STATISTICA</span> provides direct access 
 to common customization facilities for each graph component: Double-click 
 on the component to display the most commonly used options for that component. 
 For example, double-click on the z-axis of a scatterplot to display the 
 <span style="font-style: italic;">Scaling</span> dialog, in which you 
 can adjust scaling options. </p>
<p>Click the <span style="font-style: italic;">Graph Options</span> button 
 in the <span style="font-style: italic;">Scaling</span> dialog to display 
 the <span style="font-style: italic;"><a HREF="../../ModifyingGraphs/Dialogs/GraphOptions.htm">Graph 
 Options</a> </span>dialog, which contains a diverse selection of axis-related 
 options.</p>
<p>The <span style="font-style: italic;">Graph Options</span> dialog contains 
 all of the relevant customizable features for the particular graph. The 
 options are grouped in clusters containing logically related items. The 
 options in the <span style="font-style: italic;">Graph Options</span> 
 dialog are an all-inclusive &quot;superset&quot; of options accessed by 
 double-clicking on specific graph features. You can access the G<span 
 style="font-style: italic;">raph Options</span> dialog directly by selecting 
 <span style="font-style: italic;">Graph Options</span> from the graph 
 <span style="font-style: italic;">Format</span> menu, by double-clicking 
 on the background (e.g., the area outside the axes) of a graph, or by 
 selecting <span style="font-style: italic;">Graph Options</span> from 
 any graph shortcut menu.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Support for F4.</span> To simplify 
 the process of editing graph display features (e.g., font color, point 
 markers, area patterns), <span style="font-style: italic;">STATISTICA</span> 
 provides support for <span style="font-size: 8pt;">F4</span>. This means 
 that you can repeat the last command you performed in the graph. For example, 
 if you have just changed the title font to Arial, 12pt, Italic, and you 
 want to make the same change to the axis titles, simply highlight the 
 axis title you want to update, and press <span style="font-size: 8pt;">F4</span>. 
 Note that the <span style="font-size: 8pt;">F4</span> buffer is graph 
 specific. If you switch to a different graph and press <span style="font-size: 8pt;">F4</span>, 
 you will repeat the last action performed on that graph.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Adding/editing custom graphic objects</span>. 
 You can access the tools to add and modify custom graphics objects to 
 a current (active) graph (such as drawing, managing, and changing objects; 
 pasting; embedding; linking; etc.) from the <span style="font-style: italic;">Graph 
 Tools</span> toolbar or the <span style="font-style: italic;">Insert</span> 
 menu. Objects that can be added include text, rectangles, rectangles with 
 rounded corners, circles or ovals, arcs, polygons or freehand lines, arrows, 
 and linked or embedded objects. To add a custom object (e.g., a drawing, 
 arrow, or rectangle) to the graph, click a custom graphic object button 
 on the <span style="font-style: italic;">Graph Tools</span> toolbar and 
 then click on the appropriate spot on the graph. Double-click on an existing 
 object to open it for customization. </p>
