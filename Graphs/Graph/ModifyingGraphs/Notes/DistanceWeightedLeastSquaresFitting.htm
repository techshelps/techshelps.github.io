 Least Squares Fitting</h1>
<p>Unlike some other fitting procedures, the distance-weighted least squares 
 procedure does not fit to the data one function that can be easily described 
 by a single formula and plotted independently from the data.</p>
<p>The distance-weighted least squares method fits a curve to the data 
 by using the following procedure. A polynomial (second-order) regression 
 is calculated for each value on the <span style="font-style: italic;">X</span> 
 variable scale to determine the corresponding <span style="font-style: italic;">Y</span> 
 value such that the influence of the individual data points on the regression 
 (i.e., the weight, see the <span style="font-style: italic;">Stiffness</span> 
 option on the plot <span style="font-style: italic;"><a HREF="../Dialogs/PlotFitting.htm">Fitting</a></span> 
 dialog) decreases with their distance from the particular<span style="font-style: italic;"> 
 X</span> value (an algorithm similar to the one used by this procedure 
 is described by McLain, 1974).</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;"><font style="color: #000080;" color=#000080>Applications</font></span></p>
<p>There are two general classes of applications for this and similar (e.g., 
 <a HREF="SplineFitting.htm">spline</a>, <a HREF="NegativeExponentiallyWeightedFitting.htm">negative 
 exponentially-weighted</a>) smoothing procedures. First, it provides a 
 sensitive method for revealing non-salient overall patterns of data. Due 
 to measurement error, such patterns can be hard to identify by simply 
 looking at the scatterplot, although if revealed, they may turn out to 
 be interpretable and reliable.</p>
<p>Another type of application is to use the identified pattern to develop 
 quantitative models of the investigated phenomenon. Specifically, the 
 curve revealed by the smoothing procedure often consists of segments that 
 cannot easily be described by one function (e.g., such as a particular 
 polynomial or logarithmic function). However, the segmentation, and the 
 nature of the component curves (in the consecutive segments) may contain 
 interpretable information about the investigated phenomenon, and a linear 
 or nonlinear piecewise regression function can be developed to account 
 for (and predict) the process in question. The model suggested by the 
 results of such analyses can then be quantitatively verified in a nonlinear 
 estimation analysis (note that the <span style="font-style: italic;"><a 
 href="NonlinearEstimation.chm::/Indices/NonlinearEstimationAnalysis_HIndex.htm">Nonlinear 
 Estimation</a></span> module offers flexible facilities to estimate user-defined 
 piecewise regression and other models).</p>
