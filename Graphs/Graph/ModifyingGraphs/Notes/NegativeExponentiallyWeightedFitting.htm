 Fitting</h1>
<p>The negative exponentially-weighted fitting (smoothing) procedure is 
 based on a polynomial regression algorithm similar to the one used in 
 the <a HREF="DistanceWeightedLeastSquaresFitting.htm">Distance-Weighted 
 Least Squares</a> procedure. However, the weights that determine the influence 
 of individual data points on consecutive segments of the curve (depending 
 on their distance from the given segment) are calculated according to 
 a negative (decreasing) exponential function.</p>
<p>The choice of that function is not entirely arbitrary because research 
 experience confirms that, in many circumstances, exponential weighting 
 offers an adequate balance between preventing points at remote subregions 
 from biasing the curve while not ignoring them entirely. McLain (1974) 
 argues that negative exponential weighting receives &quot;some slight 
 theoretical support&quot; from the fact that in cubic splines (which are 
 proven to provide adequate approximations of real-life sequential data 
 sets) the effect of remote data points decreases approximately exponentially 
 with distance.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;"><font style="color: #000080;" color=#000080>Applications</font></span></p>
<p>There are two general classes of applications for this and similar (e.g., 
 <a HREF="SplineFitting.htm">spline</a>, <a HREF="DistanceWeightedLeastSquaresFitting.htm">distance-weighted 
 least squares</a>) smoothing procedures. First, it provides a sensitive 
 method for revealing non-salient overall patterns of data. Due to measurement 
 error, such patterns can be hard to identify by simply looking at the 
 scatterplot, although if revealed, they may turn out to be interpretable 
 and reliable.</p>
<p>Another type of application is to use the identified pattern to develop 
 quantitative models of the investigated phenomenon. Specifically, the 
 curve revealed by the smoothing procedure often consists of segments that 
 cannot easily be described by one function (e.g., such as a particular 
 polynomial or logarithmic function). However, the segmentation, and the 
 nature of the component curves (in the consecutive segments) may contain 
 interpretable information about the investigated phenomenon, and a linear 
 or nonlinear piecewise regression function can be developed to account 
 for (and predict) the process in question. The model suggested by the 
 results of such analyses can then be quantitatively verified in a nonlinear 
 estimation analysis (note that the <span style="font-style: italic;"><a 
 href="NonlinearEstimation.chm::/Indices/NonlinearEstimationAnalysis_HIndex.htm">Nonlinear 
 Estimation</a></span> module offers flexible facilities to estimate user-defined 
 piecewise regression and other models).</p>
