 Document Styles - Overview</h1>
<p>Document styles contain information about the overall graph sizes and 
 margins that are used to display all graphs. In a sense, you can think 
 of the document styles as pertaining to the &quot;blank sheet of paper&quot; 
 onto which the graphs are drawn. Note that specific graph components such 
 as line patterns, point markers, or the relative sizes of the x- and y-axes 
 in <a href="Graphs.chm::/Graph/UnderstandingGraphs/Overview/2DGraphs.htm">2D 
 graphs</a> are contained in <a HREF="GraphicsStyles.htm">Graphics styles</a>. 
 Document styles can be created and managed in the <a href="Common.chm::/CommonDialogs/OptionsGraphs2Tab.htm"><span 
 style="font-style: italic;">Documents/Graphs: Settings</a> </span>options 
 pane of the<span style="font-style: italic;"> <a href="Common.chm::/CommonDialogs/Options.htm">Options</a> 
 </span>dialog (before graphs are created) or, when working with existing 
 graphs, <span style="font-style: italic;"><a HREF="GraphOptionsGraphWindow.htm">Graph: 
 Window</a></span> and <span style="font-style: italic;"><a HREF="GraphOptionsGraphLayout.htm">Graph 
 Layout</a></span> options panes in the <a href="GraphOptions.htm"><span 
 style="font-style: italic;">Graph Options</span></a> dialog.</p>
<p>Note that when styles are applied to graphs, they modify the graphs 
 themselves, and those modifications will be saved along with the respective 
 graphs. Thus, if you, for example, e-mail to a colleague a graph customized 
 by applying a particularly elaborate and customized graphics or document 
 style, then that graph will appear on your colleague's computer customized 
 in the same manner as you intended, even though on your colleague's installation 
 of <span style="font-style: italic;">STATISTICA</span>, the styles used 
 to achieve the customization may not be defined.</p>
<p>For an example of how to create, save, and then apply a document style 
 to an existing graph, see <a HREF="CreatingaDocumentStyle.htm">Creating 
 a Document Style</a>.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold; color: #000080;">Exchanging graphs that 
 have styles applied to them.</span> Once a (document or <a HREF="GraphicsStylesOverview.htm">Graphics</a>) 
 style has been applied to a graph (either during creation of the graph 
 or after the graph has been created), the graph features addressed by 
 the style are determined by the style. The specifications of the resulting 
 graph, however, are stored in the graph not only in terms of references 
 to the respective styles, but also their absolute values. This means that 
 a graph with an applied style can be sent to another <span style="font-style: italic;">STATISTICA</span> 
 user, and its features will be correctly interpreted even though the user 
 has not defined an equivalent graph style. </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold; color: #000080;">Saving styles.</span> 
 Document styles (along with <a HREF="GraphicsStylesOverview.htm">Graphics 
 styles</a> and complete sets of globally defined graph options) can be 
 saved, exported, or imported through the <a href="Common.chm::/CommonDialogs/OptionsConfigurationManagerTab.htm" 
 style="font-style: italic;">Configurations</a> options, available by selecting 
 <a href="Common.chm::/CommonMenus/ToolsOptions.htm" style="font-style: italic;">Options</a> 
 from the <a href="Customizing.chm::/CustomizingSTATISTICA/Overview/MenuOverviews/PullDownMenus/SpreadsheetToolsMenu.htm" 
 style="font-style: italic;">Tools</a> menu. In general, styles can also 
 be imported or exported using a simple shortcut method by using the graph 
 itself as a carrier of the respective document (or Graphics) style. Refer 
 also to the <a HREF="GraphicsStylesOverview.htm">Graphics Styles</a> topic 
 <a HREF="GraphicsStylesImportingandExportingStyles.htm">Importing and 
 Exporting Styles</a> to learn more about how to create (Graphics) styles 
 from existing graphs.</p>
<p>See <a HREF="CreatingaDocumentStyle.htm">Creating a Document Style</a> 
 for additional details concerning document styles.</p>
