 Graphics Styles - Overview</h1>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">STATISTICA</span> 
 graphs consist of many components and literally thousands of different 
 characteristics (e.g., line colors, patterns), settings, etc. Styles are 
 collections of settings that you can apply to a particular graph or a 
 specific aspect or part of a graph, e.g., the font of the top title. You 
 can also configure the styles you create or modify as defaults that will 
 be automatically applied to all new graphs that you will create. <span 
 style="font-style: italic;">STATISTICA</span> allows you to create, manage, 
 and reuse styles pertaining to aspects of the graphs themselves, such 
 as line patterns, hatch patterns, sizes and colors of arrows, etc.; these 
 are called Graphics styles. In addition, you can create, manage, and reuse 
 styles pertaining to the size and proportions of graphs; those are called 
 <a HREF="DocumentStylesOverview.htm">Document Styles</a>. </p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0;">Graphics styles can be edited and created 
 via the <span style="font-style: italic;"><a href="GraphOptions.htm">Graph 
 Options</a> </span>dialog; Document styles can be edited via the <span 
 style="font-style: italic;"><a href="Common.chm::/CommonDialogs/OptionsGraphs2Tab.htm">Documents/Graphs: 
 Settings</a> </span>options pane in the<span style="font-style: italic;"> 
 <a href="Common.chm::/CommonDialogs/Options.htm">Options</a> </span>dialog. 
 Note that when styles are applied to graphs, they modify the graphs themselves, 
 and those modifications will be saved along with the respective graphs. 
 Thus, if you, for example, e-mail to a colleague a graph customized by 
 applying a particularly elaborate and customized graphics style, then 
 that graph will appear on your colleague's computer customized in the 
 same manner as you intended, even though on your colleague's installation 
 of <span style="font-style: italic;">STATISTICA</span>, the styles used 
 to achieve the customization may not be defined.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0; font-weight: bold; color: #000080;">Overview</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0;">Although most users may not need to use the 
 advanced functionality and may not be interested in the internal working 
 of <span style="font-style: italic;">STATISTICA</span>, practically all 
 features of <span style="font-style: italic;">STATISTICA</span> graphs 
 (thousands of combinations of settings) are internally represented by 
 &quot;styles.&quot; You can define these styles in a very simple way - 
 by assigning custom names to their own selections of features in the respective 
 graph customization dialogs. Later you can quickly re-use these styles 
 by selecting them by name instead of repeating the tedious sequences of 
 customizations. For example, a custom style of a specific arrow with a 
 wide, filled head and a thick red tail can be called <span style="font-style: italic;">A 
 red fat arrow</span> and later selected with a single click of the mouse. 
 Because that internal system of styles drives the management of practically 
 all graph customizations, also all program defaults (i.e., the appearance 
 of graphs when you do not make any customizations) are stored as styles 
 and can be easily modified by the users. </p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0;">In order to custom-tailor graphics options 
 in <span style="font-style: italic;">STATISTICA</span> and limit the need 
 for repeating the same graph customization, the default settings of practically 
 all features of <span style="font-style: italic;">STATISTICA</span> graphs 
 can be adjusted by the users. This flexible system customizability is 
 possible because all features of the appearance of <span style="font-style: italic;">STATISTICA</span> 
 graphs are driven by the same, comprehensive system of styles.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0;">A graphics style is a convenient way to combine 
 sets of formatting and specification options into one collection. This 
 feature allows you to specify and apply specific settings and formats 
 for different components of a graph. Once you have created a graphics 
 style, it can be applied to not only the current graph, but also to future 
 graphs (of the same type).</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0;">Note that a style may be applied to multiple 
 graphs at once, such as:</p>
<ul style="list-style: disc;" type=disc>
	<ul style="list-style: disc;" type=disc>
		<li class=p><p style="margin-bottom: 0;">One or more open graph 
 windows</p></li>
		<li class=p><p style="margin-bottom: 0;">Multiply-selected graphs 
 in a workbook</p></li>
	</ul>
</ul>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0;">There are several pre-defined, modifiable 
 graphics styles to choose from, but the power and flexibility of creating 
 entirely new graphic styles is at your fingertips. Graphic styles follow 
 a hierarchical organization and higher-level styles consist of other (lower-level) 
 styles. Therefore, styles can be created and applied on the component 
 level (e.g. background color), or they can be used to encapsulate all 
 of the component styles into a single graphic style that can be applied 
 a graph as a whole.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-weight: bold; color: #000080;">Exchanging 
 graphs that have styles applied to them.</span> Once a style has been 
 applied to a graph (either during creation of the graph or after the graph 
 has been created), the graph features addressed by the style are determined 
 by the style. The specifications of the resulting graph, however, are 
 stored in the graph not only in terms of references to the respective 
 styles, but also their absolute values: colors, sizes, patterns. This 
 means that a graph with an applied style can be sent to another <span 
 style="font-style: italic;">STATISTICA</span> user, and its features will 
 be correctly interpreted even though the user has not defined an equivalent 
 graphics style. </p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-weight: bold; color: #000080;">Saving 
 styles.</span> Graphics styles (along with complete sets of globally defined 
 graph options) can be saved, exported, or imported through the <a href="Common.chm::/CommonDialogs/OptionsConfigurationManagerTab.htm" 
 style="font-style: italic;">Configurations</a> options pane, available 
 by selecting <a href="Common.chm::/CommonMenus/ToolsOptions.htm" style="font-style: italic;">Options</a> 
 from the <a href="Customizing.chm::/CustomizingSTATISTICA/Overview/MenuOverviews/PullDownMenus/SpreadsheetToolsMenu.htm" 
 style="font-style: italic;">Tools</a> menu. Styles can also be imported 
 or exported using a simple shortcut method, specifically the method of
