 Compound Graph Customization</h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Collections of independent graphs</span>. 
 Individual graphs within certain types of <spaces>&nbsp;</spaces>compound 
 graphs (e.g., those made via the <span style="font-style: italic;">AutoLayout 
 Wizard, Multiple Graph Templates</span>, or specialized graphs from statistical 
 analyses) can be selected and customized individually.</p>
<p>To select a single graph in a compound graph, click outside the plot 
 area of the individual graph (i.e., on the outer background of the graph). 
 The graph will be surrounded by an animated border, and you can select 
 specific features of that graph (e.g., point markers, fit lines) by double-clicking 
 on them. </p>

 style="border: none; float: none; width: 449px; height: 359px;
		border-style: none; border-style: none;" width=449 height=359 border=0></p>
<p>To select the entire plot for customization via the <a href="../Dialogs/GraphOptions.htm"><span 
 style="font-style: italic;">Graph Options</span></a> dialog, double-click 
 outside the plot area of the individual graph. </p>
<p>Double-clicking on the common background of the compound graph (or right-clicking 
 on the background and using the shortcut menu) provides access to customizing 
 the compound graph's features independently from the contained graphs.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Multiple graphs</span>. Graphs of the 
 same type within a single compound graph created via <span style="font-style: italic;">STATISTICA's</span> 
 <span style="font-style: italic;">Graphs</span> menu graphs procedures 
 (e.g., categorized graphs, matrix plots, scatterplots with histograms, 
 or scatterplots with box plots) allow customization of features on all 
 of the like graph types simultaneously. That is, on a graph that has four 
 histograms and twelve scatterplots, the twelve scatterplots can be customized 
 independently. Double-clicking on a specific feature (such as an axis) 
 will display a dialog to quickly address altering that feature on all 
 the scatterplots at once. A single-click selects the feature to be customized 
 on all the like graphs (e.g., single-click the x-axis in one scatterplot, 
 and the x-axis in all other scatterplots is selected as well). Double-clicking 
 on the common outer background of the compound graph (or double-clicking 
 on the inner background of any one of the graphs) displays the <span style="font-style: italic;"><a 
 href="../Dialogs/GraphOptions.htm">Graph Options</a></span> dialog for 
 customizing features of all the scatterplots simultaneously as well as 
 for customizing the container graph.</p>
