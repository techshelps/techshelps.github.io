<h1>Advanced Graphics Capabilities</h1>
<p>Beginning with Version 10, <span style="font-style: italic;">STATISTICA</span> 
 uses advanced graphics capabilities such as gradient shading in solid 
 areas (you see this in histograms), smoother lines via “anti-aliasing” 
 technologies, and the ability to define the level of transparency to markers 
 and plot areas using the interactive graphics controls. Note that Windows 
 metafiles do not support the gradient and transparency features.</p>
<p>There are two different technologies that implement these capabilities, 
 and which one is used depends on your particular operating system and 
 the settings of various options. </p>
<p>The preferred technology is Direct2D. Direct2D is available on Windows 
 7 and later, and is also available on Vista SP2 if you have installed 
 the “Platform Upgrade” system update. This “Platform Upgrade” is available 
 as an optional system update, so if you are running Vista SP2, you may 
 need to explicitly select it from Windows Update; consult your system 
 administrator for details. In addition to the supported operating systems, 
 Direct2D performs its operations in hardware on the graphics card, so 
 a suitable advanced graphics card must be available. </p>
<p>The secondary technology, which will be used if Direct2D is not available, 
 is GDI+. GDI+ is software-based graphics, and is available on XP and later. 
 However, GDI+ has one drawback: when run over Remote Desktop (which is 
 used with Windows Terminal Server or Citrix environments), the transparency 
 feature is implemented in a different way, and does not look as good as 
 when you are running on a monitor directly connected to the system. <spaces>&nbsp;</spaces>Additionally, 
 GDI+ is not supported when running as a service, so graphs created in 
 <span style="font-style: italic;">STATISTICA</span> Server will not use 
 GDI+.</p>
<p>If neither Direct2d nor GDI+ are available, or if their use is turned 
 off by options in the <span style="font-style: italic;"><a href="Common.chm::/CommonDialogs/Options.htm">Options</a></span> 
 dialog - <span style="font-style: italic;"><a href="Common.chm::/CommonDialogs/OptionsGraphs1Tab.htm">Display</a></span> 
 options pane, the system will use the graphics engine in previous versions 
 of <span style="font-style: italic;">STATISTICA</span>, meaning that gradient 
 shading, smooth (anti-aliased) lines, and transparency will not be available. 
 </p>
<p>Finally, the current version of the PDF printer driver used in <span 
 style="font-style: italic;">STATISTICA</span> does not support area transparency 
 well. If you are creating plots that will later be saved as PDF documents, 
 do not use the transparency features. This will be resolved in future 
 versions of the software. </p>
<p>These options, located in the <span style="font-style: italic;"><a href="Common.chm::/CommonDialogs/Options.htm">Options</a></span> 
 dialog - <span style="font-style: italic;"><a href="Common.chm::/CommonDialogs/OptionsGraphs1Tab.htm">Display</a></span> 
 options pane, are used to control which graphics technology will be used:</p>
<p style="font-style: italic;">Enable advanced graphics rendering</p>
<p style="font-style: italic;">Use hardware graphics acceleration when 
 supported</p>
<p style="font-style: italic;">If no hardware support available, use software 
 support even on Remote Desktop</p>
<p style="font-style: italic;">Use Direct2D when creating enhanced metafiles</p>
<p style="font-style: italic;">Display interactive graphics controls (the 
 bar with sliders on the bottom of graph windows)</p>
<p style="font-style: italic;">Use Version 9 marker/pattern settings (requires 
 restarting STATISTICA)</p>
