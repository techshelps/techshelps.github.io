<p>The graph will appear exactly as it did on your computer. Although every 
 aspect of your graph's customization is encapsulated within graph styles, 
 all customization applied to your graphs are fully portable. In fact, 
 your colleague can then save the styles within your graph into his/her 
 system by doing the following: first, click on the background of the graph 
 and then right-click on the <span style="font-style: italic;"><a href="../ModifyingGraphs/Dialogs/GraphicsStyles.htm">Graphic 
 Styles</a></span> box on the <span style="font-style: italic;"><a href="Customizing.chm::/CustomizingSTATISTICA/Overview/ToolbarOverviews/GraphToolsToolbar.htm">Graph 
 Tools</a></span> toolbar. In the shortcut menu that is displayed, select 
 the <span style="font-style: italic;"><a href="Common.chm::/CommonMenus/FileSaveAs.htm">Save 
 As</a></span> command.</p>
<p>The <span style="font-style: italic;">Save As</span> dialog is then 
 displayed. Use this dialog to specify the name for the new graph style 
 and click the <span style="font-style: italic;">OK</span> button. In this 
 manner, the graph style that was originally installed on your system has 
 now been ported to your colleague's system in a few simple steps, using 
 a graph as a &quot;carrier.&quot;</p>
