 When and how can I customize <span style="font-style: italic;">STATISTICA</span> 
 graphs?</h1>
<p>All graph customization facilities in <span style="font-style: italic;">STATISTICA</span> 
 are available when a graph window is active (thus, after a graph has been 
 shown). </p>
<p>There are two major types of graph customizations:</p>
<p><symbol name=bullet><robohelp><font face="Symbol">&#183;</font></robohelp> 
 adding and/or editing custom graphic objects, and </p>
<p><symbol name=bullet><robohelp><font face="Symbol">&#183;</font></robohelp> 
 customizing the structural components of the graph.</p>
<p>Adding and/or editing custom graphic objects. The tools to add and edit 
 custom graphic objects to the current graph (such as drawing, managing, 
 and customizing objects, pasting, embedding, linking, etc.) can be accessed 
 from the <span style="font-style: italic;"><a href="Customizing.chm::/CustomizingSTATISTICA/Overview/ToolbarOverviews/GraphToolsToolbar.htm">Graph 
 Tools</a></span> toolbar. Those options are also accessible from the graph 
 <span style="font-style: italic;">Edit</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Insert</span> 
 menus, and many of them can also be accessed from the shortcut menus.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Customizing the structural components 
 of the graph</span>. All facilities to change the structural properties 
 of graphs (such as proportions, scales, patterns, features of individual 
 plots, etc.) can be accessed from the <span style="font-style: italic;"><a 
 href="../ModifyingGraphs/Dialogs/GraphOptions.htm">Graph Options</a></span> 
 dialog. This dialog can be accessed from the graph <span style="font-style: italic;"><a 
 href="Customizing.chm::/CustomizingSTATISTICA/TOOLBARQR/COMMON/FormatMenu.htm">Format</a></span> 
 menu as well as from shortcut menus described below.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Using the shortcut (right-click) menus 
 in graphs</span>. The easiest way to access the <span style="font-style: italic;"><a 
 href="../ModifyingGraphs/Dialogs/GraphOptions.htm">Graph Options</a></span> 
 dialog (as well as all other customization facilities) is to use the shortcut 
 menus accessible by right-clicking on the graph. Using the shortcut menus 
 is also often faster because they provide direct access the nested (i.e., 
 &quot;second-&quot; or &quot;third-level&quot;) options panes controlling 
 the attributes of specific graph components.</p>
<p><img src="../../Images/alloptionsshortcutex.gif" x-maintain-ratio=TRUE 
 style="border: none; float: none; width: 336px; height: 394px;
		border-style: none; border-style: none;" width=336 height=394 border=0></p>
<p>One of the graph shortcut menus has a different status than others. 
 Specifically, unlike all other shortcut menus that are associated with 
 specific objects, the &quot;main&quot; (or &quot;background&quot;) shortcut 
 menu (shown below), accessible by right-clicking outside the graph axes, 
 contains global graph customization and multi-graphics management options.</p>
<p><img src="../../Images/maingraphshortcut.gif" x-maintain-ratio=TRUE 
 style="border: none; float: none; width: 396px; height: 381px;
		border-style: none; border-style: none;" width=396 height=381 border=0></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Using the left mouse button (direct 
 access to customization dialogs)</span>. Another mouse-based shortcut 
 to access customization facilities for specific elements of the graph 
 is to double-click on the specific graph object or component. </p>
<p><img src="../../Images/scalevaluesex.gif" x-maintain-ratio=TRUE style="border: none; float: none; width: 570px; height: 293px;
		border-style: none; border-style: none;" width=570 height=293 border=0></p>
<p>If the element you have selected this way is one of the structural components 
 of the graph (such as a scale, point marker, or a title), then the dialog 
 that is most commonly used to customize that type of object will automatically 
 be displayed. For example, in the illustration shown above, double-clicking 
 on the y-axis scale values displays the <span style="font-style: italic;"><a 
 href="../ModifyingGraphs/Dialogs/AxisScaleValues.htm">Scale Values</a></span> 
 dialog.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Options accessible by double-clicking 
 on an object vs. options accessible from the shortcut menus (clicking 
 the right mouse button).</span> As mentioned before, by right-clicking 
 on an object, a list of customization dialogs and options applying to 
 that object will be displayed in a shortcut menu (organized hierarchically 
 with the most commonly used option at top and progressing to the dialog 
 with the largest set of options).</p>
<p>On the other hand, double-clicking displays directly the most commonly 
 used dialog, or the global dialog that applies to the object. Therefore, 
 double-clicking saves you one step whenever you are accessing the most 
 commonly used option.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Accessing the All Options dialog.</span> 
 The same principle also applies to displaying the <span style="font-style: italic;"><a 
 href="../ModifyingGraphs/Dialogs/GraphOptions.htm">Graph Options</a></span> 
 dialog. To access this dialog, simply double-click on the empty graph 
 space outside the graph axes. Alternatively, you can select it from the 
 &quot;main&quot; shortcut menu accessible by right-clicking on the empty 
 graph space outside the graph axes.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Support for F4.</span> To simplify 
 the process of editing graph display features (e.g., font color, point 
 markers, area patterns), <span style="font-style: italic;">STATISTICA</span> 
 provides support for F4. This means that you can repeat the last command 
 you performed in the graph. For example, if you have just changed the 
 title font to Arial, 12pt, Italic, and you want to make the same change 
 to the axis titles, simply highlight the axis title you want to update, 
 and press F4. Note that the F4 buffer is graph specific. If you switch 
 to a different graph and press F4, you will repeat the last action performed 
 on that graph.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Customization of custom graphic objects 
 (drawings, embedded objects)</span>. The general principles of selecting 
 objects and accessing their customization facilities (summarized in the 
 two previous paragraphs) also apply to all custom graphic objects such 
 as drawings, arrows, and embedded objects. The <span style="font-style: italic;"><a 
 href="Customizing.chm::/CustomizingSTATISTICA/Overview/ToolbarOverviews/GraphToolsToolbar.htm">Graph 
 Tools</a></span> toolbar buttons can also be used to access most of these 
 customization facilities. For example, the buttons can be used to change 
 the patterns, sizes, and colors of objects, and properties of predefined 
 objects (such as arrows or error bars) or foreign objects (e.g., pasted, 
 linked, or embedded artwork).</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Customization of linked or embedded 
 OLE objects</span>. To edit OLE objects in <span style="font-style: italic;">STATISTICA</span> 
 Graphs, double-click on the object; the source application will be opened 
 in OLE server mode with the object displayed, allowing the object to be 
 changed. </p>
<p>When the editing is completed, you can use any of the standard OLE conventions 
 to exit the application's server mode and update the graph in <span style="font-style: italic;">STATISTICA</span> 
 (such as clicking on the <span style="font-style: italic;">STATISTICA</span> 
 Graph).</p>
