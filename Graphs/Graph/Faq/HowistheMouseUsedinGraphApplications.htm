 How is the mouse used in graph applications?</h1>
<p>In addition to the standard Windows mouse conventions for selecting 
 objects, the mouse can be used in many more specialized applications in 
 the graphics window in <span style="font-style: italic;">STATISTICA</span>. 
 The following is a list of representative examples:</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">OLE</span>. Links or embeds foreign 
 document files to <span style="font-style: italic;">STATISTICA</span> 
 documents by dragging them directly from the desktop or Windows Explorer 
 (across application windows) and dropping them onto <span style="font-style: italic;">STATISTICA</span> 
 Graphs.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Brushing</span>. Highlights data points 
 from the graph by clicking on them with the brushing tool or selecting 
 them with a Box, Lasso, Cube, or a 2D or 3D Slice.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Zoom in and zoom out tools</span>. 
 Zooms in (&quot;magnifies&quot;) or zooms out (&quot;shrinks&quot;), respectively, 
 the selected area of the graph. </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Drawing tools</span>. Adds rectangles, 
 ovals (or circles), polylines and freehand drawings, arrows, etc. to a 
 graph.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Resizing and moving</span>. Resizes 
 (drag on a &quot;black selection square&quot;) or moves (drag the entire 
 object) selected graph objects. For fine adjustments, see <span style="font-style: italic;">Controlling 
 the mouse with the keyboard in graphs</span>, below.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Editing polyline objects</span>. Reshapes 
 individual segments of the polyline drawing by dragging on either the 
 object area black selection squares or any of the black selection squares 
 that mark the line segments. For fine adjustments, see <span style="font-style: italic;">Controlling 
 the mouse with the keyboard in graphs</span>, below.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Rotating text</span>. You can interactively 
 rotate custom text by selecting it in the graph and then dragging one 
 of the object handles (small black squares) in the desired direction. 
 For fine adjustments (1 degree movements), see <a HREF="GraphCustomizationTitlesLegendsCustomText/HowDoIRotateText.htm">How 
 do I rotate text?</a>. </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Controlling the mouse with the keyboard 
 in graphs</span>. You can also emulate the mouse with the keyboard in 
 order to move or resize an object by selecting the object, placing the 
 mouse pointer over the object, and then using the keyboard cursor keys 
 to move or resize the object. </p>
<p>Note that the mouse pointer will change to the appropriate tool to match 
 the application for which it is being used. Press the <span style="font-size: 8pt;">ESC</span> 
 key to return the mouse pointer to the default mode. </p>
