 between the dynamic and fixed status of custom objects (e.g., arrows, 
 custom text, drawings) in graphs?</h1>
<p>The difference pertains to the rules used to redraw and possibly reposition 
 the object when the graph (and especially its scales) changes: Should 
 it stay &quot;fixed&quot; where it was originally in the relation to the 
 graph window (e.g., perfectly in the middle) but lose its relation to 
 the specific plots, which are now drawn in a different place (fixed), 
 or should it rather follow the plots as the scales or plot positions change 
 (dynamic). <spaces>&nbsp;</spaces></p>
<p>Specifically:</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Dynamic mode.</span> In the dynamic 
 mode, all custom objects placed anywhere on the graph (e.g., drawings, 
 arrows, text, embedded or linked graphs, or other artwork) will be anchored 
 against the current <span style="font-style: italic;">X-</span> and <span 
 style="font-style: italic;">Y-</span>axis scale coordinates. Thus, they 
 will be dynamically attached to specific &quot;logical&quot; graph locations 
 (and not absolute positions within the graph window). When the graph is 
 rescaled or moved within its window, the relations between the custom 
 (dynamic) objects and the respective graph components will not change 
 (e.g., an arrow will still mark the same point on a line graph even when 
 the graph is rescaled and this point is now in a different place in the 
 window).</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Fixed mode</span><span style="font-style: italic;">.</span> 
 In the fixed mode, however, all custom objects will always remain in their 
 absolute positions, anchored only against the proportions of the window. 
 For example, if you add a footnote at the bottom of the graph, it will 
 always remain on the bottom even if the graph is rescaled.</p>
<p>The status of objects can be adjusted in the respective <span style="font-style: italic;"><a 
 href="../../ModifyingGraphs/Dialogs/ShapeObjectProperties.htm">Object 
 Properties</a></span> dialogs. Note that some objects may have two anchor 
 points, and then each can have a different status. For example, the head 
 of the arrow can be dynamically related to a detail in the plot, but its 
 tail can be fixed at the very bottom of the graph window where the label 
 or comment is located.</p>
