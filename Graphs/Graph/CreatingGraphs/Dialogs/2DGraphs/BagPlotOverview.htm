Bag Plots - Introductory Overview</h1>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">Bag
plots are the bivariate extension of the univariate box plot. The box
plot (this term was first used by Tukey, 1970) is a tool for
exploratory data analysis. With a box plot, the important
characteristics of a distribution (location, dispersion, skewness,
and tails) can be quickly visualized. An example of a box plot can be
seen below.</font></p>

</p>

<p>Extending the box plot into two dimensions, the bag plot
visualizes the
following characteristics of the bivariate distribution:</p>

<ul>

  <li>Location (Tukey median)</li>

  <li>Spread (Size of the bag)</li>

  <li>Correlation (Orientation of the bag)</li>

  <li>Skewness (Shape of the bag and the whiskers)</li>

  <li>Tails (long whiskers and outliers)</li>

</ul>

<h3>Depth as a bivariate generalization of rank</h3>

<p>The central concept with the bag plot is the depth (halfspace
location depth) of a point relative to a bivariate data set. This
allows one to extend the notion of rank beyond one dimension.
Let&rsquo;s look at the computation of the Tukey median (bivariate
median) in order to understand this. First, consider the case of
finding the median for a univariate data set. Consider the small set of
a data consisting of 5 numbers {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}. In this example, the
median is simply the middle value. However, we can think of computing
the median in a different way. For a given set of data, the depth of an
arbitrary point is equal to the minimum of ( # {zi &lt;= x}, #{zi
&gt;= x}), that is we find the number of data points to the left
and to the right of the data point and take the minimum value. For the
dataset a = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}, let&rsquo;s compute the depth for data
point 3. The #{zi &lt;= x} is equal to 3 and the #{zi &gt;= x}
is also equal to 3. This also happens to the point with the deepest
depth, that is, it has the maximum of the minimum of ( # {zi &lt;=
x}, #{zi &gt;= x}). The point with the deepest depth is known as
the Tukey median. In two dimensions, depth of a point X is the smallest
number of data points that are contained in a closed half plane with
boundary line through the point X.&nbsp; You can calculate the
depth by rotating a line through the point X 180 degrees and counting
the number of points that fall on both sides of the line.</p>

<h3><font face="Arial, sans-serif">Depth
region, Bag, and Fence</font></h3>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">Once you
have depth, then you can calculate the Tukey median which is the
point with maximum depth. The bag and fence can now be calculated as
depth regions. Specifically, the bag is a depth region (which is a
convex polygon) that contains 50% (by default) of the points with the
largest depth. The fence is augmented by a factor of 1.5 (by
default). Points that are outside of the outer fence will be marked
as outliers.</font></p>
