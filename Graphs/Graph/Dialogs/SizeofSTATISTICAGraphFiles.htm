<h1>Size of <span style="font-style: italic;">STATISTICA</span> Graph Files</h1>
<p><span style="font-style: italic;">STATISTICA</span> Graphs are virtually 
 unlimited in all respects. Because of the optimized manner in which <span 
 style="font-style: italic;">STATISTICA</span> creates and manages graphs, 
 the options and customizations pertaining to aspects of the graph itself 
 (e.g., colors, line styles, etc.) usually only require minimal space, 
 and managing even complex graphs (e.g., saving graphs to files, moving 
 them around <a href="Workbooks.chm::/Workbook/UnderstandingWorkbooks/STATISTICAWorkbookOverview.htm">workbook</a>, 
 attaching graphs to e-mail messages) is efficient and fast. </p>
<p>However, when graphing large data sets (e.g., with several hundreds 
 of thousands of cases), <spaces>&nbsp;</spaces><span style="font-style: italic;">STATISTICA</span> 
 offers choices on how to manage the data, and how to store the graph to 
 optimize speed and efficiency. Specifically, for some types of graphs 
 you can select not to attach to the graphs the actual raw data from which 
 they were computed, but to store only the aggregated summaries necessary 
 to produce the respective graphs (see also the description of the <a HREF="LargeDataWarning.htm" 
 style="font-style: italic;">Large Data Warning</a> dialog, and the <span 
 style="font-style: italic;">Display warning when creating a graph with 
 larger than the data size threshold</span> option in the <span style="font-style: italic;"><a 
 href="Common.chm::/CommonDialogs/OptionsAnalysesGraphsLimits.htm">Analyses/Graphs: 
 Limits</a></span> options pane of the <span style="font-style: italic;"><a 
 href="Common.chm::/CommonDialogs/Options.htm">Options</a></span> dialog, 
 accessible by selecting <span style="font-style: italic;">Tools </span>from 
 the<span style="font-style: italic;"> Options </span>menu). </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Example:</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">Storing 
 frequency counts instead of raw data for histograms.</span> Consider a 
 histogram computed for 2,000,000 (2 million) observations; further suppose 
 you used the default method of <a href="../UnderstandingGraphs/Overview/CategorizationMethods.htm">categorization</a> 
 to assign the observations to the bin's for the histogram, and this method 
 yielded 6 categories (columns in the histogram).</p>
<p><img src="../../Images/gsize.gif" x-maintain-ratio=TRUE style="border: none; width: 347px; height: 283px; float: none;
		border-style: none; border-style: none;" width=347 height=283 border=0></p>
<p>The histogram itself only shows the summary frequency counts for the 
 6 bins, given the chosen method of <a href="../UnderstandingGraphs/Overview/CategorizationMethods.htm">categorization</a>. 
 Therefore, it is not necessary to store and save the raw data values (i.e., 
 the 2 million data points) along with the graph; only the 6 frequency 
 counts need to be saved. By not storing and saving the raw data itself, 
 the graph object (graph file) <spaces>&nbsp;</spaces>becomes much smaller; 
 only 6 frequency counts need to be stored versus the 2 million data points 
 that were used to compute the frequency counts. </p>
<p>Of course, once you &quot;detach&quot; the raw data from the histogram 
 by not storing the original data points, but only the aggregated frequency 
 counts, you can no longer &quot;go back&quot; to the data. Thus, you cannot, 
 for example, double-click on the graph to display the <span style="font-style: italic;"><a 
 href="../ModifyingGraphs/Dialogs/GraphOptions.htm">Graph Options</a></span> 
 dialog, select the <span style="font-style: italic;"><a HREF="../ModifyingGraphs/Dialogs/PlotHistogram.htm">Plot: 
 Histogram</a> </span>options pane, and change the method of categorization 
 to, for example, make a histogram with 20 bins (categories). That would 
 require to reprocess the data, which were not stored along with the graph. 
 The only way to do this would be to go back to the original input data 
 file, and create the graph using the standard <a href="../UsingGraphs/Dialogs/Stats2DGraphs.htm">2D 
 Graphs</a> options from the <a href="../UnderstandingGraphs/GraphsMenuGraphs.htm" 
 style="font-style: italic;">Graphs</a> menu. However, if you had no access 
 to the original data that were used to create the graph (e.g., if someone 
 had e-mailed to you the <span style="font-style: italic;">STATISTICA</span> 
 graphics file as an attachment), then you could not change the way in 
 which the data were categorized to produce the histogram.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Attaching the data to the graph.</span> 
 By default, <span style="font-style: italic;">STATISTICA</span> will always 
 attach the original data to the graph. In most cases, for example when 
 dealing with data files that have less than 100,000 observations, <span 
 style="font-style: italic;">STATISTICA</span> will manage such graphs 
 very efficiently. Therefore, all options in the <span style="font-style: italic;"><a 
 HREF="../Faq/WhatIstheGraphOptionsDialog.htm">Graph Options</a></span> 
 dialog will be available to customize the graph, and to recompute various 
 aspects of the graph (e.g., to redo the method of <a href="../UnderstandingGraphs/Overview/CategorizationMethods.htm">categorization</a> 
 in histograms), even if the original input data is not available to you 
 (e.g., if the graph was sent to you as an attachment to an e-mail). You 
 can also review and edit the original input data via the <span style="font-style: italic;"><a 
 href="../Faq/BrushingInteractiveAnalysis/WhatistheGraphDataEditor.htm">Graph 
 Data Editor</a></span> options of the Graphics <span style="font-style: italic;"><a 
 href="Customizing.chm::/CustomizingSTATISTICA/Overview/MenuOverviews/PullDownMenus/GraphicsViewMenu.htm">View</a></span> 
 menu.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold; color: #000080;">Options for Managing 
 Large Data Sets and Graphs.</span> <span style="font-style: italic;">STATISTICA</span> 
 will by default attach to (store along with) the graph the original data 
 necessary to produce the graph. However, you can configure the threshold 
 value (number of observations) at which point you want to be given a choice 
 as to whether or not you want to store the raw data along with the graph, 
 or only the aggregated summaries. When the data file contains more valid 
 observations than this threshold value, and you create a graph summarizing 
 the data (see also the next paragraph regarding the relevant graphs), 
 the <a HREF="LargeDataWarning.htm" style="font-style: italic;">Large Data 
 Warning</a> dialog will be displayed where you can choose to attach or 
 not to attach the data to the graph. These options (threshold value, whether 
 or not to display the <span style="font-style: italic;">Large Data Warning</span> 
 dialog) can be configured in the <span style="font-style: italic;">Large 
 Data Warning</span> dialog and via the respective options on the <span 
 style="font-style: italic;"><a href="Common.chm::/CommonDialogs/OptionsAnalysisDisplay.htm">Analyses/Graphs</span> 
 tab</a> of the <span style="font-style: italic;"><a href="Common.chm::/CommonDialogs/Options.htm">Options</a></span> 
 dialog accessible by selecting <span style="font-style: italic;">Options</span> 
 from the <span style="font-style: italic;">Tools</span> menu.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Graphs and options that require the 
 raw data.</span> <spaces>&nbsp;</spaces>To summarize, when creating graphs 
 from large data sets, you may have the option to store along with the 
 graph only the values necessary to show the respective statistical summaries 
 (e.g., histogram bars representing frequency counts, points representing 
 means, boxes representing ranges or <a href="Glossary.chm::/GlossaryTwo/Q/Quartiles.htm">quartiles</a>). 
 However, at that point the statistical summaries themselves cannot be 
 recomputed or changed. So you cannot go back and redo the method of <a 
 href="../UnderstandingGraphs/Overview/CategorizationMethods.htm">categorization</a> 
 in a histogram, change a box plot of medians and quartiles to a box plot 
 of means and standard errors, etc. </p>
<p>Some graphs, of course, plot the raw data points themselves (e.g., scatterplots), 
 or some transformation of the data (e.g., <a href="Glossary.chm::/GlossaryTwo/2dgraphs/2DProbabilityPlots.htm">probability 
 plots</a>). For those graphs, <span style="font-style: italic;">STATISTICA</span> 
 will always attach the raw data, since each observation corresponds to 
 a point in the graph, and without the data for each point the graph couldn't 
 be drawn. The <a HREF="LargeDataWarning.htm" style="font-style: italic;">Large 
 Data Warning</a> dialog will not be displayed for those graphs, and storing 
 and managing such graphs can require large processing resources when truly 
 huge data sets are used in the analyses.</p>
