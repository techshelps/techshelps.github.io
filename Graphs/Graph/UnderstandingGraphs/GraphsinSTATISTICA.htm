 Graphs in <span style="font-style: italic;">STATISTICA</span></h1>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0;">The most common application of graphs is to 
 efficiently present and communicate information (typically, numerical 
 data). However, graphical techniques also provide powerful analytical 
 tools for the exploration of data and verification of hypotheses.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="color: #000080; font-weight: bold;">A 
 broad selection of graphics options.</span> <span style="font-style: italic;">STATISTICA</span> 
 includes a comprehensive selection of graphical methods for both data 
 analysis and the presentation of results. All graphs in <span style="font-style: italic;">STATISTICA</span> 
 include a broad selection of built-in, interactive analytic techniques 
 and extensive customization tools that enable you to interactively control 
 virtually all aspects of the display. Also, flexible multi-graphics management 
 facilities are available that are used to integrate various graphical 
 displays and to build dynamic links between applications (e.g., using 
 OLE-Object Linking and Embedding).</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-weight: bold; color: #000080;">Automatic 
 updating of graphs.</span> Graph facilities in <span style="font-style: italic;">STATISTICA</span> 
 not only enable you to create a graph easily, you can also automatically 
 update graphs in real-time whenever your input data change. If the spreadsheet 
 is linked to an outside data source, graphs can be set to update automatically 
 whenever the spreadsheet links are updated (e.g., from a database or data 
 acquisition equipment connected to the serial port). Unless the graph 
 uses its own selection conditions (via the <span style="font-style: italic;">Use 
 selection conditions for this Analysis/Graph only</span> option in the 
 <span style="font-style: italic;"><a href="Common.chm::/CommonDialogs/AnalysisCaseSelectionConditions.htm">Analysis/Graph 
 Case Selection Conditions</a></span> dialog), selection condition changes 
 in the spreadsheet will be reflected in the graph as well.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0;">Once a graph is created, you can link the 
 graph to different variables in the spreadsheet, or to a completely different 
 spreadsheet. After the link update, the graph will retain its original 
 customizations while linking to the new data.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0;">The update can go the other way as well. When 
 you change the case states of the data points of an existing graph (using 
 the brushing tool), such as the label or color of the marker, or exclude 
 or hide points from the graph, these changes can be updated to the spreadsheet. 
 Since several graphs can be linked from the same spreadsheet, this makes 
 an efficient tool for exploratory data analysis: as changes are made in 
 one graph to brush and exclude and/or label data points, changes are instantly 
 made in all the graphs based on that spreadsheet. </p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0;">Note that point marker style and color are 
 predetermined for multiple subsets, frequency scatterplot and overlaid 
 categorization. When brushing graphs of these types, the default point 
 marker and color will take precedence over the brushing color/marker. 
 However, the changes made via the brushing tool will be reflected in the 
 spreadsheet and in the Graph Data Editor.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-weight: bold; color: #000080;">Comprehensive 
 support for Visual Basic and other languages.</span> <span style="font-style: italic;">STATISTICA</span> 
 graphical options can be accessed programmatically (using the built in 
 <span style="font-style: italic;"><a href="Macros.chm::/Macro/UnderstandingMacros/VBAOverview.htm">STATISTICA</span> 
 Visual Basic</a> or other compatible languages), which creates practically 
 unlimited possibilities to produce highly customized graphical displays. 
 These custom graphs can be permanently added to <span style="font-style: italic;">STATISTICA</span>'s 
 user interface (e.g., assigned to buttons on toolbars or added to menus). 
 For additional details, see, for example, the <a href="Version6.chm::/Indices/WorkingwithMacrosSTATISTICAVisualBasic_HIndex.htm">Macro 
 Index</a><span style="font-style: italic;"> </span>or<span style="font-style: italic;">

<p style="margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-weight: bold; color: #000080;">General 
 categories of graphs.</span> The <span style="font-style: italic;">STATISTICA</span> 
 system offers a variety of methods in which graphs can be requested or 
 defined. These methods (constituting broad categories of graphs such as 
 input data, block data, and specialized) are reviewed in <a HREF="GeneralCategoriesofGraphs.htm">General 
 Categories of Graphs</a>. They complement each other, providing a high 
 level of integration between numbers (such as raw data, intermediate results, 
 or final results) and graphical displays. For example, specialized graphs 
 can be requested as part of the automatic output from statistical procedures, 
 but they can also be requested via integrated tools to visualize virtually 
 any combination of numbers (and/or labels) that are displayed or generated 
 by <span style="font-style: italic;">STATISTICA</span>.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-weight: bold; color: #000080;">Microsoft 
 Office Integration.</span> When the mouse pointer is clicked in an area 
 of the graph other than inside the axes or a title or axis label, you 
 can drag the graph into an open Microsoft document (Word, Outlook, Excel, 
 PowerPoint).</p>
