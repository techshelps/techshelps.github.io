 Customization of Graphs</h1>
<p><span style="color: #000080; font-weight: bold;">Interactive graph customization.</span> 
 The customization options in <span style="font-style: italic;">STATISTICA</span> 
 graphics include hundreds of features and tools that can be used to adjust 
 every detail of the display and associated data processing. However, these 
 options are arranged in a hierarchical manner, so those used most often 
 are accessible directly via shortcuts by double-clicking or right-clicking 
 on the respective element of the graph.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Support for F4.</span> To simplify 
 the process of editing graph display features (e.g., font color, point 
 markers, area patterns), <span style="font-style: italic;">STATISTICA</span> 
 provides support for F4. This means that you can repeat <spaces>&nbsp;</spaces>the 
 last command you performed in the graph. For example, if you have just 
 changed the title font to Arial, 12pt, Italic and you wish to make the 
 same change to the axis titles, simply highlight the axis title you wish 
 to update, and press F4. Note that the F4 buffer is graph specific. If 
 you switch to a different graph and press F4, you will repeat the last 
 action performed on that graph.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold; color: #000080;">Permanent settings 
 and automation options.</span> The initial (default) settings of all of 
 these features can be easily adjusted so that even the default appearance 
 and behavior of <span style="font-style: italic;">STATISTICA</span> Graphs 
 will match your specific needs and/or will require very little intervention 
 on your part. There are at least four different ways to make these adjustments:</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">1. Options dialog.</span> Perhaps the 
 most straightforward way to adjust the default appearance of graphs is 
 by using the options in the <span style="font-style: italic;"><a href="Common.chm::/CommonDialogs/OptionsGraphs1Tab.htm">Documents</span>/<span 
 style="font-style: italic;">Graphs: Display</span></a> and <span style="font-style: italic;"><a 
 href="Common.chm::/CommonDialogs/OptionsGraphs2Tab.htm">Documents/Graphs: 
 Settings</a></span> options panes in the <span style="font-style: italic;"><a 
 href="Common.chm::/CommonDialogs/Options.htm">Options</a></span> dialog 
 (accessible via the <span style="font-style: italic;">Tools</span> menu). 
 Most commonly used settings can be easily adjusted here, and the results 
 will be reflected in the default styles (see point 2 below) that will 
 be used by the system and as such, they will be automatically saved in 
 the <span style="font-style: italic;">STATISTICA</span> configuration 
 file (e.g., different settings can be used for different projects). For 
 further details, see the <span style="font-style: italic;"><a href="Common.chm::/CommonDialogs/OptionsConfigurationManagerTab.htm">Configurations</a></span> 
 options pane in the <span style="font-style: italic;"><a href="Common.chm::/CommonDialogs/Options.htm">Options</a></span> 
 dialog (accessible from the <span style="font-style: italic;">Tools</span> 
 menu). </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">2. Graph style system.</span> All of 
 the numerous features that affect the appearance of the graph (from as 
 elementary as the color of the font in the footnote to as general as the 
 global features of the graph document) can be saved as individual &quot;styles.&quot; 
 These styles can be given custom names and later be reapplied using simple 
 shortcuts (such as pressing a specific key combination or clicking a button 
 on a custom toolbar). An intelligent system internally manages these thousands 
 of styles and their combinations in <span style="font-style: italic;">STATISTICA</span> 
 and helps you achieve your customization objectives with a minimum amount 
 of effort. All user-defined or modified styles will be saved automatically 
 in the <span style="font-style: italic;">STATISTICA</span> configuration 
 file (e.g., different sets or systems of styles can be used for different 
 projects). For information on saving configurations of <span style="font-style: italic;">STATISTICA</span>, 
 see the <a href="Common.chm::/CommonDialogs/OptionsConfigurationManagerTab.htm"><span 
 style="font-style: italic;">Configurations</a> </span>options pane in 
 the<span style="font-style: italic;"> <a href="Common.chm::/CommonDialogs/Options.htm">Options</a> 
 </span>dialog (accessible from the<span style="font-style: italic;"> Tools 
 </span>menu).</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">3. User-defined graphs.</span> New 
 types of graphs can be defined in a variety of ways and they can be added 
 to the menus, dialogs, or toolbars. If a custom graph that you intend 
 to use repeatedly is not built &quot;from scratch&quot; (e.g., drawn using 
 the graphics primitives) but is based on one of the <span style="font-style: italic;">Graphs</span> 
 menu graphs and is produced by some combination of the existing graph 
 customization options, then adding it to the <span style="font-style: italic;">Graphs</span> 
 menu as a new type of graph is as simple as clicking the <span style="font-style: italic;">Add 
 As User-defined Graph to Menu</span> button in the <span style="font-style: italic;">Options 
 2 tab of the graph definition dialog</span>. All user-defined graph specifications 
 will be saved automatically in the <span style="font-style: italic;">STATISTICA</span> 
 configuration file (e.g., different sets of custom graphs can be used 
 for different projects). For further details, see the <a href="Common.chm::/CommonDialogs/OptionsConfigurationManagerTab.htm"><span 
 style="font-style: italic;">Configurations</a> </span>options pane in 
 the<span style="font-style: italic;"> <a href="Common.chm::/CommonDialogs/Options.htm">Options</a> 
 </span>dialog (accessible from the<span style="font-style: italic;"> Tools 
 </span>menu).</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">4. </span><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">STATISTICA</span><span 
 style="font-weight: bold;"> Visual Basic.</span> Finally, note that there 
 are no limits to how &quot;deeply customized&quot; your <span style="font-style: italic;">STATISTICA</span> 
 custom graphs can be, because <span style="font-style: italic;">STATISTICA</span> 
 Visual Basic (with all its powerful custom drawing tools as well as the 
 <span style="font-style: italic;">STATISTICA</span>-based library of graphics 
 procedures) can be used to produce virtually any graphics or multimedia 
 output supported by the contemporary computer hardware. Those custom developed 
 displays or multimedia output can be assigned to <span style="font-style: italic;">STATISTICA</span> 
 toolbars, menus, or dialogs and become a permanent part of &quot;your&quot; 
 <span style="font-style: italic;">STATISTICA</span> application.</p>
<p>There are various methods to request <span style="font-style: italic;">STATISTICA</span> 
 Graphs. You could say that these methods represent different types of 
 &quot;interfaces&quot; between numbers and graphs.</p>
<p>For example, the numbers represented in a pie chart can simply depict 
 values of a spreadsheet column (e.g., variable Sales) in the consecutive 
 cases of the spreadsheet (e.g., cases labeled: Year 2002, Year 2003, Year 
 2004, ..., etc.). The numbers in a similar pie chart, however, can also 
 represent results of some calculations. For example, the slices of the 
 pie can represent relative frequencies of observations that belong to 
 certain categories calculated by one of the histogram or frequency categorization 
 procedures (e.g., numbers of years when the Sales were below $10 million, 
 between $10 and $20 million, and above $20 million).</p>
<p>Regardless of the method used to create a graph (i.e., regardless of 
 where the numbers represented in the graph were obtained or how they were 
 calculated), all <span style="font-style: italic;">STATISTICA</span> Graph 
 customization and multigraphics management facilities can be used to change 
 the appearance of the graph or integrate it with other graphs or documents.</p>
<p><img src="../../Images/v6-p032.gif" x-maintain-ratio=TRUE style="border: none; width: 400px; height: 300px; float: none;
		border-style: none; border-style: none;" width=400 height=300 border=0></p>
<p>Also, all integrated analytic facilities that are accessible from within 
 graphs in <span style="font-style: italic;">STATISTICA</span> (such as 
 function fitting, smoothing, rotation, brushing, analytical zooming, etc.) 
 are available and can be applied to the graph regardless of the source 
 of the numbers in the graph or the method that was used to create it. 
 </p>
<p>The graph editing facilities offered in <span style="font-style: italic;">STATISTICA</span> 
 enable you to create not only highly customized scientific and technical 
 publication-ready displays </p>
<p><img src="../../Images/v6-p153.gif" x-maintain-ratio=TRUE style="border: none; width: 400px; height: 300px; float: none;
		border-style: none; border-style: none;" width=400 height=300 border=0></p>
<p>and precise drawings, </p>
<p><img src="../../Images/v6p193.gif" x-maintain-ratio=TRUE style="border: none; width: 400px; height: 300px; float: none;
		border-style: none; border-style: none;" width=400 height=300 border=0></p>
<p>but also presentation-quality diagrams, posters, business charts, and 
 other displays </p>
<p><img src="../../Images/v6p164.gif" x-maintain-ratio=TRUE style="border: none; width: 400px; height: 300px; float: none;
		border-style: none; border-style: none;" width=400 height=300 border=0></p>
<p>that are designed to communicate information in an effective and attractive 
 manner. </p>
<p>Graphs that are saved into files or that in any other way have been 
 temporarily detached from the <span style="font-style: italic;">STATISTICA</span> 
 application (e.g., copied to the Clipboard or linked to a document in 
 another application) are complete &quot;objects&quot; (technically speaking, 
 ActiveX objects) that contain not only all customization features and 
 other embedded objects, but also all data that are necessary to continue 
 editing all aspects of the display or the analysis of its contents (fitting, 
 smoothing, etc.).</p>
<p>Because <span style="font-style: italic;">STATISTICA</span> Graphs are 
 ActiveX objects, they can easily be linked to or embedded into other compatible 
 documents (e.g., Excel or Word documents), where they can be in-place 
 edited by double-clicking on them. <span style="font-style: italic;">STATISTICA</span> 
 Graphs are also ActiveX containers and, therefore, can contain a wide 
 variety of embedded or linked documents such as Visio drawings, Adobe 
 illustrations, Excel spreadsheets, or Word documents. Moreover, <span 
 style="font-style: italic;">STATISTICA</span> supports hierarchies of 
 embedded objects up to four levels, which means that it can manage &quot;documents, 
 containing documents, containing documents, which contain documents.&quot;</p>
<p>You can add ActiveX controls to graphs. When a graph is displayed, select 
 <span style="font-style: italic;">OLE Control</span> from the <span style="font-style: italic;">Insert</span> 
 menu to display the <span style="font-style: italic;"><a HREF="../ModifyingGraphs/Dialogs/InsertControl.htm">Insert 
 Control</a></span> dialog, and select the desired control to be inserted.</p>
<p>Event Handlers for events generated by the ActiveX control can be defined 
 in the Graph's Event Script by selecting <span style="font-style: italic;">View 
 Code</span> from the <span style="font-style: italic;">View - Events</span> 
 submenu.</p>
