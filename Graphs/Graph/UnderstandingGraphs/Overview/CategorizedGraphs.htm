<p>One of the most important, general, and also powerful analytic methods 
 involves dividing (&quot;splitting&quot;) the data set into categories 
 in to order compare the patterns of data between the resulting subsets. 
 This common technique is known under a variety of terms (such as breaking 
 down, grouping, categorizing, splitting, slicing, drilling-down, or conditioning) 
 and it is used both in exploratory data analyses and hypothesis testing. 
 For example: A positive relation between the age and the risk of a heart 
 attack may be different in males and females (it may be stronger in males). 
 A promising relation between taking a drug and a decrease of the cholesterol 
 level may be present only in women with a low blood pressure and only 
 in their thirties and forties. The process capability indices or capability 
 <a href="Glossary.chm::/GlossaryTwo/2dgraphs/2DHistograms.htm">histograms</a> 
 can be different for periods of time supervised by different operators. 
 The regression slopes can be different in different experimental groups.</p>
<p>There are many computational techniques that capitalize on grouping 
 and that are designed to quantify the differences that the grouping will 
 reveal (e.g., <a href="Glossary.chm::/GlossaryTwo/G/GeneralANOVAMANOVA.htm">ANOVA/MANOVA</a>). 
 However, graphical techniques (such as <a href="Glossary.chm::/GlossaryTwo/C/CategorizedGraphsalsoTrellisGraphs.htm">categorized 
 graphs</a> discussed in this section) offer unique advantages that cannot 
 be substituted by any computational method alone: they can reveal patterns 
 that cannot be easily quantified (e.g., complex interactions, exceptions, 
 anomalies) and they provide unique, multidimensional, global analytic 
 perspectives to explore or &quot;<a href="Glossary.chm::/GlossaryTwo/D/DataMining.htm">mine</a>&quot; 
 the data.</p>
<p><font style="color: #000080;" color=#000080><span style="font-weight: bold;">What 
 are Categorized Graphs? </span></font>Categorized graphs (the term first 
 used in <span style="font-style: italic;">STATISTICA</span> software by 
 StatSoft in 1990; also recently called Trellis graphs, by Becker, Cleveland, 
 and Clark, at Bell Labs) produce a series of 2D, 3D, ternary, or <ignored>nD</ignored> 
 graphs (such as <a href="Glossary.chm::/GlossaryTwo/2dgraphs/2DHistograms.htm">histograms</a>, 
 <a href="Glossary.chm::/GlossaryTwo/2dgraphs/2DScatterplot.htm">scatterplots</a>, 
 <a href="Glossary.chm::/GlossaryTwo/2dgraphs/2DLinePlots.htm">line plots</a>, 
 <a href="Glossary.chm::/GlossaryTwo/3DGraphs/3DSurfacePlot.htm">surface 
 plots</a>, <a href="Glossary.chm::/GlossaryTwo/3DGraphs/3DScatterplotsTernaryGraph.htm">ternary 
 scatterplots</a>, etc.), one for each selected category of cases (i.e., 
 subset of cases), for example, respondents from New York, Chicago, Dallas, 
 etc. These &quot;component&quot; graphs are placed sequentially in one 
 display, allowing for comparisons between the patterns of data shown in 
 graphs for each of the requested groups (e.g., cities).</p>
<p>A variety of methods can be used to select the subsets; the simplest 
 of them is using a categorical variable (e.g., a variable <span style="font-style: italic;">City</span>, 
 with three values <span style="font-style: italic;">New York</span>, <span 
 style="font-style: italic;">Chicago</span>, and <span style="font-style: italic;">Dallas</span>). 
 For example, the following graph shows <a href="Glossary.chm::/GlossaryTwo/2dgraphs/2DHistograms.htm">histograms</a> 
 of a variable representing self-reported stress levels in each of the 
 three cities.</p>
<p><img src="../../../Images/CATE_1.GIF" style="width: 300px; height: 212px; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;
		margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; border-style: none;
		border-style: none;" width=300 height=212 border=0></p>
<p>One could conclude that the data suggest that people who live in Dallas 
 are less likely to report being stressed, while the patterns (distributions) 
 of stress reporting in New York and Chicago are quite similar.</p>
<p>Categorized graphs in <span style="font-style: italic;">STATISTICA</span> 
 also support two-way or multi-way categorizations, where not one criterion 
 (e.g., <span style="font-style: italic;">City</span>) but two or more 
 criteria (e.g., <span style="font-style: italic;">City</span> and <span 
 style="font-style: italic;">Time</span> of the day) are used to create 
 the subsets. Two-way categorized graphs can be thought of as &quot;crosstabulations 
 of graphs&quot; where each component graph represents a cross-section 
 of one level of one <a href="Glossary.chm::/GlossaryTwo/G/GroupingorCodingVariable.htm">grouping 
 variable</a> (e.g., <span style="font-style: italic;">City</span>) and 
 one level of the other grouping variable (e.g., <span style="font-style: italic;">Time</span>).</p>
<p><img src="../../../Images/CATE_2.GIF" style="width: 300px; height: 212px; border-style: none; border-style: none;" 
 width=300 height=212 border=0></p>
<p>Adding this second factor reveals that the patterns of stress reporting 
 in New York and Chicago are actually quite different when the <span style="font-style: italic;">Time</span> 
 of questioning is taken into consideration, whereas the <span style="font-style: italic;">Time</span> 
 factor makes little difference in Dallas.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Categorized graphs vs. matrix graphs. 
 </span>Matrix graphs also produce displays containing multiple component 
 graphs; however, each of those component graphs are (or can be) based 
 on the same set of cases and the graphs are generated for all combinations 
 of variables from one or two lists. Categorized graphs require a selection 
 of variables that normally would be selected for non-categorized graphs 
 of the respective type (e.g., two variables for a scatterplot). However, 
 in categorized plots, you also need to specify at least one <a href="Glossary.chm::/GlossaryTwo/G/GroupingorCodingVariable.htm">grouping 
 variable</a> (or some criteria to be used for sorting the observations 
 into the categories) that contains information on group membership of 
 each case (e.g., Chicago, Dallas). That <a href="Glossary.chm::/GlossaryTwo/G/GroupingorCodingVariable.htm">grouping 
 variable</a> will not be included in the graph directly (i.e., it will 
 not be plotted) but it will serve as a criterion for dividing all analyzed 
 cases into separate graphs. As illustrated above, one graph will be created 
 for each group (category) identified by the grouping variable.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Common vs. Independent scaling. </span>Each 
 individual category graph can be scaled according to its own range of 
 values (independent scaling),</p>
<p><img src="../../../Images/CATE_3.GIF" style="width: 303px; height: 215px; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;
		margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; border-style: none;
		border-style: none;" width=303 height=215 border=0></p>
<p>or all graphs can be scaled to a common scale wide enough to accommodate 
 all values in all of the category graphs.</p>
<p><img src="../../../Images/CATE_4.GIF" style="width: 306px; height: 216px; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;
		margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; border-style: none;
		border-style: none;" width=306 height=216 border=0></p>
<p>Common scaling allows the analyst to make comparisons of ranges and 
 distributions of values among categories. However, if the ranges of values 
 in graph categories are considerably different (causing a very wide common 
 scale), then some of the graphs may be difficult to examine. The use of 
 independent scaling may make it easier to spot trends and specific patterns 
 within categories, but it may be more difficult to make comparisons of 
 ranges of values among categories.</p>
