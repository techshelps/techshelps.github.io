 - Scatter Icon Plots</h1>
<p>A scatter icon plot is a scatterplot of point markers which are icons 
 representing for each specific data point (defined by the scatterplot 
 {X,Y} coordinates) the variability within a set of other variables chosen 
 for the icon. Thus, scatter icon plots, in a way, serve the dual purpose 
 of pictorially depicting the variability between two variables (e.g., 
 height and weight) and the variability within a set of other icon variables 
 (e.g., scores of individuals on different questionnaires). The basic idea 
 of using icons (see also the respective discussion of <a href="../Concepts/ConceptualOverviewsIconPlots.htm">Icon 
 plots</a>) in a scatterplot is to represent individual points as particular 
 graphical objects (rather than point markers) where values of variables 
 are assigned to specific features or dimensions of the objects (icons). 
 The assignment is such that the overall appearances of the objects change 
 as a function of the configuration of values. Thus, the objects are given 
 visual &quot;identities&quot; that are unique for configurations of values 
 and that can be identified by the observer. Examining such icons in the 
 scatterplot may help to discover specific clusters of both simple relations 
 and interactions between variables. </p>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Scatter icon plots vs. Icon plots.</span> 
 Both the Scatter Icon plot and the simple <a href="../Concepts/ConceptualOverviewsIconPlots.htm">Icon 
 plot</a> capitalize on the human ability to &quot;automatically&quot; 
 spot complex (sometimes interactive) relations between multiple variables 
 if those relations are consistent across a set of instances (in this case 
 &quot;icons&quot;). In both cases, the individual units of observations 
 are represented as particular graphical objects. However, the two types 
 of plots differ in the sense that the individual plot points in the scatter 
 icon plot are represented by icons (star, polygon, Chernoff face, etc.) 
 in the two dimensional space, where axes represent two variables, while 
 in a simple icon plot the individual consecutive observations are represented 
 by (consecutive) icons arranged one-next-to the other, and without any 
 reference to the axes. To be more specific, in the scatter icon plot the 
 two coordinates that determine the location of each point (represented 
 by an icon) correspond to its specific values on the two variables; while 
 the icons in an icon plot are arranged in an array without any significance 
 attached to their location; the function of icons is limited only to representation 
 of individual observations based on a set of variables attached to the 
 features of the respective icons.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Types of Scatter Icon Plots.</span> 
 <spaces>&nbsp;</spaces>Most scatter icon plots use one of the two categories 
 of icons: circular (such as star plots, sun ray plots, polygon icons) 
 and sequential (such as column icons, profile icons, line icons). However, 
 it is not uncommon to use pies or Chernoff faces as icons in the scatter 
 icon plot. <span style="font-style: italic;">STATISTICA</span> provides 
 options for using Chernoff faces, Pies, Stars, Sunrays, Polygons, Columns, 
 Lines, or Profiles as icons in the scatter icon plot. See also the description 
 of <a href="../Concepts/ConceptualOverviewsIconPlots.htm">Icon plots</a> 
 for additional details.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Choice of Icon.</span> The choice of 
 an icon to be used in the scatter icon plot is important and depends on 
 the specific application. For example, the overall shape of the circular 
 type of icon assumes distinctive and identifiable overall patterns, depending 
 on multivariate configurations of values of input variables. Therefore, 
 using this type of icon may help to identify interactive relations between 
 variables of interest that will be used in defining the chosen circular 
 icon (star, sun ray, or polygon). If the aim is to translate overall patterns 
 into specific models (in terms of relations between icon variables) or 
 to verify specific observations about the pattern, then one of the sequential 
 icons (column, profile, or line) may be more appropriate. Pies as icons 
 are more versatile in the sense that they can be used for both types of 
 applications. The use of Chernoff faces as icons is a bit involved, but 
 once their features are appropriately defined by suitably assigning the 
 variables, they can reveal hidden patterns of interrelations between variables. 
 </p>
<p>Additionally, a weight variable can be selected and used to scale the 
 entire icon representing the point. Sometimes the standardization of icon 
 variables may be required to assure within-icon compatibility of value 
 ranges. See also the description of <spaces>&nbsp;</spaces><a href="../Concepts/ConceptualOverviewsIconPlots.htm">Icon 
 plots</a> for additional details.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Applications</span>. <spaces>&nbsp;</spaces>Two-dimensional 
 scatterplots are used to visualize the relationship between two variables 
 (e.g. height and weight). There are many situations where a scatter icon 
 plot can provide information that is beyond the scope of a simple two-dimensional 
 scatterplot. For example, the scatterplot can, no doubt, indicate the 
 lack of homogeneity in the sample by forming distinctive clouds of points 
 in the graph, but the information about other factors that contributed 
 to such clustering can be available if icons (defined by a set of variables) 
 are used in place of point markers, i.e., by creating a scatter icon plot. 
 <spaces>&nbsp;</spaces></p>
<p>Another interesting application of the scatter icon plots is to investigate 
 the nature and causes of <a href="Glossary.chm::/GlossaryTwo/O/Outliers.htm">outliers</a> 
 in the data. As the icons representing the points are defined by a set 
 of variables, the comparison of icons (corresponding to the outlying observations) 
 with the icons (representing other observations) can suggest the factors 
 (variables) that might have been responsible for the outlying behavior 
 of some observations. <spaces>&nbsp;</spaces></p>
<p>In yet another situation, one may want to explore possible complex relationships 
 between several variables. A scatter icon plot can then be used as a simple 
 icon plot to detect the variables that &quot;go together&quot;.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Scatter Icon Plots in </span><span 
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">STATISTICA</span>. <spaces>&nbsp;</spaces><span 
 style="font-style: italic;">STATISTICA</span> provides a variety of graph 
 types for scatter icon plots including Chernoff faces, Pies, Stars, Sunrays, 
 Polygons, Columns, Lines, and Profiles. Scatter icon plots in STATISTICA 
 can be created from the Graphs menu. Select <span style="font-style: italic;">Scatter

 the <span style="font-style: italic;"><a HREF="../../CreatingGraphs/Dialogs/2DGraphs/ScatterIconPlots.htm">Scatter
