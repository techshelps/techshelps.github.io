 Conceptual Overviews - Scatter Image Plots</h1>
<p>A scatter image plot is a scatterplot with point markers which are images 
 representing each specific data point (defined by the scatterplot {X, 
 Y} coordinates). The basic idea of using images in a scatterplot is to 
 represent individual points as particular graphical objects, so that the 
 points with similar characteristics (e.g., same gender in a Height vs. 
 weight scatterplot, or individuals in a certain age bracket in a weight 
 vs. blood pressure scatterplot) can be easily identified. This pictorial 
 version of the scatterplot can reveal a great deal of information about 
 other aspects (in addition to the X and Y variables) of the problem; there 
 may be clustering of individuals falling into the same age brackets, or 
 of individuals of the same gender. These are only a few of the numerous 
 situations where using images for the points can significantly add to 
 the information that a simple scatterplot would not be able to depict. 
 </p>
<p>In general, in this type of plot the points on the scatterplot are represented 
 by images rather than the point markers. Different image files (<span 
 style="font-style: italic;">STATISTICA</span> supports bitmap, metafile, 
 PNG, and JPG formats) can be attached to different data points, and a 
 weight variable can be used to scale specific image markers accordingly. 
 Unlike <a HREF="ScatterIconPlotsOverview.htm">Scatter icon plots</a>, 
 the images in a scatter image plot are not icons that are defined by specific 
 variables; they are rather user-selected graphics files.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Scatter icon plots vs. Scatter image 
 plots</span>. Both <a HREF="ScatterIconPlotsOverview.htm">Scatter icon 
 plot</a> and <a href="Glossary.chm::/GlossaryTwo/2dgraphs/2DScatterImagePlots.htm">Scatter 
 image plot</a> are basically scatterplots and for that reason show relations 
 between two variables; the two coordinates (in 2D plots) that determine 
 the location of each point (represented as particular graphical objects) 
 correspond to its specific values on the two variables. <spaces>&nbsp;</spaces>However, 
 the two types of plots differ in the sense that the individuals in a scatter 
 icon plot are represented by icons (star, polygon, Chernoff face, etc.) 
 that are defined by a set of variables, while in the scatter image plot 
 the individual points are represented by images that are nothing more 
 than pictures (symbolizing a common characteristic). Thus, the scatter 
 image plots cannot provide information about the within variability of 
 a set of variables as the scatter icon plots can do, where the variables 
 of interest are used to define the graphical object (icon). </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Creating images for Scatter Image Plots.</span> 
 <spaces>&nbsp;</spaces>The images that can be used in these types of plots 
 are graphical objects that can be stored in image files which can be attached 
 to different data points (defined by the scatterplot X and Y coordinates). 
 <span style="font-style: italic;">STATISTICA</span> supports files in 
 bitmap, metafile, PNG, and JPG formats. Although, the choice of images 
 is not an involved task, yet an appropriate choice of images can help 
 in depicting any hidden aspects (to be uncovered by assigning images to 
 points) much more clearly. Unlike scatter icon plot, one has a choice 
 to use as many images in a scatter image plot as desired (even a different 
 image can be used for each point). In a given situation, it may be useful 
 to use different sizes for the same image so as to depict some important 
 feature (e.g., suppose your data points represent animals; you could use 
 images of different sizes to denote differences in the animals' weight). 
 A weight variable can be used to automatically scale specific image markers 
 according to certain feature. For example, if gender is used as the weight 
 variable, then all images representing males will be of the same size, 
 but different from the common size of images representing females in the 
 scatterplot. <span style="font-style: italic;">STATISTICA</span> provides 
 options also for manually controlling image sizes.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Applications</span>. <spaces>&nbsp;</spaces>Two-dimensional 
 scatterplots are used to visualize relationship between two variables 
 (e.g. height and weight). There are many situations where a scatter image 
 plot can provide information that will remain hidden if a simple two-dimensional 
 scatterplot is used instead. For example, the scatterplot can indicate 
 the lack of homogeneity in the sample by forming distinctive clouds of 
 points in the graph, but the information as to whether this clustering 
 can be attributed to certain feature (e.g., gender in the height vs. weight 
 scatterplot) will remain hidden unless the points corresponding to males 
 and females are represented by different images in the scatter plot, i.e., 
 a scatter image plot is created. </p>
<p>The fitting of functions to scatter points helps to identify and summarize 
 the patterns of relations between variables. However, in a given situation, 
 it may be more useful to fit different functions to different sets of 
 observations, rather than one common function. A scatter image plot can 
 provide guidance with respect the different functions that should be fit 
 to different &quot;groups&quot; of cases.</p>
<p>In other situations, the scatter image plot may suggest the use of piecewise 
 linear regression, if two different trends are observed for points represented 
 by two different images that were used on the basis of a cut off value 
 (e.g., 400<span style="vertical-align: Super;">o</span><span style="vertical-align: Super;"> 
 </span>C) of Temperature. </p>
<p>Finally, scatter image plots can be used to create interesting and appealing 
 presentations of data. By replacing the standard point markers with interesting 
 relevant pictures, perhaps scaled so as to highlight an important trend, 
 major conclusions can be &quot;packaged&quot; in engaging ways.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Scatter Image Plots in </span><span 
 style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">STATISTICA</span>. <spaces>&nbsp;</spaces><span 
 style="font-style: italic;">STATISTICA</span> can create both 2D and 3D 
 Scatter image plots. It provides a several options to select images of 
 the different forms and sizes. A variety of image file types (bitmap, 
 metafile, PNG, and JPG) are supported that can be attached to individual 
 data points. Scatter image plots in <span style="font-style: italic;">STATISTICA</span>
