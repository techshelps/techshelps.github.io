 - Bivariate Histograms</h1>
<p><a href="../../CreatingGraphs/Dialogs/3DSeqGraphs/3DBivariateHistograms.htm">Three-dimensional 
 (bivariate) histograms</a> are used to visualize crosstabulations of values 
 in two variables. They can be considered to be a conjunction of two simple 
 (i.e., univariate) histograms, combined such that the frequencies of co-occurrences 
 of values on the two analyzed variables can be examined.</p>

<p>There are two major reasons why frequency distributions (either univariate 
 or bivariate, such as those visualized in 3D histograms) are of interest.</p>
<p><symbol name=bullet><robohelp><font face="Symbol">&#183;</font></robohelp> 
 One can learn from the shape of the distributions about the nature of 
 the examined variables (e.g., a bimodal distribution may suggest that 
 the sample is not homogeneous, and consists of observations that belong 
 to two populations that are more or less normally distributed); this application 
 is particularly relevant for smoothed <a href="../../CreatingGraphs/Dialogs/3DSeqGraphs/3DBivariateHistograms.htm">3D 
 Bivariate Histograms</a> (see below).</p>
<p><symbol name=bullet><robohelp><font face="Symbol">&#183;</font></robohelp> 
 Many statistics are based on assumptions about the distributions of analyzed 
 variables; <a href="../../CreatingGraphs/Dialogs/3DSeqGraphs/3DBivariateHistograms.htm">3D 
 Bivariate Histograms</a> help one to test whether those assumptions are 
 met for pairs of variables.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold; color: #000080;">3D Histograms vs. Crosstabulations</p>
<p><a href="../../CreatingGraphs/Dialogs/3DSeqGraphs/3DBivariateHistograms.htm">3D 
 Bivariate Histograms</a> provide information similar to crosstabulations. 
 Although specific (numerical) frequency data are easier to read in a table, 
 the overall shape and global descriptive characteristics of bivariate 
 distributions may be easier to explore in a graph. Moreover, the graph 
 provides qualitative information about the distribution that cannot be 
 fully represented by any single index. For example, a bivariate skewed 
 distribution of response latencies vs. the duration of a reaction-time 
 task (in a reaction-time experiment) may result from the changes in subjects' 
 strategies of dealing with fatigue.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold; color: #000080;">Different Categorization 
 Methods in One Graph</p>
<p>Different methods of categorization can be used for each of the two 
 variables for which the bivariate distribution is visualized in the graph, 
 as illustrated in the following <a href="../../CreatingGraphs/Dialogs/3DSeqGraphs/3DBivariateHistograms.htm">3D 
 Bivariate Histogram</a> of reaction time scores by experimental condition.</p>
<p><img src="../../../Images/bivariatehist2.gif" x-maintain-ratio=TRUE 
 style="border: none; float: none; width: 478px; height: 360px;
		border-style: none;" width=478 height=360 border=0></p>
<p>Specifically, in this graph the distribution of reaction times (a continuous 
 variable categorized by dividing the entire range of values into 12 intervals 
 of equal size) can be reviewed across three experimental conditions (a 
 discrete variable with three distinctively labeled levels: <spaces>&nbsp;</spaces><span 
 style="font-style: italic;">BASE</span>, <span style="font-style: italic;">NORMAL</span>, 
 and <span style="font-style: italic;">DOUBLE</span>).</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold; color: #000080;">Smoothing Bivariate 
 Distributions.</span> The <a HREF="../../UsingGraphs/Overview/3DGraphSurfaces.htm">smoothing 
 facilities</a> available for <a href="../../CreatingGraphs/Dialogs/3DSeqGraphs/3DBivariateHistograms.htm">3D 
 Bivariate Histograms</a> allow you to fit surfaces to 3D representations 
 of bivariate frequency data. Thus, every 3D histogram can be turned into 
 a smoothed surface. This technique is of relatively little help if applied 
 to a simple pattern of categorized data (such as the histogram that was 
 shown above).</p>

 style="border: none; float: none; width: 525px; height: 398px;
		border-style: none;" width=525 height=398 border=0></p>
<p>However, if applied to more complex patterns of frequencies, it may 
 provide a valuable exploratory technique,</p>

 style="border: none; float: none; width: 525px; height: 364px;
		border-style: none;" width=525 height=364 border=0></p>
<p>allowing identification of regularities which are less salient when 
 examining the standard 3D histogram representations (e.g., see the systematic 
 surface &quot;wave-patterns&quot; shown on the smoothed histogram above).</p>
