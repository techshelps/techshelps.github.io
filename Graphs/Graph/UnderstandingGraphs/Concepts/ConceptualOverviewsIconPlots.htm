 - Icon Plots</h1>
<p>Icon plots provide a selection of plots that represent cases or units 
 of observation as multidimensional symbols.</p>
<p><img src="../../../Images/icon1.GIF" x-maintain-ratio=TRUE style="border: none; width: 504px; height: 280px; float: none;
		border-style: none;" width=504 height=280 border=0> </p>
<p>The basic idea of icon plots is to represent individual units of observation 
 as particular graphical objects where values of variables are assigned 
 to specific features or dimensions of the objects (usually one case = 
 one object). The assignment is such that the overall appearance of the 
 object changes as a function of the configuration of values. </p>
<p><img src="../../../Images/icon2.gif" x-maintain-ratio=TRUE style="border: none; float: none; width: 248px; height: 168px;
		border-style: none;" width=248 height=168 border=0></p>
<p>Thus, the objects are given visual &quot;identities&quot; that are unique 
 for configurations of values and that can be identified by the observer. 
 Examining such icons may help to discover specific clusters of both simple 
 relations and interactions between variables.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold; color: #000080;">Analyzing Icon Plots</p>
<p>The &quot;ideal&quot; design of the analysis of icon plots consists 
 of five phases:</p>
<p>1. Select the order of variables to be analyzed. In many cases a random 
 starting sequence is the best solution. You can also try to enter variables 
 based on the order in a multiple regression equation, factor loadings 
 on an interpretable factor, or a similar multivariate technique. That 
 method can simplify and &quot;homogenize&quot; the general appearance 
 of the icons, which would facilitate the identification of non-salient 
 patterns. It can also, however, make some interactive patterns more difficult 
 to find. No universal recommendations can be given at this point, other 
 than to try the quicker (random order) method before getting involved 
 in the more time-consuming method.</p>
<p>2. Look for any potential regularities, such as similarities between 
 groups of icons, outliers, or specific relations between aspects of icons 
 (e.g., &quot;if the first two rays of the star icon are long, then one 
 or two rays on the other side of the icon are usually short&quot;). The 
 circular type of icon plots (see Taxonomy of Icon Plots, below) is recommended 
 for this phase. </p>
<p>3. If any regularities are found, try to identify them in terms of the 
 specific variables involved. </p>
<p>4. Reassign variables to features of icons (or switch to one of the 
 sequential icon plots, see Taxonomy of Icon Plots, below) to verify the 
 identified structure of relations (e.g., try to move the related aspects 
 of the icon closer together to facilitate further comparisons). In some 
 cases, at the end of this phase it is recommended to drop the variables 
 that appear not to contribute to the identified pattern. </p>
<p>5. Finally, use a quantitative method (such as a regression method, 
 nonlinear estimation, discriminant function analysis, or cluster analysis) 
 to test and quantify the identified pattern or at least some aspects of 
 the pattern. </p>
<p style="font-weight: bold; color: #000080;">Taxonomy of Icon Plots</p>
<p>Most icon plots can be assigned to one of two categories: circular and 
 sequential. </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Circular icons.</span> Circular icon 
 plots (Star plots, Sun Ray plots, Polygon icons) follow a &quot;spoked 
 wheel&quot; format where values of variables are represented by distances 
 between the center (&quot;hub&quot;) of the icon and its edges. </p>
<p><img src="../../../Images/icon3.gif" x-maintain-ratio=TRUE style="border: none; float: none; width: 380px; height: 250px;
		border-style: none;" width=380 height=250 border=0></p>
<p>Those icons may help to identify interactive relations between variables 
 because the overall shape of the icon may assume distinctive and identifiable 
 overall patterns depending on multivariate configurations of values of 
 input variables. </p>
<p>In order to translate such &quot;overall patterns&quot; into specific 
 models (in terms of relations between variables) or verify specific observations 
 about the pattern, it is helpful to switch to one of the sequential icon 
 plots (see the next paragraph), which may prove more efficient when you 
 already know what to look for.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Sequential icons.</span> Sequential 
 icon plots (Column icons, Profile icons, Line icons) follow a simpler 
 format where individual symbols are represented by small sequence plots 
 (of different types).</p>
<p><img src="../../../Images/icon4.gif" x-maintain-ratio=TRUE style="border: none; float: none; width: 380px; height: 250px;
		border-style: none;" width=380 height=250 border=0></p>
<p>The values of consecutive variables are represented in those plots by 
 distances between the base of the icon and the consecutive break points 
 of the sequence (e.g., the height of the columns shown above). Those plots 
 may be less efficient as a tool for the initial exploratory phase of icon 
 analysis because the icons may look alike. However, as mentioned before, 
 they may be helpful in the phase when some hypothetical pattern has already 
 been revealed and you need to verify it or articulate it in terms of relations 
 between individual variables.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Pie icons.</span> Pie icon plots fall 
 somewhere in between the previous two categories; all icons have the same 
 shape (pie) but are sequentially divided in a different way according 
 to the values of consecutive variables.</p>
<p><img src="../../../Images/icon5.gif" x-maintain-ratio=TRUE style="border: none; float: none; width: 380px; height: 250px;
		border-style: none;" width=380 height=250 border=0></p>
<p>From a functional point of view, they belong rather to the sequential 
 than circular category, although they can be used for both types of applications.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Chernoff faces.</span> This type of 
 icon is a category by itself. Cases are visualized by schematic faces 
 such that relative values of variables selected for the graph are represented 
 by variations of specific facial features.</p>
<p><img src="../../../Images/icon6.gif" x-maintain-ratio=TRUE style="border: none; float: none; width: 380px; height: 250px;
		border-style: none;" width=380 height=250 border=0></p>
<p>Due to its unique features, it is considered by some researchers as 
 an ultimate exploratory multivariate technique that is capable of revealing 
 hidden patterns of interrelations between variables that cannot be uncovered 
 by any other technique. This statement may be an exaggeration, however. 
 Also, it must be admitted that <span style="font-style: italic;">Chernoff 
 Faces</span> is a method that is difficult to use, and it requires a great 
 deal of experimentation with the assignment of variables to facial features. 
 </p>
<p style="font-weight: bold; color: #000080;">Standardization of Values</p>
<p>Except for unusual cases when you intend for the icons to reflect the 
 global differences in ranges of values between the selected variables, 
 the values of the variables should be standardized once to assure within-icon 
 compatibility of value ranges. For example, because the largest value 
 sets the global scaling reference point for the icons, then if there are 
 variables that are in a range of much smaller order, they may not appear 
 in the icon at all, e.g., in a star plot, the rays that represent them 
 will be too short to be visible. See the <a HREF="../../CreatingGraphs/Dialogs/MatrixIcon/IconPlots.htm">Icon 
 Plots</a> dialog for more information on the standardization options available 
 for this type of graph.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold; color: #000080;">Applications</p>
<p>Icon plots are generally applicable (1) to situations where you want 
 to find systematic patterns or clusters of observations, and (2) when 
 you want to explore possible complex relationships between several variables. 
 The first type of application is similar to cluster analysis; that is, 
 it can be used to classify observations. </p>
<p>For example, suppose you studied the personalities of artists, and you 
 recorded the scores for several artists on a number of personality questionnaires. 
 The icon plot may help you determine whether there are natural clusters 
 of artists distinguished by particular patterns of scores on different 
 questionnaires (e.g., you may find that some artists are very creative, 
 undisciplined, and independent, while a second group is particularly intelligent, 
 disciplined, and concerned with publicly acknowledged success). </p>
<p>The second type of application (the exploration of relationships between 
 several variables) is more similar to factor analysis; that is, it can 
 be used to detect which variables tend to &quot;go together.&quot; For 
 example, suppose you were studying the structure of people's perception 
 of cars. Several subjects completed detailed questionnaires rating different 
 cars on numerous dimensions. In the datafile, the average ratings on each 
 dimension (entered as the variables) for each car (entered as cases or 
 observations) are recorded. </p>
<p>When you now study the Chernoff faces (each face representing the perceptions 
 for one car), it may occur to you that smiling faces tend to have big 
 ears; if price was assigned to the amount of smile and acceleration to 
 the size of ears, then this &quot;discovery&quot; means that fast cars 
 are more expensive. This, of course, is only a simple example; in real-life 
 exploratory data analyses, non-obvious complex relationships between variables 
 may become apparent.</p>
