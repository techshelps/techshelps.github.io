 - Sequential/Stacked Plots</h1>
<p><a HREF="../../CreatingGraphs/Dialogs/2DGraphs/SequentialStackedPlots.htm">Sequential/Stacked 
 Plots</a> are used to present sequences of values. In this respect, the 
 way in which they visualize data is similar to <a HREF="ConceptualOverviews2DLinePlotsVariables.htm">line 
 plots</a>. In fact, as long as you select only one variable to be plotted, 
 the graphical representation of data will be identical to the one offered 
 by line plots, although the specific graphical representations of data 
 offered by the current graphs are more differentiated (e.g., line plots, 
 area charts, step charts, bar charts, etc.).</p>
<p>The only major difference between the representation of data in those 
 graphs as compared to line graphs appears when you select more than one 
 variable to be plotted. In <a HREF="ConceptualOverviews2DLinePlotsVariables.htm">line 
 plots</a>, each of them would be plotted independently from the others; 
 thus, for example, if two variables have the same values for case number 
 3, at this point (case 3) the two lines will cross or overlap. However, 
 all graphs in the current category &quot;stack&quot; corresponding values 
 of consecutive variables (from the selected list).</p>
<p><img src="../../../Images/2dseqstack1.gif" x-maintain-ratio=TRUE style="border: none; float: none; width: 393px; height: 280px;
		border-style: none;" width=393 height=280 border=0></p>
<p>Thus, in this example, the point representing case number 3 in the second 
 variable will be respectively higher than in the first variable. The variables 
 are stacked in the order in which they were selected.</p>
<p>Due to this stacked representation of values in consecutive variables, 
 the lines (or steps, areas, columns, etc.) of consecutive variables will 
 never overlap as long as they are larger than 0.</p>
<p>This interpretation of data involves a limitation concerning missing 
 data in the plotted data set. Specifically, the graph location of each 
 data point in each consecutive variable (from the selected list) is calculated 
 as a sum of its value and the corresponding values (i.e., those for the 
 same case) in all &quot;preceding&quot; variables in the list. Therefore, 
 if any of those preceding values are missing, then the sum cannot be calculated 
 and the graph will be &quot;broken&quot; at this point. Thus, there should 
 be no missing data in the data sets selected for the stacked representation 
 (except for the last variable).</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold; color: #000080;">Applications</p>
<p><a HREF="../../CreatingGraphs/Dialogs/2DGraphs/SequentialStackedPlots.htm">Sequential/Stacked 
 Plots</a> are used to present sequences of values of selected variables. 
 Sequential/stacked line plots can be used for some of the applications 
 reviewed in <a HREF="ConceptualOverviews2DLinePlotsVariables.htm">line 
 plots</a>. However, the stacked feature of those graphs (applicable when 
 more than one variable is selected) is specifically designed to represent 
 the broad category of data sets in which consecutive variables represent 
 parts (&quot;portions&quot;) of one whole. For example, each case may 
 represent a particular formulation of a chemical blend, and each of several 
 variables may represent the volume of one of several chemicals in each 
 formulation. If such data were represented as a stacked column graph, 
 then the total height of each column would indicate the total volume of 
 the blend, and each of its stacked segments would show the relative contribution 
 of the respective chemicals. </p>
<p><img src="../../../Images/2dseqstack2.gif" x-maintain-ratio=TRUE style="border: none; float: none; width: 394px; height: 151px;
		border-style: none;" width=394 height=151 border=0></p>
<p>If the variables shown in the graph represent percentages and/or add 
 up to the same value (e.g., 100%) for each &quot;case,&quot; then the 
 total height of the graph will be constant across cases.</p>
