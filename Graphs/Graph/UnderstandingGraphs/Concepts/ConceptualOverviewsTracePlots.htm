 - Trace Plots</h1>
<p>As in <a HREF="ConceptualOverviews3DScatterplots.htm">3D Scatterplots</a>, 
 each data point in a trace plot is represented by its location in 3D space 
 as determined by the values of the variables selected as X, Y, and Z (and 
 interpreted as the X, Y, and Z axis coordinates). The data points are 
 then connected sequentially (in the order encountered in the datafile) 
 with a line to form a &quot;trace&quot; of a sequential process (e.g., 
 movement, change of a phenomenon over time, etc.).</p>

<p>A good metaphor of the information that is best represented in a trace 
 plot is that of the trajectory of an object in three-dimensional space.

<p>In general, any sequential process (or processes) that simultaneously 
 produces changes in three dimensions over consecutive measurements can 
 be studied via the trace plot.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Multiple trace plot.</span> The multiple 
 trace plot differs from the regular trace plot only in that it allows 
 for a list of Z variables; thus, multiple &quot;trajectories&quot; can 
 be simultaneously displayed.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold; color: #000080;">Applications</span> 
 </p>
<p>Examples of datasets that match the trajectory metaphor above could 
 be the behavior of any multivariate time series. Suppose you measured 
 the temperature, pollution level, and ozone content of the air in a large 
 city over consecutive months for several years. Since those variables 
 are likely cyclical in nature (i.e., it is cold in the winter in the northern 
 hemisphere), a characteristic pattern would emerge; moreover, the pattern 
 is usually not simple (e.g., linear) in nature. The prices for several 
 commodities or multiple economic indicators could also be studied via 
 this graph; that is, characteristic patterns or &quot;trajectories&quot; 
 over time may become apparent.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">3D drawings.</span> Another application 
 of this graph is to generate precise &quot;3D drawings&quot; (by providing 
 coordinates in 3D space) of objects such as control limits, marked areas, 
 etc. Typically, in order to customize (by overlaying) 3D data plots, 3D 
 objects &quot;drawn&quot; by the trace plot facility become active parts 
 of the 3D display, and thus they can be rotated and transformed in perspective 
 (see below). Note that such objects cannot be drawn interactively since 
 there is no method to control the third dimension (i.e., the &quot;depth&quot;) 
 in drawn objects (they can only be &quot;drawn&quot; by specifying 3D 
 coordinate systems in <span style="font-style: italic;"><a href="Macros.chm::/Macro/UnderstandingMacros/VBAOverview.htm">STATISTICA</span> 
 Visual Basic</a>).</p>

		border-style: none;" width=419 height=266 border=0></p>
<p>Inserting an incomplete case (i.e., a case with either one or two, but 
 not all three values X, Y, and Z) into the dataset presented as a trace 
 plot will break the line. </p>

<p>This feature can be used to create separate objects (as shown above).
