<p>This <span style="font-style: italic;">Electronic Manual</span> contains 
 topics devoted to specific <a HREF="GeneralCategoriesofGraphs.htm">categories 
 of graphs</a>, includes conceptual overviews and <a HREF="../../Indices/Examples_HIndex1.htm">examples 
 of typical applications</a>, and discusses distinctive functional properties 
 of the respective types of graphs. More comprehensive general introductions 
 to the science (and art) of visualization of data can be found in numerous 
 sources on the subject. Some of the recommended sources that address a 
 broad range of issues in statistical graphing are Buja and Tukey (1991), 
 Chambers, Cleveland, Kleiner, and Tukey (1983), Cleveland (1984, 1985), 
 Kolata (1984), Tufte (1983, 1990), Tukey (1977), and Tukey and Tukey (1981). 
 Representative collections of articles on specific issues, covering a 
 diverse selection of areas of visualization of statistical data, can be 
 found in the proceedings of the <span style="font-style: italic;">Annual 
 Meetings of the Section on Statistical Graphics of the American Statistical 
 Association</span> (published by the American Statistical Association).</p>
<p>The default settings of most statistical graphs offered in <span style="font-style: italic;">STATISTICA</span> 
 follow the established conventions that are either explicitly described 
 in the literature on statistical and technical graphing, or they represent 
 standards that are commonly accepted by major scientific journals (e.g., 
 <span style="font-style: italic;">SCIENCE</span>). However, practically 
 all default settings of <span style="font-style: italic;">STATISTICA</span> 
 can be customized to meet specific requirements of unusual applications. 
 <span style="font-style: italic;">STATISTICA</span>'s graphics facilities 
 were designed to play the role of flexible &quot;tools,&quot; capable 
 of producing effects that go far beyond established patterns and templates. 
 Moreover, these tools can be customized, new tools can be designed, and 
 both can be added to toolbars or menus for repeated use.</p>
<p>In addition to a comprehensive selection of standard statistical and 
 technical graphs, <span style="font-style: italic;">STATISTICA</span> 
 includes numerous unique types of graphs and graph customization facilities. 
 While StatSoft statisticians designed most of them, it is important to 
 say that our users have played an important role in their creation. In 
 fact, the final selection of graphics options included in <span style="font-style: italic;">STATISTICA</span> 
 is the result of input from thousands of users who provided their comments 
 and &quot;want lists&quot; in response to StatSoft's inquiries. Many unique 
 facilities of <span style="font-style: italic;">STATISTICA</span> Graphs 
 (e.g., the multiple subset selection facility, on-line categorization 
 options, and others) were introduced in response to users' ideas and requests. 
 We at StatSoft are very grateful for the input from our users.</p>
