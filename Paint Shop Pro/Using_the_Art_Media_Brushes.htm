<h1>Using the Art Media Brushes</h1>

<p>The Art Media brushes and tools in the Tools toolbar are shown here:</p>

<p><img src="Art_Media_Tools/Art%20Media%20tools.bmp"
		x-maintain-ratio=TRUE
		style="border: none;
				width: 170px;
				height: 258px;
				float: none;
				border-style: none;
				border-style: none;"
		width=170
		height=258
		border=0></p>

<p>Use these tools when working on Art Media layers. Like any other tool, 
 the Art Media tools have their own settings in the Tool Options palette 
 to control their behavior on the image.</p>

<p>The purpose of these tools is to simulate the rich, expressive results 
 you get when working on physical pigment media such as paint, chalk, pastel, 
 and pencil. The tools will appeal not only to creative graphic artists, 
 but also to photo-centric users looking for ways to touch up their images.</p>

<p class=NoteHeading>Note:</p>

<p class=NoteText>Although the Art Media tools support Presets, they do 
 not support custom brush tips like the Paint Brush and other raster painting 
 tools.</p>

<h2>The Wet Pigment Media Tools</h2>

<p>The <span class="hcp1">Oil Brush</span> and <span class="hcp1">Marker</span> 
 tools simulate painting with a wet pigment media. The Oil Brush further 
 simulates wet painting in that it will run out of paint during the stroke. 
 To &quot;get more paint,&quot; simply release the mouse button, then hold 
 it down again and drag more paint strokes. You can also get more paint 
 from the Mixer palette's Mixer area.</p>

<p>Note that the Oil Brush and the Palette Knife are the only Art Media 
 tools capable of producing strokes with multiple colors on the brush head. 
 This simulates what you could get using a real-life painting palette with 
 multiple wet pigments on it. Additionally, when the Oil Brush or Palette 
 Knife is active, you can &quot;dry&quot; wet strokes by choosing <span class="hcp1">Layers &gt; Dry Art Media layer</span>; conversely 
 you can make dried strokes &quot;wet&quot; by choosing <span class="hcp1">Layers 
 &gt; Wet Art Media layer</span>. (These commands are also available in 
 the Layer palette's context menu.)</p>

<p class=NoteText><span class="hcp1">Note</span>: Both the 
 <span class="hcp1">Dry Art Media layer</span> command and 
 the <span class="hcp1">Wet Art Media layer</span> command 
 can be selectively undone in the History palette.</p>

<h2>The Dry Pigment Media Tools</h2>

<p>The <span class="hcp1">Chalk</span>, <span class="hcp1">Pastel</span>, 
 <span class="hcp1">Crayon</span>, and <span class="hcp1">Colored 
 Pencil</span> tools simulate artwork created with dry pigment media. Unlike 
 the Oil and Acrylic brushes, these dry tools don't &quot;run out&quot; 
 of their respective pigment media. Additionally, the pigment applied with 
 these tools has less volume than what is applied via the Oil Brush or 
 Acrylic Brush.</p>

<h2>The Palette Knife, Smear, and Art Eraser Tools</h2>

<p>The <span class="hcp1">Palette Knife</span> can be used 
 to smear art media pigments with a hard, knife-like edge, or it can be 
 used to apply the pigments.</p>

<p>The <span class="hcp1">Smear</span> tool is to smear art 
 media pigments as though you were using a finger or cloth.</p>

<p>The <span class="hcp1">Art Eraser</span> tool is used 
 to erase pigment from the Art Media layer. When using the Art Eraser over 
 areas covered with multiple paint strokes (such as those applied by the 
 Oil or Acrylic brushes), you'll find that it may take multiple strokes 
 with the Art Eraser tool to clean the area. Conversely, using this tool 
 on strokes applied with the Chalk or Colored Pencil tool will yield quicker 
 results.</p>

<h2>Adjusting the Brush Size Via the Keyboard</h2>

<p>While using any Art Media tool, raster painting brush (with the exception 
 of the Warp brush), the Clone brush, the Color Replacer, or the Eraser 
 and Background Eraser, you can quickly adjust the brush size without taking 
 the cursor off the image and into the Tool Options palette. To adjust 
 the brush size via the keyboard:</p>

<ul>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CBullet><p class=Bullet>Press <span class="hcp1">Alt 
 + X </span>to <span class="hcp1">decrease</span> the brush 
 size by <span class="hcp1">one</span> pixel.</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CBullet><p class=Bullet>Press <span class="hcp1">Alt 
 + C</span> &nbsp;to 
 <span class="hcp1">increase</span> the brush size by <span class="hcp1">one</span> pixel.</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CBullet><p class=Bullet>Hold down <span class="hcp1">Alt 
 </span>and<span class="hcp1"> Shift </span>and press <span class="hcp1">X</span> to <span class="hcp1">decrease</span> 
 the brush size by <span class="hcp1">20</span> pixels.</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CBullet><p class=Bullet>Hold down <span class="hcp1">Alt 
 </span>and<span class="hcp1"> Shift </span>and press <span class="hcp1">C</span> to <span class="hcp1">increase</span> 
 the brush size by <span class="hcp1">20</span> pixels.</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CBullet><p class=Bullet>Hold down the <span class="hcp1">Alt</span> 
 key and drag (to drag, hold down the left mouse button and then move the 
 mouse) the left mouse button up or down to rapidly change the brush size.</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CBullet><p class=Bullet>Hold down the <span class="hcp1">Alt</span> 
 and <span class="hcp1">Shift</span> keys and drag the left 
 mouse button; the size will be set to its lowest value (3 pixels for the 
 Art Media tools, and 1 pixel for the raster painting tools) and then you 
 can drag to increase it from there. </p></li>
</ul>

<h2>About the Trace Check Box</h2>

<p>One particular Tool Options setting to be aware of is the <span class="hcp1">Trace</span> 
 check box. When this check box is marked, the current Art Media tool will 
 select the pigment/paint color by sampling the data below the center of 
 the brush regardless of the layer type. (This feature works much the same 
 way the Clone Brush's Sample Merged tool option works). When you hold 
 down the mouse button to begin the stroke, note that a single sample is 
 performed, and the resulting color is used for the duration of the stroke.</p>

<p>This feature allows you to, for example, use the Art Media tools to 
 trace over a photo residing on the Background layer, using colors in the 
 photo as the pigment media source. With careful, detailed use of this 
 feature you could create an impressionistic effect similar to what you 
 can get with some of Paint Shop Pro's own effects or even third party 
 plug-ins such as Virtual Painter.</p>

<p>Be aware that when tracing over elements such as an eye or other small, 
 fine features, you'll get better results if you set your zoom level appropriately 
 as well as the brush size setting in the Tool Options palette. </p>
