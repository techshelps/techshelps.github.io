<h1>About Masks</h1>

<p>A mask layer covers parts of another layer completely or with varying 
 levels of opacity. Use masks to fade between layers or to create special 
 effects with precision. For example, mask all details around the main 
 subject in a photograph, or use a mask to create a Web page navigation 
 bar that fades away.</p>

<p>You can create a new mask layer that you can paint on, use the mask 
 layer to hide or show underlying layers, or create a mask layer from an 
 image, a selection, or the luminance of an image. In addition, use one 
 of the sample masks (stored in the Masks folder of the Paint Shop Pro 
 program folder) and apply it as is, or customize it.</p>

<p>Mask layers function similar to other types of layers. Turn the visibility 
 of the mask layer on or off, change the overall opacity of the mask layer, 
 or link the mask layer to other layers. For more information, see <a href="../Working%20with%20Layers/Editing_Layer_Properties.htm">Editing 
 Layer Properties</a>. </p>

<p>Mask layers are automatically saved with the image in the .PspImage 
 format. You can also save a mask to an alpha channel or as a separate 
 image file on a disk. For more information, see <a href="Saving_Masks.htm">Saving 
 Masks</a>.</p>

<p class=Important><span class="hcp1">Important: </span><span 
 style="letter-spacing: 0.05em;">Masks work with greyscale with transparency 
 and 16 million color images only. To increase the color depth of an image, 
 see <a href="../Working%20with%20Colors%20and%20Materials/Increasing_the_Color_Depth_of_an_Image.htm">Increasing 
 the Color Depth of an Image</a>.</span></p>

<h3>How Masks Affect Underlying Layers</h3>

<p>A mask layer applies to all layers below it that are at the same level, 
 as follows:</p>

<ul>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CBullet><p class=Bullet>If a mask layer is in a layer 
 group, it applies only to layers within the group that are lower in the 
 stacking order.</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CBullet><p class=Bullet>If the mask layer is at the 
 main level (rather than in a layer group), it applies to all layers below 
 it in the stacking order. </p></li>
</ul>

<p>To change which underlying layers the mask applies to, on the Layer 
 palette drag the mask layer to a new position in the stacking order. For 
 more information, see <a href="../Working%20with%20Layers/Arranging_the_Stacking_Order_of_Layers.htm">Arranging 
 the Stacking Order of Layers</a>.</p>

<p>Mask layers can never be the bottom layer in the image or in a layer 
 group.</p>

<h3>Mask Layers as Greyscale Raster Layers</h3>

<p>Masks are greyscale raster layers—they contain pixels that can display 
 256 shades of grey. Rather than applying grey paint to the image, however, 
 the levels of grey correspond to levels of opacity, or masking. White 
 pixels show underlying layers, black pixels hide underlying layers, and 
 grey pixels show varying amounts of underlying layers. The darker the 
 grey, the more the underlying pixels are masked.</p>

<p>Even though masks are raster layers, you can create masks that hide 
 or show portions of vector layers. </p>

<p>When you select a mask layer, the Materials palette displays black, 
 white, and 254 shades of grey as available colors. Paint on the mask layer 
 to change the visibility of underlying pixels. All tools and commands 
 that work on greyscale raster layers work on masks. For the Line, Preset 
 Shapes, and Text tools, which can create raster or vector objects, use 
 the tools to create raster objects on mask layers.</p>

<p><span class="hcp1">Note: </span>To see what the mask layer 
 looks like, position the cursor over the layer name on the Layer palette.
