<h3>New Tools to Create Professional Results</h3>

<p><span class=BoldOption>Background Eraser Tool</span> Use the new Background 
 Eraser tool to select a colored area of the image and replace it with 
 transparency.</p>

<p><span class=BoldOption>Warp Brush</span> Create fun or dramatic effects 
 by altering your photos. Stretch, pull, push, tug, or swirl to create 
 unlimited effects.</p>

<p><span class=BoldOption>Straighten Tool</span> Align crooked photos. 
 Simply draw a horizontal or vertical line specifying the direction in 
 which to align the image.</p>

<p><span class=BoldOption>Enhanced Deform Tool</span> The new handles that 
 are easier to use. Use the tool to scale, shear, distort, rotate, and 
 apply perspective to images.</p>

<p><span class=BoldOption>Enhanced Painting Engine</span> Enjoy better 
 photo retouching with greater precision and smoother blending of brush 
 strokes. </p>

<p><span class=BoldOption>Enhanced Retouch Brushes</span> All of the retouch 
 brushes that were formerly part of the Retouch tool are now separate brushes. 
 For example, use the Dodge brush to lighten images and bring out details, 
 use the Burn brush to darken areas of images, or use the Saturation brush 
 to increase or decrease the saturation.</p>

<p><span class=BoldOption>Enhanced Crop Tool</span> Choose from preset 
 crop sizes, such as 4 x 6 or 8 x 10. This tool now also provides aspect 
 ratio control to make it even easier to achieve the perfect crop.</p>

<p><span class=BoldOption>Enhanced Selections</span> New Edge Seeker mode 
 adds more intelligence as the Freehand Selection tool automatically seeks 
 an edge between mouse click points along an object. You also have a wide 
 choice of ways to modify selections, such as removing holes and specks 
 and adding an inside feather.</p>

<p><span class=BoldOption>Versatile Tablet Options</span> Explore your 
 freedom and creativity with additional options for pen tablets—vary the 
 color, density, opacity, rotation, size, and thickness of brush strokes 
 based on pressure, tilt, altitude, and more.</p>

<p><span class=BoldOption>Layer Groups</span> Place layers in layer groups 
 to organize the Layer palette, apply settings (such as opacity) to all 
 layers within a group, and have mask and adjustment layers affect only 
 layers within the group (rather than all underlying layers).</p>

<p><span class=BoldOption>Mask Layers</span> Masks are now separate layers 
 rather than attributes of other layers. Mask layers mask all image data 
 below them at the same level; for example, all layers within a layer group.</p>
