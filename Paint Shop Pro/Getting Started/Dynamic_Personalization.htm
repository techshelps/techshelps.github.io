<h3>Dynamic Personalization</h3>

<p><span class=BoldOption>Customizing the User Interface </span>Adapt your 
 workspace to the way you work. Drag and drop any feature, special effect, 
 filter, and tool anywhere on the interface - wherever you want. Place 
 menu items and tools you frequently use on a floating or docked toolbar 
 that you create. You can also create your own keyboard shortcuts, and 
 customize the menus. </p>

<p><span class=BoldOption>Enhanced Workspaces</span> Once you have everything 
 set up just the way you like it, save your workspace <span class=Emdash>- 
 </span>or multiple workspaces. This is perfect if you share a computer 
 with others because each person can have their own personalized workspace 
 that loads instantly and saves time otherwise spent moving things around.</p>
