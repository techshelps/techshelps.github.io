<h1>Opening Raw Camera Data Images</h1>

<p>Raw camera data images, generally available only on high-end digital 
 cameras, record billions of shades of color. Unlike other image formats 
 captured by digital cameras, Raw images are unprocessed. They can also 
 be quite large in terms of file size, and depending on your computer's 
 capabilities, can take longer to open.</p>

<p>Paint Shop Pro allows you to apply corrections to Raw camera data images 
 prior to opening them into the program. By default, the Raw Camera Data 
 preferences option labeled <span class="hcp1">Prompt for 
 override settings each time a raw camera format is opened </span>is marked. 
 This option forces the Raw Camera Data dialog to display whenever you 
 attempt to open a Raw image. To access the Raw Camera Data preferences 
 tab, choose <span class="hcp1">File &gt; Preferences &gt; 
 File Format Preferences</span>, and click this tab.</p>

<p>The Raw Camera Data dialog lets you apply corrections for sharpening, 
 white balance, and exposure compensation. The dialog's preview area updates 
 to reflect any modifications.</p>
