<h1>Guidelines for Analyzing the Histogram</h1>

<p>Here are guidelines that can help you analyze the histogram and make 
 decisions about how to correct your images:</p>

<ul>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CBullet><p class=Bullet>If a line spikes, there are 
 many pixels at that value.</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CBullet><p class=Bullet>If a line is close to the 
 horizontal axis, there are few pixels at that level.</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CBullet><p class=Bullet>If the graph is spread out, 
 the image has a balanced composition and probably has enough detail to 
 be corrected.</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CBullet><p class=Bullet>If the lines are compressed 
 into a narrow area, the image probably doesn’t contain enough detail to 
 be corrected; try a new scan or find another picture.</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CBullet><p class=Bullet>The usefulness of the histogram 
 depends upon the image content as well as its channel values. For example, 
 an image of pale, desaturated skin tones may display a big saturation 
 peak on the left side (in the lower values) of the histogram. An image 
 of a bright red fire engine may display a peak on the right side (in the 
 higher values) of the histogram. If the images were improperly saturated, 
 the saturation histograms might be reversed.</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CBullet><p class=Bullet>If the greyscale graph is 
 mostly at the left side, the image is too dark.</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CBullet><p class=Bullet>If the greyscale graph is 
 mostly at the right side, the image is too light.</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CBullet><p class=Bullet>If the greyscale lines are 
 not spread out enough, you may need to increase the contrast.</p></li>
</ul>
