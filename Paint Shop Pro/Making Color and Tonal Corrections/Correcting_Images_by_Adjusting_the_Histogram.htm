<h1>Correcting Images by Adjusting the Histogram</h1>

<p>Use the Histogram Adjustment command to adjust the contrast and color 
 balance of your image. The Histogram Adjustment dialog graphs one color 
 channel at a time, unlike the Histogram Window which can display all color 
 channels at once. You may want to first display the Histogram Window (choose 
 <span class=BoldOption>View &gt; Palettes &gt; Histogram</span>), then 
 use autoproofing on the Histogram Adjustment dialog so you can see changes 
 graphed in the Histogram Window.</p>

<p class=Important><span class="hcp1">Important: </span>This 
 command applies to greyscale and 16 million (24-bit) color images only. 
 To increase the color depth of an image, see <a href="../Working%20with%20Colors%20and%20Materials/Increasing_the_Color_Depth_of_an_Image.htm">Increasing 
 the Color Depth of an Image</a>.</p>

<p><span class="hcp1">Note: </span>When you place the cursor 
 over the histogram, a ToolTip displays the following information: Input 
 is the value on the horizontal axis, Count is the number of pixels that 
 have that value, Integral is the percentage of pixels in the image with 
 that value, and Output is the adjusted value.</p>

<p>The graph in the Histogram Adjustment dialog displays how many pixels 
 are at each value of the selected channel. The vertical axis represents 
 the number of pixels and ranges from zero pixels to the highest number 
 of pixels in the graph. The horizontal axis represents the value from 
 zero to 255 of the selected channel.</p>

<p>When you change the histogram, the graph displays the adjusted his­togram 
 as red and the original histogram as grey. To turn off the red overlay, 
 clear the <span class=BoldOption>Overlay result histogram</span> check 
 box. </p>

<p>For detailed information on the graph, see <a href="Understanding_the_Histogram_Values.htm">Understanding 
 Histogram Values</a> and <a href="Guidelines_for_Analyzing_the_Histogram.htm">Guidelines 
 for Analyzing the Histogram</a>.</p>

<p>In the Histogram Adjustment dialog, you can edit the luminance (lightness) 
 and the red, green, and blue color channels. The Histo­gram Window (opened 
 by choosing <span class=BoldOption>View &gt; Palettes &gt; Histogram</span>) 
 also graphs the hue, saturation, and greyscale values, but these can­not 
 be edited by adjusting the histogram.</p>

<p class=StepHeading>To use the Histogram Adjustment command:</p>

<ol>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CStep1><p class=Step1>To limit the adjustment to 
 a specific area, make a selection in the image. See <a href="../Making%20Selections%20in%20Images/Using_the_Selection_Tools.htm">Using 
 the Selection Tools</a>.</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CStep><p class=Step>Choose <span class=BoldOption>Adjust 
 &gt; Brightness and Contrast &gt; Histogram Adjustment</span> to open 
 the Histogram Adjustment dialog.</p></li>
</ol>

<p class=BodyIndent>Click <img id="2" src="NAVIGATING_zoom%20in.jpg" style="width:14px; height:13px;" width="14" height="13" border="0" class="hcp2"> to magnify the histogram or click 
 <img id="3" src="NAVIGATING_zoom%20out.jpg" style="width:14px; height:13px;" width="14" height="13" border="0" class="hcp2"> to reduce the view of the histogram. Click 1:1 to display 
 the histogram at its original size.</p>

<ol start=3
	style="list-style: decimal;"
	type=1>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CStep><p class=Step>For the <span class=BoldOption>Edit</span> 
 option, choose a channel:</p></li>
</ol>

<p class=BodyIndent><span class=BoldOption>Luminance </span>Lightness values 
 of the image. If you are correcting contrast, start with this channel.</p>

<p class=BodyIndent><span class=BoldOption>Color</span> Pick a color channel 
 from the drop-down list: <span class=BoldOption>Red</span>, <span class=BoldOption>Green</span>, 
 or <span class=BoldOption>Blue</span>.</p>

<ol start=4>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CStep><p class=Step>In the <span class=BoldOption>Presets</span> 
 drop-down list, choose Default. The default values represent no adjustment 
 to the image.</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CStep><p class=Step>On the left side of the histogram, 
 look for a gap between the left edge and the point where the graph starts 
 to rise. If there is a gap, it shows that the darkest pixels in the image 
 are not completely black. Click and drag the Low slider (the black triangle) 
 to the point where the graph rises. The top Low edit box displays the 
 low position (from 0 to 255). The bottom edit box displays the percentage 
 of pixels that are between zero and the low value; their contrast will 
 be lost. As a general rule, keep the percentage below 0.1%.</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CStep><p class=Step>On the right side of the histogram, 
 look for a gap between the right edge of the window and the point where 
 the graph decreases to zero pixels. If there is a gap, click and drag 
 the High slider (the white triangle) to that point on the graph. This 
 changes the lightest pixels in the image to white. As a general rule, 
 keep the High percentage change (the bottom edit box) to below 0.1%.</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CStep><p class=Step>If the overall image is too dark 
 or too light, adjust the gamma. (Gamma is a standard measure of change 
 in an image’s contrast.) If the image is too dark, drag the Gamma slider 
 (the grey triangle) to the right to increase the gamma (the number changes 
 in the Gamma edit box). If the image is too light, drag the Gamma slider 
 to the left to decrease the gamma.</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CStep><p class=Step>If the graph has peaks on the 
 left and right sides and contains low points in the center, the midtones 
 need to be compressed. Shadows and highlights need to be expanded to reveal 
 the information they contain. This often occurs in flash photography when 
 a subject is too close to the camera; the subject appears brightly illuminated 
 but the background of the photograph is very dark. To compress the midtones, 
 click and drag the <span class=BoldOption>Midtones</span> slider up.</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CStep><p class=Step>If the graph peaks in the center 
 and has a low number of pixels at the left and right sides, expand the 
 midtones by dragging the <span class=BoldOption>Midtones</span> slider 
 down.</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CStep><p class=Step>If you are improving your image, 
 skip this step. If you are creating artistic effects, use the Output Max 
 and Min sliders on the left side of the histogram to make further adjustments. 
 The Max slider is the white circle within a grey square; the Min slider 
 is the black circle within a grey square. To darken the image’s whites, 
 click and drag the Max slider down. To lighten the image’s blacks, click 
 and drag the Min slider up.</p></li>
</ol>

<p class=NoteInSteps><span class=BoldOption>Note: </span>Even though you 
 are dragging sliders along the vertical axis, the Max and Min values actually 
 affect the horizontal axis. They indicate the maximum and minimum value 
 (from 0 to 255) in the image. All pixels outside those values are converted 
 so that they fall within the maximum and minimum.</p>

<ol start=11>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CStep><p class=Step>To adjust another color component, 
 choose it in the <span class=BoldOption>Edit</span> drop-down list and 
 follow these steps again.</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CStep><p class=Step>Click <span class=BoldOption>OK</span>.</p></li>
