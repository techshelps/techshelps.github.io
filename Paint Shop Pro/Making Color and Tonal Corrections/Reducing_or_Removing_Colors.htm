<h1>Reducing or Removing Colors</h1>

<p>In Paint Shop Pro you can reduce or remove colors in several ways. You 
 can create black-and-white, greyscale, duotone (two-color), colorized, 
 and sepia images. You can also create a negative image or create a positive 
 image from a photographic negative.</p>

<p class=StepHeading>Ways to reduce or remove colors:</p>

<p><span class=BoldOption>Creating Black and White Images</span> To create 
 a black-and-white image, use the Threshold command. See <a href="Creating_Black_and_White_Images.htm">Creating 
 Black and White Images</a>.</p>

<p><span class=BoldOption>Creating Greyscale Images </span>A greyscale 
 image looks like a traditional black-and-white photograph. See <a href="Creating_Greyscale_Images.htm">Creating 
 Greyscale Images</a>.</p>

<p><span class=BoldOption>Creating Sepia-Tone Images </span>Sepia tones 
 are the browns of old black-and-white photographs and newsprint. See <a href="Creating_Sepia-Tone_Images.htm">Creating Sepia-Tone Images</a>.</p>

<p><span class=BoldOption>Reducing the Number of Lightness Levels </span>Use 
 the Posterize command to reduce the number of lightness levels in the 
 image and create interesting effects. See <a href="Reducing_the_Number_of_Lightness_Levels.htm">Reducing 
 the Number of Lightness Levels</a>.</p>

<p><span class=BoldOption>Creating Negative Images </span>Use the Negative 
 Image command to replace each pixel color with its opposite on the color 
 wheel, use an Invert adjustment layer command to create an adjustment 
 layer that has the same effect as the Negative Image command but doesn’t 
 change the original image pixels, or use the Solarize command to produce 
 a negative image in which you control the threshold level. See <a href="Creating_Negative_Images.htm">Creating 
 Negative Images</a>.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Changing Individual Colors</span> You 
 can also use the Hue Map command to change the saturation or the lightness 
 of the image. When you adjust these values, all colors (original and shifted 
 colors) are adjusted. &nbsp;For 
 example, you can shift all greens to blues. See <a href="Changing_Individual_Colors.htm">Changing 
 Individual Colors</a>.</p>

<p><span class=BoldOption>Colorizing Images</span> Use the Colorize command 
 to replace all colors in a selection or an image with a single color and 
 saturation while leaving the lightness values unchanged. You can use this 
 command to create sepia tones (the brown seen in old photographs) and 
 other single-color effects. See <a href="Colorizing_Images.htm">Colorizing 
 Images</a>.</p>
