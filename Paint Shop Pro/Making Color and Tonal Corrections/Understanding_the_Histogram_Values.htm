<h1>Understanding Histogram Values</h1>

<p>The value of a selected channel is graphed from 0 to 255 along the horizontal 
 axis of the histogram. The meaning of the value depends on the selected 
 channel:</p>

<ul>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CBullet><p class=Bullet>Red, Green, and Blue values 
 represent the amount of red, green, or blue in each color channel. A channel 
 value of zero indicates the color is not present and a value of 255 indicates 
 the color is at full strength. For example, if the graph has a spike at 
 the value 128 for the Red channel, then there are a large number of pixels 
 with a red value of 128 (or middle red).</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CBullet><p class=Bullet>Hue, Saturation, and Lightness 
 values are a different representation of color than the Red, Green, and 
 Blue channels. Hue is the actual color and the value is the number assigned 
 on the color wheel; for example, red is zero, yellow is 43, green is 85, 
 cyan is 128, blue is 170, and magenta is 212. (As a reference, look at 
 the color wheel on the Jasc Color Picker.) Saturation is the level of 
 grey added to the hue; zero is very grey and unsaturated and 255 is no 
 grey and fully saturated. Lightness is the brightness of the hue; zero 
 is no light (black), 128 is middle grey, and 255 is fully light (white). 
 The lightness histogram has information similar to the greyscale histogram. 
 </p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CBullet><p class=Bullet>Greyscale values are levels 
 of grey; zero is black, 128 is middle grey, and 255 is white. These represent 
 the brightness or luminosity of an image. The distribution of grey values 
 determines the contrast of an image.</p></li>
</ul>
