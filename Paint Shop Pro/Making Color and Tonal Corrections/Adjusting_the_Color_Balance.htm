<h1>Adjusting the Color Balance</h1>

<p>In technical terms, color balance refers to the balance of red, green, 
 and blue in your images. In common usage, balancing colors means creating 
 natural looking images without color casts (an overall imbalance of colors 
 in an image). Use Paint Shop Pro to correct color balance and also to 
 change the balance to create dramatic effects. For a quick and easy way 
 to balance colors, use the Automatic Color Balance command. See <a href="../Improving%20Photographs/Automatically_Balancing_Colors.htm">Automatically 
 Balancing Colors</a>.</p>

<p class=TableHeading>Ways to adjust color balance:</p>

<p><span class=BoldOption>Changing the Overall Color Balance</span> Use 
 the Red/Green/Blue command to adjust the amount of red, green, and blue 
 in your image to make color corrections by changing the overall color 
 cast. See <a href="Changing_the_Overall_Color_Balance.htm">Changing the 
 Overall Color Balance</a></p>

<p><span class=BoldOption>Changing the Color Balance of Shadows, Midtones, 
 and Highlights</span> Use the Hue/Saturation/Lightness command to shift 
 all colors in an image and change their strength and lightness. See <a href="Changing_the_Color_Balance_of_Shadows,_Midtones,_and_Highlights.htm">Changing 
 the Color Balance of Shadows, Midtones, and Highlights</a>.</p>

<p><span class=BoldOption>Adjusting the Hue, Saturation, and Lightness 
 in Unison </span>Use the Hue/Saturation/Lightness command to shift all 
 colors in an image and change their strength and lightness. See <a href="Adjusting_the_Hue_Saturation_and_Lightness_in_Unison.htm">Adjusting 
 the Hue Saturation and Lightness in Unison</a>.</p>

<p><span class=BoldOption>Correcting Colors by Setting Black and White 
 Points</span> If an image has a color cast, an effective way to correct 
 it is to select those points that you know are supposed to be black or 
 white and shift all colors based on resetting these points to true black 
 and true white. See <a href="Correcting_Colors_by_Setting_Black_and_White_Points.htm">Correcting 
 Colors by Setting Black and White Points</a>.</p>

<p><span class=BoldOption>Adjusting the Color Channels</span> Use the Channel 
 Mixer command to increase or decrease the red, blue, or green color channel 
 by a percentage of itself and the other two channels. See <a href="Adjusting_Color_Channels.htm">Adjusting 
 Color Channels</a>.</p>
