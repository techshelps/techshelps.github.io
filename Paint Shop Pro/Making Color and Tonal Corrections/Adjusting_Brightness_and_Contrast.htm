<h1>Adjusting Brightness and Contrast</h1>

<p>There are numerous methods for correcting the brightness and contrast 
 of an image. Analyze the image with the histogram and then use the histogram 
 commands to adjust the image. Use the Brightness/Contrast command to adjust 
 the brightness or contrast individually. Use the Curves command to change 
 the brightness values of individual pixels. Use the Gamma Correction command 
 to change the image’s gamma, which adjusts the brightness and contrast 
 in unison. Adjust the brightness of highlights, midtones, and shadows 
 to improve contrast and bring out detail in light or dark areas. Use the 
 Levels command to adjust the lightness of the image. </p>

<p class=Important><span style="font-weight: bold;">Automatic adjustment:</span> 
 Choose <span class=BoldOption>Adjust &gt; Automatic&nbsp;Contrast Enhancement</span> 
 to adjust the contrast with several easy-to-use options. </p>

<p class=TableHeading>Ways to Adjust Brightness and Contrast:</p>

<p><span class=BoldOption>Using the Histogram to Fix Contrast Problems</span> 
 Use the Histogram Adjustment command to edit the luminosity (or lightness) 
 channel, To average image brightness, and to increase contrast. See <a 
 href="Using_the_Histogram_to_Fix_Contrast_Problems.htm">Using the Histogram 
 to Fix Contrast Problems</a>.</p>

<p><span class=BoldOption>Manually Adjusting Brightness and Contrast</span> 
 Manually adjust the brightness and contrast of an image using the Brightness/Contrast 
 command. See <a href="Manually_Adjusting_Brightness_and_Contrast.htm">Manually 
 Adjusting Brightness and Contrast</a>.</p>

<p><span class=BoldOption>Adjusting Individual Brightness Values</span> 
 Use the Curves command to adjust the individual brightness values of your 
 image. See <a href="Adjusting_Individual_Brightness_Values.htm">Adjusting 
 Individual Brightness Values</a>.</p>

<p><span class=BoldOption>Adjusting the Brightness and Contrast in Unison</span> 
 Use the Gamma Correction command to adjust the brightness and contrast 
 of an image in unison. The gamma of an image is a standard measure of 
 its contrast and brightness. See <a href="Adjusting_the_Brightness_and_Contrast_in_Unison.htm">Adjusting 
 the Brightness and Contrast in Unison</a>.</p>

<p><span class=BoldOption>Adjusting the Brightness of Highlights, Midtones, 
 and Shadows</span> Use the Highlight/Midtone/Shadow command to separately 
 adjust the light, middle, and dark values (the tonal values) of a photograph. 
 See <a href="Adjusting_the_Brightness_of_the_Highlights,_Midtones,_and_Shadows.htm">Adjusting 
 the Brightness of the Highlights, Midtones, and Shadows</a>.</p>

<p><span class=BoldOption>Adjusting the Lightness Levels</span> Use the 
 Levels command to make adjustments to the brightness, contrast, and gamma 
 in the image. Adjusting the gamma changes the brightness values of middle 
 grey tones. See <a href="Adjusting_the_Lightness_Levels.htm">Adjusting 
 the Lightness Levels</a>.</p>
