<h1>What's New in Paint Shop Pro 9</h1>

<p>Briefly described below are the new features in Paint Shop Pro 9 that 
 will enhance your ability to work with digital photographs, create and 
 enhance artwork and graphics, and boost your productivity. Click the Learn 
 More link for more information on each item.</p>

<h2>User Interface Changes</h2>

<p>Although similar to the version 8 interface, Paint Shop Pro 9 has been 
 updated to include the following.</p>

<ul>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CBullet><p class=Bullet>The History palette replaces 
 the Command History menu item. The History palette lists each command 
 applied to an image. You can then selectively undo any action without 
 affecting subsequent actions. Additionally, you can select and save steps 
 as a Quickscript to be applied to another image, or copy to the clipboard 
 the scripting language code (Python) associated with each step. <a HREF="Using_the_History_Palette.htm">Learn 
 More</a>.</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CBullet><p class=Bullet>The Mixer palette offers 
 a more natural, intuitive way for artists to create and pick colors. Working 
 in conjunction with the new Art Media brush tools and the new Art media 
 layer, the Mixer palette provides artists with the best way to digitally 
 simulate real-world painting. <a HREF="Using_the_Mixer_Palette.htm">Learn 
 More</a>.</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CBullet><p class=Bullet>The Materials palette now 
 contains the Frame tab, offering a new (and for some users a more intuitive) 
 method of choosing colors. <a HREF="Working%20with%20Colors%20and%20Materials/Basics_of_Using_the_Materials_Palette.htm">Learn 
 More</a>.</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CBullet><p class=Bullet>Open images can optionally 
 be displayed in a tabbed format across the top of the workspace. To make 
 an image active, click the desired tab. When many images are open, use 
 the forward and backward buttons to scroll among the tabs. <a HREF="Tabbed_Image_Windows.htm">Learn 
 More.</a></p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CBullet><p class=Bullet>The docking behavior of palettes 
 has been modified. Palettes can be set to slide open and closed from a 
 tab along the right side, roll up at a user-selected speed, or roll up 
 into the nearest quadrant of the workspace. <a HREF="Getting%20to%20Know%20the%20Program/Using_Toolbars_and_Palettes.htm">Learn 
 More</a>.</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CBullet><p class=Bullet>The default, main workspace 
 area right-click context menu now has more commands for enhancing control 
 of the workspace.</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CBullet><p class=Bullet>The Customize dialog now 
 contains a new tab called Scripts. This tab lets you easily bind a script 
 to one of 50 icons. The icon can then be dragged onto a toolbar or into 
 a menu. <a HREF="Binding_Scripts_to_Icons.htm">Learn More.</a></p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CBullet><p class=Bullet>The General Program Preferences 
 dialog has new options for the Crop tool's shading area, as well as the 
 number of steps to save for the History palette. Additionally, the main 
 workspace right-click context menu now contains the command to access 
 this dialog in a single click. <a HREF="Updates_in_Preferences_and_Customize_Dialogs.htm">Learn 
 More.</a></p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CBullet><p class=Bullet>In the Adjust menu, the three 
 Automatic correction commands (Color Balance, Contrast Enhancement, and 
 Saturation Enhancement) have been pulled out of their former submenus 
 and now reside as standalone items in the Adjust menu. Additionally, the 
 Adjust menu contains a Photo Fix item loaded with helpful commands geared 
 toward quickly correcting common problems with digital photos.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>New Art Media Tools</h2>

<p>Working in conjunction with the new Mixer palette, the new Art Media 
 tools let you create digital artwork that closely mimics real-world media, 
 pigments, paints, and artist's tools. The Oil Brush creates realistic 
 paint strokes, while the Chalk, Pastel, Crayon, Colored Pencil, and Marker 
 tools are used for making dry-pigment works of art. <a HREF="Using_the_Art_Media_Brushes.htm">Learn 
 More</a>.</p>

<h2>Image Browser Updates</h2>

<p>The Image Browser now contains two tabs, <span class="hcp1">Find</span> 
 and <span class="hcp1">Info</span>, in the left side of 
 the Browser window. The Find tab contains the familiar Windows Explorer-like 
 navigation view, and the Info tab displays image information, creator 
 data, and EXIF data. Additionally, with the Browser active you can choose 
 <span class="hcp1">File &gt; Sort</span> and use the Sorting 
 dialog to sort images by EXIF data. <a HREF="Getting%20Images%20into%20Paint%20Shop%20Pro/Using_the_Paint_Shop_Pro_Browser.htm">Learn 
 More</a>. </p>

<h2>Raw Camera Image Support</h2>

<p>You can now open Raw (unprocessed) images from high-end digital cameras 
 in Paint Shop Pro. Additionally, a new File Format Preferences tab contains 
 an option for displaying a dialog that allows for further Raw image editing 
 before the image opens in Paint Shop Pro. <a HREF="Setting_Raw_Camera_Data_Preferences.htm">Learn 
 More.</a></p>

<h2>New Digital Photo Correction Filters</h2>

<p>Four new filters provide innovative methods of correcting common problems 
 with digital photos:</p>

<ul>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CBullet><p class=Bullet>The <span class="hcp1">Digital 
 Camera Noise Removal</span> filter scans your photo and removes image 
 noise often inherent to digital cameras while intelligently preserving 
 normal image textures. You can even customize noise removal by defining 
 specific regions or color ranges to focus on or ignore, and then save 
 settings as a Preset that can be applied to photos taken from the same 
 camera. <a HREF="Using_the_Digital_Camera_Noise_Removal_Filter.htm">Learn 
 More.</a></p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CBullet><p class=Bullet>The <span class="hcp1">Chromatic 
 Aberration Removal</span> filter helps eliminate the colored glow that 
 often appears in digital photos, especially in an image's high contrast 
 images. <a HREF="Using_the_Chromatic_Aberration_Removal_Filter.htm">Learn 
 More</a>.</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CBullet><p class=Bullet>The <span class="hcp1">Fill 
 Flash</span> filter corrects underexposed, shadowy areas of your photos. 
 <a HREF="Using_the_Fill_Flash_Filter.htm">Learn More.</a></p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CBullet><p class=Bullet>The <span class="hcp1">Backlighting</span> 
 filter corrects the opposite problem by compensating for overexposed areas 
 surrounding the photo's subject. <a HREF="Using_the_Backlighting_Filter.htm">Learn 
 More.</a></p></li>
</ul>

<h2>New Effects</h2>

<p>Two new powerful and interesting effects include:</p>

<ul>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CBullet><p class=Bullet>The <span class="hcp1">Displacement 
 Map</span> effect lets you create two or three-dimensional surface effects 
 using a different, underlying image as the basis for the effect. <a HREF="Using_the_Displacement_Map_Effect.htm">Learn 
 More.</a></p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CBullet><p class=Bullet>The <span class="hcp1">Radial 
 Blur</span> effect lets you add interesting and fun spin, twist, and zoom 
 effects to an image. <a HREF="Using_the_Radial_Blur_Effect.htm">Learn 
 More.</a></p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Vector Drawing Tool Updates</h2>

<p>Creating vector shapes has never been easier or more powerful.</p>

 tool's functionality has been simplified to offer a clearer, more intuitive 
 way to create and edit curves and lines. <a HREF="Drawing_and_Editing_Objects/Drawing_Objects.htm">Learn

	<li class=kadov-p-CBullet><p class=Bullet>Three new tools, <span class="hcp1">Rectangle</span>, 
 <span class="hcp1">Ellipse</span>, and <span class="hcp1">Symmetric 
 Shape</span>, provide all the controls you need to create buttons, banners, 
 polygons, any kind of rectangle or ellipse or custom shape. <a HREF="Drawing_and_Editing_Objects/Drawing_Objects.htm">Learn 
 More</a>.</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CBullet><p class=Bullet>The <span class="hcp1">Preset 
 Shape</span> tool provides you with a variety of arrows, flowers, gears, 
 and other miscellaneous shapes. <a HREF="Drawing_and_Editing_Objects/Drawing_Objects.htm">Learn 
 More</a>.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Text Tool Updates</h2>

<p>The Text tool now provides a vertical text layout option, updates to 
 the text on a path feature, as well as new anti-aliasing rendering options 
 that generate cleaner text at smaller font sizes. <a HREF="Working%20with%20Text/Creating_Text.htm">Learn 
 More</a>.</p>

<h2>Crop Tool Updates</h2>

<p>The Crop tool now provides the option of shading the area outside the 
 crop box. This option can be set in the Transparency and Shading tab of
