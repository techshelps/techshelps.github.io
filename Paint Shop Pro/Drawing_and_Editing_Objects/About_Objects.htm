<h1>About Objects</h1>

<p>Vector objects are created with the Pen, Rectangle, Ellipse, Symmetric 
 Shape, and Preset Shape tools. Use the Preset Shape tool to create standard 
 shapes (circles, squares, and stars). Or, create your own custom shapes 
 using the Pen tool. Both tools can create raster or vector objects. For 
 overview information on vector and raster data, see <a href="../Getting%20Images%20into%20Paint%20Shop%20Pro/About_Raster_and_Vector_Graphics.htm">About 
 Raster and Vector Graphics</a>. The Text tool can also create vector objects. 
 For more information, see <a href="../Working%20with%20Text/About_Vector,_Floating_and_Selection_Text.htm">About 
 Vector, Floating, and Selection Text</a>.</p>

<p><span class="hcp1">Raster Objects</span> When you use 
 the Preset Shapes or Pen tool to draw raster objects, you are really painting 
 on a raster layer. Even though you create a raster object in the same 
 way as a vector object, your finished shape is not a vector object. Once 
 the shape is complete, it becomes pixels on a layer. You can only edit 
 the pixels with raster editing tools.</p>

<p class=BodyIndent><span class="hcp1">Note: </span>You can 
 only draw raster objects on raster layers. If you try to draw a raster 
 object on a vector layer, Paint Shop Pro will create a new raster layer 
 for your object.</p>

<p><span class="hcp1">Vector Objects</span> When you use 
 the Preset Shapes or Pen tool to draw vector objects, you are creating 
 objects that can be edited later. A vector object’s properties (outline 
 color, fill color, size, location and more) can all be easily changed 
 over and over. You can also edit the paths, con­tours, line segments, 
 and nodes that make up vector objects.</p>

<p class=BodyIndent><span class="hcp1">Note:</span> You can 
 only draw vector objects on vector layers. If you try to draw a vector 
 object on a raster layer, Paint Shop Pro will create a new vector layer 
 for your object.</p>
