<h1>CMYK Model</h1>

<p>The CMYK model is based on the fact that ink on paper both absorbs and 
 reflects light. As white light strikes the ink, part of the color spectrum 
 is absorbed and part is reflected back to your eyes (resulting in the 
 color you see). </p>

<p>In this model, the primary colors cyan (C), magenta (M), and yellow 
 (Y) combine in varying proportions to produce a variety of colors. When 
 the three colors are combined, they produce black. Because impurities 
 in the ink make it difficult to produce a true black, a fourth color, 
 black (K), 
 is added.</p>

<p>Combining inks in this way is called four-color process printing. It 
 is used by printing services and high-end color printers.</p>

<p>Although you cannot create images in Paint Shop Pro using the CMYK model, 
 you can produce color separations that can be printed on CMYK printers. 
 There are two ways to do this: You can split the images into CMYK channels 
 or you can print color separation pages.</p>

<p>CMYK channels are simply four separate greyscale images that represent 
 the percentage and location of cyan, magenta, yellow, and black in the 
 image. For more information, see <a href="Working_with_Color_Channels.htm">Working 
 with Color Channels</a>.</p>

<p>When you print CMYK separations, Paint Shop Pro prints a separate greyscale 
 page for each primary color. You can then use these pages as “color plates” 
 to give to a printing service. For more information, see <a href="../Printing%20Images/Printing_with_CMYK_Color_Separations.htm">Printing 
 with CMYK Color Separations</a>.</p>
