<h1>How Monitor and Print Colors Differ</h1>

<p>Computer monitor colors and printed colors may often be quite different—which 
 is a challenge when you are trying to match a certain color. Colors can 
 also appear different from monitor to monitor.</p>

<p>Image colors on a monitor are influenced by a variety of factors: the 
 color range, called the color gamut, of the input device (such as the 
 scanner or camera), the manufacturer and age of the monitor, and the monitor’s 
 brightness and contrast settings.</p>

<p>When you print an image, you introduce other factors that influence 
 color: the quality and absorption properties of the paper, the color gamut 
 of the printer, and the conversion of RGB values from the monitor to the 
 CMYK values of the printer’s ink.</p>

<p>This conversion is a challenge because of the different approaches to 
 color between monitors and printers. Because monitors use light to display 
 color, they use additive colors—when you add them together, they produce 
 white. Conversely, when you remove all monitor colors you produce black. 
 Because printers use ink to display color, they use subtractive colors—when 
 you remove colors, you produce white, and when you add all printer colors 
 you produce black. As a result, monitors and printers have different color 
 gamuts. Although they share many of the same colors, there are some colors 
 a monitor can display that a printer can’t print and some colors a printer 
 can print that a monitor can’t display.</p>

<p>Given all the factors that go into producing colors, how do you go about 
 making colors accurate and consistent? Try these options:</p>

<ul>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CBullet><p class=Bullet>Calibrate your monitor every 
 few months. See <a href="../Customizing%20Paint%20Shop%20Pro/Adjusting_Monitor_Display_Options.htm">Calibrating 
 Your Monitor</a>.</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CBullet><p class=Bullet>Get to know the typical differences 
 between your monitor’s colors and your printer’s colors so that you can 
 adjust your images as needed. Print out several photographs or other images 
 and compare them to the screen. Are there typical results? For example, 
 your printer may always print colors darker than your monitor displays 
 them. Knowing this, you can modify the lightness of your images accordingly.</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CBullet><p class=Bullet>Consider using Windows Color 
 Management, which helps to improve color consistency across devices. See 
 <a href="../Customizing%20Paint%20Shop%20Pro/Adjusting_Monitor_Display_Options.htm">Adjusting 
 Monitor Display Options</a>.</p></li>
</ul>
