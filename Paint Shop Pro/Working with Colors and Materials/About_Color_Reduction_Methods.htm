<h1>About Color Reduction Methods</h1>

<p>When you decrease an image’s color depth, you must select a color reduction 
 method. Depending upon the color depth you select, two or three of these 
 methods are available:</p>

<p><span class=BoldOption>Nearest Color</span> Replaces the original color 
 of a pixel with the color in the newly generated palette that is closest 
 to the original RGB value. This method eliminates dithering and produces 
 a high-contrast image. Simple graphics may look better with this method.</p>

<p><span class=BoldOption>Error Diffusion</span> Replaces the original 
 color of a pixel with the most similar color in the palette, but spreads 
 the discrepancy between the original and new color to the surrounding 
 pixels. As it replaces a color (working from the top left to the bottom 
 right of the image), it adds the “error,” or discrepancy to the next pixel, 
 before selecting the most similar color. This method produces a naturally 
 looking image and often works best for photographs or complex graphics.</p>

<p><span class=BoldOption>Ordered Dither</span> Adjusts adjacent pixels 
 so that two colors give the illusion of a third color and intermingles 
 pixels to produce patterns based on a known palette. Use this method to 
 give the image the appearance of containing more colors than it actually 
 does. Images may appear to be composed of cross-hatches and dots and may 
 have distinct patterns of light and dark areas.</p>

<h2>About Palette Options</h2>

<p>When you decrease an image’s color depth, you must select a palette 
 option. Depending upon the color depth you select, two or three of these 
 methods are available:</p>

<p><span class=BoldOption>Optimized Median Cut</span> Measures and ranks 
 each color by how frequently it occurs in the image, then uses the most 
 frequently occurring colors to determine the new palette. Even if your 
 image contains fewer colors than the palette that is generated, this method 
 may not represent each color exactly. The method, therefore, is not as 
 accurate as the Optimized Octree method, but it is better at weighting 
 color importance.</p>

<p><span class=BoldOption>Optimized Octree</span> Creates an eight-level 
 “tree” with eight branching nodes totaling 256 individual “leaves” or 
 colors to determine the new palette. This method attempts to reproduce 
 each color in the original image, so if your image contains fewer colors 
 than the palette that is generated, every color in the image is represented. 
 This method is faster and more accurate than Optimized Median Cut, but 
 it is not as good at weighting color importance. </p>

<p><span class=BoldOption>Windows</span> Changes each pixel’s color to 
 the nearest color in the Windows palette.</p>

<p><span class=BoldOption>Standard/Web-Safe Palette</span> Changes each 
 pixel’s color to the nearest color in the standard Web-safe palette. Use 
 this method to create images for the Web that can be viewed without color 
 distortion on most monitors.</p>
