<h1>Understanding the Difference Between Patterns and Textures</h1>

<p>On the Materials palette you can select both a pattern and a texture 
 as part of a material. Whats the difference between the two?</p>

<p>A pattern is an opaque, repeated image with specific colors and details. 
 A pattern is a style just like solid color or gradient. Thus, patterns 
 do not use the current foreground or background colors. Lets say you select 
 the pattern called Bricks and then apply brushstrokes with the Paintbrush 
 tool. Each brush stroke paints the brick pattern.</p>

<p>A texture gives the effect of having textured canvas or paper. Textures 
 use the current style (such as a solid color). Lets say the foreground 
 color is yellow and you select the texture called Crumpled Paper. When 
 you apply a brush stroke, each brush stroke paints yellow with the texture 
 of crumpled paper.</p>

<p>Unlike patterns, textures can be applied at the same time as styles 
 solid color, gradient, or pattern. That means you can have both a pattern 
 and a texture selected at the same time. Heres an example of the pattern 
 Bricks and the texture Crumpled Paper both selected.</p>
