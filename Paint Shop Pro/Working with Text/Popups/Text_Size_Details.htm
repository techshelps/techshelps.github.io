<h1>Text Size Details</h1>

<p>The Text tool's Size setting in the Tool Options palette is expressed 
 in points where the calculation is relative to the pixel per inch resolution 
 of your monitor. Most monitors in today are designed to be 96 pixels to 
 the inch. Points are a unit of measurement where 72.27 points are equal 
 to one inch. However, the computer world has changed the measurement to 
 72 points per inch. Thus a 24-point font is roughly equivalent to 1/3 
 of an inch.</p>

<p>Be aware that this is relative to the number of pixels per inch. The 
 calculation to go from size to display fontsize is :</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="hcp1">fontsize 
 = (Size x Monitor-pixels-per-inch) / 72</span></p>

<p>Using the above example of Size set to 24-point:</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="hcp1">fontsize 
 = (24 x 96) / 72 = 2304 / 72 = 32</span></p>

<p>since 32 / 96 = 1/3 then relative to the monitor specifications, the 
 fontsize is 1/3 of an inch.</p>

<p>But since our images also carry a resolution, (for example 200 pixels 
 per inch) and printers may have yet a different (usually higher) resolution, 
 a typical printer resolution is 300 dpi or 600 dpi or greater. </p>

<p>In order for a 1/3 inch size font on a 300 dpi image, then the value 
 should be 100. Which means to correctly calculate the appropriate size 
 for points, the above algorithm should replace monitor pixels per inch 
 with image pixels per inch or image resolution.</p>

<p>For example, if your image dimensions were one inch wide by one inch 
 high, and the image resolution were 100 dpi, printing this image on a 
 300 x 300 dpi printer will produce an image roughly one-third of an inch 
 square.</p>
