<h1>About Layers</h1>

<p>When you create or import an image in Paint Shop Pro, the image has 
 a single layer. Depending on the type of image you created or imported, 
 you'll see in the Layers palette that the single layer may be labeled 
 Background (this is the case when opening images such as photos or screen 
 captures), Raster, Vector, or Art Media.</p>

<p>For most simple image retouches and corrections, you do not have to 
 add any layers. However, it's generally a good habit to simply duplicate 
 the layer (by clicking the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Duplicate 
 Layer</span> button <img src="DuplicateLayer_button.bmp"
							x-maintain-ratio=TRUE
							style="border: none;
									width: 16px;
									height: 16px;
									float: none;
									border-style: none;
									border-style: none;"
							width=16
							height=16
							border=0> in the Layers palette toolbar) before 
 applying actions such as the photo correction commands. By applying any 
 changes to the duplicated layer, you'll always preserve the original image 
 on its own layer. And when you intend to do more complex work such as 
 add elements to the image, create photo compostions, add text and other 
 effects, etc., it's highly encouraged that you utilize layers for these 
 tasks.</p>

<p>Each layer that you add begins as a transparent sheet over the background. 
 As you add brush strokes, vector objects, or text, you cover up parts 
 of the Background layer. Transparent parts allow you to see through to 
 underlying layers. You can stack up multiple layers to create whatever 
 effect you’d like—such as artistic compositions, photo collages, or complex 
 illustrations. For more information about using layers, see: <a href="Types_of_Layers.htm">Types 
 of Layers</a></p>
