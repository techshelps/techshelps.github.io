<h1>Types of Layers</h1>

<p>There are many types of layers: Background, Raster, Vector, Art Media, 
 Mask, Adjustment, Group, Floating Selection, and Edit Selection. The icon 
 before the layer name on the Layers palette shows the type of layer. In 
 addition, you can create layer groups, and promote selections to layers. 
 Paint Shop Pro supports up to 500 layers. The actual number of layers 
 allowed in an image may be limited by the amount of memory in your computer. 
 For more information on raster and vector data, see <a href="../Getting%20Images%20into%20Paint%20Shop%20Pro/About_Raster_and_Vector_Graphics.htm">About 
 Raster and Vector Graphics</a>.</p>

<p><span class="hcp1">Note: </span>Only greyscale and 16 
 million color images can have multiple raster layers. Images of any color 
 depth can include multiple vector layers.</p>

<h2>Background Layer</h2>

<p>The background layer <img id="4" src="layers_Background%20layer.jpg" style="width:15px; height:13px;" width="15" height="13" border="0" class="hcp2"> is the bottom layer of an image. 
 It is named “Background” on the Layers palette and cannot be renamed. 
 When you import file formats such as JPEG, GIF, or PNG into Paint Shop 
 Pro, they are one layer—the background layer.</p>

<p>The background layer contains raster data but cannot display transparency. 
 You cannot change its order in the stack, its blend mode, or its opacity.</p>

<p>To move a background layer higher in the stacking order, promote it 
 to a regular raster layer; see <a href="Promoting_a_Background_Layer_to_a_Regular_Raster_Layer.htm">Promoting 
 a Background Layer to a Regular Raster Layer</a>.</p>

<p>If you create a new image with a transparent background, it does not 
 have a background layer and its bottom layer is a raster layer named “Raster 
 Layer 1”. You may move this layer anywhere within the stacking order, 
 or change its opacity or blend mode.</p>

<h2>Raster Layers</h2>

<p>Raster layers <img id=1
						src="layers_new_raster_layer.jpg"
						style="margin-bottom: -3.607pt;
								width: 14px;
								height: 16px;
								border-style: none;
								border-style: none;"
						width=14
						height=16
						border=0> are layers with raster data only. Raster 
 data is composed of individual elements, called pixels, arranged in a 
 grid. Each pixel has a specific location and color. Photographic images 
 are composed of raster data. If you magnify raster data, you can see the 
 individual pixels as squares of colors.</p>

<p>Use raster layers for displaying subtle changes in tones and colors. 
 Or, use raster layers for objects and raster text on which you want to 
 apply raster-only commands and tools. The effects commands, the painting 
 tools, and many other tools apply only to raster layers.</p>

<p class=Important><span class="hcp1">Saving multi-layered 
 images:</span> When you create multi-layered images, you must save them 
 in .PspImage format (Paint Shop Pro’s native format) to maintain all layer 
 information. When you save to most other formats, all layers are merged 
 into one background layer. When you save to .PSD (PhotoShop) format, the 
 image maintains raster and adjustment layers, but vector layers and art 
 media layers are converted to raster layers. Raster data must be on raster 
 layers (a regular raster layer or the background layer). If you try to 
 use a raster tool while a vector layer is selected, Paint Shop Pro prompts 
 you to convert the vector layer into a raster layer.</p>

<h2>Vector Layers</h2>

<p>Vector layers <img id=3
						src="layers_new-vector-layer.jpg"
						style="margin-bottom: -3.334pt;
								width: 16px;
								height: 15px;
								border-style: none;
								border-style: none;"
						width=16
						height=15
						border=0> are layers with only vector objects (lines 
 and shapes), vector text, or vector groups. Vector objects and text are 
 composed of geometric characteristics—lines, curves, and their locations. 
 When you edit vector objects and text, you edit these lines and curves, 
 rather than editing individual pixels. Vector graphics and vector text 
 maintain their clarity and detail when scaled to any size or printed at 
 any resolution. </p>

<p>Use vector layers to create objects or text that you can easily edit. 
 To display the names of vector objects on a vector layer, click the plus 
 sign in front of the layer name on the Layers palette.</p>

<p>Vector objects must be on vector layers. If you create a vector object 
 while a raster layer is selected, Paint Shop Pro creates a vector layer 
 just above the current layer. In addition, you cannot move a vector object 
 to a non-vector layer.</p>

<h2>Art Media Layers</h2>

<p>Art Media layers <img src="ArtMediaLayer_button.bmp"
						x-maintain-ratio=TRUE
						style="border: none;
								width: 16px;
								height: 16px;
								float: none;
								border-style: none;
								border-style: none;"
						width=16
						height=16
						border=0> are automatically created when you begin 
 using any of the Art Media tools. In this regard, the layer-creation functionality 
 is similar to the vector tools.</p>

<p>You can also create a new Art Media layer by choosing <span class="hcp1">Layers 
 &gt; New Art Media layer</span>.</p>

<p>Art Media layers can be converted to Raster layers, but not Vector layers.</p>

<h3 class=Bullet>Dry and Wet Art Media Layers</h3>

<p>Paint strokes applied by the Oil Brush and Palette Knife are, by default, 
 wet in terms of how strokes interact with other strokes by smearing/mixing 
 together. You can, however, choose to dry the Art Media layer at any time. 
 Conversely, you can choose to make a dry Art Media layer wet again:</p>

<ul>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CBullet><p class=Bullet>Choose <span class="hcp1">Layers 
 &gt; Dry Art Media layer</span> (or right click on the Layers palette 
 and choose <span class="hcp1">Dry Art Media layer</span> 
 from the context menu) to dry the strokes applied by the Oil Brush or 
 Palette Knife.</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CBullet><p class=Bullet>Choose <span class="hcp1">Layers 
 &gt; Wet Art Media layer</span> (or right click on the Layers palette 
 and choose <span class="hcp1">Wet Art Media layer</span> 
 from the context menu) to make dried Oil Brush or Palette Knife strokes 
 wet again.</p></li>
</ul>

<p class=NOTEINBULLETS><span class="hcp1">Note</span>: Both 
 the <span class="hcp1">Dry Art Media layer</span> command 
 and the <span class="hcp1">Wet Art Media layer</span> command 
 can be selectively undone in the History palette.</p>

<h3>New Images with an Art Media Layer</h3>

<p>When creating a new image via the New Image dialog, you can choose to 
 create the image with an Art Media layer. Choose the <span class="hcp1">Art 
 Media Background</span> option in the New Image dialog's Image Characteristics 
 section.</p>

<h2>Mask Layers</h2>

<p>Mask layers <img id="2" src="masks_new_Mask%20Layer.jpg" style="width:15px; height:13px;" width="15" height="13" border="0" class="hcp2"> show or hide portions of underlying layers. 
 A mask is basically an adjustment layer that modifies opacity. Use masks 
 to create sophisticated effects. For example, mask all details around 
 the main subject in a photograph, or use a mask to create a picture frame 
 that fades away at the center to reveal the subject. </p>

<p>Mask layers cannot be the bottom layer. You will not be able to delete 
 other layers if deleting them causes a mask layer to become the bottom 
 layer. For more information, see <a href="../Working%20with%20Masks/Working_with_Masks.htm">Working 
 with Masks</a>. </p>

<h2>Adjustment Layers</h2>

<p>Adjustment layers are correction layers that adjust the color or tone 
 of underlying layers. Each adjustment layer makes the same correction 
 as an equivalent command on the <span class=BoldOption>Adjust</span> menu, 
 but does not change image pixels like the command does.</p>

<p>Adjustment layers cannot be the bottom layer. You will not be able to 
 delete other layers if deleting them causes an adjustment layer to become 
 the bottom layer. For more information, see <a href="Adding_Adjustment_Layers.htm">Using 
 Adjustment Layers</a>.</p>
