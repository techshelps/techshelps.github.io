<h1>Saving Images for the Web &nbsp;</h1>

<p>Because the majority of Web browsers recognize GIF and JPEG images, 
 these two formats are used most often for saving Web images. Newer versions 
 of the Web browsers can also recognize the more recent PNG format, and 
 many Web browsers also support Windows Wireless Bitmap (WBMP) and iMode 
 formats, which are popular to display when using wireless devices. </p>

<p>When you save images for the Web, there are three major issues to consider: 
 layers, color depth, and file size. </p>

<h3>Layers</h3>

<p>Because none of the current Web browsers can display layered images, 
 you need to flatten an image before saving it for the Web. Flatten it 
 by choosing <span class=BoldOption>Layers &gt; Merge &gt; Merge All (Flatten)</span>. 
 </p>

<h3>Color Depth</h3>

<p>Some computers are only capable of displaying up to 256 colors. If an 
 image on a Web page contains more colors, the Web browser uses its own 
 dithering method to display the image. This can produce color distortion. 
 If you reduce the color depth of the image to 8 bits (256 colors) before 
 placing it on your Web page, its appearance will be more consistent. </p>

<h3>File Size</h3>

<p>File size affects the majority of users accessing a Web page. As the 
 size of an image file increases, it takes more time to download, so viewers 
 have a longer wait. Use a file format that reduces the image size most 
 efficiently while keeping the quality as high as possible.</p>

<h3>Web File Formats</h3>

<p>Choose from the following file formats when saving image for use on 
 the Web: </p>

<ul>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CBullet><p class=Bullet><span class=BoldOption>GIF</span> 
 Use this format to compress line art and images with areas of similar 
 colors. It supports 8-bit (256) color. There are two versions of GIF: 
 89a, which can save transparency and animation information, and 87a, which 
 cannot. Both are recognized by most browsers and use lossless compression. 
 </p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CBullet><p class=Bullet><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 7.0pt;">&nbsp;</span><span 
 class=BoldOption>JPEG</span> Use this format to compress photographic 
 images. It supports 24-bit (16.7 million) color, uses lossy compression, 
 and is recognized by most browsers. </p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CBullet><p class=Bullet><span class=BoldOption>PNG</span> 
 This format compresses most images efficiently. It supports up to 24-bit 
 (16.7 million) color and uses lossless compression, but it is recognized 
 by most browsers, however many features of this format are not available. 
 </p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CBullet><p class=Bullet><span class=BoldOption>Wireless 
 Bitmap (WBMP)</span> This format is used with many wireless devices. The 
 images are black and white and have lossless compression.</p></li>
</ul>

<p class=Important><span style="font-weight: bold;">Lossy vs. Lossless 
 compression:</span> <span class=BoldOption>Lossy </span>compression is 
 a compression method that eliminates data to reduce the file size, while<span 
 class=BoldOption> lossless </span>compression retains all of the original 
 image data and reduces the file size by storing patterns of pixels in 
 the image.</p>
