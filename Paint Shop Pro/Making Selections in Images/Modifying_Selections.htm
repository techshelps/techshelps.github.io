<h1>Modifying Selections</h1>

<p>After you make a selection in your image, you may want to modify or 
 edit the selection. You can add to or subtract from a selection, change 
 the feathering, add or remove colors, and clean up the edges of a selection. 
 You can remove specks and holes, smooth the boundary, and recover or apply 
 anti-aliasing. </p>

<p class=TableHeading><span class=StepNumber>Ways to modify selections:</span></p>

<p><span class=BoldOption>Adding to a Selection</span> You can add to the 
 selection area using the selection tools, either the same selection tool 
 you used to make the original selection or a different selection tool.</p>

<p><span class=BoldOption>Subtracting from a Selection</span> You can subtract 
 from the selection area using the selection tools, either the same selection 
 tool you used to make the original selection or a different selection 
 tool. You can also use the Contract command to contract a selection by 
 a specific number of pixels.</p>

<p><span class=BoldOption>Changing the Feathering of a Selection</span> 
 Feathering specifies a width in pixels (0 to 200) that the selection is 
 faded along the edges. When you move or paste the selection, feathering 
 helps blend the selection into the surrounding area and makes it appear 
 more natural. The higher the Feather value, the softer the edges. Set 
 the width to 0 to create a selection with no feathering and distinct edges.</p>

<p><span class=BoldOption>Adding or Removing a Color from a Selection</span> 
 To add or remove a color from a selection, use the Select Color Range 
 command. You can choose to add or remove a color from the selection border. 
 The color that you choose is either added or removed, and the selection 
 border changes.</p>

<p><span class=BoldOption>Cleaning Up the Edges of a Selection</span> When 
 you move or copy a selection, some of the pixels surrounding the border 
 are included, especially when the selection is anti-aliased or feathered. 
 Matting cleans up the border by removing these pixels. There are three 
 Matting commands: Remove Black Matte, Remove White Matte, and Defringe. 
 Use the Remove Black Matte or Remove White Matte command when the selection 
 is from an image with a black or white background. These commands remove 
 the black or white pixels at the selection edges.</p>

<p><span class=BoldOption>Removing Specks and Holes from a Selection</span> 
 To fill the specks and holes that may occur in a selection. The Remove 
 Specks and Holes dialog removes specks and holes from the area that you 
 define in square pixels.</p>

<p><span class="hcp1">Smoothing the Boundary of a Selection</span> 
 Use the Smooth command to smooth the edges of a selection.</p>

<p><span class="hcp1">Recovering the Anti-alias</span> Use 
 the Recover Anti-alias command when you want to restore the original anti-aliasing 
 of an object that was pasted into an image. </p>

<p><span class="hcp1">Shape-Based Anti-aliasing</span> Use 
 the Shape-Based Anti-alias command to anti-alias a selection based on 
 its shape.</p>

<p><span class="hcp1">Modifying the Select Selection Borders</span> 
 Use the Select Selection Borders command to add a border around the selection. 
 This command is useful when you want to add a border around the selection, 
 and then fill that border using the Flood Fill tool.</p>
