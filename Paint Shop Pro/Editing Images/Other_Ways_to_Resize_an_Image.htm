<h1>Other Ways to Resize an Image</h1>

<p class=SidebarHeading>In addition to resizing an image, you can also 
 change the image size by changing the canvas size, cropping the image, 
 or printing at a different size.</p>

<p class=SidebarBullet>Resizing the image removes pixels to make it smaller 
 or adds pixels to make it larger. </p>

<p class=SidebarBullet>Increasing the canvas size adds pixels at the edge 
 of the image. Decreasing the canvas size hides pixels at the edges of 
 the image (full layer information is kept).</p>

<p class=SidebarBullet>Cropping an image deletes the pixels outside the 
 selected crop area.</p>

<p class=SidebarBullet>Printing through Print Layout resizes the image 
 for printing but the image file remains unchanged. This is the best option 
 if you want to print the image at various sizes.</p>
