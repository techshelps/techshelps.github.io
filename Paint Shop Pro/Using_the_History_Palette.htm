<h1>About the History Palette</h1>

<p>The History palette lists each command you apply to the active image. 
 The most recent action appears at the top of the list. The History palette 
 gives you the ability to quickly undo and redo actions applied to the 
 current image. In addition to its basic Undo and Redo To Here functions, 
 the History Palette also offers several additional powerful and time-saving 
 functions:</p>

<ul>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CBullet><p class=Bullet>Selectively Undo any listed 
 action. Depending on which action you undid, actions that were applied 
 after the undone action may or may not remain applied to the image. This 
 is described in more detail in <a HREF="Undoing_and_Redoing_History_Palette_Actions.htm">Undoing 
 and Redoing History Palette Actions</a>.</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CBullet><p class=Bullet>Save a Quickscript based 
 on any number of selected History palette actions, and then run the Quickscript 
 on the current image or another open image. This is described in more 
 detail in <a HREF="Saving_and_Applying_Quickscripts.htm">Saving and Applying 
 Quickscripts</a>.</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CBullet><p class=Bullet>Save History palette actions 
 as a regular PspScript file, or copy them to the clipboard for pasting 
 into another script file.</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CBullet><p class=Bullet>Drag and drop History palette 
 actions onto another image to instantly apply those actions.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Setting the Number of Saved Commands in the History Palette</h2>

<p>By default, the History palette will list the 250 most recently executed 
 commands on the active image. To set this value higher or lower:</p>

<ol>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CStep1><p class=Step1>Choose <span class="hcp1">File 
 &gt; Preferences &gt; General Program Preferences</span>.</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CStep><p class=Step>Click the <span class="hcp1">Undo 
 </span>tab.</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CStep><p class=Step>Make sure the Enable the undo 
 system check box is marked.</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CStep><p class=Step>Set the <span class="hcp1">Limit 
 undo/redo to </span><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">n</span><span class="hcp1"> steps per open image</span> to the desired 
 value. As mentioned above, the default value is 250. Steps older than 
 250 will become undoable steps, only 10 of which will be retained as defined 
 by the next setting.</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CStep><p class=Step>The <span class="hcp1">Non-undoable 
 steps after the last non-undoable step</span> value, as mentioned above, 
 sets the number of non-undoable steps that will be retained after the 
 last non-undoable step limit has been reached. The default value is 10.</p></li>
</ol>

<p class=NOTEINSTEPS><span class="hcp1">Note</span>: Non-undoable 
 steps cannot be undone or redone anymore. They can, however, be reapplied 
 to the current image or other open images, can be saved to the Quickscript, 
 or as a regular PspScript file, or copied to the clipboard.</p>
