<h1>About Restricted Script Mode</h1>

<p>The scripts in Paint Shop Pro are created in the Python program­ming 
 language, which can unfortunately also be used to create and execute malicious 
 scripts. Because of this potential danger, Paint Shop Pro includes two 
 explicit directory sets that reside inside the path \Program Files\Jasc 
 Software Inc\Paint Shop Pro 9. These directories are:</p>

<ul>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CBullet><p class=Bullet><span class=BoldOption>Scripts 
 - Restricted</span>: any script residing here is restricted, as is any 
 script not residing in a trusted folder (see Restriction information below)</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CBullet><p class=Bullet><span class=BoldOption>Scripts 
 - Trusted</span>: any script residing here is trusted.</p></li>
</ul>

<h3>What is Restricted?</h3>

<p>Some general notes about Restricted scripts:</p>

<ul>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CBullet><p class=Bullet>When the application searches 
 for scripts, Restricted scripts are searched before Trusted scripts. In 
 the Script toolbar’s Select Script drop-down list, the two sets of scripts 
 are intermingled and listed alphabetically.</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CBullet><p class=Bullet>When saving a script, the 
 path defaults to the Restricted directory for the first time this is done 
 with the application. After that, it defaults to the most recently used 
 directory.</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CBullet><p class=Bullet>If a script is run from an 
 unconfigured path, it is treated as Restricted.</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CBullet><p class=Bullet>If a path appears in both 
 the Restricted and Trusted lists, it is treated as Restricted.</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CBullet><p class=Bullet>Presets, Material palette 
 Swatches, and Print Layout Templates (which are essentially scripts) are 
 treated as Restricted.</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CBullet><p class=Bullet>Additionally, the following 
 commands are not allowed when run from a Restricted script: FileSave, 
 FileSaveAs, FileSaveCopyAs, GIFExport, PNGExport, JPEGExport, FileLocations, 
 FileClose, FileCloseAll, FileSend, BatchConvert, BatchRename, Mapper, 
 Slicer, FileExit.</p></li>
</ul>
