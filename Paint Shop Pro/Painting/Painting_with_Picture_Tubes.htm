<h1>Painting with Picture Tubes &nbsp;</h1>

<p>Use the Picture Tube tool to paint with a collection of objects with­out 
 having to draw them. You can add butterflies and beetles to a picnic setting, 
 fill an aquarium with fish, or frame a picture with holly. Use one of 
 the picture tubes included with Paint Shop Pro or create your own.</p>

<p>Picture tubes are .PspTube files. Each picture tube file is made up 
 of a series of images arranged in rows and columns that are called cells. 
 Picture tubes may have any number of cells. As you paint with the Picture 
 Tube tool, Paint Shop Pro paints one image of a picture tube after another. 
 Many picture tubes create discrete images (such as traffic signs), while 
 some create the effect of a continuous image (such as crepe paper).</p>

<p class=SidebarText
	style="font-weight: bold;">Note: </p>

<ul>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CBulletFirst><p class=BulletFirst>The Picture Tube 
 tool paints raster objects on raster layers. You cannot use the tool on 
 vector layers. To make picture tube elements easier to edit, it is helpful 
 to paint them on a separate layer.</p></li>
</ul>

<ul>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CBullet><p class=Bullet>To use a previous Paint Shop 
 Pro version's picture tubes, use the File Locations dialog to add that 
 version's Picture Tubes folder (or, in the case of Paint Shop Pro version 
 7, the Tubes folder) to the list of Preset file folders. See <a HREF="Using_Picture_Tubes_from_a_Previous_PSP_Version.htm">Using 
 Picture Tubes from a Previous PSP Version</a>.</p></li>
</ul>

<p class=StepHeading>To paint with a picture tube:</p>

<ol>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CStep1><p class=Step1>On the Tool Palette, choose 
 the <span class=BoldOption>Picture Tube </span>tool <img src="Picture%20Tube%20button.bmp"
															x-maintain-ratio=TRUE
															style="border: none;
	width: 18px;
	height: 18px;
	float: none;
	border-style: none;
	border-style: none;"

	<li class=kadov-p-CStep><p class=Step>On the Tool Options palette, 
 click the Picture Tube drop-list and select a picture tube.</p></li>
</ol>

<p class=NoteInSteps><span class=BoldOption>Note: </span>Most picture tube 
 previews show one image rather than all images in the picture tube. To 
 view all images, select the desired picture tube and then paint with it, 
 or open the .PspTube file with the Browser.</p>

<ol start="3" type="1" class="hcp1">
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CStep><p class=Step>If necessary, adjust the following 
 options:</p></li>
</ol>

<p class=BodyIndent><span class=BoldOption>Scale</span> The percentage 
 (10 to 250%) to reduce or enlarge each image in the picture tube and scale 
 the step.</p>

<p class=BodyIndent><span class=BoldOption>Step</span> The distance in 
 pixels (1 to 500) between the centers of each picture tube image that 
 you paint.</p>

<p class=BodyIndent><span class=BoldOption>Placement mode</span> The way 
 images are placed: <span class=BoldOption>Continuous </span>evenly spaced 
 by step size or <span class=BoldOption>Random</span> spacing between 1 
 pixel and the step size.</p>

<p class=BodyIndent><span class=BoldOption>Selection mode</span> How Paint 
 Shop Pro selects images to paint from the cells within the picture tube: 
 <span class=BoldOption>Random</span> selects images ran­domly; <span class=BoldOption>Incremental 
 </span>selects images one by one from top left to the bottom right; <span 
 class=BoldOption>Angular</span> selects images based on the direction 
 you drag the cursor as you paint;<span class=BoldOption> Pressure </span>selects 
 images based on the pressure you apply on a pressure-sensitive tablet; 
 <span class=BoldOption>Velocity</span> selects images based on the speed 
 you drag the cursor as you paint.</p>

<ol start="4" type="1" class="hcp1">
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CStep><p class=Step>Optionally, you can click the 
 <span class="hcp2">Settings</span> button <img src="Picture%20Tube%20Settings%20button.bmp" x-maintain-ratio="TRUE" style="width:19px; height:18px;" width="19" height="18" border="0" class="hcp3"> in the Tool Options palette and make further changes to the 
 behavior of the current Picture Tube. Refer to the Picture Tube Settings 
 Dialog section below for more information.</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CStep><p class=Step>To paint one image of the picture 
 tube, click once in the image. To paint multiple images, drag in the image.</p></li>

<h3>Picture Tube Settings Dialog</h3>

<p>When you click the <span class="hcp2">Settings</span> 
 button <img src="Picture%20Tube%20Settings%20button.bmp" x-maintain-ratio="TRUE" style="width:19px; height:18px;" width="19" height="18" border="0" class="hcp3"> in the Tool Options palette, the Picture Tube Settings 
 dialog appears. You can use this dialog to update the current Tool Option 
 palette settings and modify the look of the current Picture Tube. But 
 you can also make the settings permanent by marking the Save as default 
 for this picture tube option.</p>

<p class=BodyIndent><span class="hcp2">Current Picture Tube 
 name and path</span> &nbsp;The 
 name and directory path appear across the top of this dialog.</p>

<p class=BodyIndent><span class="hcp2">Cell arrangement</span> 
 &nbsp;The <span class="hcp2">Cells across</span> and <span class="hcp2">Cells 
 down</span> fields display the current cell layout of the tube. The range 
 for these values depend upon how the tube was created. The <span class="hcp2">Total 
 cells</span> field shows the product of multiplying the Cells across by 
 the Cells down.</p>

<p class=BodyIndent><span class="hcp2">Placement options</span> 
 &nbsp;Modifying 
 any of these settings will update the corresponding setting in the Tool 
 Options palette. Note that the <span class="hcp2">Scale</span> 
 setting can only be modified if the current Picture Tube was created in 
 Paint Shop Pro 9.</p>

<p class=BodyIndent><span class="hcp2">Save as default for 
 this Picture Tube</span> &nbsp;Mark 
 this checkbox if you want to save any modifications made in the Picture 
 Tube Settings dialog. If you do not mark this checkbox, changes made here 
 will only affect the current use of the tube.</p>
