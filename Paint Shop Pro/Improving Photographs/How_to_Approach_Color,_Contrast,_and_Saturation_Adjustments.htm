<h1>How to Approach Color, Contrast, and Saturation Adjustments</h1>

<p>The color, contrast, and saturation have the most influence on our perception 
 of a photograph’s quality. If the colors are washed out or the contrast 
 is low, the photo doesn’t look right.</p>

<p>Paint Shop Pro’s adjustments modify the basic components of color: hue, 
 saturation, and lightness. Hue is the color (such as red or yellow). Saturation 
 is the vividness of the color. Lightness is the intensity of light in 
 the color. </p>

<p><span class="hcp1">Note: </span>Because greyscale and 
 black-and-white photos have no color, you can adjust only the contrast. 
 See <a href="Improving_Contrast.htm">Improving Contrast</a>.</p>

<p>Make adjustments in this order:</p>

<ul>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CBullet><p class=Bullet>For most photos, first adjust 
 the color and then adjust the contrast. (Contrast adjustment can result 
 in a loss of image information that is needed for color adjustments.)</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CBullet><p class=Bullet>For images that are extremely 
 dark or light, first adjust the contrast to make the colors more visible, 
 then adjust the color. If necessary, adjust the contrast again.</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CBullet><p class=Bullet>Always adjust the saturation 
 last.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Each color, contrast, and saturation adjustment can be made automatically 
 or manually. For automatic adjustments, you choose a few settings and 
 Paint Shop Pro does the rest. For manual adjustments, you analyze the 
 photo and decide what adjustments it needs.</p>

<p class=Important><span class="hcp1">Important:</span> When 
 correcting color photographs, start with the automatic adjust­ments, and 
 see if you like the result. If the photo still isn’t right, use the manual 
 adjustments. For more information about the qualities of color, see <a 
 href="../Working%20with%20Colors%20and%20Materials/Understanding_Color_and_Color_Models.htm">Understanding 
 Color and Color Models</a>.</p>
