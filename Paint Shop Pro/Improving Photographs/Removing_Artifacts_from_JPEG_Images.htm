<h1>Removing Artifacts from JPEG Images</h1>

<p>When you save a file to the JPEG format from any software package (such 
 as scanning software), the file information is compressed to create a 
 smaller file. The compression produces artifacts—unwanted image problems—that 
 can appear as halos or color leakage beyond the edges of objects, checkerboard 
 problems on smooth backgrounds, or blocky-looking areas in an image. Use 
 Paint Shop Pro’s JPEG Artifact Removal command to restore a JPEG image 
 to its original appearance. </p>

<p>You can apply the JPEG Artifact Removal command to a file in any format. 
 For example, if you have saved a JPEG file as a Paint Shop Pro (.PspImage), 
 you can still apply the command.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Note: </span>Because JPEG compression 
 discards image information, there are limits to how well the image can 
 be restored.</p>

<p class=StepHeading>To remove<span class=StepNumber> JPEG artifacts:</span></p>

<ol>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CStep1><p class=Step1>Make sure the image has no 
 selections. If necessary, choose <span class=BoldOption>Selections &gt; 
 Select None</span>. The JPEG Artifact Removal command is not available 
 if the image contains a selection.</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CStep><p class=Step>Choose <span class=BoldOption>Adjust 
 &gt; Add/Remove Noise &gt; JPEG Artifact Removal</span>.</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CStep><p class=Step>In the preview window, center 
 the area of the image where the artifacts are most apparent.</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CStep><p class=Step>In the <span class=BoldOption>Strength</span> 
 group box, set the strength of correction to <span class=BoldOption>Low</span>, 
 <span class=BoldOption>Normal</span>, <span class=BoldOption>High</span>, 
 or <span class=BoldOption>Maximum</span>. For best results, try each option 
 and examine all areas of the image to see which strength setting works 
 best.</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CStep><p class=Step>Set the <span class=BoldOption>Crispness</span> 
 to determine the amount of detail that is restored, from 0 (the least) 
 to 100 (the most). Start with 50 and adjust the value until the image 
 looks the most natural. This option determines how much fine-detail information 
 the artifact removal attempts to create. The recreated information can 
 only be a guess since the original information is lost. Excessive crispness 
 may produce fine dots in the image.</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CStep><p class=Step>Click <span class=BoldOption>OK</span>.</p></li>
</ol>
