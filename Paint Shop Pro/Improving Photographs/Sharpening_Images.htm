<h1>Sharpening Images</h1>

<p>Paint Shop Pro contains several commands that sharpen your image by 
 increasing the contrast of adjacent pixels:</p>

<p><span class=BoldOption>Sharpen and Sharpen More</span> Focus the image 
 and improve its clarity by increasing the contrast between adjacent pixels 
 where there are significant color contrasts, usually at the edges of objects. 
 The Sharpen More command sharpens with a stronger effect than the Sharpen 
 command. Both commands are automatically applied to the image.</p>

<p><span class=BoldOption>Unsharp Mask</span> Sharpens the mid- to high-contrast 
 edges in the image without enhancing noise. This command locates adjacent 
 pixels that have a difference in lightness values that you specify and 
 increases their contrast by an amount you specify. This command is typically 
 used in professional color corrections.</p>

<p class=StepHeading>To use the Sharpen or Sharpen More command:</p>

<p>Choose <span class=BoldOption>Adjust &gt; Sharpness &gt; Sharpen</span> 
 or <span class=BoldOption>Adjust &gt; Sharpness &gt; Sharpen&nbsp;More</span>.</p>

<p class=StepHeading>To 
 use the Unsharp Mask dialog:</p>

<ol>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CStep1><p class=Step1>Choose <span class=BoldOption>Adjust 
 &gt; Sharpness &gt; Unsharp Mask</span>. </p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CStep><p class=Step>In the preview window, center 
 an important part of the image (such as a face). Pan the image by clicking 
 and dragging in the preview window; zoom in or out as necessary.</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CStep><p class=Step>Sharpen the image with the following 
 options:</p></li>
</ol>

<p class=BodyIndent><span class=BoldOption>Radius</span> The number of 
 pixels to adjust around each edge. A value between 0.5 and 2 works best, 
 depending on the image. A lower value sharpens only the edge pixels, while 
 a higher value sharpens a wider band of pixels. The effect is much less 
 noticeable in print than on-screen because a small radius (for example, 
 1 pixel) represents a smaller area in a high-resolution printed image. 
 Therefore, use lower values for on-screen images and higher values for 
 high resolution printed images. </p>

<p class=BodyIndent><span class=BoldOption>Strength</span> The amount of 
 contrast to increase in the image’s pixels. Start with a low value and 
 increase it gradually.</p>

<p class=BodyIndent><span class=BoldOption>Clipping</span> The difference 
 in lightness values that adjacent pixels must have before they are sharpened.</p>

<ol start=4
	style="list-style: decimal;"
	type=1>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CStep><p class=Step>Click <span class=BoldOption>OK</span>.</p></li>
</ol>
