<h1>Fixing Line Problems in Video Images</h1>

<p>Some video capture devices actually take two sequential images, or fields, 
 and combine them to form the final image. The first field captures the 
 even rows of the image. A very short time later, the process repeats, 
 but this time the odd lines are captured. These two fields are combined 
 by interleaving the lines of the two fields, producing the final frame. 
 But since the two fields are captured at slightly different times, it's 
 possible that the subject may have moved during the interval. This produces 
 images with undesirable striping. This type of defect is more likely to 
 happen when motion is involved, either by objects that are moving in the 
 scene, or by moving (or panning) the camera.</p>

<p>The Deinterlace command remedies this problem by discarding either the 
 even or the odd lines of the image, and then making replacements by interpolating 
 the retained lines.</p>

<p class=NoteText><span style="font-weight: bold;">Note: </span>Apply the 
 Deinterlace command before you resize the image. Resizing adds or removes 
 pixels from the image, which makes it more difficult to determine scan 
 lines.</p>

<p>If your image has already been resized, you must return it to as close 
 to the original size as possible so that each scan line is one pixel high. 
 Zoom in until you can see individual pixels to determine how many pixels 
 make up one scan line, and then resize the image so that each scan line 
 is one pixel. For example, if the enlarged image has scan lines that are 
 two pixels high, you would resize it by 50 percent. Keep in mind that 
 the image loses clarity when you resize it.</p>

<p class=StepHeading>To deinterlace an image:</p>

<ol>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CStep1><p class=Step1>Make sure the image has no 
 selections. If necessary, choose <span class=BoldOption>Selections &gt; 
 Select None</span>. The Deinterlace command is not available if the image 
 contains a selection.</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CStep><p class=Step>Choose <span class=BoldOption>Adjust 
 &gt; Add/Remove Noise &gt; Deinterlace</span>.</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CStep><p class=Step>In the preview window, center 
 the area of the image where the scan lines are most apparent.</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CStep><p class=Step>For <span class=BoldOption>Scanlines 
 to retain</span>, select either <span class=BoldOption>Odd</span> or <span 
 class=BoldOption>Even</span> to determine whether the odd-numbered or 
 even-numbered scan lines are kept.</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CStep><p class=Step>Click <span class=BoldOption>OK</span>.</p></li>
</ol>
