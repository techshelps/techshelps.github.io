<h1>Improving Saturation</h1>

<p>After you have adjusted the tones of your image (by using the Automatic 
 Contrast Enhancement command), adjust the saturation. Saturation is an 
 indicator of the relative amount of color vividness. Imagine a highly 
 saturated color like bright orange. As the saturation is reduced (keeping 
 the hue and lightness unchanged), the orange color becomes brownish, then 
 taupe and finally a middle neutral grey (after the saturation has been 
 set all the way down to zero). Reducing the saturation &quot;drains&quot; 
 the color away, leaving just the greyscale component. Taupe and mauve 
 are familiar, fairly low saturation colors because they are quite neutral, 
 with just a touch of color. Apple red and banana yellow are high saturation 
 colors. Generally speaking, saturation is a measure of how different a 
 color is from a neutral grey of the same brightness.</p>

<p>For digital images, increasing the saturation can give the image brilliant 
 color and &quot;punch.&quot; But too much saturation will distort colors 
 such as skin tones.</p>

<p>Paint Shop Pro has several commands that are useful for adjusting the 
 saturation of an image. Go to the <span class="hcp1">Adjust 
 &gt; Hue and Saturation</span> submenu for a list of available commands.</p>

<h2>Using the Automatically Saturation Enhancement Filter</h2>

<p>The Automatic Saturation Enhancement command is useful for improving 
 the saturation of your image. It automatically adapts its behavior to 
 the color content of each image. Therefore, it will be most effective 
 when used without any selections, because then the entire range of colors 
 will be available for analysis.</p>

<p class=Important><span class="hcp1">Important: </span>This 
 command works on 16 million color and greyscale images only. To increase 
 the color depth of an image, see <a href="../Working%20with%20Colors%20and%20Materials/Increasing_the_Color_Depth_of_an_Image.htm">Increasing 
 the Color Depth of an Image</a>.</p>

<p>To automatically enhance saturation:</p>

<ol>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CStep1><p class=Step1>Choose <span class="hcp1">Adjust 
 &gt; Automatic Saturation Enhancement</span>.</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CStep><p class=Step>In the preview window in the 
 upper left portion of the dialog, center an important part of the image. 
 Pan the image by dragging the cursor in the preview window. Zoom in or 
 out as necessary.</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CStep><p class=Step>Set the <span class="hcp1">Bias</span> 
 (which is the overall saturation) to your preferred target saturation. 
 The command will automatically adjust the saturation to match this target.</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CStep><p class=Step>Set the <span class="hcp1">Strength</span> 
 of the correction to <span class="hcp1">Weak</span>, <span class="hcp1">Normal</span> or <span class="hcp1">Strong</span>.</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CStep><p class=Step>Mark the <span class="hcp1">Skintones 
 present</span> check box if appropriate. With this enabled, the saturation 
 adjustment algorithm is modified in a way that produces more natural looking 
 skin tones.</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CStep><p class=Step>Click <span class="hcp1">OK</span> 
 to apply the correction.</p></li>
</ol>
