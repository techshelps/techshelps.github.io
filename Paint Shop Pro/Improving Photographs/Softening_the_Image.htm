<h1>Softening the Image</h1>

<p>The three Softness commands are Soft Focus, Soften, Soften More. Soften 
 applies a uniform blur to your image. Soften More applies the Soften command 
 with more intensity. The Soft Focus command makes the image look as though 
 it was taken with a camera using a soft focus filter.</p>

<p>To use the Soften and Soften More commands, choose <span class=BoldOption>Adjust 
 &gt; Softness &gt;</span> and either the <span class=BoldOption>Soften 
 </span>or <span class=BoldOption>Soften More </span>command.</p>

<p class=StepHeading>To use the Soft Focus command:</p>

<ol>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CStep1><p class=Step1>Choose <span class=BoldOption>Adjust 
 &gt; Softness &gt; Soft Focus</span> to open the dialog. </p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CStep><p class=Step>In the preview window, center 
 the important part of the image. Pan the image by clicking and dragging 
 in the preview window; zoom in or out as necessary.</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CStep><p class=Step>For <span class=BoldOption>Softness</span>, 
 set a percentage value or choose the strength of the correction. At lower 
 values, the image is softened only a small amount. At higher values, the 
 image appears to have a blurred effect.</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CStep><p class=Step>For <span class=BoldOption>Edge 
 importance</span>, set a percentage value or choose the strength of the 
 correction. At lower values, the edges of the image is softened. At higher 
 values, the detail of the edges are retained.</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CStep><p class=Step>Mark the <span class=BoldOption>Include 
 scattered light </span>check box if you want bright areas in the background 
 of the image to be softened.</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CStep><p class=Step>For <span class=BoldOption>Amount</span>, 
 set a percentage value or choose the strength of the halo effect. At lower 
 values, the halo is added to only very bright areas in the image. At higher 
 values, a halo effect is created around bright areas.</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CStep><p class=Step>For <span class=BoldOption>Halo 
 size</span>, set a percentage value or choose the size of the halo. At 
 lower values, the halo is small. At higher values, the halo effect is 
 large.</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CStep><p class=Step>For <span class=BoldOption>Halo 
 visibility</span>, set a percentage value or choose the strength of the 
 halo visibility. At lower values, the halo effect is subtle. At higher 
 values, the halo effect is more obvious.</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CStep><p class=Step>Click<span class=BoldOption> 
 OK</span>.</p></li>
