<h1>Removing Image Defects and Noise</h1>

<p>Sometimes images have defects that are called noise— black, white, or 
 colored specks ranging in size from very tiny to relatively large or all-over 
 noise that gives surfaces a grainy look. Often you'll notice them in skin 
 tones or in parts of a photo such as a clear blue sky. You know these 
 artifacts are not present in the person's skin nor would they be present 
 in the sky. You can use Paint Shop Pro’s Noise commands to remove noise 
 from images. Before you decide which command to use, determine the type 
 of noise that your image contains.</p>

<p class=Important><span style="font-weight: bold;">Important: </span>These 
 commands work on 16 million color and greyscale images only. To increase 
 the color depth of an image, see <a href="../Working%20with%20Colors%20and%20Materials/Increasing_the_Color_Depth_of_an_Image.htm">Increasing 
 the Color Depth of an Image</a>.</p>

<p class=TableCellLeft><span class=StepNumber>Ways to remove image defects 
 and noise:</span></p>

<p><span class=BoldOption>An Advanced Noise Removal Filter </span><span 
 class=BoldOption
	style="font-weight: normal;">Use the Digital Camera Noise Removal Filter 
 to find and remove the noise artifacts that you know should not be in 
 the photo. See <a HREF="../Using_the_Digital_Camera_Noise_Removal_Filter.htm">Using 
 the Digital Camera Noise Removal Filter</a>.</span></p>

<p><span class=BoldOption>Removing Single-Pixel Specks</span> This command 
 analyzes the brightness of each pixel and compares it to the surrounding 
 pixels to determine if it should be removed. See <a href="Removing_Single-Pixel_Specks.htm">Removing 
 Single-Pixel Specks</a>.</p>

<p><span class=BoldOption>Removing Multiple-Pixel Black or White Specks</span> 
 Use the Salt and Pepper Filter command to remove multiple-pixel black 
 or white specks, such as those caused by dust on film or video. See <a 
 href="Removing_Multiple-Pixel_Black_or_White_Specks.htm">Removing Multiple-Pixel 
 Black or White Specks</a>.</p>

<p><span class=BoldOption>Removing Noise While Preserving Edge Details</span> 
 Use the Edge Preserving Smooth command to remove noise in an image without 
 losing edge details. See <a href="Removing_Noise_While_Preserving_Edge_Details.htm">Removing 
 Noise While Preserving Edge Details</a>.</p>

<p><span class=BoldOption>Removing Small Areas of Noise</span> Use the 
 Median Filter command to remove small random specks or areas of noise 
 that are distinctly different from the surrounding area. See <a href="Removing_Small_Areas_of_Noise.htm">Removing 
 Small Areas of Noise</a></p>

<p><span class=BoldOption>Removing Noise While Keeping Texture Details</span> 
 Use the Texture Preserving Smooth command to remove noise or specks in 
 an image while preserving texture details. See <a href="Removing_Noise_While_Keeping_Texture_Details.htm">Removing 
 Noise While Keeping Texture Details</a>.</p>

<p><span class=BoldOption>Softening the Image</span> The three Softness 
 commands are Soft Focus, Soften, Soften More. Soften applies a uniform 
 blur to your image. Soften More applies the Soften command with more intensity. 
 The Soft Focus command makes the image look as though it was taken with 
 a camera using a soft focus filter. See <a href="Softening_the_Image.htm">Softening 
 the Image</a>.</p>
