<h1>Removing Small Areas of Noise</h1>

<p>Use the Median Filter command to remove small random specks or areas 
 of noise that are distinctly different from the surrounding area. You 
 can also use the command to remove single-pixel colored specks.</p>

<p>The Median Filter command adjusts the intensity of each pixel in the 
 image to the median intensity of surrounding pixels. The median intensity 
 is the middle value (not the average) in the range of values.</p>

<p>To preserve object edges, the Median Filter command adjusts a pixel 
 that is very different from surrounding pixels more than a pixel that 
 is similar to surrounding pixels. You can choose the number of surrounding 
 pixels to use in the calculation. If you choose a large number, more noise 
 is removed and so more detail is lost.</p>

<p class=StepHeading>To remove small areas of noise:</p>

<ol>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CStep1><p class=Step1>Select the area that contains 
 the specks. See <a href="../Making%20Selections%20in%20Images/Using_the_Selection_Tools.htm">Using 
 the Selection Tools</a>.</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CStep><p class=Step>Choose <span class=BoldOption>Adjust 
 &gt; Add/Remove Noise &gt; Median Filter</span>.</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CStep><p class=Step>For <span class=BoldOption>Filter 
 Aperture</span>, choose the number of surrounding pixels to include in 
 determining the median intensity of each pixel. The filter is always an 
 odd number of pixels. To preserve image details, choose the smallest filter 
 that removes the noise. For single-pixel colored specks, set the filter 
 to 3.</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CStep><p class=Step>Click <span class=BoldOption>OK</span>.</p></li>
