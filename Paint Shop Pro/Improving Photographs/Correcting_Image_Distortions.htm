<h1>Correcting Image Distortions</h1>

<p>Camera lenses can create distortions in photographs. You see these distortions 
 most often in wide-angle photographs, in close-up photographs taken with 
 cameras with fixed focal ranges, and in cameras with inexpensive lenses 
 (such as disposable cameras).</p>

<p class=Important><span style="font-weight: bold;">Important: </span>These 
 effects work on greyscale and 16 million color (24-bit) images only. To 
 increase the color depth of an image, see <a href="../Working%20with%20Colors%20and%20Materials/Increasing_the_Color_Depth_of_an_Image.htm">Increasing 
 the Color Depth of an Image</a>.</p>

<p class=StepHeading>Types of Lens Distortions:</p>

<p><span class=BoldOption>Barrel distortion</span> If your image has a 
 barrel distortion, it looks pushed out at the center. Lines that should 
 be straight are curved. You must correct lens distortions before cropping 
 the image. For distortion corrections to work properly, the axis of the 
 camera lens must coincide with the center of the image. See <a href="Correcting_Barrel_Distortions.htm">Correcting 
 Barrel Distortions</a>.</p>

<p><span class=BoldOption>Fisheye distortion</span> If your image has a 
 fisheye distortion, it looks as though it has been pasted onto a sphere 
 or blown up like a balloon. Lines that should be straight are curved and 
 the edges of the image look compressed. See <a href="Correcting_Fisheye_Distortions.htm">Correcting 
 Fisheye Distortions</a></p>

<p><span class=BoldOption>Pincushion distortion</span> If your image has 
 a pincushion distortion, it looks pushed in at the center. Lines that 
 should be straight are curved. See <a href="Correcting_Pincushion_Distortions.htm">Correcting 
 Pincushion Distortions</a>.</p>
