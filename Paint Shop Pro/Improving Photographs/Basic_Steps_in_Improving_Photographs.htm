<h1>Basic Steps in Improving Photographs &nbsp;</h1>

<p>Paint Shop Pro contains many features you can use to enhance your photos. 
 Whenever you work on photos, you should follow the same basic steps in 
 a specific order to get the best results. This is necessary because some 
 later actions remove image data that is needed to successfully complete 
 earlier steps.</p>

<p class=StepHeading>To improve photographs:</p>

<ol>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CStep1><p class=Step1>Calibrate your monitor to ensure 
 that screen and print images match as closely as possible and that colors 
 are consistent from image to image. For more information, see <a HREF="../Customizing%20Paint%20Shop%20Pro/Calibrating_Your_Monitor.htm">Calibrating 
 Your Monitor</a>.</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CStep><p class=Step>Improve colors, contrast, and 
 saturation. Use Paint Shop Pro’s automatic adjustment commands or use 
 the manual adjustments to make initial corrections to your images. See 
 <a href="How_to_Approach_Color,_Contrast,_and_Saturation_Adjustments.htm">How 
 to Approach Color, Contrast, and Saturation Adjustments</a>.</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CStep><p class=Step>Remove &quot;noise&quot; image 
 artifacts often present in digital photos. See <a HREF="../Using_the_Digital_Camera_Noise_Removal_Filter.htm">Using 
 the Digital Camera Noise Removal Filter</a>.</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CStep><p class=Step>Remove color aberrations often 
 present in digital photos. See <a HREF="../Using_the_Chromatic_Aberration_Removal_Filter.htm">Using 
 the Chromatic Aberration Removal Filter</a>.</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CStep><p class=Step>Quickly correct problems caused 
 by too much flash or not enough flash. See <a HREF="../Using_the_Fill_Flash_Filter.htm">Using 
 the Fill Flash Filter</a> and <a HREF="../Using_the_Backlighting_Filter.htm">Using 
 the Backlighting Filter</a>.</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CStep><p class=Step>Correct defects caused by the 
 image source, including unwanted patterns on scanned images and undesirable 
 lines on video frames. See <a href="Removing_Source_Defects.htm">Removing 
 Source Defects</a>.</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CStep><p class=Step>Correct image defects such as 
 black or white specks, and image distortions caused by camera lenses. 
 See <a href="Removing_Image_Defects_and_Noise.htm">Removing Image Defects 
 and Noise</a> and <a href="Correcting_Image_Distortions.htm">Correcting 
 Image Distortions</a>.</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CStep><p class=Step>Retouch photos, including removing 
 scratches and red-eye effects on people and animals. During this step 
 you can also remove unwanted highlights and objects from your photos. 
 See <a href="Retouching_Photographs.htm">Retouching Photographs</a>.</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CStep><p class=Step>Clarify and sharpen images. See 
 <a href="Improving_Image_Clarity.htm">Improving Image Clarity</a>.</p></li>
</ol>

<p class=Important><span style="font-weight: bold;">Analyzing images using 
 the histogram:</span> For image editing professionals, the histogram and 
 its accompanying adjustment features are powerful tools for understanding 
 and correcting images—especially those with contrast or brightness problems. 
 For casual users, getting familiar with the histogram may not be necessary 
 because Paint Shop Pro offers many simpler ways to adjust images. For 
 information about using the histogram to analyze your photos, see <a href="../Making%20Color%20and%20Tonal%20Corrections/Using_the_Histogram_to_Analyze_Images.htm">Using 
 the Histogram to Analyze Images</a>.</p>
