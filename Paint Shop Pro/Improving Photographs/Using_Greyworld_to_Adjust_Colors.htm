<h1>Using Grey World to Adjust Colors</h1>

<p>Like the Automatic Color Balance command, the Grey World Color Balance 
 command corrects image colors, but it uses a different mathematical algorithm.</p>

<p>The premise behind this command is that the average of all colors in 
 the image should be neutral. Although this may be a reasonable approximation 
 for some complex images, it isn't true for all images. (For example, an 
 image dominated by a blue sky.) You should therefore use your own judgement 
 to determine if this command is appropriate for your image.</p>

<p>By default the Grey World Color Balance command balances in way that 
 causes neutral objects to have approximately equal red, green, and blue 
 components. When viewed on a typical computer monitor, this corresponds 
 to a color temperature of about 6500k. The Grey World command allows you 
 to simulate other color temperatures relative to 6500k by adjusting the 
 Illuminant Temperature control to higher values (to produce cooler neutrals 
 with larger blue components and reduced red and green components) or lower 
 values (to produce warmer neutrals with smaller blue components and increased 
 red and green components).</p>

<p class=Important><span class="hcp1">When </span><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">not</span><span class="hcp1"> to use Grey World color correction:</span> 
 This color correction may not work well for very simple scenes with few 
 colors, images with a limited range of hues (such as mostly blues), or 
 simple computer-generated graphics.</p>

<p class=StepHeading>To correct colors using the Grey World dialog:</p>

<ol>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CStep1><p class=Step1>Choose <span class=BoldOption>Adjust 
 &gt; Color Balance &gt; Grey World Color Balance</span>.<br>
	The right preview window shows the image colors automatically corrected 
 with the Grey World algorithm.</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CStep><p class=Step>In the preview window, center 
 an important part of the image (such as a face). Pan the image by clicking 
 and dragging in the preview window; zoom in or out as necessary.</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CStep><p class=Step>In the <span class=BoldOption>Illuminant 
 Temperature</span> group box, type a value or drag the slider to change 
 the image’s illuminant temperature from warmer tones (oranges) to cooler 
 tones (blues). The default setting is 6500K, which gives the effect of 
 a photo taken in typical daylight. Photos taken indoors tend to look more 
 orange, while photos taken in bright sunlight tend to look more blue. 
 Adjust the value to achieve the desired effect or until the colors look 
 the most natural.</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CStep><p class=Step>Click <span class=BoldOption>OK</span>.</p></li>
</ol>
