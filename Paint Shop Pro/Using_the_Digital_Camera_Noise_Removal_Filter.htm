<h1>Using the Digital Camera Noise Removal Filter</h1>

<p>The tiny, non-uniform speckles that can sometimes appear in digital 
 photos are referred to as &quot;noise.&quot; These unwanted image artifacts 
 usually derive from inevitable sources such as JPEG file compression, 
 or even as a result of electronic fluctuations inside a digital camera. 
 A good example would be a photo of a clear blue sky. Zooming in may reveal 
 tiny specks of color that you know are not present in the sky. You can 
 use this filter to identify and remove noise while preserving detail smaller 
 than the noise itself.</p>

<p>In addition to scanning and identifying three potential noise regions 
 (in the highlight, midtone, and shadow regions of the image), the Digital 
 Camera Noise Removal filter lets you target additional image areas for 
 noise removal. This filter works on the entire image, or on a selection.</p>

<h2>Camera Presets and Standard Presets</h2>

<p>This filter gives you the option of creating a <span class="hcp1">Camera 
 preset</span><span>. When a Camera preset option is checked, the Presets 
 drop-list will only display these special types of presets. When you load 
 a camera preset, the image is not sampled at all, but instead the camera 
 preset settings are applied. You can still create additional sampling 
 regions, however. </span>Using a camera preset is recommended when your 
 camera produces consistent noise patterns across each image. Camera presets 
 tend to work well on similar photos, such as photos of people. </p>

<p>When you do not use a camera preset, the filter will scan your image 
 (or selection) and determine potential areas needing correction by placing 
 sampling regions in the highlight, midtone, and shadow regions.</p>

<p>Like other dialogs and tools, you can also save and load <span class="hcp1">standard 
 presets</span> for this filter. When you load a standard preset, the filter 
 will use the preset's dialog settings, but will still scan the image and 
 place the three sampling regions. </p>

<h2>Typical Uses for this Filter</h2>

<p>Here are some scenarios in which this filter could be an ideal solution:</p>

<ul>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CBullet><p class=Bullet>For photos you know are going 
 to contain excessive noise (such as a video whiteboard capture), use the 
 filter with low settings to help make the overall image clearer without 
 excessive blurring.</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CBullet><p class=Bullet>For photos taken with normal 
 settings yet still having image artifacts surrounding the subject area, 
 use this filter to target just these key areas needing correction.</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CBullet><p class=Bullet>For photos taken with the 
 same camera that tend to have noise in the same area, use this filter 
 to create a <span class="hcp1">camera preset</span> that 
 can be applied to all images from the camera.</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CBullet><p class=Bullet>For higher-end photography, 
 use the options in the filter's Protect Image tab to specify the color 
 ranges to preserve or discard.</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CBullet><p class=Bullet>Lower-end cameras tend to 
 produce more noise than higher-end cameras.</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CBullet><p class=Bullet>Note that in some cases, 
 using the JPEG Artifact Removal filter before using this filter (or instead 
 of using this filter) can yield good results. Be aware also that the Digital 
 Camera Noise Removal filter is not designed to remove moire patterns.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Accessing and Using the Filter</h2>

<ol>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CStep1><p class=Step1>Choose <span class="hcp1">Adjust 
 &gt; Photo Fix &gt; Digital Camera Noise Removal</span>.</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-P-CStep><p class=Step>Note the <a href="javascript:BSSCPopup('Improving Photographs/Popups/DCNR_Sampling_Regions.htm');"
														id=a1>three crosshairs 
 placed on the image preview in the Remove Noise tab</a><script 
 type="text/javascript"
	language=JavaScript1.2><!--
kadovFilePopupInit('a1');
//--></script> 
 (not in the normal preview area in the top half of the dialog). These 
 represent noise samples (as determined by the filter) located in the image's 
 light, midtone, and dark areas.</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CBulletIndent><p class=BulletIndent>Click a crosshair 
 to view its sampling region in the upper left preview window.</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CBulletIndent><p class=BulletIndent>To move a crosshair, 
 hold down the right mouse button and drag the crosshair to a new position. 
 The sampling region will move accordingly. </p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CBulletIndent><p class=BulletIndent>To <a href="javascript:BSSCPopup('Improving Photographs/Popups/DCNR_Create_Sampling_Regions.htm');"
	id=a2>create more crosshairs</a><script type="text/javascript"
	language=JavaScript1.2><!--
kadovFilePopupInit('a2');
//--></script>, 
 go to the left preview pane in the upper half of the dialog, and then 
 drag the cursor over the areas you want to apply correction. A correction 
 box will encompass the area you dragged, and in the Remove Noise section's 
 preview box, a crosshair will appear over the area. (Note that you may 
 want to maximize the size of the dialog and zoom in appropriately (in 
 the upper left preview window) to help identify image areas with noise 
 artifacts.) You can have a maximum of 10 sampling regions.</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CBulletIndent><p class=BulletIndent>Avoid sampling 
 an image edge (this will result in excessive smoothing), and avoid sampling 
 pure black and pure white regions of the image.</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CBulletIndent><p class=BulletIndent>To make a sampling 
 region's box active in the upper left preview window, click its associated 
 crosshairs in the Remove Noise section's preview box.</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CBulletIndent><p class=BulletIndent>To remove a crosshair, 
 go into the upper left preview pane and drag a corner of the correction 
 box onto its diagonally opposite corner.</p></li>
</ol>

<ol start=3>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CStep><p class=Step>In the <span class="hcp1">Remove 
 Noise </span>tab, set a level for the <span class="hcp1">Small</span>, 
 <span class="hcp1">Medium</span> and <span class="hcp1">Large 
 details</span> correction settings. These settings denote the amount of 
 correction in its respective spatial noise band. Mark the <span class="hcp1">Lock</span> 
 check box to adjust these settings in proportion to each other.</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CStep><p class=Step>Use the <span class="hcp1">Correction/Blend</span> 
 setting to determine the percentage of the corrected image to blend in 
 with the original. Values range from 0 percent (no noise reduction) to 
 100 percent (full processing of the entire image), and the default is 
 70 percent.</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CStep><p class=Step>Use the <span class="hcp1">Sharpening</span> 
 setting to define the percentage (if any) of sharpening to apply to the 
 image after the noise reduction is applied. The default value is 0 percent.</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CStep><p class=Step>To save the current settings 
 as a preset specific to this image and camera, mark the <span class="hcp1">Camera 
 preset</span> check box, and then save the preset by clicking the <span class="hcp1">Save</span> button <img src="PSP_9_interim_help/Preset_Save.bmp" x-maintain-ratio="TRUE" style="width:14px; height:14px;" width="14" height="14" border="0" class="hcp2"> found in 
 the Presets drop list at the top of the dialog. Note that when the Camera 
 preset option is checked, the Presets drop list will only display previously 
 saved Camera presets, not the standard presets.</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CStep><p class=Step>To save the current settings 
 as a standard Preset, uncheck the Camera preset option, and then click 
 the <span class="hcp1">Save</span> button <img src="PSP_9_interim_help/Preset_Save.bmp" x-maintain-ratio="TRUE" style="width:14px; height:14px;" width="14" height="14" border="0" class="hcp2"> found in the Presets drop list at the top of the dialog.</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CStep><p class=Step>Click <span class="hcp1">OK</span> 
 to apply the correction.</p></li>
</ol>

<h2>Using the Protect Image Tab</h2>

<p>For more advanced correction, click the <span class="hcp1">Protect 
 Image </span>tab. The options in this tab allow you to define regions 
 of color and texture that can be protected from noise correction. For 
 example, you may want to protect skin tones in a photo from having any 
 correction applied to them. You can define as many regions to protect 
 as you like. To define a protected region:</p>

<ol>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CStep1><p class=Step1>Select the <span class="hcp1">Protect 
 Image</span> tab.</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CStep><p class=Step>In the dialog's upper left preview 
 window, pan and zoom as necessary so you can view the region you wish 
 to protect.</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CStep><p class=Step>Hold down the <span class="hcp1">Ctrl</span> 
 key and drag the cursor to over the region you wish to protect. Note that 
 by holding down <span class="hcp1">Ctrl</span> you will 
 not create a corresponding crosshair in the Remove Noise tab's Sampling 
 Regions preview area.</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CStep><p class=Step>In the Protect Image tab, the 
 Hue and Range settings will reflect the area you sampled. <a href="javascript:BSSCPopup('Improving Photographs/Popups/DCNR_Protect_Region_Example.htm');"
	id=a3>Click here to see an example</a><script type="text/javascript"
	language=JavaScript1.2><!--
kadovFilePopupInit('a3');
//--></script>. 
 You can manually adjust the Hue knob by dragging it inside the ring, or 
 by adjusting the Hue and/or Range settings.</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CStep><p class=Step>Optionally, you can drag any 
 of the seven graph handles downward to progressively diminish the noise 
 reduction (apply less correction/smoothing to that segment of the hue 
 range). For example, dragging just the middle graph handle all the way 
 to the bottom of the graph will completely suppress the midtone of the 
 current hue range. Note that you cannot drag the graph handles laterally.</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CStep><p class=Step>To completely remove all color 
 adjustments (essentially starting over in this tab), click the <span class="hcp1">Reset 
 All</span> button. To remove color adjustments for the current color range, 
 click the <span class="hcp1">Reset Current</span> button.</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CStep><p class=Step>Click <span class="hcp1">OK</span> 
 to apply the correction.</p></li>
</ol>
