<h1>Using the Fill Flash Filter</h1>

<p>One of the more common problems in photography involves lighting. Photos 
 taken in bright light often have little detail in the shadow areas since 
 the camera is attempting to not overexpose the brighter areas. The Fill 
 Flash filter allows you to lighten the darker, underexposed areas of a 
 photo. If your photo's background is too dark, or you feel there's too 
 much difference between the photo's light and dark areas, this filter 
 is a good choice to help correct that problem.</p>

<h2>Accessing and Using the Filter</h2>

<ol>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CStep1><p class=Step1>Choose <span class="hcp1">Adjust 
 &gt; Photo Fix &gt; Fill Flash</span>.</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CStep><p class=Step>Use the <span class="hcp1">Strength</span> 
 value to determine how much the darker areas will be lightened.</p></li>
</ol>

<h2>Using Fill Flash in Combination with Backlighting</h2>

<p>You may run into a situation where a photo has just enough of a problem 
 with too-dark areas as well as too-light areas. In that case, try running 
 the Fill Flash &nbsp;filter 
 on the photo, and then the Backlighting filter.</p>
