<h1>Opening Frames from Animation Shop</h1>

<p>Paint Shop Pro allows you to bring in selected frames from Jasc Animation 
 Shop. After exporting the frames, you can use Paint Shop Pro's image editing 
 arsenal to modify the frames before sending them back to Animation Shop.</p>

<p>Before opening Animation Shop frames in Paint Shop Pro, be aware of 
 the Export option in the Animation Shop Preferences (this option affects 
 how selected animation frames open in Paint Shop Pro).</p>

<p class=StepHeading>To set the export options in Animation Shop:</p>

<ol>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CStep1><p class=Step1>In Animation Shop, choose<span class="hcp1"> File &gt; Preferences &gt; General Program 
 Preferences</span>, and choose the <span class="hcp1">Layered 
 Files</span> tab. The first option is a check box labeled &quot;Export 
 frames to Paint Shop Pro as layered images&quot;</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CStep><p class=Step>Your choices are:</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CBulletIndent><p class=BulletIndent>If you mark this 
 check box, when you subsequently select multiple animation frames for 
 export to Paint Shop Pro, the frames will be contained as individual layers 
 within one Paint Shop Pro image.</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CBulletIndent><p class=BulletIndent>If you do NOT 
 mark this check box, when you subsequently select multiple animation frames 
 for export to Paint Shop Pro, each frame will open as its own Paint Shop 
 Pro image file.</p></li>
</ol>

<p class=StepHeading>To open frames from Animation Shop:</p>

<ol>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CStep1><p class=Step1>In Animation Shop, select the 
 frames you want to export to Paint Shop Pro. Only selected frames will 
 be exported.</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CStep><p class=Step>Choose <span class="hcp1">File 
 &gt; Export Frames &gt; To Paint Shop Pro</span>.</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CStep><p class=Step>If Paint Shop Pro is already 
 open, it will become the active application, and the selected frame(s) 
 will appear. If Paint Shop Pro was not open, it will start up, and the 
 selected frame(s) will appear.</p></li>
</ol>

<h2>Important Notes about Interactivity</h2>

<ul>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CBullet><p class=Bullet>While animation frames are 
 open in Paint Shop Pro, the two programs are “linked,” meaning that modifications 
 made on the frames in Paint Shop Pro can be automatically updated to the 
 associated animation in Animation Shop. (To do so, in Paint Shop Pro, 
 choose <span class="hcp1">Edit &gt; Update Back to Animation 
 Shop</span>). You can, however, break this link. To do so, in Animation 
 Shop, choose<span class="hcp1"> File &gt; Export Frames 
 &gt; Break Link with Exported Frames</span>. You can also break the link 
 by closing the images in Paint Shop Pro without saving changes. </p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CBullet><p class=Bullet>If you also have an older 
 version of Paint Shop Pro, be aware that Animation Shop will export selected 
 frames to the most recently used version of Paint Shop Pro.</p></li>
</ul>
