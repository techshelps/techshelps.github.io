<h1>About Raster and Vector Graphics</h1>

<p>Computer graphics are of two types: raster (also called bitmap) or vector. 
 With Paint Shop Pro, you create both raster and vector images. You can 
 also create an image with both raster and vector layers. It’s important 
 to understand the differences between the two data types.</p>

<h3>Raster Images</h3>

<p>Raster images are composed of individual elements, called pixels, arranged 
 in a grid. Each pixel has a specific location and color. If you magnify 
 raster data, you can see the individual pixels as squares of colors.</p>

<p>An object in a raster image is defined by its pixels. For example, the 
 front door in an image of a house is made up of a mosaic of pixels at 
 certain locations in the image. In bitmap images you edit pixels rather 
 than objects or shapes.</p>

<p>Raster images can display subtle changes in tones and colors, so they 
 are most often used for images like photographs and digital artwork. Raster 
 images contain a fixed number of pixels, so when you magnify the image 
 you are magnifying the display size of the pixels. As a result, raster 
 images can display jagged rather than smooth edges if magnified on screen 
 or printed at a large magnification.</p>

<h3>Vector Graphics</h3>

<p>Vector graphics or images use geometric characteristics—lines, curves, 
 and their locations—to define objects. For example, a door in a graphic 
 of a house is made up of a rectangle with a certain width and height at 
 a specific location and filled with a certain color. In vector images 
 you edit objects or shapes rather than pixels.</p>

<p>Vector graphics do not lose clarity or detail when scaled to any size 
 or printed at any resolution. They work well for technical illustrations 
 or corporate logos.</p>

<h3>Choosing Raster or Vector</h3>

<p>In Paint Shop Pro, you create and edit raster and vector data on separate 
 layers. With some tools you create raster data (like brush strokes with 
 the Paint tool) and with other tools (like the Text and Preset Shapes 
 tools) you can choose whether you want to create raster or vector data.</p>

<p>In general, use vector objects when you’ll need to edit the object as 
 an element separate from other parts of the image. For example, if you 
 add a star to an image, you may want to change its size, color or location. 
 This is easier if the star is a vector object. You can create raster data 
 on separate layers so you can easily edit or move them.</p>

<p>To apply tools or commands to vector objects that work only on raster 
 data (such as the painting tools or the effects commands), you can create 
 a raster selection of a vector object. Then, paste the selection to a 
 new raster layer. </p>
