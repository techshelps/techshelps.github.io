<h1>Updating Thumbnails</h1>

<p>When you open a folder in the Browser, Paint Shop Pro creates thumbnails 
 for all supported graphic images and stores them in a file called PspBrwse.jbf. 
 Every folder you have opened in the Browser has a copy of this thumbnail 
 file. Paint Shop Pro uses this file to dis­play thumbnails more quickly 
 each time you open a folder.</p>

<p>The default preference setting is to have the thumbnails file update 
 automatically every time you open the folder. To change this prefer­ence, 
 see <a href="../Customizing%20Paint%20Shop%20Pro/Browser_Preferences.htm">Browser 
 Preferences</a>.</p>

<p>Occasionally you may want to update the thumbnails with the Update Thumbnails 
 command. For example, if you have used Win­dows Explorer to delete or 
 add a file in a folder, you can choose <span class=BoldOption>File &gt; 
 Update Thumbnails</span>, or press<span class=BoldOption> F5 </span>to 
 update the thumbnails file. (You can also open the folder again in the 
 Browser for Paint Shop Pro to update it automatically.)</p>

<p>After a thumbnail file is created, new files are appended to the end 
 of the thumbnails list. To sort the list alphabetically or by other charac­teristics, 
 choose <span class=BoldOption>File &gt; Sort.</span></p>
