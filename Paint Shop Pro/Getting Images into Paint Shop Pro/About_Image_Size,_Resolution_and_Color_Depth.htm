<h1>About Image Size, Resolution, and Color Depth</h1>

<p>Before you create a new image, think about how you will use it. For 
 example, will you display the image on a Web site, send it as an e-mail 
 attachment, or print it? How you use the image helps you determine the 
 image’s size, resolution, and color depth.</p>

<p><span class=BoldOption>Image Size</span> The physical dimensions of 
 the image. In Paint Shop Pro you define image height and width in pixels, 
 inches, millimeters, or centimeters. This is done when you create a new 
 image (by choosing File &gt; New), or when resizing the current image 
 (using Image &gt; Resize).</p>

<ul>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CBullet><p class=Bullet>For printed images for which 
 you know the size you need, use inches or centimeters. By starting with 
 the final image dimensions, you can produce an image that will fit the 
 page.</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CBullet><p class=Bullet>For printed images that you 
 will import into another software package (such as a word processor) and 
 resize as needed, use whichever unit is easiest for you.</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CBullet><p class=Bullet>For images to be displayed 
 on screen, use pixels.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>You can resize an image after you have created it, but doing so may 
 result in loss of image data. For more information, see <a href="../Editing%20Images/Resizing_Images.htm">Resizing 
 Images</a>.</p>

<p><span class=BoldOption>Image Resolution</span> The number of pixels 
 per inch (ppi) or pixels per centimeter in images. It is important to 
 select an appropriate resolution. Too low a resolution causes pixelation, 
 or large pixels that produce coarse output. Too high a resolution adds 
 to an image’s memory requirements without producing a proportional increase 
 in its quality.</p>

<p>For example, when scanning a photo or other image for subsequent use 
 in Paint Shop Pro, be aware that the higher you set the scanning resolution, 
 the larger the resulting image will be.</p>

<p><span class=BoldOption>Color Depth</span> The number of colors that 
 a pixel can display. Each pixel’s color information is stored in a certain 
 number of computer bits—from 1 bit to 24 bits. In a 1-bit image, each 
 pixel can display only one of two colors (black or white). In a 24-bit 
 image, each pixel can display one of 16 million colors. Images with a 
 color depth of 16 million colors look best because they contain the most 
 colors, but they also require the most memory to store and edit. Not all 
 computer monitors can display 16 million colors, so some file formats 
 limit the number of supported colors. For example, GIF images, a popular 
 format for the Web, contain up to 256 colors (8-bit depth).</p>

<p>Many of Paint Shop Pro’s effect and correction commands work on 16 million 
 color images only. Therefore, its best to create most images using 16 
 million colors. When you have finished working on the image, you can decrease 
 its color depth and save it in another format.</p>

 Color Depth</a>.</p>
