<p>This section explains all the terms used in the OmniFlow processing. 
 The user can have an overview about the components for which the API calls 
 are used and can be integrated with external applications.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Process</h2>

<p>The entire business logic is termed as Process. It can be better defined 
 as a definition of what flows to whom and in what sequence. It is a flow 
 chart representation of the sequences in which tasks must be performed 
 from initiation to completion. It is a chain of worksteps linked together, 
 through which the workflow moves until it reaches a logical conclusion. 
 Processes can be serial, parallel, or conditional.</p>

<p>The concept of a Process can be better understood with an example. A 
 company is divided into various departments, for instance the Reception, 
 the HR department, the Technical department and so on. At the time of 
 recruiting, various applications fly in the respective company. But the 
 selection of the right candidate has to go through various processes. 
 The applications / resumes first come in the reception, and from there 
 they are forwarded to the HR. Then it is the work of the HR people to 
 further distribute the wanted resumes to the required departments. The 
 technical resumes are forwarded to the technical department, and so on. 
 This whole workstep comprises of process, that is from the reception to 
 the HR and from there to the respective departments.</p>

<p>Process is designed in an easy to use graphical interface provided by 
 the OmniFlow Process Modeler Application.</p>

<h2>Workstep<a name=Workstep></a></h2>

<p>Workstep is a logical unit, in a process, where specified set of actions 
 / processing has to be performed either by a fully automated program or 
 by an interactive program where people act, enter / change data, set decision 
 variables and so on. Relating to the above example, each of the departments 
 such as the HR department and the technical department can be co-related 
 to form a workstep. </p>

<p>There are two types of worksteps:</p>

<ul style="list-style: disc;"
	type=disc>
	
	<li class=kadov-p><p>Custom workstep</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p><p>System workstep</p></li>
</ul>

<h3>Custom workstep</h3>

<p>Custom workstep implies that the user has to explicitly login to the 
 desktop to perform the intended operation. Custom worksteps can also be 
 termed as Manual Worksteps.</p>

<h3>System workstep</h3>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0;">System workstep implies that the processing 
 is done by the system or an external application. The user does not have 
 to explicitly login to perform the intended operations at these worksteps. 
 They can also be termed as Automated Worksteps. There are a total of seven 
 such worksteps, namely, <span style="font-weight: bold;">Introduction, 
 Distribute, Decision, Hold, Collect, Discard </span>and<span style="font-weight: bold;"> 
 Exit</span>. <!--kadov_tag{{<spaces>}}-->&nbsp;<!--kadov_tag{{</spaces>}}-->From 
 the above the Distribute, Decision, Hold and Collect can also be termed 
 as the Flow control worksteps, which perform operations like routing workitems 
 to alternate worksteps, splitting workitems for parallel processing, collecting 
 the split workitems and so on.</p>

<p style="text-align: right;"
	align=right><span style="text-align: right;"><a href="#Terminology">Back</a></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Workitems</h2>

<p>Workitems is a unit of task that has to be processed in the workflow.</p>

<h2>WorkSpace</h2>

<p>Workspace implies the entire screen in which you can design the graphical 
 representation of the process.</p>

<h2>Streams</h2>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0;">Streams can be defined as predefined filters 
 on a workstep, which decides who is the next person to view the workitem.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0;">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0; font-weight: bold;">Example</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0;">This can be understood with the help of the 
 following example; resumes come in an organization for the various posts 
 opened. The resumes are first handed over to the HR people who further 
 distribute the resumes to the required departments.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0;">The resumes of VB are handled by ‘A ‘and resumes 
 of VC are handled by ‘B’. ‘A’ and ‘B’ further distribute (stream) the 
 resumes to their respective departments.</p>

<p style="text-align: right;"
	align=right><a href="#Workstep">Back</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Rules</h2>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0;">A rule is a list of one or more actions that 
 are to be executed when the associated list of conditions, if any, are 
 satisfied. <span style="margin-bottom: 0;">Rules are used for defining 
 all the processing that has to be performed on any particular Workstage. 
 Rules are always executed sequentially, one after another, in the sequence 
 in which they are defined.</span></p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0;">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0;">For Example:</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0;">&gt; <!--kadov_tag{{<spaces>}}-->&nbsp;<!--kadov_tag{{</spaces>}}-->IF 
 Technical Area =’VB’ </p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0;"><!--kadov_tag{{<spaces>}}-->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<!--kadov_tag{{</spaces>}}-->Then 
 </p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0;"><!--kadov_tag{{<spaces>}}-->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<!--kadov_tag{{</spaces>}}-->ROUTE 
 TO <!--kadov_tag{{<spaces>}}-->&nbsp;<!--kadov_tag{{</spaces>}}-->AppDepartment</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0;">&gt; <!--kadov_tag{{<spaces>}}-->&nbsp;<!--kadov_tag{{</spaces>}}-->ROUTE 
 TO <!--kadov_tag{{<spaces>}}-->&nbsp;<!--kadov_tag{{</spaces>}}-->SystemDepartment.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0;">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0;">In the above example, the first rule is defined 
 with condition, while the second rule is defined without condition. This 
 means the second rule will be executed always, whenever the condition 
 for the first rule is not met.</p>

<p style="text-align: right;"
	align=right><span style="text-align: right;"><a href="#Terminology">Top</a></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>ToDoList</h3>

<p>ToDoList is a reminder list, which contains a set of tasks called ‘ToDoItems’ 
 that are to be performed by the user on the Workitem at the particular 
 Workstep at which the ToDoItem is associated.</p>

<h3>Actions</h3>

<p>Actions are the explicit rules that are defined for users on the Desktop. 
 It is on the user’s discretion whether to perform these Actions on the 
 worksteps or skip them.</p>

<h3>Exception</h3>

<p>Exception signifies an objection during process flow. Example, for a 
 ‘Recruitment’ type of process, if the applicant has not attached his age 
 proof certificate or experience certificate or he / she has suffered from 
 any serious disease and so on, the user can raise objections at any stage 
 during the processing and can clear it at a later stage if the need is 
 satisfied.</p>

<p style="text-align: right;"
	align=right><span style="text-align: right;"><a href="#Terminology">Top</a></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Variable</h2>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0;">Variables are used for processing rules and 
 in monitoring workitems. There can be three types of variables- System 
 Defined, User Defined (Queue variables) and External Database variables.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0;">System variables are those variables whose 
 value is maintained / set implicitly by the system. For example, CreationDateTime, 
 ExpiryDateTime, WorkItemState and so on.</p>

<h3>User Defined (Queue) variables</h3>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0;">User Defined (Queue) variables are the temporary 
 variables used mainly for processing rules at different Worksteps. Both 
 the variables can be defined and modified. User can define a maximum number 
 of 26 variables.</p>

<h3>External Database variables</h3>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0;">To keep the Workflow system efficient and 
 capable of processing millions of transactions, only 26 queue variables 
 can be defined. However you can also import external application data 
 variables in the form of a database table (where each column corresponds 
 to an external database variable). <!--kadov_tag{{<spaces>}}-->&nbsp;<!--kadov_tag{{</spaces>}}-->Once 
 imported into the Workflow system they act like normal process variables. 
 </p>

<p style="text-align: right;"
	align=right><span style="text-align: right;"><a href="#Terminology">Top</a></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Triggers</h2>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0;">At each worksteps or flow control steps, events 
 can be defined. These events can invoke trigger that can send messages 
 or invoke exception-processing programs. Triggers can be used by the system 
 for sending mails / fax, generating responses, invoking data form for 
 data entry, communicating from external systems for data updating and 
 retrieval, informing supervisors of exceptional conditions and so on.</p>

<h2>Interface</h2>

<p>Interfaces are the customized programs for defining properties. These 
 settings are reflected on the Omniflow Desktop.</p>

<p>System Defined workstep processing is performed by the system, or an 
 external application. A user does not have to perform the related operations 
 explicitly. For example, Print, Fax, Mail, Workflow Entry, Workflow-Exit, 
 and so on. There are seven such worksteps: Introduction, Distribute, Decision, 
 Hold, Collect, Discard and Exit.</p>
