<P>Crystal Reports is the report writer that has been included in Visual Basic since 1993. It uses a banded approach, as do many other report designers, such as Access's report writer and dBASE.</P>
<P>Crystal Reports is included in Visual Studio .NET for use with both Windows Forms and Web Forms. You can deploy your reports and have them store locally or even using a Report Web Service. This chapter uses Windows Forms to show how to create and run Crystal Reports.</P>
