<P>Windows 2000 recognizes individual users as well as functional groups. You can, for instance, set up a group called Marketing or Sales, and then add new users to the computer. In addition, each user can be added to any of the groups that you've created. Therefore, you might have a marketing manager who belongs to both the Marketing and Management groups.</P>
<P>One advantage of using groups is that SQL Server automatically recognizes the registered Windows users. SQL Server is tightly integrated with Windows security, and you are able to use this integration as you set up SQL Server security. This means, for instance, that you can provide the marketing group with access to tables and stored procedures that are related to marketing data, yet deny the salespeople access to those same tables and procedures. The marketing manager mentioned earlier in this chapter is able to work with marketing and management data (such as employee human resources data).</P>
<P>Because you are treating multiple users as a single group, the administrative effort is considerably less than if you had gone to the trouble of providing access to each individual user. As you'll soon see, treating users as members of groups greatly simplifies the security administration task.</P>
<P>Handling individual users is a real hassle. In large installations with hundreds of users, you spend inordinate amounts of time managing SQL Server security on a user-by-user basis. Instead, you'd like to use Windows groups to add groups of users to the database.</P>
<H4 class="docSection2Title"> Technique</H4>
<P>Use the Administrative Tools in the Control Panel to create groups and add the users you've created to those groups.</P>
<H4 class="docSection2Title"> Steps</H4>
<P>Most often, users are arranged into logical groupings. For instance, all the people in the marketing department are likely to belong to a group named Marketing. Similarly, managers probably belong to a Management group. In this section, you'll learn how to specify the groups on your computer and add the user accounts you've created to those groups.</P>
<P>Later, as users log in to SQL Server, they'll be able to log in as themselves or as a group. Although this might sound a bit strange, to SQL Server, an individual user is the same as a group of users. All that SQL Server sees is an identifier ("TonyS" or "Marketing"), and it matches that identity with a Windows network login.</P>

<H4 class="docSection2Title"> Comments</H4>
<P>Normally, as a database developer, you won't be creating Windows 2000 groups. However, in many small environments, developers are required to take on more than a single role. Also, you might find it useful to create a group login just for the applications you write.</P>
