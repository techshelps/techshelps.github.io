<P>The basic entity that holds data in your database is a table, which is analogous to the manila folder of customers. A table is made up of columns (also referred to as <span class="docEmphasis">fields</span>.) Picture a page of information that you keep on a customer. The information would have Last Name, First Name, Address, and so on. These would be columns in a table. The filled out page of information would be a row (or record) in your table, and it would be made up of columns.</P>
<P>The database would be the filing cabinet, which would be made up of multiple tables (manila folders) with different subjects besides customers, such as invoices, parts information, and so on. Double-click on the Northwind node in the server explorer, you will then see a list of tables that are part of the database. If you open the Customers table in Design mode, you will see the various columns in the table.</P>
<P>Then when you open your table to see the data, you will see the columns for each row or record in your table.</P>
