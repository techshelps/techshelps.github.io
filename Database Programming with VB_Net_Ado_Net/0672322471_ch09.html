<P>Writing database-access code is never a simple task, whether you use ADO.NET, DAO, RDO, db-lib, ct-lib, or OCI. Although ADO.NET makes life much easier, data still needs to be validated for size, type, or range; referential integrity must be maintained; business rules must be obeyed; exceptions must be handled; and so on. Moreover, writing the code can be tedious. Think of how many lines of code are needed to set up a <TT>DbCommand</TT> object with ten parameters-and maintaining different code bases that access the same database objects can turn into weeks of busywork.</P>
<P>The solution for any complex programming problem is to place all the related code into a flexible, reusable code component, or class. This chapter shows you how easy it is to create a class that handles all the common tasks you need to access data in the table, and more important, how this will simplify writing code for the rest of your application.</P>
<P>This chapter also touches on several of Visual Basic .NET's objects-oriented features. Because Microsoft has made every .NET language-including Visual Basic-a fully object-oriented language, no book on .NET programming is complete without some discussion of object-oriented programming. This book, however, is all about database access using .NET technologies, so we shouldn't get bogged down with discussions filled with words like polymorphism, encapsulation, and inheritance. In fact, this chapter will do its best to avoid using these terms (at least until the concept is already explained) because, frankly, if you're new to object-oriented programming (OO), these terms can be confusing and intimidating.</P>
<P>This chapter uses three terms frequently that need definition. A <span class="docEmphasis">class</span> is a software component that combines related data, function, and type definitions into a new type. In other words, it is a description of some properties and methods, but nothing more. The properties, methods, types, data, and so on of a class are referred to jointly as <span class="docEmphasis">members</span>. To use a class, you need to instantiate it with a specific set of data. An instance of a class is called an <span class="docEmphasis">object</span>.</P>
<P>This chapter takes for granted that you understand how <TT>DataAdapter</TT>, <TT>DataSet</TT>, and <TT>Command</TT> objects interact to assist client applications and databases communicate. Instead, it focuses on the tools that Microsoft has provided for you to automatically generate code that creates these objects for use with specific database tables, as well as the basic principles for creating data access classes.</P>
