<body><H3 class="docSection1Title">10.7 Create an Onscreen Report That Contains Hyperlinks</H3>
<P>My user has a text field in his Customers table that is actually customers' Web sites. Users want to be able to access the site as a hyperlink on an onscreen report. How can I use Crystal Report to create a report that uses hyperlinks?</P>
<H4 class="docSection2Title"> Technique</H4>
<P>For this How-To, you won't be doing coding. You'll just adjust the formatting of a report field to tell it that it needs to treat the field like a hyperlink. Before doing this, you need to modify Northwind.</P>
<H5 class="docSection3Title"> Adding a Web Site Field to Northwind</H5>
<P>To accomplish this, you open the Northwind database in the Server Explorer. You then add a field called Website to the Customers table, with the Data Type of nchar and a size of 50.</P>
<P>You then modify the first two records in the Customers table so that the Website field contains <TT class="docEmphHyperlink">www.appsplus.com</TT> and <TT class="docEmphHyperlink">www.microsoft.com</TT> respectively, as shown in Figure 10.26.</P>
<CENTER><H5 class="docFigureTitle">Figure 10.26. These will be displayed as hyperlinks on the new report you will create.</H5><p><IMG BORDER="0" WIDTH="500" HEIGHT="375" src="FILES/10fig26.jpg" ALT="graphics/10fig26.jpg"></p>
</CENTER>
<P>Now you are ready to create the report.</P>
<H5 class="docSection3Title"> Telling the Report That a Field Is a Hyperlink</H5>
<P>You create a simple report that is based off the Customers table and contains the fields CompanyName, ContactName, and Website. Then you right-click on the Website field in the report and choose Format. The Format dialog box opens, where you can click on the Hyperlink tab. For the hyperlink type, you should choose Current field value (see Figure 10.27).</P>
<CENTER><H5 class="docFigureTitle">Figure 10.27. These are the options that you can have for hyperlink actions.</H5><p><IMG BORDER="0" WIDTH="437" HEIGHT="465" src="FILES/10fig27.jpg" ALT="graphics/10fig27.jpg"></p>
</CENTER>
<P>Now that you have told the field to act like a hyperlink, you need to have it look like one. To perform this task, you set the following properties:</P>
<UL>
<LI><p>
<TT>BorderColor</TT>. 
This is set to <TT>RoyalBlue</TT> to give it the color of a hyperlink.</p>
</LI>
<LI><p>
<TT>BottomLineStyle</TT>. 
This is set to <TT>crLSSingleLine</TT>.</p>
</LI>
<LI><p>
<TT>EnableTightHorizontal</TT>. 
This is set to <TT>True</TT> so that it doesn't highlight the full length of the field-just to the text.</p>
</LI>
</UL>
<P>That's it! When you display this in a Viewer, as shown in Figure 10.28, you can click on the Website field, and the Viewer will bring you to the Web site you chose.</P>
<CENTER><H5 class="docFigureTitle">Figure 10.28. This is a real-time hyperlink.</H5><p><IMG BORDER="0" WIDTH="500" HEIGHT="315" src="FILES/10fig28.jpg" ALT="graphics/10fig28.jpg"></p>
</CENTER>
<H4 class="docSection2Title"> Steps</H4>
<P>Open and run the Visual Basic .NET-Chapter 10 solution. Click on the button labeled How-To 10.7. You can click on the hyperlinks, displayed for the Web site, to go to the Web site.</P>

<H4 class="docSection2Title"> Comments</H4>
<P>Now when you run the report, you get your hyperlinks. You could have performed additional tasks with hyperlinks, such as using the report for reviewing those you want to email, and having the field be clickable that way.</P>
