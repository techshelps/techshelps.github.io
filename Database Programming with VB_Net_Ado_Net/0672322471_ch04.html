<P>In Chapter 3, "Viewing Data with ADO.NET," you saw how to use ADO.NET to display data in various forms. However, there is so much more to ADO.NET, such as manipulating your data by modifying current data, as well as inserting and deleting data. ADO.NET gives you the tools you need to accomplish these tasks with some of the objects you were introduced to in Chapter 3.</P>
<P>A few more steps are required to manipulate data using ADO.NET then there were in ADO. The main reason for this is that ADO.NET is disconnected; therefore, after you have saved your changes to the ADO.NET objects, such as a dataset, you need to commit those changes back to the server. You will see how to do this in this chapter. The good news is that after you learn how to have the objects update and commit the data back to the server for one task, such as editing of data, you will use the same basic commands for the other tasks as well. Let's get started.</P>
