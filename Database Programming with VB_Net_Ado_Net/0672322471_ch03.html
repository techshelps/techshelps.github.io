<P>ActiveX Data Objects (ADO) was introduced a few years ago as a solution to accessing data that can be found in various forms, not only over a local area network (LAN), but over the Internet as well. ADO was the new generation of data access that replaced Remote Data Objects (RDO) and Data Access Objects (DAO), originally created for the JET database engine. JET was originally created for Microsoft Access, and was later used as a choice of databases for small- and medium-sized single- and two-tier database solutions. Then along came ADO.NET.</P>
