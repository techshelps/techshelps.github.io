<P>ADO was Microsoft's last data-access method, and it is now the standard for most Office, Web, and Visual Basic environments prior to .NET. The following products ship ADO in the box:</P>
<UL>
<LI><P>Microsoft Office 200<span class="docEmphasis">x</span></P></LI>
<LI><P>Visual Studio 6.0 (including all the languages in the box)</P></LI>
<LI><P>SQL Server 7.0, 2000</P></LI>
</UL>
<P>Data Access Objects (DAO), the standard prior to even ADO, was used throughout Office and Visual Basic, but it wasn't designed to be used with Web environments such as Visual InterDev and other data servers. Currently, no plan is underway to update DAO beyond DAO 3.6, which includes support for Unicode and some bug fixes, but doesn't have any other new features included beyond 3.5.</P>
