<div class="alarmpossbody">
<ul><li>warning for abnormal channel activation (sub-category 00)</li><li>The channel types or states between the BSC and BTS are not consistent.</li><li>A TRX detects an channel activation alarm based on timeslot. It detects each channel for such an alarm. Because channel types and states are configured and managed in timeslots, the number of abnormal channel activation events are calculated in timeslots. One timeslot can be configured as a channel of different types and the number of sub-channels is different. Therefore, the alarm trigger threshold for the number of abnormal channel activation events on a specific timeslot depends on the channel configuration.</li><li>Specifically, the threshold is 5 for the number of abnormal activations of each sub-channel. Therefore, the threshold is 5 for the number of abnormal activations of TCH/F channels. The threshold is 10 for the number of abnormal activations of TCH/H channels and 40 for that of abnormal activations of SDCCH8.An abnormal channel activation alarm is reported concerning TRX information. Once an abnormal channel activation is detected on a timeslot, an abnormal channel activation warning involving TRX information shall be reported.</li><li>warning for abnormal channel release (sub-category 01)</li><li>The proportion of abnormal channel release exceeds the relevant alarm threshold.</li><li>Upon receipt of the RELEASE COMPLETE message, a TRX first detects whether there is any interaction on the channel on the Um interface since the channel activation. If no, it shall consider this release as an abnormal release. Then the number of abnormal channel releases is incremented by 1 on the timeslot. If the number of channel activations on the timeslot exceeds the defined alarm threshold (20 for each sub-channel on a timeslot by default, configurable) and the percentage of the number of abnormal releases to the latest defined number of calls reaches or exceeds the defined alarm report threshold (80% by default, configurable), the corresponding TRX shall send the TMU a log containing the channel type of the timeslot. At the same time, it shall report an abnormal channel release warning concerning the TRX information. Otherwise, the percentage of the number of abnormal channel releases will decrease. When this percentage decreases to or below the defined alarm removal threshold (50% by default, configurable), indicating the warning is cleared, the TRX shall check whether the abnormal channel release warning on all the timeslots is cleared. If yes, it shall send the TMU the removal of the abnormal channel release warning.</li><li>The alarm threshold for the number of abnormal channel releases on each timeslot depends on the channel type of the timeslot. Specifically, the threshold is in direction proportion to the number of sub-channels on each timeslot. The default alarm threshold for the number of sub-channels on each timeslot is 20. You may also configure it through the BSC maintenance system. The alarm threshold for the number of abnormal channel releases on each timeslot is equal to the number of sub-channels on the timeslot multiplied by the defined threshold for the number of abnormal releases of a sub-channel.</li><li>warning for no traffic on primary BCCH (sub-category 02)</li><li>If a TRX has not detected traffic for a defined time period (four hours by default, configurable), it shall report a warning for no traffic on the primary BCCH.</li><li>warning for power level imbalance between uplink and downlink (sub-category 03)</li><li>When a TRX detects a fault or defect in the uplink receive channel or downlink transmit channel, there will be a great difference for the same call between the uplink receive power level detected by the BTS and the downlink receive power level reported from the MS. This difference is called power level imbalance between uplink and downlink. The TRX reports a warning for power level imbalance between uplink and downlink upon detecting a severe imbalance. This warning is one of radio link warnings and identified by alarm sub-category number.</li><li>Specifically, the TRX starts to detect such power level imbalance between uplink and downlink since the system time of 22:00. It reports a warning for power level imbalance between uplink and downlink when the total number of measurements reaches 1000 and the percentage of the number of measurements with power level imbalance to the total number reaches the defined alarm threshold. The default value of the threshold is 80%. You may configure a different value through the BSC maintenance system.</li></ul>
