<h1 class="topictitle1">Replace the DDPU/DDPM/DFCU</h1>

<div>
<div class="section"><p>Note: Replace the DDPU/DDPM/DFCU at a suitable time as it will completely interrupt the services in the cell carried on the board. </p>
<p>      Do not touch the running DDPU/DDPM/DFCU as its surface temperature is rather high. </p>
<p>      Handle the DDPU/DDPM/DFCU with care. </p>
<p>      Connect cables to the DDPU/DDPM/DFCU tightly to avoid RF signal leakage. </p>
<p>      The removed DDPU/DDPM/DFCU cable connectors must be installed with protective caps to avoid damages due to the contact between the inner conductor of the cable connector and the sharp edges. </p>
<p>1) Preparations</p>
<p>a. Confirm the position and version. </p>
<p>b.Mark the installation positions of the cables to the DDPU/DDPM/DFCU. </p>
<p>2)Replace the DDPU/DDPM/DFCU </p>
<p>a. Block the transmission channel of the related DTRU.</p>
<p>b. Wear an antistatic wrist strap.</p>
<p>c.  Remove the cables from the faulty DDPU/DDPM/DFCU and install protective caps onto the cable connectors.</p>
<p>d. Remove the faulty DDPU/DDPM/DFCU. </p>
<p>   Loosen the M4 screws on the DDPU/DDPM/DFCU panel with a cross screwdriver. Hold the handle with one hand and the DDPU/DDPM/DFCU with the other hand to pull out the DDPU/DDPM/DFCU from the slot.</p>
<p>e.Put the DDPU/DDPM/DFCU in an antistatic packaging box.</p>
<p>f.Install the new DDPU/DDPM/DFCU . </p>
<p>h.Install the cables to the DDPU/DDPM/DFCU panel. </p>
<p>Remove the protective caps and insert the cables into the corresponding cable interfaces on the panel according to the installation position of the cables.Take off the antistatic wrist strap and keep it for future use. Unblock the transmission channel of the related DTRU. </p>
<p>In the Management State box of the Change RC Management State dialog box, select UNLOCKED, and click OK.</p>
<p>3)Checking the Replaced Board</p>
<p>a. Check whether the board is in full contact with its backplane. </p>
<p>If board indicators are on and then off, it indicates that the board is not in full contact with its backplane. Reinstall the board. </p>
<p>When the board is in full contact with the backplane, all the indicators will light up for three seconds. In this case, go to Step b. </p>
<p>b.Check whether the board software versions are correct .</p>
<p>c.Check whether the relevant alarms are cleared.</p>
<p>d.Check whether the board is operating normally. </p>
<p>e.Check whether the board can provide normal services</p>
<p>Perform dialing tests after replacing the board. If the board supports packet service before replacement, you also have to perform the packet domain services such as internet browse to ensure that the board is in normal service.</p>
