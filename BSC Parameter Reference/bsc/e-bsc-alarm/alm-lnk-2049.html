<p>2) Remove the rear door of BTS.</p>
<p>3) Remove all the boards and modules from the power backplane.</p>
<p>This operation include removing the boards and modules, specifying the slots that have the boards and modules to be removed, removing and marking the cables that are connected to the boards and modules.</p>
<p>4) Remove the cables from the backplane.</p>

<p>5) Remove the faulty backplane.</p>
<p>Remove the screws that fixed the backplane to the cabinet and remove the backplane. Once this is done, put the backplane in an antistatic bag, and then in an antistatic packaging box.</p>
<p>Because the backplane is heavier than other boards with a wider area, two or more people are required to perform the removing and installing the backplane in case accident happens. </p>
<p>The screws being removed must be well kept in case they drop into the cabinet and cause short circuit in future.</p>
<p>6) Install the new backplane.</p>

<p>Turn on the power of the BTS to check whether the  backplane operates normally, if nothing abnormal happens,  turn off the power of the BTS.</p>
<p>10) Install other boards and modules.</p>
<p>Install the boards and modules by referring to the marks being recorded earlier; reconnect the cables being removed accordingly.</p>
<p>11) Install the rear door.</p>
<p>12) Turn on the power of the BTS.</p>
<p>13) Make sure that the backplane operates normally.</p>
