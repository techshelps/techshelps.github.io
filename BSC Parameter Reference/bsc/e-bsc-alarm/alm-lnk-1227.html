<h1 class="topictitle1">Check whether the reset of the BSC or BTS is performed in thirty minutes in the operation log online.</h1>

<div>
<div class="section"><p>The operation logs of the BSC reset and the BTS reset are different based on the specific reset object.</p>
<p></p>
<p>[1] The operation logs of the BSC reset are classified into the following two types: </p>
<p>a. The reset of the SCU subrack. The operation log is recorded as RST SUBRACK:SRN=Subrack number</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<p>If the reset SCU is located in the subrack 0, the operation log is recorded as RST SUBRACK:SRN=0.</p>
<p>b. The reset of the SCU board. The operation log is recorded as Reset Board:Subrack No.=Subrack number,Slot No.=Slot number.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<p>If the reset SCU board is located in the slot 6 of the subrack 0, the operation log is recorded as Reset Board: Subrack No.=0, Slot No.=6.</p>
<p>Note:</p>
<p>If the SCU board is configured in active/standby mode, you must reset both the active SCU and standby SCU boards to reset the SCU subrack.                                                                                                                  For example:</p>
<p>If the reset SCU boards are located in the slot 6 and 7 of the subrack 0, the operation log is recorded as Reset Board:Subrack No.=0,Slot No.=6;Reset Board:Subrack No.=0,Slot No.=7.                                                                                                                [2] The operation logs of the BTS reset are classified into the following two types:                                                                                                                                </p>
<p>a. If the BTS is reset manually by running commands, the operation logs are classified into level 3 reset and level 4 reset. The operation logs are recorded as follows: </p>
<p>1) site reset:Site Index=BTS ID, Site Reset Level=BTS reset level, Work Port=255;</p>
<p>2) site level4 reset:Site Index=BTS ID,Site Name=BTS name;</p>
<p>                                                     </p>
<p>For example:</p>
<p>If the BTS index is 0 and the BTS name is bts3012, the operation logs of level 3 reset and level 4 reset are respectively recorded as follows:                                                 </p>
<p>1) site reset:Site Index=0,Site Reset Level=2,Work Port=255;                                                                             </p>
<p>2) site level4 reset:Site Index=0,Site Name=bts3102;                                                                                    </p>
<p>b. The reset of the BTS main control board may lead to the reset of the BTS. When you run the BTS reset command Reset BTS Board, you must specify the information regarding the main control board, such as Equipment Type (board type) and Slot No.                                                                                                                                For example:</p>
<p>If the index of BTS 3012 is 2, the main control board (DTMU) is 0X40 (64 in decimal), and the board is located in the slot 0 of the subrack 0 of the cabinet 0, the operation log is recorded as follows:                                                 </p>
<p>                                                                                                                    </p>
<p>Reset BTS Board:Time out value = 8,Operation mode = 0,Object Type = 0,Object count = 1,Bts Object Id = [2,],ParaInd = 0,Para length = 19,Attribute Id = 23,Equipment Id LenH. = 0,Equipment Id LenL. = 1,Equipment Id = 0,Equipment Type LenH. = 0,Equipment Type LenL. = 1,Equipment Type = 64,Equipment Version LenH. = 0,Equipment Version LenL. = 2,Equipment Version0 = 0,Equipment Version1 = 0,Location LenH = 0,Location LenL = 3,Cabinet No. = 0,SubRack No. = 0,Slot No. = 0,MenDep Info LenH. = 0,MenDep Info LenL. = 1,MenDep Info. = 0.</p>
