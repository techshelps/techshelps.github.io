<h1 class="topictitle1">MML FAQs</h1>


<div><p>This describes how to troubleshoot the problems related to MML commands. When the MML commands fail to return, the data on the server is inconsistent with that on the BSC.</p>

<div class="section"><h4 class="sectiontitle">Failing to Delete Data in Online Mode</h4><p>When you run MML commands to delete data, the system deletes the data from the database only when all the involved boards succeed in deleting the data. If one board fails to delete the data,
the system does not delete the data from the database. In this case, the data in the database may not be consistent with that on the BSC.</p>
<p>If you fail to delete data in online mode, generally you can run MML commands again to delete the data.</p>
<ul><li>If the failure is caused by the busy network, you can run the MML commands again to delete the data.</li><li>If the data cannot be deleted after you run the MML commands many times, the connection between the BSC and the server may be faulty.</li></ul>
<p>If the problem cannot be located for the moment, and if you must delete the data from the database of the server, you can log in to the LMT in offline mode, and then run the MML commands. In this case, the data on the server is consistent with
the data on the BSC that succeeds in deleting the data; the data on the server, however, may be inconsistent with the data on the BSC that fails to delete the data.</p>
</div>

<div class="section"><h4 class="sectiontitle">Failing to Add Data in Online Mode</h4><p>Before the system runs adding (configuring or modifying) commands, the system modifies the data in the database of the server. Then, the system sends the data to the involved boards on the
BSC. If all the boards succeeds in adding the data, the data on the server is consistent with that on the BSC. If some boards, including the subracks/boards out of position, fail to add the data, the data on the server is consistent with the data on
the boards that succeed in adding the data. The data on the server, however, may be inconsistent with the data on the boards that fail to add the data.</p>
<p>When you fail to add data in online mode, do as follows:</p>
<ul><li>If the subracks/boards that fail to add data are out of position, no handling is required.</li><li>If the subracks/boards that fail to add data are in position, you can delete the data that fails to be added, and then add the data in online mode.<div class="note"><img src="../../public_sys-resources/icon-note.gif"><span class="notetitle"> NOTE: </span><div class="notebody">When you fail to add data in online mode for multiple times, the connection between
the server and the BSC may be faulty.</div></div>
</li></ul>
</div>

<div class="section"><h4 class="sectiontitle">Failing to Configure/Modify Data in Online Mode</h4><p>When you run MML commands to configure or modify data, the system processing procedure is the same as when you run MML commands to add data.</p>
<p>When you fail to configure or
modify data in online mode, do as follows:</p>
<ul><li>If the subracks/boards that fail to add data are out of position, no handling is required.</li><li>If the subracks/boards that fail to configure or modify data are in position, you can run MML commands again to configure or modify data.</li></ul>
