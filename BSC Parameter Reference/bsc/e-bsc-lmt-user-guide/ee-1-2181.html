<h1 class="topictitle1">Loopback</h1>


<div><p>You can perform loopback on a transmission device or a transmission channel by means of hardware or software.</p>

<p>You can learn whether the hardware equipment are working properly and the software parameters are set correctly based on the situation of the transmission equipment, channels, services, and signaling cooperation after the self-loopback. Loopback
test is a most often used method of locating transmission faults and faults in trunk parameter setting.</p>

<p>Loopback is classified into timeslot loopback, port loopback, and speech loopback.</p>

<div class="section"><h4 class="sectiontitle">Timeslot Loopback</h4><p>Timeslot loopback is used to loop back the data carried by the timeslot in the specified direction. Through the timeslot loopback, you can determine whether the transmission on a speech channel is normal
or not. You can determine the loopback direction by selecting a loopback mode.</p>
<p>Timeslot loopback is of two modes: remote loopback and local loopback.</p>
<ul><li><p>Remote loopback</p>
<p>The signals received on a timeslot are sent out without being processed. Remote loopback refers to the loopback performed on the MSC side.</p>
</li><li><p>Local loopback</p>
<p>The signals that should be placed in the sending direction are placed in the receiving direction as the received data. Local loopback refers to the loopback performed on the BSC side.</p>
</li></ul>
</div>

<div class="section"><h4 class="sectiontitle">Port Loopback</h4><p>Port loopback is used to loop back the data received or transmitted by the port in the specified direction. Different interface boards have different port loopback modes. For details, see <a href="#ee-1-2181__table1">Table 1</a>.</p>

<div class="section"><h4 class="sectiontitle">Speech Loopback</h4><p>On a speech channel, you can locate the segment where the speech problem occurs by comparing the loopback speech with the original speech.</p>
<p>Speech loopback is classified into remote speech channel loopback
and DSP speech channel loopback:</p>
<ul><li><p>Remote speech channel loopback</p>
<p>You can detect the speech channel fault by performing the remote speech channel loopback on the A interface, GEIUB/GOIUB/GFGUB/GEHUB/GOGUB Abis interface, and PTU Abis interface. If it is the
internal problem that results in the speech channel fault, you can start the internal testing to locate the fault.</p>
</li><li><p>DSP speech channel loopback</p>
<div class="p">DSP speech channel loopback is classified into DSP A interface loopback and DSP Abis interface loopback.<ul><li>The loopback on the A interface indicates that the data received on the A interface is sent as the data source. The data can be sent in BTS and MSC directions.</li><li>The loopback on the Abis interface indicates that the data received on the Abis interface is sent as the data source. The data can be sent in BTS and MSC directions.</li></ul>
