<h1 class="topictitle1">BSC Software Loading</h1>
<div><p>This describes how the board software is loaded from the server or the flash memory of the board to the service boards.</p>
<p>Board software must be loaded when a board is started or upgraded online. The software loading mode used when a board is started is different from that used when a board is upgraded online.</p>
<ul><li><p>Loading software when a board is started</p>
<p>The software is loaded when the board is started. Based on the loading control character, this kind of loading has three loading modes.</p>
<ul><li>If the loading control character is <span class="parmname"><b>Auto</b></span>, the BSC compares the software version in the flash memory and that in the active area of the server. If the two versions are consistent, the BSC notifies the board to obtain and load program files from the flash memory. If the two versions are inconsistent, the BSC notifies the board to load program files from the active area of the server.</li><li>If the loading control character is <span class="parmname"><b>Load from GBAM</b></span>, the board loads the program files directly from the active area of the server.</li><li>If the loading control character is <span class="parmname"><b>From Flash</b></span>, the BSC loads the program files to each board directly from the flash memory.</li></ul>
</li><li><p>Loading software when a board is upgraded online</p>
<p>The software is loaded when a board is upgraded to a higher version. This kind of loading has only one loading mode, that is, loading software from the server to service boards.</p>
<ul><li>If the software version is saved in the active area of the server, load the software directly from the active area to the service boards.</li><li>If the software version is saved in the standby area of the server, the BSC firstly switches over the active/standby area. Then, you can load the software directly from the active area to the service boards.</li></ul>
</li></ul>
