<div><p>You can determine a port, device, or route uniquely by its IP address.</p>
<p>BSC internal IP addresses consists of the following:</p>
<ul><li><p>Port IP address</p>
<p>The port IP address is used for routing table configuration and route forwarding. The port IP address facilitates the OM of boards. The port IP address can a public network IP address or a private network IP address. The physical IP address must be a full address. Different port IP addresses belong to different network segments. In inter-board active/standby mode, however, the port IP addresses of the active and standby boards can belong to the same network segment.</p>
</li><li><p>Device IP address</p>
<p>The device IP address is a logical IP address for a board. It is also called service IP address. The device IP address of a board is valid to all the ports on the board. All the messages sent to the device IP address can be received and processed on the activated physical port. In inter-board active/standby mode, the active and standby interface boards have the same device IP address and different port IP addresses.</p>
</li><li><p>BSC routing destination IP address</p>
<p>BSC routing destination IP address is the next-hop IP address. The BSC searches the port in the same network segment with the current board (compared with the port IP address) as the outlet port of the board route according to the BSC routing destination IP address. Then, the route from the board to the BSC routing destination IP address is established.</p>
