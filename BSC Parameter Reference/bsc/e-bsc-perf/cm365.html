<div class="section"><h4 class="sectiontitle">Measurement Counter</h4>  <p>CM365:CELL_SIG_CALL_DROPS_FORCE_HO</p>
 </div>

<div class="section"><h4 class="sectiontitle">Description</h4>  <p>After the MS seizes a channel, the BSC initiates forced handover in the cases of channel preemption, channel failure, channel blocking. If the MS fails to handover, the BSC releases the call.</p>
 <p>This measurement
provides the number of call releases by the BSC on the signaling channel due to forced handover failure.</p>
 </div>

<div class="section"><h4 class="sectiontitle">Unit</h4>  <p>Integer number or integer.</p>
 

</div>

<div class="section"><h4 class="sectiontitle">Measurement Point</h4>  <p>When an SDCCH or a TCH is seized to carry signaling during a call, this counter is measured in the following situations:</p>
 <ul><li>The timer expires before the outgoing BSC handover command is received, or the CLEAR REQUEST message is received from the MSC before the timer expires, and the handover cause is OM intervention, MSC triggering, or preemption. </li><li>A call drop occurs during the emergency handover due to PDCH assignment, or ‚Äèthe handover due to TRX mutual aid, preemption, or blocking of cells, TRXs, and channels.</li></ul>
 <p>This counter is calculated at A6, as shown in <a href="#bsc-cell_sig_call_drops_force_ho__fig1">Figure 1</a>, <a href="#bsc-cell_sig_call_drops_force_ho__fig2">Figure 2</a>, <a href="#bsc-cell_sig_call_drops_force_ho__fig3">Figure 3</a>, <a href="#bsc-cell_sig_call_drops_force_ho__fig4">Figure 4</a>, and <a href="#bsc-cell_sig_call_drops_force_ho__fig5">Figure 5</a>.</p>
