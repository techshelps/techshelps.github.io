<div class="section"><h4 class="sectiontitle">Description</h4>  <div class="p">After the BSC loopback starts, the BSC loopback recovery is initiated in the following cases:<ul><li>(1) After the BSC loopback starts, a call processing module at one end needs to perform data services. The BSC receives a data service assignment request message from the MSC. The loopback, however, does not support data services. Therefore, the
call should be returned to a normal one before the data services can be performed. Within the BSC, the call processing module that needs to perform data services initiates a loopback recovery request. Then, the loopback recovery procedure is started.</li><li>(2) When the calling and called MSs are in the stable BSC loopback state, one MS performs an outgoing BSC handover. The cross-BSC loopback is not supported. Therefore, after receiving a handover command from the MSC, the BSC notifies the call processing
module at the peer end that the call should be returned to a normal one to ensure the speech quality after the outgoing BSC handover is successful. If the call processing module initiating the handover receives a handover failure message from the MS,
it is also restored to the normal call state. Within the BSC, the call processing module initiating the outgoing BSC handover initiates a loopback recovery request. Then, the loopback recovery procedure is started.</li><li>(3) When the calling and called MSs are in the stable BSC loopback state, one of them initiates an intra-BSC handover. After receiving the handover detection indication message, the BSC returns the loopback call to a normal one if the handover fails.
Within the BSC, the call processing module initiating the handover sends a loopback recovery indication. Then, the loopback recovery procedure is started.</li><li>(4) When the calling and called MSs are in the stable BSC loopback state, a loopback request is initiated again. The loopback recovery is performed if the loopback acknowledgement message due to the following causes is received: Timer Expired, Failures
on the BTS Side, and Other Causes.</li></ul>

 <p>This measurement provides the number of attempts to return to normal call from BSC loopback.</p>

<div class="section"><h4 class="sectiontitle">Measurement Point</h4>  <p>(1) After the BSC loopback starts, a call processing module at one end needs to perform data services. The BSC receives a data service assignment request message from the MSC. The loopback, however, does
not support data services. Therefore, the call should be returned to a normal one before the data services can be performed. Within the BSC, the call processing module that needs to perform data services initiates a loopback recovery request. Then, this
counter is measured.</p>
 <p>(2) When the calling and called MSs are in the stable BSC loopback state, one MS performs an outgoing BSC handover. The BSC loopback does not support cross-BSC loopback. Therefore, after receiving a handover command from the
MSC, the call processing module in the BSC notifies the call processing module at the peer end that the call should be returned to a normal one to ensure the speech quality after the outgoing BSC handover is successful. If the BSC receives a handover
failure message from the MS, the BSC notifies the call processing module initiating the handover that the call should be returned to a normal one. In the BSC, the call processing module initiating the outgoing BSC handover initiates a loopback recovery
request. Then, this counter is measured.</p>
 <p>(3) When the calling and called MSs are in the stable BSC loopback state, one of them initiates an intra-BSC handover. After receiving the handover detection indication message, the BSC returns the loopback
call to a normal one if the handover fails. Within the BSC, the call processing module initiating the handover sends a loopback recovery indication message to the peer end. Then, this counter is measured.</p>
 <p>(4) When the calling and called MSs are
in the stable BSC loopback state, a loopback request is initiated again. The loopback recovery is performed if the loopback acknowledgement message due to the following causes is received: Timer Expired, Failures on the BTS Side, and Other Causes. The
call processing module initiating the loopback sends a loopback recovery indication message to the peer end. Then, this counter is measured.</p>
