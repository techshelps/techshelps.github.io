 </div>

<div class="section"><h4 class="sectiontitle">Description</h4>  <p>After receiving a system message with the frequency configured in the BA table of the BSC as a neighbor cell of the present cell, the MS measures the information of this neighbor cell (including the BSIC, BCCH, and receive level, where the BSIC and BCCH uniquely identify a neighbor cell), and sends the information to the BTS in a measurement report. The BTS then sends the information to the BSC in a measurement report or a pre-processed measurement report.</p>
<p>After receiving the valid measurement report from the BTS, the BSC decodes the BSIC, BCCH, and receive level, and then measures the number of MSs of that neighbor cell.</p>
 </div>

<div class="section"><h4 class="sectiontitle">Unit</h4>  <p>Integer number or integer.</p>
 

</div>

<div class="section"><h4 class="sectiontitle">Measurement Point</h4> <p>After receiving the valid MR from the BTS in the serving cell, the BSC checks whether the defined neighbor cell in the MR is recorded based on the BSIC and BCCH frequency. If the neighbor cell is recorded, the downlink receive level of this cell is accumulated and this counter is incremented by one. Otherwise, the BSC records the neighbor cell, and measures the BSIC, BCCH, receive level, and number of MRs of this cell.</p>
<p>The measurement object of this counter is configurable. If the measurement object is not configured, this counter is not measured.</p>
</div>

<div class="section"><h4 class="sectiontitle">Formula</h4>  <p>This is an original counter without involving any formula.</p>
