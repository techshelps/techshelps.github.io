<div class="section"><h4 class="sectiontitle">Description</h4>  <p>After receiving a valid MR
from the MS or a pre-processed MR from the BTS, the BSC makes a handover
decision. If an handover from the OL subcell to the UL subcell is
required, the counter Uplink Receive Level during Concentric Cell
Handover Initiation (Overlay to Underlay) is incremented by the uplink
receive level in the MR, and the counter Downlink Receive Level during
Concentric Cell Handover Initiation (Underlay to Overlay) is incremented
by the downlink receive level in the MR. In a granularity period,
the value of Mean Uplink Receive Level during Concentric Cell Handover
Initiation (Overlay to Underlay) is the result of dividing the accumulative
Uplink Receive Level during Concentric Cell Handover Initiation (Overlay
to Underlay) by Internal Intra-Cell Handover Requests (Overlay to
Underlay), and the value of Mean Downlink Receive Level during Concentric
Cell Handover Initiation (Overlay to Underlay) is the result of dividing
the accumulative Downlink Receive Level during Concentric Cell Handover
Initiation (Overlay to Underlay) by Internal Intra-Cell Handover Requests
(Overlay to Underlay).</p>
