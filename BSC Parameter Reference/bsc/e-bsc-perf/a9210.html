<div class="section"><h4 class="sectiontitle">Measurement Counter</h4><p>A9210: UP_EGPRS_TBF_ABNORM_REL_NO_CHAN_RES</p>
 </div>

<div class="section"><h4 class="sectiontitle">Description</h4> <p>This measurement provides the number of uplink EGPRS TBF abnormal releases due to no channel in a granularity period. A high measurement value is yielded because the channel malfunction is frequent or the channel is blocked manually. Refer to the related information such as device alarms to locate the cause. Together with Number of Failed Uplink EGPRS TBF Establishments due to No Channel and Number of Uplink EGPRS TBF Establishment Attempts, this measurement indicates the congestion of the uplink EGPRS TBF establishment due to no channel in a granularity period. If an EGPRS TBF congestion rate higher than 10% is mainly caused by the uplink EGPRS TBF abnormal releases due to no channel, the uplink traffic volume may exceed the system capacity or the CS traffic that preempts the dynamic channels is heavy. Check whether no packet resource is caused by equipment resetting or manual channel blocking. To guarantee stable PS services in the cell with heavy CS traffic, add fixed channels. The addition of fixed channel may affect the coverage of EGPRS services, and thus it should be planned considering the whole situation.</p>

<div class="section"><h4 class="sectiontitle">Unit</h4> <p>Integer number or integer.</p>

<div class="section"><h4 class="sectiontitle">Measurement Point</h4> <p>If the PDCHs reach the specification limit, the PDCHs are released irrespective of the MS status. The uplink EGPRS TBF that uses the PDCH as the control channel is also released.</p>
<p>When the MS is in transmission state and the uplink EGPRS TBF exists but no channel is available for the uplink EGPRS TBF, the BSC releases the uplink EGPRS TBF that uses the channel as the control channel. </p>
<p>Figure 1 shows the procedure of abnormal release of the uplink EGPRS TBF due to no channel. Each time the BSC does not have available channels and thus abnormally releases the uplink EGPRS TBF that uses the channel as the control channel (see measurement point A), the counter is incremented by one.</p>
