 </div>

<div class="section"><h4 class="sectiontitle">Description</h4> <p>This measurement provides the total number of uplink EGPRS RLC data blocks using MCS-3 coding scheme in a cell in a granularity period.</p>
 </div>

<div class="section"><h4 class="sectiontitle">Unit</h4> <p>Integer number or integer.</p>
 

</div>

<div class="section"><h4 class="sectiontitle">Measurement Point</h4> <div class="p">The uplink EGPRS RLC data blocks using MCS-3 coding scheme that the BSC receives from the MS are categorized into three types: MCS-3 data blocks, retransmitted MCS-6 data blocks with MCS-3 coding scheme , and retransmitted MCS-9 data blocks with MCS-3 coding scheme. The total number of uplink EGPRS RLC data blocks using MCS-3 coding scheme is measured as follows:<ul><li>When the MCS-3 data blocks that the BSC receives from the MS is not used to retransmit MCS-6 or MCS-9 data blocks:<ol><li>If the BSC receives an uplink EGPRS RLC MCS-3 data block for the first time, and the data block in the V(N) on the BSC side is in NACKED state, you can infer that the data block has been sent several times. In this case, the counter is incremented by two.</li><li>If the BSC receives an uplink EGPRS RLC MCS-3 data block for the first time, and the data block in the V(N) on the BSC side is in UNRECEIVED state, you can infer that the data block has been sent once only. In this case, the counter is incremented by one.</li><li>If the BSC receives an uplink EGPRS RLC MCS-3 data block for the first time, and the data block in the V(N) on the BSC side is in RECEIVED state, you can infer that the data block is received. In this case, the counter is incremented by one.</li></ol>
</li><li>When the MCS-3 data blocks that the BSC receives from the MS is used to retransmit MCS-6 data blocks:<ol><li>If part of a data block using MCS-6 coding scheme is received, and the rest part of the data block using MCS-3 coding scheme is also received, then the counter is incremented by one.</li><li>If all the data blocks using MCS-6 coding scheme (including all the radio data blocks using MCS-3 coding scheme) are received, the counter is incremented by one.</li><li>If part of a data block using MCS-6 coding scheme is received, and the rest part of the data block using MCS-3 coding scheme is also received, then the counter is incremented by one.</li></ol>
</li><li>When the MCS-3 data blocks that the BSC receives from the MS is used to retransmit MCS-9 data blocks:<ol><li>If part of a data block using MCS-9 coding scheme is received, and the rest part of the data block using MCS-3 coding scheme is also received, then the counter is incremented by one.</li><li>If all the data blocks using MCS-9 coding scheme (including all the radio data blocks using MCS-3 coding scheme) are received, the counter is incremented by one.</li><li>If part of a data block using MCS-9 coding scheme is received, and the rest part of the data block using MCS-3 coding scheme is also received, then the counter is incremented by one.</li></ol>
