<div class="section"><h4 class="sectiontitle">Measurement Counter</h4>  <p>CM360:CELL_SIG_STATIC_STATE_CALL_DROPS</p>
 </div>

<div class="section"><h4 class="sectiontitle">Description</h4>  <p>This measurement provides the number of calls released because of the ERR IND, CONN FAIL IND, and REL IND messages received by the BSC after the MS seizes a signaling channel.</p>
 <p>The MS seizes a signaling
channel in any of the following conditions:</p>
 <p>In the immediate assignment procedure, the BTS sends an EST IND message to the BSC.</p>
 <p>The MS sends a HO CMP message to the BSC, and the MS seizes a signaling channel.</p>
 </div>

<div class="section"><h4 class="sectiontitle">Unit</h4>  <p>Integer number or integer.</p>
 

</div>

<div class="section"><h4 class="sectiontitle">Measurement Point</h4>  <p>When a signaling channel is seized during a call, this counter is measured in the following situations:</p>
 <p>1. The BSC receives an ERROR INDICATION message from the BTS because of the abnormal connection
on the radio link layer. For details, refer to GSM Rec. 08.58.</p>
 <p>2. The BSC receives a CONNECTION FAILURE INDICATION message from the BTS because of link fault or hardware fault on the radio link layer. For details, refer to GSM Rec. 08.58.</p>
 <p>3. When receiving a DISC frame on a link layer connection in multi-frame mode, the BTS sends a REL IND message to the BSC. For details, refer to GSM Rec. 08.58.</p>
 <p>This counter is calculated at A1, A2, and A3, as shown in <a href="#bsc-cell_sig_static_state_call_drops__fig1">Figure 1</a>.</p>
