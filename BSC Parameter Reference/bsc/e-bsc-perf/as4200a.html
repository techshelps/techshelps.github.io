<div class="section"><h4 class="sectiontitle">Description</h4>  <p>The interference band is the uplink interference level of a channel reported by the BTS to the BSC in the RF RESOURCE INDICATION message when the channel is idle. There are five levels of interference bands. The
threshold of each interference band can be configured on the LMT.</p>
 <div class="note"><img src="../../public_sys-resources/icon-note.gif"><span class="notetitle"> NOTE: </span><div class="notebody"><p>The higher rank suggests higher interference level. </p>
</div></div>
<p>This measurement provides the average number of idle channels (TCHF, TCHH, or SDCCH) whose interference
level are in each interference band (1-5) per granularity period. </p>
</div>

<div class="section"><h4 class="sectiontitle">Unit</h4>  <p>Integer number or integer.</p>
 

</div>

<div class="section"><h4 class="sectiontitle">Measurement Point</h4>  <p>The system accumulates the number of idle channels (TCHF, TCHH, or SDCCH) whose interference level are in each interference band every five seconds. At the end of a granularity period, the accumulated number
is divided by sampling times. The result is the average number of idle channels (TCHF, TCHH, or SDCCH) whose interference level are in each interference band.</p>
 </div>

<div class="section"><h4 class="sectiontitle">Formula</h4>  <p>Mean Number of SDCCHs in Interference Band 1 = [Number of SDCCHs in Interference Band 1]/[Number of Attempts to Scan the Interference Band of Channels]</p>

of SDCCHs in Interference Band 2]/[Number of Attempts to Scan the Interference Band of Channels]</p>
 <p>Mean Number of SDCCHs in Interference Band 3 = [Number of SDCCHs in Interference Band 3]/[Number of Attempts to Scan the Interference Band of Channels]</p>

 <p>Mean Number of SDCCHs in Interference Band 5 = [Number of SDCCHs in Interference Band
5]/[Number of Attempts to Scan the Interference Band of Channels]</p>
 <p>Mean Number of TCHFs in Interference Band 1 = [Number of TCHFs in Interference Band 1]/[Number of Attempts to Scan the Interference Band of Channels]</p>
