<div class="section"><h4 class="sectiontitle">Description</h4>  <p>This measurement provides the average erasion rate of each channel type. The channel type is categorized in to FR, HR, EFR, AMR FR (12.2 kbit/s), AMR FR (10.2 kbit/s), AMR FR (7.95 kbit/s), AMR FR (7.40 kbit/s),
AMR FR (6.70 kbit/s), AMR FR (5.90 kbit/s), AMR FR (5.15 kbit/s), AMR FR (4.75 kbit/s), AMR HR (7.95 kbit/s), AMR HR (7.40 kbit/s), AMR  HR (6.70 kbit/s), AMR HR (5.90 kbit/s), AMR HR 5.15 kbit/s, AMR HR (4.75 kbit/s).</p>

<div class="section"><h4 class="sectiontitle">Measurement Point</h4>  <p>The BTS reports the channel type, number of erased frames, and total number of frames in a granularity period in the uplink measurement report. After receiving the measurement report, the BSC measures the
frame erasion rate based on the formula as follows: Number of erased frames × 10000/total number of frames in a granularity period(in this formula, x 10000 is used to retain two digits after the decimal point). The value is accumulated to Accumulated
FER, and MRs with FER are incremented by one. The Average FERs of various channel types are measured on the basis of the formula as follows: Accumulated FER/(MRs with FER × 100).</p>
<p>If the channel type is FR, the counter FR Average FER is measured. </p>
<p>If the channel type is EFR, the counter EFR Average FER is measured. </p>
<p>If the channel type is HR, the counter HR Average FER is measured. </p>
<p>If the channel type is AMR FR (12.2 kbit/s), the counter AMR FR Average FER (12.2kbps) is measured. </p>
<p>If the channel type is AMR FR (10.2 kbit/s0, the counter AMR FR Average FER (10.2kbps) is measured. </p>
<p>If the channel type is AMR FR (7.95 kbit/s), the counter AMR FR Average FER (7.95kbps) is measured. </p>
<p>If the channel type is AMR FR (7.40
kbit/s), the counter AMR FR Average FER (7.40kbps) is measured. </p>
<p>If the channel type is AMR FR (6.70 kbit/s), the counter AMR FR Average FER (6.70kbps) is measured. </p>
<p>If the channel type is AMR FR (5.90 kbit/s), the counter AMR FR Average
FER (5.90kbps) is measured. </p>
<p>If the channel type is AMR FR (5.15 kbit/s), the counter AMR FR Average FER (5.15kbps) is measured. </p>
<p>If the channel type is AMR FR (4.75 kbit/s), the counter AMR FR Average FER (4.75kbps) is measured. </p>
<p>If
the channel type is AMR HR (7.95 kbit/s), the counter AMR HR Average FER (7.95kbps) is measured. </p>
<p>If the channel type is AMR HR (7.40 kbit/s), the counter AMR HR Average FER (7.40kbps) is measured. </p>
<p>If the channel type is AMR HR (6.70 kbit/s),
the counter AMR HR Average FER (6.70kbps) is measured. </p>
<p>If the channel type is AMR HR (5.90 kbit/s), the counter AMR HR Average FER (5.90kbps) is measured. </p>
<p>If the channel type is AMR HR (5.15 kbit/s), the counter AMR HR Average FER (5.15kbps)
is measured. </p>
<p>If the channel type is AMR HR (4.75 kbit/s), the counter AMR HR Average FER (4.75kbps) is measured. </p>
