<div class="section"><h4 class="sectiontitle">Measurement Counter</h4>  <p>K3021:CELL_KPI_TCH_CONG_SIG</p>
 </div>

<div class="section"><h4 class="sectiontitle">Description</h4>  <p>This measurement provides the times the BSC has no TCH (signaling channel) to allocate in an immediate TCH assignment procedure.</p>
 </div>

<div class="section"><h4 class="sectiontitle">Unit</h4>  <p>Integer number or integer.</p>
 

</div>

<div class="section"><h4 class="sectiontitle">Measurement Point</h4>  <p>The BSC receives the ASSIGNMENT REQUEST message from the MSC and the resources assigned by the message are used to establish the signaling connection. See measurement points G1-G6 C in <a href="#bsc-cell_kpi_tch_cong_sig__fig">Figure 1</a>. </p>
<ul><li><p>(1)The BSC will assign a channel after receiving the ASSIGNMENT REQUEST message. If there is no channel available and the BSC does not support queuing or directed retry, the BSC measures the counter.  </p>
<p>(2)If Mode Modify is performed during
the assignment procedure, the CHANNEL MODE MODIFY message is sent to the MS. The MS performs Mode Modify and sends the CHANNEL MODE MODIFY ACKNOWLEDGE message to the BSC. When receiving this message, the BSC measures the counter if the Um channel mode
IE is abnormal. </p>
<p> (3) After the BSC receives the ASSIGNMENT REQUEST message, if there is no channel available and the BSC supports queuing, a timer is set to wait for an idle channel. If an idle channel becomes available before the timer expires,
the BSC successfully assigns the channel. If no idle channels exist when the timer expires and directed retry is not supported, the BSC measures the counter.  </p>
<div class="p">(4) If the directed retry fails, the BSC measures the counter when any of the following
situations occurs, and sends the MSC an ASSIGNMENT FAILURE message to clear the connection. <ul><li>The MRs reported by the MS have no target cell available. </li><li>Directed retry to another cell in the BSC. The originating cell receives the Intercell Handover Reject message from the target cell. The measurement object is the originating cell. </li><li>Directed retry to another cell in the BSC. The handover fails and the MS reconnects to the original signaling channel. The measurement object is the originating cell.</li><li>Directed retry to another cell in the BSC. The target cell response is not received within scheduled time. The measurement object is the originating cell. </li><li>Directed retry to another cell in the BSC. The originating cell receives the Inter Clear Request message from the target cell. This clear message is used to inform the originating cell of the directed retry failure and to request the originating
cell to clear the connection. The measurement object is the originating cell. </li><li>Directed retry to another cell in the BSC. The originating cell sends the MS a HANDOVER COMMAND message, requesting the MS to access a new channel. If the originating cell does not receive the Inter Clear Request from the target cell within scheduled
time, the BSC measures the counter. </li></ul>
