<div class="section"><h4 class="sectiontitle">Measurement Counter</h4>  <p>CM30:CELL_SD_CALL_DROPS</p>
 </div>

<div class="section"><h4 class="sectiontitle">Description</h4>  <p>In the immediate assignment procedure and the handover procedure, after the MS accesses the SDCCH assigned by the BSC, the procedure fails to be performed due to various reasons. This measurement provides the
number of call drops on the SDCCH. Alternatively, when the MS normally seizes the SDCCH, this measurement provides the number of call drops due to various reasons. Then the BSC sends the CLEAR REQUEST message to the MSC.</p>
 <p>This measurement provides
the number of call releases by the BSC on the SDCCH due to various reasons.</p>
 </div>

<div class="section"><h4 class="sectiontitle">Unit</h4>  <p>Integer number or integer.</p>
 

</div>

<div class="section"><h4 class="sectiontitle">Measurement Point</h4>  <div class="p">When an SDCCH is seized during a call, this counter is measured in the following situations:<ul><li>1. The BSC receives an ERROR INDICATION message from the BTS because of the abnormal connection on the radio link layer. For details, refer to GSM Rec. 08.58.</li><li>2. The BSC receives a CONNECTION FAILURE INDICATION message from the BTS because of link fault or hardware fault on the radio link layer. For details, refer to GSM Rec. 08.58.</li><li>3. When receiving a DISC frame on a link layer connection in multi-frame mode, the BTS sends a REL IND message to the BSC. For details, refer to GSM Rec. 08.58.</li><li>4. The timer set to wait for an HO CMP message expires during internal intra-cell handover.</li><li>5. The timer set to wait for an HO CMP message expires during outgoing internal inter-cell handover.</li><li>6. The timer set to wait for an HO CMP message expires during outgoing external inter-cell handover.</li><li>7. The timer set to wait for an HO CMP message expires during incoming external inter-cell handover.</li><li>8. The BSC does not receive any measurement report within a certain period (by default, five minutes) and sends a CLEAR COMMAND message to the MSC to release the call.</li><li>9. The BSC detects a broken RSL and releases all the calls on the RSL.</li><li>10. A call drop occurs in any of the following situations: TRX mutual aid; dynamic modification of cell attributes, TRX frequencies, or TRX FH data; dynamic deletion of cells or TRXs; blocking of cells, TRXs, or channels.</li><li>11. The timer set to wait for the outgoing BSC handover command expires, or the clear request message is received from the MSC before the timer expires.</li><li>12. A call drop occurs because of call assignment failure during the handover.</li><li>13. The MSC cannot send a short message because the data configuration prohibits the downlink short messages or because of flow control, and the call is released.</li><li>14. A call drop occurs because of software error.</li><li>15. After seizing a channel, the MS fails to start a local switching due to terrestrial resource request failure, failures on the BTS side, or timer expiration.</li><li>16. During the handover of the call in the local switching state, the BSC releases the call after receiving a HANDOVER DETECT message from the BTS and then a HANDOVER FAILURE message from the MS.</li><li>17. When a call is in the BSC or BTS local switching state, if the local switching cannot be proceeded for handover or other reasons, the BSC restores the call to the common call state. If the restoration fails for terrestrial resource request
failure or other reasons, the BSC releases the call.</li></ul>
