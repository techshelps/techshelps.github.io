 </div>

<div class="section"><h4 class="sectiontitle">Description</h4>  <p>After the MS seizes a traffic channel, in case of any call release is caused, the BSC sends a CLR REQ message to the MSC, regardless of whether the call is in the stable or handover state.</p>
 <p>This measurement
provides number of clear requests sent on the TCHFs or TCHHs used to carry traffic over the A interface.</p>
 </div>

<div class="section"><h4 class="sectiontitle">Unit</h4>  <p>Integer number or integer.</p>
 

</div>

<div class="section"><h4 class="sectiontitle">Measurement Point</h4>  <p>When the a TCH is seized to carry signaling during a call, this counter is incremented by one when the BSC sends a CLR REQ message to the MSC.</p>
 <p>This counter is calculated at A5, as shown in <a href="#bsc-cell_a_clr_req_tch_traf__fig2">Figure 1</a>, <a href="#bsc-cell_a_clr_req_tch_traf__fig3">Figure 2</a>, <a href="#bsc-cell_a_clr_req_tch_traf__fig4">Figure 3</a>, and <a href="#bsc-cell_a_clr_req_tch_traf__fig5">Figure 4</a>.</p>
