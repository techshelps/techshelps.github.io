<div class="section"><h4 class="sectiontitle">Measurement Counter</h4><p>A9004:UP_GPRS_TBF_ESTB_FAIL_MS_NO_RESP</p>
 </div>

<div class="section"><h4 class="sectiontitle">Description</h4> <p>This measurement provides the number of failed uplink GPRS TBF establishments due to no response from the MS in a granularity period. A high measurement value is yielded because the radio quality of the cell is
bad.</p>
 </div>

<div class="section"><h4 class="sectiontitle">Unit</h4> <p>Integer number or integer.</p>
 

</div>

<div class="section"><h4 class="sectiontitle">Measurement Point</h4> <div class="p">The uplink GPRS TBF establishment failures due to no response from the MS involve the following aspects: <ul><li><p>Failed uplink GPRS TBF establishment using one phase access due to no response from the MS</p>
<p>After sending the IMMEDIATE ASSIGNMENT message during the procedure of one phase access establishment, the BSC begins to allocate the valid USF for
the MS to schedule the uplink blocks. If the BSC receives the valid uplink block in the blocks reserved for the MS, the N3101 is reset. Otherwise, the N3101 is incremented by one, and the BSC reschedules the uplink blocks for the MS through Packet Downlink
Dummy Control Block. If the N3101 overflows, the BSC releases the uplink GPRS TBF. Figure 1 shows the procedure in which the uplink GPRS TBF establishment fails because the MS does not respond to the IMMEDIATE ASSIGNMENT message from the BSC. If the
N3101 overflows (see measurement point A), the counter is incremented by one.</p>

</div>
</li><li><p>Failed uplink GPRS TBF establishment using single block access due to MS no response</p>
<p> After sending the PACKET UPLINK ASSIGNMENT message during the procedure of single block access establishment, the BSC begins to allocate the valid USF
for the MS to schedule the uplink blocks. If the BSC receives the valid uplink block in the blocks reserved for the MS, the N3101 is reset. Otherwise, the N3101 is incremented by one, and the BSC reschedules the uplink blocks for the MS through Packet
Downlink Dummy Control Block. If the N3101 overflows, the BSC releases the uplink GPRS TBF. Figure 2 shows the procedure in which the uplink GPRS TBF establishment fails because the MS does not respond to the PACKET UPLINK ASSIGNMENT message from the
BSC. If the N3101 overflows (see measurement point A), the counter is incremented by one.</p>

</div>
</li><li><p>Uplink GPRS TBF establishment failure on the PACCH due to no MS response</p>
<p> After sending the PACKET UPLINK ASSIGNMENT message on the PACCH, the BSC begins to allocate the valid USF for the MS to schedule the uplink blocks. If the BSC receives
the valid uplink block in the blocks reserved for the MS, the N3101 is reset. Otherwise, the N3101 is incremented by one, and the BSC reschedules the uplink blocks for the MS through Packet Downlink Dummy Control Block, Downlink Data Block, or downlink
control block.If the N3101 overflows, the BSC releases the uplink GPRS TBF. Figure 3 shows the procedure in which the uplink GPRS TBF establishment fails because the MS does not respond to the PACKET UPLINK ASSIGNMENT message from the BSC. If the N3101
overflows (see measurement point A), the counter is incremented by one.</p>
