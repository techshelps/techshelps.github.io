<div class="section"><h4 class="sectiontitle">Description</h4>  <p>After an MS seizes a channel, if the system initiates a forced handover and the handover fails, the BSC may initiate a call release procedure. This measurement provides the number of call drops due to forced
handovers on the basis of the channel type (SDCCH, TCHF, or TCHH), the service type (signaling or traffic), and the concentric attribute (overlaid subcell or underlaid subcell).</p>
 </div>

<div class="section"><h4 class="sectiontitle">Unit</h4>  <p>Integer number or integer.</p>
 

</div>

<div class="section"><h4 class="sectiontitle">Measurement Point</h4> <p>This counter is measured in the following situations:</p>
 <ul><li>The timer expires before the outgoing BSC handover command is received, or the CLEAR REQUEST message is received from the MSC before the timer expires, and the handover cause is OM intervention, MSC triggering, or preemption.</li><li>A call drop occurs during the emergency handover due to PDCH assignment, or ‚Äèthe handover due to TRX mutual aid, preemption, or blocking of cells, TRXs, and channels.</li></ul>
 <p>The specific counter is measured at A6, as shown in <a href="#bsc-cell_call_drops_force_ho_sd__fig1">Figure 1</a>, <a href="#bsc-cell_call_drops_force_ho_sd__fig2">Figure 2</a>, <a href="#bsc-cell_call_drops_force_ho_sd__fig3">Figure 3</a>, <a href="#bsc-cell_call_drops_force_ho_sd__fig4">Figure 4</a>, and <a href="#bsc-cell_call_drops_force_ho_sd__fig5">Figure 5</a>.</p>
