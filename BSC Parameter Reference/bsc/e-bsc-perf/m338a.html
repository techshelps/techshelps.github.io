 </div>

<div class="section"><h4 class="sectiontitle">Description</h4>  <p>This measurement provides the number of successful seizures of the TCH carried on the TRX in the overlaid subcell of a concentric cell.</p>
 </div>

<div class="section"><h4 class="sectiontitle">Unit</h4>  <p>Integer number or integer.</p>
 

</div>

<div class="section"><h4 class="sectiontitle">Measurement Point</h4>  <p>In the assignment procedure, if the TRX is in the overlaid subcell of a concentric cell and a TCH is seized during a call, this counter is incremented by one when the BSC receives an ASS CMP message from
the MS.</p>
 <p>In the incoming inter-cell handover procedure, if the TRX is in the overlaid subcell of a concentric cell and a TCH is seized during a call, this counter is incremented by one when the BSC receives an HO CMP message from the MS.</p>
 <p>This counter is calculated at A8, as shown in <a href="#bsc-cell_call_tch_succ_overlay__fig2">Figure 1</a> and <a href="#bsc-cell_call_tch_succ_overlay__fig3">Figure 2</a>.</p>
