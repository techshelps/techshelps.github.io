<div class="section"><h4 class="sectiontitle">Description</h4>  <p>After the MS seizes a channel, the BSC may send a CLEAR REQ message to the MSC. This measurement provides the number of clear requests sent over the A interface on the basis of the channel type (SDCCH, TCHF,
or TCHH), the service type (signaling or traffic), and the call state (stable state or handover state).</p>
 <p>After the MS seizes a channel, if TA Limit is enabled on the BSC and the TA exceeds the threshold, the BSC sends a CLEAR REQ message to release
the call. The counter Clear Requests Sent on the A interface (TA Limit) provides the number of clear requests of this type sent on the A interface.</p>
