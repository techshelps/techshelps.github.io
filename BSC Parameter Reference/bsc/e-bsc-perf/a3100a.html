<div class="section"><h4 class="sectiontitle">Description</h4><div class="p">In the immediate assignment procedure, the BSS assigns a signaling channel to an MS. After the MS sets up an RR connection with the BSS, the MS sets up an MM connection and a CC connection to the MSC on this signaling
channel. The MSC assigns an A interface circuit to the MS in the ASS REQ message based on the CC connection request from the MS and specifies the service type of this call and the type of the channel that can be assigned to the call. Upon receipt of
the ASS REQ message from the MSC, the BSC assigns a proper channel for the access of the MS based on the service type and the channel type specified in the ASS REQ message. The service type can be one of the following three: <ul><li>Signaling service</li><li>Speech service</li><li>Data service </li></ul>
</div>
<div class="p">When the channel assigned by the MSC is used for speech service, the assigned channel is one of the following types: <ul><li>Full rate TCH channel Bm </li><li>Half rate TCH channel Lm</li><li>Full or Half rate TCH channel, Full rate preferred, changes between full rate and half rate allowed also after first channel allocation as a result of the request</li><li>Full or half rate TCH channel, half rate preferred, changes between full rate and half rate allowed also after first channel allocation as a result of the request</li><li>Full or half rate TCH channel, full rate preferred, changes between full rate and half rate not allowed after first channel allocation as a result of the request </li><li>Full or half rate TCH channel, half rate preferred, changes between full rate and half rate not allowed after first channel allocation as a result of the request </li><li>Full or half rate TCH channel, changes between full and half rate allowed also after first channel allocation as a result of the request </li><li>Full or half rate TCH channel, changes between full and half rate not allowed after first channel allocation as a result of the request </li></ul>
</div>
<p>Huawei BSC supports all of the eight channel types.</p>
<div class="p"> When the channel assigned by the MSC is used for data services, the assigned channel is one of the following types: ÔÅ¨<ul><li><ul><li>Full rate TCH channel Bm</li><li>Half rate TCH channel Lm</li><li>Full or Half rate TCH channel, Full rate preferred, changes between full rate and half rate allowed also after first channel allocation as a result of the request</li><li>Full or half rate TCH channel, half rate preferred, changes between full rate and half rate allowed also after first channel allocation as a result of the request</li><li>Full or half rate TCH channel, full rate preferred, changes between full rate and half rate not allowed after first channel allocation as a result of the request </li><li>Full or half rate TCH channel, half rate preferred, changes between full rate and half rate not allowed after first channel allocation as a result of the request</li><li>Full rate TCH channels in a multislot configuration, changes of the radio interface rate per channel allowed after first channel allocation as a result of the request </li><li>Full rate TCH channels in a multislot configuration, changes of the radio interface rate per channel not allowed after first channel allocation as a result of the request</li></ul>
</li></ul>

<p> Huawei BSC supports the first six channel types.</p>
<p> The measurement counters provide the numbers of ASS REQ messages received by the BSC based on the service type and the channel type in the ASS REQ messages. </p>
<p>The counter A3100A
"CELL_ASS_REQ_SIG_TCH "and "A3100K: CELL_ASS_REQ_SIG_SDCCH" provides the number of ASS REQ messages received by the BSC, in which the service type indicates the signaling service.</p>
<div class="p"> The rest counters as listed below provide the numbers of ASS REQ
messages received by the BSC, in which the service type indicates speech service or data service. <ul><li>A3100B: CELL_ASS_REQ_TCHF_ONLY </li><li>A3100C: CELL_ASS_REQ_TCHH_ONLY </li><li>A3100D: CELL_ASS_REQ_TCHF_PREF_NOCHG </li><li>A3100E: CELL_ASS_REQ_TCHH_PREF_NOCHG </li><li>A3100F: CELL_ASS_REQ_TCH_NOCHG </li><li>A3100G: CELL_ASS_REQ_TCHF_PREF_CHG </li><li>A3100H: CELL_ASS_REQ_TCHH_PREF_CHG </li><li>A3100I: CELL_ASS_REQ_TCH_CHG</li></ul>

<div class="section"><h4 class="sectiontitle">Measurement Point</h4>  <p>As shown in<a href="#bsc-cell_ass_req_sig_tch__fig1">Figure 1</a> each time the BSC receives an ASS REQ message from the MSC (see measurement point A), the corresponding counter is incremented by one based on the service type and the
channel type specified in the ASS REQ message.</p>
