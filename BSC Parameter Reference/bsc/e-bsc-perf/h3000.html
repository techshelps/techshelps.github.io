<div class="section"><h4 class="sectiontitle">Description</h4>  <p>After seizing a dedicated channel, an MS sends the BSC measurement reports periodically. After receiving the measurement reports, the BSC uses the handover algorithm to decide whether a handover is required or
not based on the measurement reports. If a handover is required and the source cell (current cell) is also the target cell, the BSC sends an intra-cell handover request.</p>
 <p>The counters provide the numbers of intra-cell handover requests initiated
based on the type of the channel the MS seizes before the handover and the handover reason. They indicate the frequency of intra-cell handovers initiated from the current cell and can be combined with the Internal Intra-Cell Handover Commands and the
Failed Internal Intra-Cell Handovers to reflect the performance of internal intra-cell handovers.</p>
 <div class="p">The counter H3000 indicates the number of internal intra-cell handover requests when the type of the channel the MS seizes before the internal intra-cell
handover is SDCCH. The counter H3009 indicates the number of internal intra-cell handover requests when the type of the channel the MS seizes before the internal intra-cell handover is TCH. Each time an internal intra-cell handover request is initiated,
the counter H3000 or H3009 is incremented by one based on the type of the channel the MS seizes before the handover.<ul><li>H3000: CELL_INTRACELL_HO_REQ_SD</li><li>H3009: CELL_INTRACELL_HO_REQ_TCH</li></ul>
</div>
 <p>If the cell supports TCHHs and enables TCHF-TCHH dynamic conversion, the BSC initiates a TCHF-TCHH conversion based on the traffic load of the cell or changes two TCHHs back to one TCHF. If the selected TCHF is already seized by a call,
the BSC initiates another internal intra-cell handover procedure to switch the current call to another channel for the dynamic conversion. If one of the selected TCHHs to be changed back is already seized by a call, the BSC initiates another internal
intra-cell handover procedure to switch the current call to another channel for the changeback.</p>
 <div class="p">The counter H3003A indicates the number of internal intra-cell handover requests initiated for a TCHF-TCHH conversion. The counter H3003B indicates
the number of internal intra-cell handover requests initiated for a TCHH-TCHF conversion. Each time an internal intra-cell handover request is initiated for a TCHF-TCHH or TCHH-TCHF conversion, the counter H3003A or H3003B is incremented by one based
on the type of the conversion.<ul><li>H3003A: CELL_INTRACELL_HO_REQ_TCHF_TCHH</li><li>H3003B: CELL_INTRACELL_HO_REQ_TCHH_TCHF</li></ul>
</div>
 <p>When the cell enables TCH-SDCCH dynamic conversion, the BSC initiates a conversion from a TCH to an SDCCH based on the signaling channel load of the cell or changes an SDCCH back to a TCH. If the selected TCH is already seized by a call,
the BSC initiates another internal intra-cell handover procedure to switch the current call to another channel for the dynamic conversion. If the selected SDCCH to be changed back is already seized by a call, the BSC initiates another internal intra-cell
handover procedure to switch the current call to another channel for the changeback.</p>
 <div class="p">The counter H3004A indicates the number of internal intra-cell handover requests initiated for a TCH-SDCCH conversion. The counter H3004B indicates the number
of internal intra-cell handover requests initiated for an SDCCH-TCH conversion. Each time an internal intra-cell handover request is initiated for a TCH-SDCCH or SDCCH-TCH conversion, the counter H3004A or H3004B is incremented by one based on the type
of the conversion.<ul><li>H3004A: CELL_INTRACELL_HO_REQ_TCH_SD</li><li>H3004B: CELL_INTRACELL_HO_REQ_SD_TCH</li></ul>
</div>
 <p>When a cell is configured as a concentric cell, usually the overlay has many channels and has far stronger traffic bearing capability than the underlay. For this reason, the MS should hand over to the overlay when the MS moves to the service
area of the overlay after establishing a connection to the underlay; however, the overlay has limited coverage capability. Therefore, the MS should hand over to a channel in the underlay to maintain the connectivity when the MS moves to the border between
the underlay and the overlay after establishing a connection to the overlay.</p>
 <div class="p">The counter H3002 indicates the number of internal intra-cell handover requests initiated for a handover from the underlay of a concentric cell to the overlay of the
cell. The counter H3001 indicates the number of internal intra-cell handover requests initiated for a handover from the overlay of a concentric cell to the underlay of the cell. Each time an internal intra-cell handover request is initiated for a handover
from the underlay to the overlay or from the overlay to the underlay of a concentric cell, the counter H3002 or H3001 is incremented by one based on the type of the handover.<ul><li>H3002: CELL_INTRACELL_HO_REQ_ULCELL_OLCELL</li><li>H3001: CELL_INTRACELL_HO_REQ_OLCELL_ULCELL</li></ul>
</div>
 <p>Suppose a cell enables the interference handover algorithm. When the BSC considers that a call in the cell meets the uplink interference handover decision condition and the target cell is the current cell, the BSC initiates an intra-cell
uplink interference handover request. If the BSC considers that a call in the cell meets the downlink interference handover decision condition and the target cell is the current cell, the BSC initiates an intra-cell downlink interference handover request.</p>
 <div class="p">The counter CH3036A indicates the number of intra-cell uplink interference handover requests initiated. The counter CH3036B indicates the number of intra-cell downlink interference handover requests initiated. Each time an internal intra-cell handover
request is initiated for an uplink or downlink interference handover, the counter CH3036A or CH3036B is incremented by one.<ul><li>CH3036A: CELL_INTRACELL_HO_REQ_UL_INTERFERE </li><li>CH3036B: CELL_INTRACELL_HO_REQ_DL_INTERFERE</li></ul>
</div>
 <p>If the BSC enables the local switching function, then the calls that meet the local switching condition of the BSC use the local switching function of the BSC for the conversation and those that meet the local switching condition of the
BTS use the local switching function of the BTS for the conversation.</p>
 <div class="p">The counter H300a indicates the number of internal intra-cell handover requests sent by the BSC for the calls that use the local switching function of the BSC. The counter H300b
indicates the number of internal intra-cell handover requests sent by the BSC for the calls that use the local switching function of the BTS. Each time an internal intra-cell handover request is sent by the BSC for a call that uses the local switching
function of the BSC or the BTS, the counter H300a or H300b is incremented by one.<ul><li>H300a: CELL_INTRACELL_HO_REQ_BSC_LOOP</li><li>H300b: CELL_INTRACELL_HO_REQ_BTS_LOOP</li></ul>
</div>
 <div class="p">If a cell supports the AMR function, the BSC initiates a TCHF-TCHH or TCHH-TCHF handover inside the cell for a call that uses the AMR speech version based on the traffic load of the cell. If the channel type carried in the ASS REQ message
from the MSC in the call establishment phase does not permit any change of the channel type in the call procedure, the BSC gives up the handover.<ul><li>The counter H3005A indicates the number of internal intra-cell handover requests initiated for a TCHF-TCHH conversion for an AMR call. The counter H3005B indicates the number of internal intra-cell handover requests initiated for a TCHH-TCHF conversion
for an AMR call. Each time an internal intra-cell handover request is initiated for a TCHF-TCHH or TCHH-TCHF conversion for an AMR call, the counter H3005A or H3005B is incremented by one based on the type of the conversion.<ul><li>H3005A: CELL_INTRACELL_HO_REQ_AMR_TCHF_TCHH</li><li>H3005B: CELL_INTRACELL_HO_REQ_AMR_TCHH_TCHF</li></ul>
 </li><li>The counter H3055A indicates the number of attempted internal intra-cell handovers the BSC gives up for a TCHF-TCHH conversion. The counter H3055B indicates the number of attempted internal intra-cell handovers the BSC gives up for a TCHH-TCHF conversion.<ul><li>H3055A: CELL_INTRACELL_HO_NO_TRIG_AMR_TCHF_TCHH</li><li>H3055B: CELL_INTRACELL_HO_NO_TRIG_AMR_TCHH_TCHF</li></ul>
