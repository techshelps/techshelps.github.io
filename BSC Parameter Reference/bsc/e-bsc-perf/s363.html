<div class="section"><h4 class="sectiontitle">Description</h4>  <p>The MS measures the information of the serving cell and neighbor cells, and sends the information to the BTS in an MR. The BTS then sends the information to the BSC in an MR. This measurement provides the number of times that the signal strength difference between the serving cell and each neighbor cell contained in the MRs is smaller than the Neighbor Cell Interference Level Threshold N subtracted by 64. This measurement is used to show the mapping between the receive level of the serving cell and the receive level of neighbor cells, and provide a basis for formulating the frequency planning scheme.</p>

<div class="section"><h4 class="sectiontitle">Unit</h4>  <p>Integer number or integer.</p>
 

</div>
<div class="section"><h4 class="sectiontitle">Measurement Point</h4>  <p>After receiving a valid MR from the MS, the BSC compares the receive level of the serving cell with that of each neighbor cell. The BSC triggers the measurement when the following formula is met: serving cell receive level + 64 &lt; neighbor cell receive level + Neighbor Cell Interference Level Threshold N. N ranges from 0 to 1, and Neighbor Cell Interference Level Threshold 1 &gt; Neighbor Cell Interference Level Threshold 0.</p>
<p>The counters S394:CELL_SCELL_NCELL_LEV_LESS_THRES0_MR_NUM and S363:CELL_SCELL_NCELL_LEV_LESS_THRES1_MR_NUM are incremented by one respectively when the following formula is met: serving cell receive level + 64 &lt; neighbor cell receive level + Neighbor Cell Interference Level Threshold 0.</p>
<p>The counter S363:CELL_SCELL_NCELL_LEV_LESS_THRES1_MR_NUM is incremented by one when the following formula is met: neighbor cell receive level + Neighbor Cell Interference Level Threshold 0 â‰¤ serving cell receive level + 64 &lt; neighbor cell receive level + Neighbor Cell Interference Level Threshold 1.</p>
<p>The measurement object of this counter is configurable. If the measurement object is not configured, this counter is not measured.</p>

<div class="section"><h4 class="sectiontitle">Formula</h4>  <p>This is an original counter without involving any formula.</p>
