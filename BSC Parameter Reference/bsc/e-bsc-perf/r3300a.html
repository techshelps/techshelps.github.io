<div class="section"><h4 class="sectiontitle">Description</h4>  <p>In the immediate assignment procedure, the BSC receives a CHANNEL REQUIRED message from the BTS. If the BSC successfully assigns a channel and sends a CHANNEL ACTIVATION message, one of the following three counters
is incremented by one for the cell where the channel resides based on the channel type: R3300A "Channel Activation Attempts in Immediate Assignment Procedure (SDCCH)", R3307A "Channel Activation Attempts in Immediate Assignment Procedure (TCHF)", or
R3308A "Channel Activation Attempts in Immediate Assignment Procedure (TCHH)". In addition, one of the following five counters is incremented by one based on the call type: R3300D "Channel Activation Attempts in Immediate Assignment Procedure (Call Initiation)(SDCCH)",
R3300E "Channel Activation Attempts in Immediate Assignment Procedure (Paging Response)(SDCCH)", R3300F "Channel Activation Attempts in Immediate Assignment Procedure (Call Re-establishment)(SDCCH)", R3300G "Channel Activation Attempts in Immediate Assignment
Procedure (Emergency Call)(SDCCH)", or R3300H "Channel Activation Attempts in Immediate Assignment Procedure (Non-Call Part)(SDCCH)".</p>
 <p>In the immediate assignment procedure, the BSC sends a CHANNEL ACTIVATION to the BTS. If the BTS returns a CHANNEL
ACTIVATION NEGATIVE ACKNOWLEDGE message indicating the channel activation failure, one of the following three counters is incremented by one for the cell where the channel resides based on the channel type: R3300B "CHAN ACTIV NACK Messages Sent by BTS
in Immediate Assignment Procedure (SDCCH)", R3307B "CHAN ACTIV NACK Messages Sent by BTS in Immediate Assignment Procedure (TCHF)", or R3308B "CHAN ACTIV NACK Messages Sent by BTS in Immediate Assignment Procedure (TCHH)". In addition, one of the following
five counters is incremented by one based on the call type: R3300I "Channel ACTIV NACK Messages in Immediate Assignment Procedure (Call Initiation)(SDCCH)", R3300J "Channel ACTIV NACK Messages in Immediate Assignment Procedure (Paging Response)(SDCCH)",
R3300K "Channel ACTIV NACK Messages in Immediate Assignment Procedure (Call Re-establishment)(SDCCH)", R3300P "Channel ACTIV NACK Messages in Immediate Assignment Procedure (Emergency Call)(SDCCH)", or R3300Q "Channel ACTIV NACK Messages in Immediate
Assignment Procedure (Non-Call Part)(SDCCH)". </p>
 <p>In the immediate assignment procedure, the BSC sends a CHANNEL ACTIVATION message to the BTS and starts an internal timer (5 s by default) to wait for a CHANNEL ACTIVATION ACKNOWLEDGE message. If
the BSC does not receive the CHANNEL ACTIVATION ACKNOWLEDGE message after the timer expires, one of the following three counters is incremented by one for the cell where the channel resides based on the channel type: R3307C "Channel Activation Timeouts
in Immediate Assignment Procedure (SDCCH)", R3307C "Channel Activation Timeouts in Immediate Assignment Procedure (TCHF)", or R3308C "Channel Activation Timeouts in Immediate Assignment Procedure (TCHH)". In addition, one of the following five counters
is incremented by one based on the call type: R3300R "Channel Activation Timeout Counts in Immediate Assignment Procedure (Call Initiation)(SDCCH)", R3300S "Channel Activation Timeout Counts in Immediate Assignment Procedure (Paging Response)(SDCCH)",
R3300T "Channel Activation Timeout Counts in Immediate Assignment Procedure (Call Re-establishment)(SDCCH)", R3300U "Channel Activation Timeout Counts in Immediate Assignment Procedure (Emergency Call)(SDCCH)", or R3300V "Channel Activation Timeout Counts
in Immediate Assignment Procedure (Non-Call Part)(SDCCH)".</p>
