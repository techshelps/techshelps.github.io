<div class="section"><h4 class="sectiontitle">Description</h4>

<p>This measurement indicates the usage of radio resources when an MS performs EGPRS services. It is a major factor for determining whether the radio resources of the EGPRS network are sufficient. The packet service transmission with low data flow such as attach, RAU, and reverse messages (control message, acknowledgment message, and response message) may result in the failure of the network to allocate radio resources to multi-slot capable MSs even through the network has sufficient radio resources. Such low data flow services are performed frequently, and may lead to a lower value of this counter than in actual situations. As a result, it is difficult to determine whether the radio resources of the GPRS network are sufficient. The factors that affect the measurement of this counter must be eliminated, and you can measure the counter based on the service types (uplink preferred, downlink preferred, and normal mode). The principles are as follows: For the MSs that perform uplink-preferred services, only the number of actually used PDCHs on the uplink is measured; for the MSs that perform downlink-preferred services, only the number of actually used PDCHs on the downlink is measured; for the MSs that perform normal mode services, no measurement is performed.</p>

<p>In a granularity period, when the sampling moment comes, the scanning is triggered, and all the uplink TBFs of the channels in a cell are scanned. Every time the EGPRS uplink-preferred service is detected on a channel, the number of TBFs associated with the EGPRS uplink-preferred service on this channel is incremented by one. The number of TBFs associated with the EGPRS uplink-preferred service in the cell is also incremented. After all the uplink TBFs on this channel are scanned, the ratio of the number of TBFs associated with the EGPRS uplink-preferred service on this channel to the number of MSs multiplexed on the uplink of this channel is calculated. This value is incremented within the cell, and the total is then divided by the number of TBFs associated with the EGPRS uplink-preferred service in the cell. In this way, the Number of Actually Used Uplink PDCHs per EGPRS User (Original) is obtained.</p>
