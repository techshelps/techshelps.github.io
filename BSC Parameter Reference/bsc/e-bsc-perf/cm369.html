<div class="section"><h4 class="sectiontitle">Description</h4>  <p>After the MS seizes a TCH to carry signaling, the BSC sends a CLR REQ message to the MSC if the BSC releases a call due to various causes.</p>
 <p>This measurement provides number of clear requests sent on the
A interface when the channel type is TCHF or TCHH and the service type is signaling channel.</p>
 </div>

<div class="section"><h4 class="sectiontitle">Unit</h4>  <p>Integer number or integer.</p>

<div class="section"><h4 class="sectiontitle">Measurement Point</h4>  <p>When a TCH is seized as a signaling channel during a call, this counter is measured when the BSC sends a CLEAR REQ message to the MSC.</p>
 <p>This counter is calculated at A5, as shown in <a href="#bsc-cell_a_clr_req_tch_sig__fig1">Figure 1</a>.</p>
