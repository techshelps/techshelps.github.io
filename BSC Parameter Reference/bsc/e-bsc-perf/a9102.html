<div class="section"><h4 class="sectiontitle">Measurement Counter</h4><p>A9102:DOWN_GPRS_TBF_ESTB_SUCC</p>
 </div>

<div class="section"><h4 class="sectiontitle">Description</h4> <p>This measurement provides the
number of successful downlink GPRS TBF establishments in a granularity
period. A low measurement value indicates that the radio environment,
network parameter configuration, network resource configuration, or
network equipment is not satisfactory, and thus requires optimization.
Further analysis should be made based on the causes of GPRS TBF abnormal
release. Together with Number of Downlink GPRS TBF Establishment Attempts,
this measurement indicates the downlink assignment success rate in
a granularity period. Together with the number of downlink GPRS TBF
abnormal releases, this measurement indicates the call drop rate of
the downlink GPRS TBF in a granularity period.</p>

<div class="section"><h4 class="sectiontitle">Measurement Point</h4> <div class="p">The successful downlink
GPRS TBF establishment involves the following aspects:<ul><li><p> Successful downlink GPRS TBF establishment on the CCCH </p>
<p>The BSC initiates the request for downlink GPRS TBF establishment
by sending the IMMEDIATE ASSIGNMENT message with Starting Time on
the CCCH. When Starting Time expires, the BSC sends the POLLING message
to the MS to obtain the TA value. The BSC also reserves the block
resource for the MS to respond with the assignment acknowledgement
message. If the BSC receives the PACKET CONTROL ACKNOWLEDGEMENT message
from the MS on the reserved block resources, it indicates that the
downlink GPRS TBF establishment is successful. On the basis of received
PACKET CONTROL ACKNOWLEDGEMENT message, the BSC can calculate the
TA value. Figure 1 shows the procedure of downlink GPRS TBF establishment
on the CCCH. Each time the BSC receives a PACKET CONTROL ACKNOWLEDGEMENT
message (see measurement point B), the counter is incremented by one.</p>

</div>
</li><li><p>Successful downlink GPRS TBF establishment on the PACCH</p>
<p> The BSC can initiate the downlink GPRS TBF establishment procedure
by sending the PACKET DOWNLINK ASSIGNMENT message on the uplink or
downlink PACCH to the MS. The BSC also reserves the blocks for the
MS to respond with the assignment acknowledgement message. If the
BSC receives the PACKET CONTROL ACKNOWLEDGEMENT message from the MS
on the reserved block resources, it indicates that the downlink GPRS
TBF establishment is successful. Figure 2 shows the procedure of downlink
GPRS TBF establishment on the PACCH. Each time the BSC receives a
PACKET CONTROL ACKNOWLEDGEMENT message as a response to the PACKET
DOWNLINK ASSIGNMENT (see measurement point A), the counter is incremented
by one.</p>
