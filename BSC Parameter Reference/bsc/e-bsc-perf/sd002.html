 </div>

<div class="section"><h4 class="sectiontitle">Description</h4>  <p>For the 3012 series base stations, this measurement provides the number of control-plane packets received over the HDLC paths between the TMU and the PTU, and the HDLC paths between the PTU and the PEU. The control-plane
packets described here are received from the TMU or from the BSC. For the NG series base stations, this measurement provides the number of control-plane packets received over the HDLC paths between PTUs, and the HDLC paths between the PTU and the PEU.
The control-plane packets described here are received from the transmission interface board or from the BSC.</p>
 </div>

<div class="section"><h4 class="sectiontitle">Unit</h4>  <p>Integer number or integer.</p>

<div class="section"><h4 class="sectiontitle">Measurement Point</h4>  <p>For the 3012 series base stations, the PTU measures the control-plane packets received over the HDLC paths between the TMU and the PTU, and the HDLC paths between the PTU and the PEU. For the NG series base
stations, the transmission interface board measures the control-plane packets received over the HDLC paths between PTUs, and the HDLC paths between the PTU and the PEU. The BTS periodically reports the result, and the BTSM disassembles the packets and
processes the measurement results. </p>
