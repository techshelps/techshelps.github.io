<div>
<div class="section"><h4 class="sectiontitle">Measurement Counter</h4>  <p>CM330B:CELL_TRAF_CH_STATIC_STATE_CALL_DROPS_OLCELL</p>
 </div>

<div class="section"><h4 class="sectiontitle">Description</h4>  <p>This measurement provides the number of abnormal call releases due to various reasons after the MS seizes the TCH on the TRX in the overlaid subcell.</p>
 </div>

<div class="section"><h4 class="sectiontitle">Unit</h4>  <p>Integer number or integer.</p>
 

</div>

<div class="section"><h4 class="sectiontitle">Measurement Point</h4>  <p>When a TCH on the TRX in the overlaid subcell is seized during a call, this counter is measured in the following situations:</p>
 <p>1. The BSC receives an ERROR INDICATION message from the BTS because of
the abnormal connection on the radio link layer. For details, refer to GSM Rec. 08.58.</p>
 <p>2. The BSC receives a CONNECTION FAILURE INDICATION message from the BTS because of link fault or hardware fault on the radio link layer. For details, refer
to GSM Rec. 08.58.</p>
 <p>3. When receiving a DISC frame on a link layer connection in multi-frame mode, the BTS sends a REL IND message to BSC. For details, refer to GSM Rec. 08.58.</p>
 <p>4. The timer set to wait for an HO CMP message expires during
internal intra-cell handover.</p>
 <p>5. The timer set to wait for an HO CMP message expires during outgoing internal inter-cell handover.</p>
 <p>6. The timer set to wait for an HO CMP message expires during outgoing external inter-cell handover.</p>
 <p>7. The timer set to wait for an HO CMP message expires during incoming external inter-cell handover.</p>
 <p>8. The BSC does not receive any measurement report within a certain period (by default, five minutes) and then sends a CLEAR COMMAND message
to the MSC to release the call.</p>
 <p>9. The BSC detects a broken RSL and releases all the calls on the RSL.</p>
 <p>10. A call drop occurs in any of the following situations: TRX mutual aid; dynamic modification of cell attributes, TRX frequencies,
or TRX FH data; dynamic deletion of cells or TRXs; blocking of cells, TRXs, or channels.</p>
 <p>11. The timer set to wait for the outgoing BSC handover command expires, or the clear request message is received from the MSC before the timer expires.</p>
 <p>12. A call drop occurs because of call assignment failure during the handover.</p>
 <p>13. When the MSC cannot send a short message because of the restriction on sending downlink short messages in data configuration or because of flow control,
this counter is incremented by one and the call is released.</p>
 <p>14. A call drop occurs because of software error.</p>
 <p>15. The call is released because of the inconsistency in the check for the internal resources of the BSC.</p>
 <p>This counter
is calculated at A1, A2, A3, and A4, as shown in <a href="#bsc-cell_traf_ch_static_state_call_drops_olcell__fig2">Figure 1</a>, <a href="#bsc-cell_traf_ch_static_state_call_drops_olcell__fig3">Figure 2</a>, <a href="#bsc-cell_traf_ch_static_state_call_drops_olcell__fig4">Figure 3</a>, and <a href="#bsc-cell_traf_ch_static_state_call_drops_olcell__fig5">Figure 4</a>.</p>
