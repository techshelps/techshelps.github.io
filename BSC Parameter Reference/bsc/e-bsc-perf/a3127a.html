<div class="section"><h4 class="sectiontitle">Description</h4>  <p>Upon receipt of an ASS REQ message, the BSC assigns a channel based on the channel type specified in the ASS REQ message and then sends a CHAN ACT message to the BTS. If the BSC receives a CHAN ACT ACK message
from the BTS, the BSC considers that the channel is successfully activated. At the same time, the BSC connects the internal circuit based on the A interface CIC specified in the ASS REQ message. Then the BSC sends an ASS CMD message to the MS and waits
for the MS to access the specified channel. The ASS CMD message carries the information on the ready channel, such as channel type, channel number, and frequency hopping information. The MS attempts to access the specified channel based on the channel
number specified in the ASS CMD message. After successfully accessing the channel, the MS reports an ASS CMP message. Upon receipt of the ASS CMP message, the BSC sends an ASS CMP message to the MSC.</p>
 <p>If the current cell does not have available
channels and its directed retry switch is on, the BSC selects a proper adjacent cell based on the measurement report from the MS to trigger an outgoing internal inter-cell handover with the destination channel type being the traffic channel. If the handover
is successful, the BSC sends an ASS CMP message to the MSC.</p>
 <p>Suppose the MS already seizes a TCH for the signaling service in the immediate assignment procedure. When receiving an ASS REQ message, the BSC determines whether the channel mode specified
in the ASS REQ message can be obtained from the channel that the MS currently seizes. If the channel mode specified in the ASS REQ message can be obtained from the channel that the MS currently seizes, the BSC enters the Mode Modify procedure and sends
a MODE MODIFY message to the BTS to instruct the BTS to modify the channel mode. If the BSC receives a MODE MODIFY ACK message indicating that the BTS channel mode is successfully modified from the BTS, the BSC sends a CHAN MODE MODIFY message to the
MS. After successfully modifying the channel mode, the MS reports a CHAN MODE MODIFY ACK message to the BSC. Upon receipt of the CHAN MODE MODIFY ACK message, the BSC sends an ASS CMP message to the MSC.</p>
 <p>When receiving an ASS CMD or HO CMD message,
the MS attempts to access the new channel. If the MS fails to access the new channel, the MS reconnects to the old channel. If the BSC receives an ASS FAIL or RR STATUS message from the MS, the BSC considers that the MS has successfully reconnected to
the old channel and then decides whether to retry the air interface assignment procedure based on the data configuration. The maximum retry times are decided by the data configuration. The procedure that takes place at each retry is the same as the procedure
described above. When the maximum retry times are reached, the MS reconnects to the old channel and the BSC sends an ASS FAIL message to the MSC.</p>
 <div class="p">An assignment failure can be caused by the following conditions:<ul><li>State machine and ASS REQ <ul><li>The current call state machine of the BSC should not receive an ASS REQ message. </li><li>The ASS REQ message cannot be interpreted. </li><li>The A interface CIC carried in the ASS REQ message is unavailable. </li><li>The A interface CIC carried in the ASS REQ message is occupied by another call.</li></ul>
</li><li>Resource allocation<ul><li>No traffic channel is available.</li><li> No Abis resource is available.</li><li> The requested speech version is unavailable.</li><li> The terrestrial resource fails to be obtained.</li></ul>
</li><li>Air interface access<ul><li>The MS fails to access the new channel and then reconnects to the old channel. </li><li>The timer for the BSC to wait for an ASS CMP message expires.</li></ul>
</li><li>Exceptions<ul><li>The A interface is faulty. </li><li>The MSC clears the call.</li></ul>
