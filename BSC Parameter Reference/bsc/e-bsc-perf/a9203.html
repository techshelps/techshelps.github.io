<div class="section"><h4 class="sectiontitle">Measurement Counter</h4><p>A9203: UP_EGPRS_TBF_ESTB_FAIL_NO_CHAN_RES</p>
 </div>

<div class="section"><h4 class="sectiontitle">Description</h4> <p>This measurement provides the number of failed uplink EGPRS TBF establishments due to no channel in a granularity period. A high measurement value is yielded because radio channels of the cell are insufficient or faulty. Together with Number of Uplink EGPRS TBF Establishment Attempts and Number of Uplink EGPRS TBF Abnormal Releases due to No Channel, this measurement indicates the congestion of the uplink GPRS TBF due to no channel in a granularity period.</p>

<div class="section"><h4 class="sectiontitle">Measurement Point</h4> <div class="p">The uplink EGPRS TBF establishment failures due to no channel involve the following aspects:  <ul><li><p>Failed uplink EGPRS TBF establishment using one phase access due to no channel</p>
<p>When receiving a CHANNEL REQUEST message, the BSC sends an IMMEDIATE REJECT message on the CCCH to reject the access request from the MS if the uplink EGPRS TBF cannot be established because no PDCH is available. Figure 1 shows the procedure in which the BSC rejects the access request from the MS. Each time the BSC sends an IMMEDIATE REJECT message (see measurement point A), the counter is incremented by one.</p>

</div>
</li><li><p>Failed uplink EGPRS TBF establishment using single block access due to no channel</p>
<p>During the single lock access procedure or when the MS requests the change of radio resource configuration, the BSC receives the PACKET RESOURCE REQUEST message from the MS. This message requests the establishment or re-establishment of the uplink EGPRS TBF. If the uplink EGPRS TBF cannot be established because no PDCH is available, the BSC sends a PACKET ACCESS REJECT message on the PACCH to reject the access request from the MS. Figure 2 shows the procedure in which the BSC rejects the uplink resource request from the MS. Each time the BSC sends a PACKET ACCESS REJECT message (see measurement point A), the counter is incremented by one.</p>

</div>
</li><li><p>Failed uplink EGPRS TBF establishment on the PACCH due to no channel</p>
<p>When the BSC receives the PACKET DOWNLINK ACK/NACK message with the CHANNEL REQUEST information element from the MS, the BSC sends a PACKET ACCESS REJECT message on the PACCH to reject the access request from the MS if the uplink EGPRS TBF cannot be established because no packet channel is available. Figure 3 shows the procedure in which the BSC rejects the uplink packet channel request form the MS. Each time the BSC sends a PACKET ACCESS REJECT message (see measurement point A), the counter is incremented by one.</p>
