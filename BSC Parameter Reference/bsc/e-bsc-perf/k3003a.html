<div class="section"><h4 class="sectiontitle">Measurement Counter</h4>  <p>K3003A:CELL_SD_SUCC_CALL</p>
 </div>

<div class="section"><h4 class="sectiontitle">Description</h4>  <p>In an SDCCH immediate assignment procedure, the BTS sends a CHANNEL ACTIVATION ACKNOWLEDGE message to the BSC. After receiving this message, the BSC regards that the MS successfully seizes the SDCCH. In an SDCCH
handover procedure, the BTS sends a HANDOVER DETECTION message to the target cell. After receiving this message, the BSC regards that the MS successfully seizes the SDCCH.</p>
 <p>This measurement provides the number of successful SDCCH seizures in
the preceding two situations with the call type as MOC, MTC, call re-establishment, or emergency call.</p>
 </div>

<div class="section"><h4 class="sectiontitle">Unit</h4>  <p>Integer number or integer.</p>
 

</div>

<div class="section"><h4 class="sectiontitle">Measurement Point</h4>  <p>When an SDCCH is seized during a call, and the call type is MOC, MTC, emergency call, or call re-establishment, this counter is measured in the following situations:</p>
 <p>1. In the SDCCH immediate assignment
procedure, this counter is incremented by one when the BSC receives a CHANNEL ACTIVATION ACKNOWLEDGE message from the BTS.</p>
 <p>2. In the internal intra-cell SDCCH handover procedure, this counter is incremented by one when the BSC receives a HANDOVER
DETECTION message from the BTS controlling the target cell.</p>
 <p>3. In the incoming internal inter-cell SDCCH handover procedure, this counter is incremented by one when the BSC receives a HANDOVER DETECTION message from the BTS.</p>
 <p>4. In the
incoming external inter-cell SDCCH handover procedure, this counter is incremented by one when the BSC receives a HANDOVER DETECTION message from the BTS.</p>
 <p>This counter is calculated at A10, as shown in <a href="#bsc-cell_sd_succ_call__fig1">Figure 1</a>, <a href="#bsc-cell_sd_succ_call__fig3">Figure 2</a>, and <a href="#bsc-cell_sd_succ_call__fig5">Figure 3</a>.</p>
