 </div>

<div class="section"><h4 class="sectiontitle">Description</h4>  <p>This measurement indicates the usage of radio resources when an MS performs GPRS services. It is a major factor for determining whether the radio resources of the GPRS network are sufficient. The packet service
transmission with low data flow such as attach, RAU, and reverse messages (control message, acknowledgment message, and response message) may result in the failure of the network to allocate radio resources to multi-slot capable MSs even through the
network has sufficient radio resources. Such low data flow services are performed frequently, and may lead to a lower value of this counter than in actual situations. As a result, it is difficult to determine whether the radio resources of the GPRS network
are sufficient. The factors that affect the measurement of this counter must be eliminated, and you can measure the counter based on the service types (uplink preferred, downlink preferred, and normal mode). The principles are as follows: For the MSs
that perform uplink-preferred services, only the number of actually used PDCHs on the uplink is measured; for the MSs that perform downlink-preferred services, only the number of actually used PDCHs on the downlink is measured; for the MSs that perform
normal mode services, no measurement is performed.</p>

<div class="section"><h4 class="sectiontitle">Measurement Point</h4>  <div class="p">In a granularity period, when the sampling moment comes, the scanning is triggered, and all the uplink TBFs of the channels in a cell are scanned. Every time the GPRS uplink-preferred service is detected
on a channel, the number of TBFs associated with the GPRS uplink-preferred service on this channel is incremented by one. The number of TBFs associated with the GPRS uplink-preferred service in the cell is also incremented. After all the uplink TBFs
on this channel are scanned, the ratio of the number of TBFs associated with the GPRS uplink-preferred service on this channel to the number of subscribers multiplexed on the uplink of this channel is calculated. This value is incremented within the
cell, and the total is then divided by the number of TBFs associated with the GPRS uplink-preferred service in the cell. In this way, the Number of Actually Used Uplink PDCHs per GPRS User (Original) is obtained.<div class="note"><img src="../../public_sys-resources/icon-note.gif"><span class="notetitle"> NOTE: </span><div class="notebody"><p>To improve the accuracy,
this counter is multiplied by 100 times during measurement.</p>
