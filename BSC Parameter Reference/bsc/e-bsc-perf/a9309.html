<div class="section"><h4 class="sectiontitle">Measurement Counter</h4><p>A9309: DOWN_EGPRS_TBF_ABNORM_REL_NO_CHAN_RES</p>
 </div>

<div class="section"><h4 class="sectiontitle">Description</h4> <p>This measurement provides the number of downlink EGPRS TBF abnormal releases due to no channel in a granularity period. A high measurement value is yielded because the channel malfunction is frequent, the channel is blocked manually, the dynamic PDCHs in use are occupied by the CS services, or the cell is blocked manually. Refer to the related information such as device alarms to locate the cause. Together with Number of Failed Downlink EGPRS TBF Establishments due to No Channel and Number of Downlink EGPRS TBF Establishment Attempts, this measurement indicates the congestion of the downlink EGPRS TBF due to no channel in a granularity period. If an EGPRS TBF congestion rate higher than 10% is mainly caused by the downlink EGPRS TBF abnormal releases due to no channel, the downlink traffic volume may exceed the system capacity or the CS traffic that preempts the dynamic channels is heavy. Check whether no packet resource is caused by equipment resetting or manual channel blocking. To guarantee stable PS services in the cell with heavy CS traffic, add fixed channels. The addition of fixed channel may affect the coverage of EGPRS services, and thus it should be planned considering the whole situation.</p>

<div class="section"><h4 class="sectiontitle">Unit</h4> <p>Integer number or integer.</p>
 

</div>

<div class="section"><h4 class="sectiontitle">Measurement Point</h4> <p>If a PDCH is occupied by the BSC for CS services with a higher priority, or the PDCH is unavailable, then the BSC releases the PDCH irrespective of the MS status. The downlink EGPRS TBF that uses the PDCH as the control channel is also released.</p>
