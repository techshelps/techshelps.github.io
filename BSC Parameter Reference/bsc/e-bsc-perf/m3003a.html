<div class="section"><h4 class="sectiontitle">Description</h4>  <p>After the MS seizes a channel, if a call is released because of Abis Terrestrial Link Failure, No MRs from MS for a Long Time, Equipment Failure, or Forced Handover Failure, this measurement provides the number
of call drops on the SDCCH on the basis of the call type (MOC, MTC, Call Re-establishment, Emergency Call, or Non-Call).</p>
 </div>

<div class="section"><h4 class="sectiontitle">Unit</h4>  <p>Integer number or integer.</p>
 

</div>

<div class="section"><h4 class="sectiontitle">Measurement Point</h4> <p>The counter of a certain call type is incremented by one in the following situations:</p>
 <p>1. The BSC does not receive a measurement report within a certain period (by default, five minutes), and then
the BSC sends a CLEAR COMMAND message to the MSC to release the call.</p>
 <p>2. The BSC detects a broken RSL and releases all the calls on the RSL.</p>
 <p>3. A call drop occurs because of any of the following: TRX mutual aid; dynamic modification of
cell attributes, TRX frequencies, or TRX FH data; dynamic deletion of cells or TRXs; blocking of cells, TRXs, or channels.</p>
 <p>4. The timer set to wait for the outgoing BSC handover command expires, or the clear request message is received from
the MSC before the timer expires.</p>
 <p>5. A call drop occurs because of call assignment failure during the handover.</p>
 <p>6. The MSC cannot send a short message because of the restriction on sending downlink short messages in data configuration
or because of flow control, and then the call is released.</p>
 <p>7. A call drop occurs because of software error.</p>
 <p>8. A call drop occurs during the emergency handover due to PDCH assignment, or ‚Äèthe handover due to TRX mutual aid, preemption,
or blocking of cells, TRXs, and channels.</p>
 <p>The specific counter is measured at A4, as shown in <a href="#bsc-cell_call_drops_other_cause_origin_call_sd__fig1">Figure 1</a>, <a href="#bsc-cell_call_drops_other_cause_origin_call_sd__fig2">Figure 2</a>, <a href="#bsc-cell_call_drops_other_cause_origin_call_sd__fig3">Figure 3</a>, <a href="#bsc-cell_call_drops_other_cause_origin_call_sd__fig4">Figure 4</a>, and <a href="#bsc-cell_call_drops_other_cause_origin_call_sd__fig5">Figure 5</a>.</p>
