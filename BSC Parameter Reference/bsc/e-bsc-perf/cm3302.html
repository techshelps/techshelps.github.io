<div class="section"><h4 class="sectiontitle">Measurement Counter</h4>  <p>CM3302: CELL_TRAF_CH_STATIC_STATE_CALL_DROPS_REL_IND</p>
 </div>

<div class="section"><h4 class="sectiontitle">Description</h4>  <p>After the MS seizes a channel, the BTS sends the BSC a REL IND message, indicating that call drops occur on the Um interface because of the abnormal connection at the radio link layer.</p>
 <p>This measurement
provides the number of times that the BSC receives a REL IND message on the traffic channel for releasing a call. During a call, if an ERR IND or CONN FAIL IND message is received after a REL IND message, this counter is measured only once.</p>
 </div>

<div class="section"><h4 class="sectiontitle">Unit</h4>  <p>Integer number or integer.</p>
 

</div>

<div class="section"><h4 class="sectiontitle">Measurement Point</h4>  <p>When a TCH is seized to carry traffic during a call, this counter is incremented by one if the BSC receives a REL IND message.</p>
 <p>This counter is calculated at A3, as shown in <a href="#bsc-cell_traf_ch_static_state_call_drops_rel_ind__fig2">Figure 1</a>, <a href="#bsc-cell_traf_ch_static_state_call_drops_rel_ind__fig3">Figure 2</a>, <a href="#bsc-cell_traf_ch_static_state_call_drops_rel_ind__fig4">Figure 3</a>, and <a href="#bsc-cell_traf_ch_static_state_call_drops_rel_ind__fig5">Figure 4</a>.</p>
