<div class="section"><h4 class="sectiontitle">Measurement Counter</h4><p>A9216: UP_EGPRS_TBF_ESTB_FAIL_OTHER_CAUSE</p>
 </div>

<div class="section"><h4 class="sectiontitle">Description</h4> <p>This measurement provides the number of failed uplink EGPRS TBF establishments due to other causes in a granularity period. A high measurement value is yielded because the channel assignment exception or failure occurs in the cell, or the uplink EGPRS TBFs on the PDCHs reach the limit.</p>
 </div>

<div class="section"><h4 class="sectiontitle">Unit</h4> <p>Integer number or integer.</p>
 

</div>

<div class="section"><h4 class="sectiontitle">Measurement Point</h4> <div class="p">The uplink EGPRS TBF establishment failures due to other causes involve the following aspects:<ul><li><p>Failed uplink EGPRS TBF establishment using one phase access due to other causes</p>
<p>When receiving the CHANNEL REQUEST message, the BSC sends an IMMEDIATE REJECT message on the CCCH to reject the access request from the MS if the uplink EGPRS TBF cannot be established due to abnormal or failed resource allocation or flow control. If the uplink EGPRS TBF cannot be established because the BSC detects overload protection on the board, the BSC does not send the channel assignment message.  Figure 1 shows the procedure in which the BSC rejects the channel request from the MS. Each time the BSC sends an IMMEDIATE REJECT message (see measurement point A), the counter is incremented by one.</p>

</div>
</li><li><p>Failed uplink EGPRS TBF establishment using single block access due to other causes</p>
<p> During the single block access procedure or when the MS requests the change of radio resource configuration, the BSC receives the PACKET RESOURCE REQUEST message from the MS. This message requests the establishment or re-establishment of the uplink EGPRS TBF. If the uplink EGPRS TBF establishment fails due to abnormal or failed resource allocation or flow control, the BSC sends a PACKET ACCESS REJECT message on the PACCH to reject the access request from the MS. Figure 2 shows the procedure in which the BSC rejects the uplink resource request from the MS. Each time the BSC sends a PACKET ACCESS REJECT message (see measurement point A), the counter is incremented by one.</p>

</div>
</li><li><p>Failed uplink EGPRS TBF establishment on the PACCH due to other causes</p>
<p> When receiving the CHANNEL REQUEST information element in the PACKET DOWNLINK ACK/NACK from the MS, the BSC sends a PACKET ACCESS REJECT message on the PACCH to reject the access request from the MS if the uplink EGPRS TBF cannot be established due to abnormal or failed resource allocation or flow control. Figure 3 shows the procedure in which the BSC rejects the uplink packet channel request form the MS. Each time the BSC sends a PACKET ACCESS REJECT message (see measurement point A), the counter is incremented by one.</p>
