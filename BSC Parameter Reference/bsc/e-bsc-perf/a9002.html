<div class="section"><h4 class="sectiontitle">Measurement Counter</h4><p>A9002:UP_GPRS_TBF_ESTABLISH_SUCC</p>
 </div>

<div class="section"><h4 class="sectiontitle">Description</h4> <p>This measurement provides the number of successful uplink GPRS TBF establishments in a granularity period. A low measurement value indicates that the radio environment, network parameter configuration, network resource configuration, or network equipment is not satisfactory, and thus requires optimization. Further analysis should be made based on the causes of GPRS TBF abnormal release. Together with Number of Uplink GPRS TBF Establishment Attempts, this measurement indicates the uplink assignment success rate in a granularity period. Together with Number of Uplink GPRS TBF Abnormal Releases due to N3101 Overflow (MS No Response), this measurement indicates the call drop rate of the uplink TBF in a granularity period.</p>

<div class="section"><h4 class="sectiontitle">Measurement Point</h4> <div class="p">The successful uplink GPRS TBF establishments involve the following aspects:<ul><li><p>Successful uplink GPRS TBF establishment using one phase access</p>
<p> After sending the IMMEDIATE ASSIGNMENT message, if the BSC receives the uplink blocks on the channel allocated to the MS, it means that the uplink GPRS TBF establishment using one phase access is successful. Figure 1 shows the procedure of uplink GPRS TBF establishment using one phase access. Each time the BSC receives the first uplink block from the MS after sending the IMMEDIATE ASSIGNMENT message (see measurement point C), the counter is incremented by one.</p>

</div>
</li><li><p>Successful uplink GPRS TBF establishment using single block access</p>
<p>After sending the PACKET UPLINK ASSIGNMENT message, if the BSC receives the uplink data blocks on the channel allocated to the MS, it means that the uplink GPRS TBF establishment using single block access is successful. Figure 2 shows the procedure of uplink GPRS TBF establishment using single block access. Each time the BSC receives the first uplink block from the MS after sending the PACKET UPLINK ASSIGNMENT message (see measurement point E), the counter is incremented by one.</p>

<br><span><img src="images/a9403.png"></span><br>
</div>
</li><li><p>Successful uplink GPRS TBF establishment on the PACCH</p>
<p>When the MS initiates an uplink GPRS TBF establishment request on the PACCH, the BSC sends a PACKET UPLINK ASSIGNMENT message to the MS. If the BSC receives the uplink data blocks on the channel assigned to the MS, the uplink GPRS TBF establishment on the PACCH is successful. Figure 3 shows the procedure of uplink GPRS TBF establishment on the PACCH. When the BSC receives the uplink block sent from the MS after sending the PACKET UPLINK ASSIGNMENT message (see measurement point C), the counter is incremented by one.</p>
