<div class="section"><h4 class="sectiontitle">Measurement Counter</h4>  <p>CM362:CELL_SIG_CALL_DROPS_NO_MR</p>
 </div>

<div class="section"><h4 class="sectiontitle">Description</h4>  <p>After seizing the SDCCH, the MS reports a measurement report to the BSC every 470 ms. After seizing the TCH, the MS reports a measurement report to the BSC every 480 ms. If the BSC does not receive a measurement
report within a certain period (five minutes by default), the BSC determines that a call drop occurs on the Um interface.</p>
 <p>This measurement provides the number of call releases by the BSC because the BSC does not receive any measurement report
on the signaling channel within a certain period.</p>
 </div>

<div class="section"><h4 class="sectiontitle">Unit</h4>  <p>Integer number or integer.</p>
 

</div>

<div class="section"><h4 class="sectiontitle">Measurement Point</h4>  <p>When an SDCCH or a TCH is seized to carry signaling during a call, if the BSC does not receive a measurement report within a certain period (by default, five minutes), then the BSC sends a CLEAR COMMAND
message to the MSC to release the call. This counter is measured when the BSC sends a CLEAR COMMAND message to the MSC.‚Äè</p>
 <p>This counter is calculated at A4, as shown in <a href="#bsc-cell_sig_call_drops_no_mr__fig1">Figure 1</a>, <a href="#bsc-cell_sig_call_drops_no_mr__fig2">Figure 2</a>, <a href="#bsc-cell_sig_call_drops_no_mr__fig3">Figure 3</a>, <a href="#bsc-cell_sig_call_drops_no_mr__fig4">Figure 4</a>, and <a href="#bsc-cell_sig_call_drops_no_mr__fig5">Figure 5</a>.</p>
