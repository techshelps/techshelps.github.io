<div class="section"><h4 class="sectiontitle">Measurement Counter</h4>  <p>CM3606:CELL_SIG_CHAN_STATIC_STATE_CALL_TCH_DROP_TIMES</p>
 </div>

<div class="section"><h4 class="sectiontitle">Description</h4>  <p>This measurement provides the number of calls released because of the ERR IND, CONN FAIL IND, and REL IND messages received by the BSC.</p>
<p>The MS seizes a signaling channel in any of the following conditions:</p>
<ul><li>1. In the immediate assignment procedure, the BTS sends an EST IND message to the BSC.</li><li>2. The MS sends an HO CMP message to the BSC, and the MS seizures a signaling channel.</li></ul>
 </div>

<div class="section"><h4 class="sectiontitle">Unit</h4>  <p>Integer number or integer.</p>
 

</div>

<div class="section"><h4 class="sectiontitle">Measurement Point</h4>  <p>If the signaling is processed for the call and if a TCH is seized, this counter is measured in any of the following situations:</p>
<ul><li>1. The BSC receives an ERROR INDICATION message from the BTS because of the abnormal connection on the radio link layer. For details, refer to GSM Rec. 08.58.</li><li>2. The BSC receives a CONNECTION FAILURE INDICATION message from the BTS because of link fault or hardware fault on the radio link layer. For details, refer to GSM Rec. 08.58.</li><li>3. When receiving a DISC frame on a link layer connection in multi-frame mode, the BTS sends a REL IND message to BSC. For details, refer to GSM Rec. 08.58.</li></ul>
<p>This counter is calculated at A1, A2, and A3, as shown in <a href="#bsc-cell_sig_static_state_call_drops_conn_fail__fig1">Figure 1</a>.</p>
