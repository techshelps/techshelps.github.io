<div class="section"><h4 class="sectiontitle">Description</h4>  <p>After the MS seizes a channel, the BTS sends the BSC an ERR IND message, indicating that call drops occur on the Um interface because of the abnormal connection at the radio link layer. This measurement provides
the number of call drops on the SDCCH on the basis of the call type (MOC, MTC, Call Re-establishment, Emergency Call, or Non-Call Part).</p>
 </div>

<div class="section"><h4 class="sectiontitle">Unit</h4>  <p>Integer number or integer.</p>
 

</div>

<div class="section"><h4 class="sectiontitle">Measurement Point</h4>  <p>When an SDCCH is seized during a call, the specific counter is incremented by one if the BSC receives an ERR IND message.</p>
 <p>The counter is measured at A1, as shown in <a href="#bsc-cell_call_drops_err_ind_origin_call_sd__fig1">Figure 1</a>, <a href="#bsc-cell_call_drops_err_ind_origin_call_sd__fig2">Figure 2</a>, <a href="#bsc-cell_call_drops_err_ind_origin_call_sd__fig3">Figure 3</a>, <a href="#bsc-cell_call_drops_err_ind_origin_call_sd__fig4">Figure 4</a>, and <a href="#bsc-cell_call_drops_err_ind_origin_call_sd__fig5">Figure 5</a>.</p>
