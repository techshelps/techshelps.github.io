<h1 class="topictitle1">Manual Timeslot Assignment on the Abis Interface</h1>


<div><p>This describes the manual timeslot assignment on the Abis interface. Timeslot assignment on the Abis interface is required when you add BTSs, cells, TRXs, idle timeslots, and monitoring timeslots. By default, the timeslots are assigned automatically. You can also manually assign timeslots on the Abis interface if required.</p>

<p>When manually assigning timeslots on the Abis interface, adhere to the following principles:</p>

<ul><li>The objects that support manual timeslot assignment are OMLs, RSLs, channels, idle timeslots, and monitoring timeslots.</li><li>You can assign timeslots on the Abis interface for multiple objects at a time.</li><li>If you manually assign timeslots on the Abis interface for a cascaded BTS, you must also manually assign the incoming Abis timeslots for all the cascaded BTSs on the link.</li><li>The assigned timeslots must be idle or in Flex mode.</li><li>The multiplexing mode of assigned timeslots must be the same as the multiplexing mode of the BTS. If the BTS uses the 2:1 multiplexing mode, do not multiplex four signaling links together.</li><li>In the incoming E1 and outgoing E1 links of all the cascaded BTSs on a link, all the objects multiplexed onto one 64 kbit/s timeslot must be located in the same 64 kbit/s timeslot and all the relative positions of sub-timeslots must remain unchanged. For example, three objects of a BTS use timeslots 8, 9, and 10 of level 1 BTS and timeslots 4, 5, and 6 of level 2 BTS. When assigning timeslots for another object of the BTS, you should not assign timeslot 11 of level 1 BTS or timeslot 7 of level 2 BTS. You can assign a timeslot of level 1 BTS except for timeslot 11 and a timeslot of level 2 BTS except for timeslot 7.</li><li>When adding BTSs, cells, TRXs, idle timeslots, and monitoring timeslots, you can manually assign timeslots for only the newly added objects. The timeslots of existing objects cannot be manually assigned. If you only manually assign timeslots on the Abis interface without performing other operations, you can assign timeslots for all the objects on the entire link.</li><li>When you change the assignment mode of the timeslots of an object from manual mode to auto mode, the timeslots are released and assigned automatically. When you change the assignment mode of the timeslots of an object from auto mode to manual mode, the Abis timeslots automatically assigned for the object are released.</li><li>You can manually assign the timeslots on the Abis interface for the BTSs on the same link in a topology at a time.</li></ul>
