<div><p>The Gb interface can use the FR protocol or the IP protocol.
For different protocols, the configuration objects and principles
of configuring the Gb interface links are different.</p>

<p>In Gb over FR mode, the NSE, BC, NSVC, and PTPBVC must be configured
on the Gb interface links; in Gb over IP mode, the NSE, local NSVL,
remote NSVL, and PTPBVC must be configured on the Gb interface links. <a href="#ee-1-2479__tab1">Table 1</a> lists these objects.</p>

<p>One or more BCs can be configured
on one E1. Each BC on an E1 is assigned a number to facilitate local

timeslot distribution on both ends must be consistent.</p>

SGSN side have a one-to-one mapping relationship, and their NSVCIs
are the same. NSVCs are divided into different groups at the NS layer.
Each group is identified by an NSEI. The NSVCs in the same group use
the loading sharing mode. If one NSVC is unavailable, the NS switches
the data from this NSVC to another NSVC for transmission. A group
of NSVCs are connected to one SGSN.</p>
<p>In an FR network, an NSVC
is mapped to a PVC. In an IP network, an NSVC is identified by a pair
of IP addresses and UDP ports at both the BSS and the SGSN.</p>

<ul><li>As shown in <a href="#ee-1-2479__fig1">Figure 1</a>, an NSE is represented
by a set of BVCs (a set of cells) at the BSSGP layer, and is represented
by a set of NSVCs at the NS layer. The NS layer provides the BSSGP
layer with data transmission channels. The data transmission channels
of the cells under an NSE are selected from the NSVCs of the NSE to
balance the traffic between NSVCs.</li><li>In Gb over FR mode, you need to configure the NSVCs by specifying
the BC and the NSVC; in Gb over IP mode, you need to configure NSVCs
by specifying the local NSVL and the remote NSVL.</li></ul>

<p>The principles of configuring the Gb interface links are as follows:</p>

<ul><li>One BSC can be connected to multiple SGSNs.</li><li>One BSC can be configured with multiple NSEs.</li><li>The NSE applies to the entire BSC instead of a single subrack.</li><li>Two NSEs with the same NSEI on the BSC and on the SGSN are uniquely
mapped to each other. Each PTPBVC and NSVC that belong to the same
NSE on the BSC are uniquely mapped to a PTPBVC and an NSVC that belong
to the mapping NSE on the SGSN respectively.</li><li>When the SGSN pool function is disabled, a cell is configured
with a PTPBVC, and the PTPBVC belongs to a specific NSE.</li><li>When the SGSN pool function is enabled, a cell is mapped to multiple
PTPBVCs, and these PTPBVCs must belong to different NSEs.</li><li>In the case of direct point-to-point connections between the BSC
and the SGSN, Huawei recommends that multiple timeslots on the E1
be bound to form a BC.</li><li>The number of NSVCs that can be configured on one BC is not strictly
limited. Huawei recommends that one BC be configured with one NSVC.</li><li>The NSVCI configured on the BSC side must be consistent with the
NSVCI configured on the SGSN side.</li></ul>
