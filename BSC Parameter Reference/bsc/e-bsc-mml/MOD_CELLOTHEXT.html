<p>Explanation: This parameter specifies whether to support DRX. To reduce the power consumption, the discontinuous reception mechanism (DRX) is introduced to the GSM. The MS that supports the DRX consumes less power to receive broadcast messages that the MSs are interested in. This prolongs the service time of the MS battery.</p>
<p>The BSC that supports the DRX should send the dispatching message to MSs so that the MSs can use the DRX function. The period occupied by broadcast short messages that are contained in a dispatching message is called a dispatching period. The description and position of the broadcast short message are contained in the dispatching message in the sending sequence.
