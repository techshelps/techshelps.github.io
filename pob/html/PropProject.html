            In other words, Level is the number of mouse clicks on Web links
            necessary to get from the starting page to the last page desired.
            The usual value of the Level is 0 through 3. Setting the Level to
            higher values may cause too many Web pages to be loaded. If you
            want to download a complete Web server, uncheck the Level checkbox

            servers and files support file modification check. For example,
            CGI-BIN and ASP applications, database access scripts, etc. This
            method is best for updating downloaded Web sites
            frequently.</p></li></ul></div><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="circle"><li><p>Check file size</p><p>When downloading the Project, Portable Offline Browser will check every

            such cases you may want to check file modifications by file size
            also. If the file size has not changed since the previous
            download, Portable Offline Browser considers the file to be the same. In rare cases
            it might be possible that updated file will have the same size.
            So, please, use this feature with caution.</p></li></ul></div><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="circle"><li><p>Skip existing Media files</p><p>It is very common that images on Web sites change very

            sites. Instead, every already downloaded file will be kept and
            even updated copies will be not downloaded. This is the best way

            specified Levels and pages will be downloaded only if they are
            missing on your local hard disk. For example, most news sites have
            an index page with links to news articles and many articles pages.
            These articles are never updated, they are just added or deleted
            often. In this case setting "<span class="bold"><strong>Skip existing
            files on levels higher than 0</strong></span>" will mean that the first
            page (on Level 0) will be checked and downloaded if it was
            modified, and then Portable Offline Browser will download only missing news
            articles. All previously loaded news pages will be neither checked
            for modifications nor downloaded again.</p></li></ul></div></li></ul></div><p><span class="bold"><strong>Tips</strong></span>: to expand the URLs field,
