    Export button on the Ribbon - Home tab. This feature allows copying of downloaded files
    from one or several Projects.</p><p></p><p>When exporting loaded sites Portable Offline Browser will change links in HTML, Flash or
    Java script files according to the new filenames. You may use the
    following settings to fine-tune the Export process:</p><p></p><p>The list on the left allows you to copy
    exported files to the specified directory or to compress them to a ZIP,
    MHT archive, EXE viewer, compressed HTML Help (.CHM) file or upload to
    an FTP server.</p><p></p><p>MHT archives use no compression, but they keep all exported sites in
    a single file. Besides, they could be directly browsed using MS Internet
    Explorer.</p><p>HTML Help has benefits of MHT files plus, it occupies much less disk
    space because of the compression.</p><p>However both MHT and HTML Help files can be browsed only on systems
    with MS Internet Explorer 5.0 or higher installed.</p><p></p><p>If you select <span class="bold"><strong>MS Internet Explorer
    cache</strong></span>, Portable Offline Browser will send exported files to the Internet
    Explorer cache and they will be accessible in "Work offline" mode.</p><p></p><p><span class="bold"><strong>Do not create subdirectories</strong></span> -
    place all files in the single directory. Files with same names will be
    renamed to avoid filename conflicts. </p><p></p><p>If you check <span class="bold"><strong>Make Autorun CD</strong></span>
    option, Portable Offline Browser will also create <span class="bold"><strong>autorun.inf
    </strong></span>and <span class="bold"><strong>oe_open.exe</strong></span> files. All
    three files, when placed on the root CD directory, make the CD auto
    running - if you place the disk into the CD-ROM drive, the contents.htm
    file will be opened automatically in the browser.</p><p></p><p><span class="bold"><strong>Export recently loaded files only </strong></span>-
    copy only the files that were downloaded or updated during the last
    download session only. If some previously downloaded files were not
    updated, they will be skipped. Uncheck the box to export all files that
    belong to the Project.</p><p><span class="bold"><strong>Filenames format</strong></span> - you can choose
    one of three possible formats:</p><p><span class="bold"><strong>Keep as - is </strong></span>copy files with their
    original filenames, which is fine if you want to export a Project to
    another directory.</p><p></p><p><span class="bold"><strong>8+3 - MS-DOS compatible </strong></span>this option
    is useful when exporting Projects to Windows 3.11, floppy disks, Novell
    network drives or other older file systems. Portable Offline Browser will change all
    filenames so that they will use no more than 8 symbols for the filename
    part and 3 symbols for the extension.</p><p></p><p><span class="bold"><strong>Joliet - CD-R 64 symbols</strong></span> great for
    publishing on CD-ROM disks, because they require that every filename
    consist of no more than 64 symbols.</p><p></p><p><span class="bold"><strong>Use standard extensions for files with known
    file types</strong></span> - many Web sites contain standard files with
    non-standard extensions. For example, HTML files normally use <span class="bold"><strong>.htm</strong></span> or <span class="bold"><strong>.html
    </strong></span>extensions. However there are many cases when CGI-BIN scripts,
    ASP pages, Lotus Domino sites and many others return HTML formatted
    contents under non-standard filenames. Extensions could be completely
    different, such as .shtml, .nsf, or .asp. Many files may contain no
    extension at all.</p><p></p><p>Normal Web browsers determine the content type of a file using its
    extension. Thus a file with a non-standard extension will be used as
    unknown, and when offline browsing without running Portable Offline Browser, browsers may
    simply offer to save a file to disk instead of displaying it.</p><p></p><p>To overcome this problem, Portable Offline Browser will add standard extensions like
    <span class="bold"><strong>.htm, .gif, .jpg, .js</strong></span> and others to the
    copied files depending on their actual type.</p><p></p><p><span class="bold"><strong>Disable popup links</strong></span> changes all popups to open in
    the same browser window. It is recommended to check this setting when you export to HTML Help.</p><p>When a Project is exported, Portable Offline Browser will create a file, named
    <span class="bold"><strong>contents.htm</strong></span> in the directory with
    exported sites. This file contains links to the exported Projects. </p><p><span class="bold"><strong>Preserve online links</strong></span> - if any
    downloaded HTML file has links pointing online, they will be kept as-is
    and not translated offline.</p><p></p><p><span class="bold"><strong>Add original URL to HTML files</strong></span> -
    add online URL of every exported Web page as a comment to the page
    contents. Besides, it helps to solve compatibility problems when browsing
    exported files under Windows XP Service Pack 2 or later.</p><p></p><p><span class="bold"><strong>Faster Export </strong></span>improves file parsing
    speed during the export. However some links may work improperly,
    especially when you use <a href="OptionsDirectory.html" title="Options dialog: Advanced - File Locations">Prevent
    directories from overloading</a> (in the Options dialog). It also skips
    resolving moved links and links in .ram files.</p><p><span class="bold"><strong>Open file when export completes</strong></span> automatically
    starts the exported file when you export to a directory, ZIP, MHT, EXE or CHM file.</p><p></p><p><span class="bold"><strong>FTP upload</strong></span></p><p>It requires you to specify the server.
    You may also type the directory to upload to: ftp://ftp.site.com/path/. If the server port is not 21, specify it this way:
    ftp://ftp.site.com:8021/</p><p>Username/password might be also required.</p><p>FTP upload will export to a local directory on your hard disk. It uses other export settings, like filenames format,
    standard extensions, etc. When export completes, it starts an upload utility that sends the files in the exported directory
    to the server. You may also want to <span class="bold"><strong>delete exported files</strong></span> from the local directory when
    upload completes. This doesn't influence the remote server.</p><p></p><p>It is also
    possible to export
    Projects <a href="AutoExport.html" title="How to export or print Project automatically after
    downloading?">automatically</a> once they are
    downloaded.</p><p><span class="bold"><strong>Troubleshooting</strong></span></p><p>If you experience problems with the export, such as not files were
    exported as you expected, please check the Project Map - whether it lists
    all of the files or not. Export works only with the files listed in the
    Project Map.</p><p></p><p>If the Map is incomplete or missing and downloaded Project files are
    on your disk, please select the Project and press Ctrl + F5 on your
    keyboard. This will start downloading the Project in the "Do not load
    existing files mode". Portable Offline Browser will go through all downloaded files and add
    them to the Project Map. If there are some missing files, they will be
    downloaded.</p></div></body></html>
