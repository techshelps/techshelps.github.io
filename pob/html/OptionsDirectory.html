    Directory.</p><p>All files are stored under their original names and grouped by Web
    site, so the download directory structure is kept as close as possible to
    the original Internet structure.</p><p>You can either type the desired directory name in the edit box or
    select it from the directory tree.</p><p>It is not necessary that the download directory should exist before
    downloading. Portable Offline Browser will create all required directories itself. Just
    make sure that the disk with download directory is not read-only.</p><p>You can also specify a different download directory in a <a href="FolderProp.html" title="Folder Properties dialog">Folder Properties</a> dialog. All Projects in the
    folder will use its own download directory instead of the global one (in
    the Options dialog).</p><p>The download directory name should be fully-qualified. For
    example:</p><p>c:\download\</p><p><span class="bold"><strong>Disk Space</strong></span></p><p>Please make sure that the disk where the download directory resides
    has enough space to store your downloads. You can check the available
    space on a disk drive here. If free disk space amount falls below the
    specified limit, Portable Offline Browser stops any download activity automatically.</p><p><span class="bold"><strong>Maintenance</strong></span></p><p>After removing a Project, you can choose whether you want to keep
    files and sites it downloaded or not. If you keep these files, you can't
    remove them automatically, unless you use the Clean button. The Clean
    procedure is absolutely safe and you can cancel it at any step.</p><p>When you click the Clean button, Portable Offline Browser determines which files in
    all download directories belong to Projects and which not. The latter ones
    are called "unused files". When the list of unused files is prepared, you
    will see them all in a window. You will be able to select and remove some
    of them, remove all unused files or cancel the operation.</p><p> Portable Offline Browser also contains the "Prevent download directories from
    overloading" checkbox. When checked, Portable Offline Browser will not create more than
    1000 files per directory. Instead, it will create subfolders with names
    that begin with<span class="bold"><strong> %&amp;ovr </strong></span>and place extra
    files there. This may result in slower but more stable work on huge Web
    sites.</p><p><span class="bold"><strong>Projects, templates and maps
    directory</strong></span></p><p>You can specify an alternative place to keep Projects file
    (webdown.dat), Templates (template.dat) and Project Maps (*.map). This may
    be useful in a multi-user environment or on a removable disk, etc. You
    need to restart Portable Offline Browser in order the change to take effect.</p><p></p><p><span class="bold"><strong>Prevent download directories from
