    offline browsing. If you don't want to spend time adjusting Project
    settings to download only the desired files, you can use the AutoSave
    feature.</p><p>Here is a simple step-by-step process:</p><p><span class="bold"><strong>Step 1.</strong></span> Click the <span class="bold"><strong>New...</strong></span> button on toolbar to create a new Project.
    Portable Offline Browser opens a new Project Properties dialog. Type the URL of the page or
    the site where you want to start browsing in the URLs field. Click OK
    button to save the Project.</p><p><span class="bold"><strong>Step 2.</strong></span> Click the AutoSave button
    (<span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="AutoSave.GIF"></span>) on the Internal browser toolbar. The button will
    stay pressed down.</p><p><span class="bold"><strong>Step 3.</strong></span> Click the Browse button on
    the Ribbon - Home tab to start browsing the Project. Although the Project was not yet
    downloaded, Portable Offline Browser will show the Web page offline. All missing files will
    be automatically downloaded and added to the selected Project. You can
    visit other pages on this Web site or others and they all will be
    downloaded the same way. When you have finished downloading all pages you
    want, click the AutoSave button again to stop the downloading
    process.</p><p></p><p>You can also use the AutoSave mode when you have downloaded a Web
    site, but you forgot several pages or files and you want them to be added
    to the Project without adjusting its settings and redownloading.</p><p>Also, some Web pages may include very complex scripts, animations,
    etc. If Portable Offline Browser was unable to extract and download some links correctly,
    browsing the site offline with the AutoSave mode will correct the
    situation.</p><p></p></div></body></html>
