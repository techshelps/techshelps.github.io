    order in which your Projects are <a href="Scheduling.html" title="Scheduling Project Downloads">scheduled
    </a> for automatic downloads.</p><p>It represents Projects on a timeline in one of the four chosen
    modes:</p><p><span class="bold"><strong>Daily</strong></span> - displays all Projects
    scheduled for everyday download. (0 - 24 hours timeline)</p><p><span class="bold"><strong>Weekly </strong></span> - for Projects to be loaded
    every week. (Sunday through Saturday timeline)</p><p><span class="bold"><strong>Monthly</strong></span> - only Projects which have
    to be downloaded every month. (Timeline from 1st to 31st day)</p><p><span class="bold"><strong>Yearly</strong></span> - for every year schedule.
    (January through December timeline)</p><p></p><p>Each Project is shown with a blue arrow. Project details are
    displayed on the upper panel when the mouse hovers over the corresponding
    blue arrow.</p><p>You may change the Project scheduled time by moving its arrow with
    your mouse (the left mouse button should be held down.) Dragging a Project
    out of the Schedule manager will change its scheduled state to Manual.
    Double-clicking a Project will show the Scheduling panel in Project
    Properties dialog.</p><p>You may also drag a Project from the Projects tree to the Schedule
    Manager to set its scheduled state and time.</p><p><span class="bold"><strong>Sequencer</strong></span></p><p>Another useful feature is Sequencer. You can drag and drop Projects
    on it to download them one-by-one. When a Project from the sequence is
    downloaded, the next one starts.</p><p>You can start and stop sequencer using the Suspend box. If Loop box
    is checked, the sequencer will start the first Project after the last one
    finishes downloading.</p><p>Double-click on a Project in the Sequencer to select it in the
    Projects tree. This will allow you to start or stop it manually. Use
    right-click context menu to change sequence order or remove
    Projects.</p></div></body></html>
