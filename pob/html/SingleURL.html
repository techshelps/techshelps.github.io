    some page was not loaded because of Level restrictions or other Project
    settings. Adjusting Project settings and re-downloading it will take much
    time and may download lots of extra pages that you don't need.</p><p>Portable Offline Browser offers a quick way to add the
    single missing page to the Project. Simply drag the desired link over the
    Project and drop on it. You will get a small menu that offers either to
    add the link to the Project or to create a new Project with that URL. If
    you add the link to the existing Project, it will be immediately
    downloaded and become available offline.</p><p>In the Project Properties, the new URL will be added to the URLs
    field as a separate line:</p><p><span class="bold"><strong>SingleURL=http://www.server.com/page.htm</strong></span></p><p>You can also select a portion of the Web page with some links and
    drop it to the Project. All links in the selection will be added to the
    Project the same way.</p></div></body></html>
