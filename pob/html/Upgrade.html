    download the new installation file from our Web site: <a href="http://www.metaproducts.com" target="_top">http://www.metaproducts.com

    same directory where the previous version was installed. This will
    preserve all your Projects, downloaded sites and settings. There is no
    need to reenter the registration key if you make a minor upgrade, like
    from 4.4 to 4.7 version. Major upgrades, like from 4.x to 5.x version
    require additional key which could be purchased for some upgrade
    price.</p></div></body></html>
