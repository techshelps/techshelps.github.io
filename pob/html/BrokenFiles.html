    when the Web server returns file length and when the length is unknown. In
    the first case, if the file is not completely loaded and the connection is
    broken, Portable Offline Browser resumes downloading (it is trying to resume from the
    broken point (Reget feature).)</p><p></p><p>However with no file length given, there is no reliable way to
    confirm that the file is completely loaded. In this case, after the
    connection is broken, the file is saved to disk as it is. If the file is
    HTML, GIF or JPEG, then Portable Offline Browser looks for the file ending. If it is
    missing, Portable Offline Browser tries to redownload the file to make sure it is
    complete.</p></div></body></html>
