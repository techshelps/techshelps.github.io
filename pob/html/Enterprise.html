    Explorer with the power of Offline Explorer Pro and adds:</p><p></p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>The ability to download up to 100 million URLs per
        Project</p></li></ul></div><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>An OLE Automation interface to enable control from other

    want to have their own offline browsing solutions. We put all our offline
    browsing experience (since January, 1997) into it.</p><p><span class="bold"><strong>Huge downloads possible </strong></span></p><p>Enterprise edition was optimized to use as little memory as possible
    during downloads. We redesigned the parsing queue and map files format.
    Map files are no longer loaded in memory, but kept on the disk all the
    time. Offline Explorer Enterprise reads only the necessary map parts to
    display in the Project Map or to add new entries.</p><p></p><p>Map files have an <span class="bold"><strong>.mpx</strong></span> extension
    now. They are not compatible with other versions of Offline Explorer.
    Offline Explorer Enterprise converts old map files to the new format when
    necessary, but the reverse operation is not included. So, if you install
    Offline Explorer or Offline Explorer Pro over the Enterprise edition, some
    map information might be lost. Projects and other files formats are the
    same, so all settings, Projects and templates will be preserved.</p><p></p><p><span class="bold"><strong>Make your own offline browsing
    solution</strong></span></p><p>OLE Automation opens Offline Explorer Enterprise for solution
    developers. It is now possible to write a program using Visual C++, Visual
    Basic, Delphi or another COM-compatible development environment to start
    new downloads, manage Projects and process downloaded Web sites via
    Offline Explorer.</p><p>Offline Explorer Enterprise provides full access to its folders,
    Projects and downloads. A complete help file on OLE Automation details is
    provided in the Content section.</p><p>We plan to enhance the OLE Automation interface with each new
    version. If you need more information or if you would like to add more
    functionality to it please <a href="Support.html" title="Obtaining Technical Support">write</a> us.</p><p></p><p><span class="bold"><strong>Update Projects with deleted
    files</strong></span></p><p>Now you can delete downloaded Project files and Offline Explorer
    Enterprise will still be able to download only new or modified files from
    the Web site.</p><p>The information about the files you remove is stored in a compact
    database.</p><p>For example, if you downloaded a collection of large PDF files that
    were burned on a CD, you can delete the files from your hard disk using
    the <span class="bold"><strong>File | Delete | Only Project Files</strong></span>
    command. When you start downloading the Project the next time, Offline
    Explorer Enterprise will determine if any of the deleted files have
    changed and download only new and updated files.</p><p>This feature saves space by preventing storage of duplicate
    files.</p></div></body></html>
