    and descr.wd3 files.</p><p>The purpose of .primary files is to help when updating a loaded Web
    site. When Portable Offline Browser is told not to load unmodified files, it will check
    every file to see if it has changed since the last download. If not, the
    file is not loaded. If it is an HTML file, Portable Offline Browser should have its
    original copy with unchanged HTML links to follow. The .primary files are
    the original and unmodified HTML files.</p><p>Primary files are also used when existing files are not loaded. To
    follow links Portable Offline Browser parses .primary HTML files.</p><p><span class="bold"><strong>Note:</strong></span> .primary files do not
    increase the traffic. Portable Offline Browser loads only normal files, with .primary files
    created later.</p><p>Portable Offline Browser versions starting from 2.0 do not create .primary files
    unless you add the following line to the Project's URLs field:</p><p><span class="bold"><strong>Additional=KeepPrimary</strong></span></p><p>Descr.wd3 files reside in each directory Portable Offline Browser creates and contain
    information regarding all downloaded files in the directory:</p><p>- file name</p><p>- original file URL</p><p>- date of the last modification on Web server (to check for
    updates)</p><p>- file MIME type as it was returned by Web server (this is useful
    for offline browsing)</p><p>- a sign, if a .primary file was created or not.</p><p>Although all these files could be deleted, it is not recommended
    because this may make Web site updates and offline browsing less
    reliable.</p></div></body></html>
