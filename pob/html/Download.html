    Portable Offline Browser starts retrieving files from the Internet according to the Project
    Properties settings. To download a Project, first select the Project you
    want to download. Then:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>Click the Start button on the Ribbon - Home tab.</p></li><li><p>Click the Download Project or Folder in the Toolbar.</p></li><li><p>Press F5 on the keyboard.</p></li><li><p>If the Project is created using the Address Bar, the Project
        begins to download automatically.</p></li><li><p>Project downloads may be scheduled by selecting the Schedule
        section from Project Properties - Advanced. This
        determines when and how often a Project will be automatically
        downloaded. See <a href="Scheduling.html" title="Scheduling Project Downloads">Scheduling </a>for more
        details.</p></li><li><p><a href="CommandLine.html" title="Command Line Parameters">Command line parameters</a> may
        be used to download Projects when Portable Offline Browser starts.</p></li></ol></div><p>Once the download has been started, Portable Offline Browser begins loading files
    located under the Project URL. Every link in the file is checked against
    the limits set in the Project Properties: Limit number, File Types, File
    Sizes, URL Filters, etc. Since Portable Offline Browser downloads a limited <a href="InternetConnection.html" title="Options dialog: Internet - Connection">number of files</a> at one time, other
    files are placed in the Queue to wait for the download. The <a href="StatusBar.html" title="Status Bar">Status bar</a> displays the number of processed
    (downloaded) files and the number of files waiting in the Queue. When all
    files are downloaded and no files are left in Project Queue, the Project
    download is complete.</p><p>While a Project is downloading, a small green forward-arrow will be
    added to the Project icon. When the download is complete, the Project icon
    is returned to its normal state. Downloaded files are available offline at
    this time.</p><p>Portable Offline Browser can download many Projects simultaneously. Files queued for
    download by all Projects share the same downloading channels.</p><p>Each Project has its own downloading queue, so files from different
    Projects will be downloaded in parallel. Portable Offline Browser also allows you to limit the maximum number of
    connections that will be used by the Project. You can do it with the help
    of the context menu in the Queue tab or by adding the following line to
    the Project's URLs field:</p><p><span class="bold"><strong>Channels</strong></span>=3</p><p>You can also limit the number of simultaneous connections to each of
    the servers to prevent it from overloading:</p><p><span class="bold"><strong>ChannelsPerServer</strong></span>=2</p><p>To stop downloading a Project, select the Project and then click the
    Stop downloading button on Quick Access Toolbar or click Stop on the Ribbon - Home tab.
    To stop loading all Projects at once, click Stop All on the Ribbon - Tools tab.</p><p>Downloading may be temporarily suspended to free the Internet access
    channel by selecting Download | Suspend. All downloading Projects icons
    will change to the yellow VCR pause sign. To resume downloading, select
    Download | Resume. When suspending, Portable Offline Browser will not break the connections
    immediately. Instead, it will wait until every currently downloading file
    is complete, so there may be a pause before the Project is
    suspended.</p><p>Downloads in Portable Offline Browser may also be delayed. During the delay, other
    downloading activity will be available in Portable Offline Browser and the computer may be
    restarted. See <a href="SuspendToFile.html" title="Suspending to a File">Suspending to a file</a>
    for details.</p><p>You can control the download process even more precisely in Portable Offline Browser. There is a Queue tab
    that shows all URLs that Portable Offline Browser downloads for the selected Project.
    Right-click a URL in the list to abort it, copy the URL or Referer,
    perform other actions.</p><p>The Queue manager also allows you to limit the number of connections
    for the selected Project and pause individual Projects.</p><p>When you download streaming files (MMS, PNM and RTSP protocols) you
    may save a partially downloaded stream. Right-click the desired file in
    the Connections panel and choose <span class="bold"><strong>Finalize</strong></span>
    from the popup menu.</p></div></body></html>
