    URLs compatible with the filesystem. On the other hand, the renamed URLs
    have to maintain ability to be reverted back to online form.</p><p>For example, ? symbol which often can be found in URLs have to be
    replaced with some other symbol (@). Otherwise a filename with the ?
    symbol cannot be created in Windows. The sequence of symbols _40 has to be
    replaced with _5F40, because Portable Offline Browser reverts _40 to @ symbol in an online
    URL.</p><p>In any case, all links in the downloaded files are correctly
    converted to match changed filenames, so you should have no problem
