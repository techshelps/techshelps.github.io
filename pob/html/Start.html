    three simple steps to offline browsing.</p><p><span class="bold"><strong>Step 1. </strong></span>Creating a new <a href="Project.html" title="Projects">Project</a> for <a href="Project.html" title="Projects">downloading</a>.</p><p>The Project defines from which web page the download should start
    and how many pages Portable Offline Browser should download for you.</p><p>By default you get a New Project Wizard screen when you run Portable Offline Browser.
    If it doesn't show, click the <span class="bold"><strong>Wizard</strong></span> button on the
    Ribbon - Home tab and follow the steps to create a Project. At the
    end of the Wizard you will be prompted to start downloading the new Project.
    The newly created Project will be added to the Projects tree on the left
    side of the Portable Offline Browser screen.
    </p><p><span class="bold"><strong>Step 2.</strong></span> Waiting for the download to
    complete.</p><p>The new Project will be created and will start downloading.
    The green arrow on the Project icon indicates that the download goes on. When the download
    completes the green arrow disappears.</p><p>Once the download has been started, Portable Offline Browser begins loading files
    referenced by the Project URL (starting address). Every link in the file is checked against
    the limits set in the Project Properties: Level, File Types, File
    Sizes, URL Filters, etc.  Since Portable Offline Browser downloads a limited number
    of files at one time, other files are placed in the Queue to wait for the
    download. The Status bar displays the number of processed (downloaded) files
    and the number of files waiting in the Queue.  When all files are downloaded
    and no files are left in Project Queue, the Project download is complete.
    </p><p><span class="bold"><strong>Step 3</strong></span><a href="View.html" title="Browsing Downloaded Site Offline"><span class="bold"><strong>.</strong></span> Viewing downloaded files
    offline.</a></p><p>Now the web site is available for browsing off line. Right-click the
    downloaded Project and select <span class="bold"><strong>Browse.</strong></span>
    Portable Offline Browser will detect the best way to display the site, either in <a href="IB.html" title="Internal Browser">Internal browser</a> or in your default WWW
    browser.</p><p>You may repeat steps 1-3 at any time. Portable Offline Browser supports creation of
    an almost unlimited number of Projects, which could be downloaded in
    parallel.</p><p>There is also an easy semi-manual way to download Web sites for
    offline browsing. Click <a href="AutoSave.html" title="Saving pages as you browse">here </a>to read more
    about it.</p><p>For more details about working with Portable Offline Browser, go to the<a href="Main.html" title="Main Window"> Using Portable Offline Browser </a>section</p></div></body></html>
