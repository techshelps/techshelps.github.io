One type asks for a
    username and password in a standard Windows-type dialog (BASIC and NTLM authentication,)
    while the other type requires you to logon directly on a Web page.</p><p><span class="bold"><strong>1. Web sites that require BASIC and NTLM-authentication.</strong></span></p><p>To download this type of site, either specify the username and password in the
    Project Properties dialog | Advanced | Password section, or type them directly in the
    URL, such as: http://username:password@www.server.com/...
    </p><p>Notice that a colon separates the password from the username and the @ symbol separates
    them from the server name.
    </p><p>Some sites use NTLM authentication, which looks like the above, but with a third box
    labeled "DOMAIN" along with the username and password. Enter the domain name along with
    the username in the same field in the Project Properties dialog | Passwords this way:
    </p><p><span class="bold"><strong>DOMAIN\username</strong></span></p><p>The backslash symbol separates the domain name from the username. When you are done
    with the Project Properties changes, click the OK button to save them.
    </p><p><span class="bold"><strong>2. Authentication in a Web form.</strong></span></p><p>It is easy to download this type of site. You need to browse to the logon page
    of the site using the internal Browser of Portable Offline Browser.
    </p><p>If you need to download the site immediately and only once, you can proceed with
    the logon and begin downloading the desired pages using Portable Offline Browser. The
    program will use the session cookies of the logged on site from the internal browser.
    </p><p>You can also record the logon form contents in a Project, so that
    Portable Offline Browser will know how to log itself on whenever you wish to download the
    site. This is useful when you want to schedule the site download or perform it later,
    or if you want to update the downloaded site in the future.
    </p><p>Once you have entered your username and password on the logon page in the internal
    browser, press and hold the <span class="bold"><strong>Alt + Ctrl</strong></span> keys on your
    keyboard, click the Logon (or Submit) button in the Web form and release the keyboard buttons.
    You should get a new Project that contains the Web form information recorded in the URL field.
    </p><p>Adjust the Project settings as you wish (set the Level and other parameters) and
    click the OK button to save the Project. You may begin downloading at any time.
    </p><p>It is also recommended to make sure that the "Use alternate connection method"
    box is checked in the Internet tab of the Ribbon.
