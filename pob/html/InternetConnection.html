        making downloading easier and faster. The most commonly used number of
        connections is between 10 and 20. Fewer connections may make the
        downloads slower, while more may make them unreliable because of a
        possible timeout. If you feel that your downloads are not reliable,
        but you don't want to decrease the number of connections, try
        increasing the Timeout value. You are free to change this setting at
        any time. If you increase the number of connections while downloading,
        the new channels will be added immediately. If you reduce the number
        of connections, the extra channels will not be removed at once, as
        Portable Offline Browser will wait until files downloading on the last connections
        finish before removing the channels. Warning: selecting more than 100
        simultaneous connections may cause system instability, as Windows may
        have problems while handling that many opened TCP/IP sockets.</p></li></ul></div><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Number of retries</p><p>File downloads may fail for several reasons: server not found,
        connection was not established, file was not transmitted fully,
        timeout, etc. To recover from these failures, set the <span class="bold"><strong>Number of retires</strong></span> setting in the Options |
        Internet | Connections panel to tell Portable Offline Browser how many times to attempt
        to re-establish a connection. If the number of retries is not set,
        Portable Offline Browser will retry indefinitely until it succeeds or is manually
        stopped.</p></li></ul></div><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Delay between downloads</p><p>To reduce the traffic created by Portable Offline Browser, you may increase the
        <span class="bold"><strong>Delay between downloads</strong></span> setting. Once
        a file is loaded, Portable Offline Browser will wait the specified number of seconds
        before retrieving the next one. You can also use <span class="bold"><strong>random</strong></span> delays to make Portable Offline Browser act as a human
        browsing. This may help to overcome anti-offline browsers protection
        on some Web sites. Simply use the following format: <span class="bold"><strong>2-10</strong></span> The above will make Portable Offline Browser to choose a
        delay randomly in the range between 2 and 10 seconds before
        downloading each file.</p><p>You may specify non-integer delays, like <span class="bold"><strong>0.23</strong></span> seconds.
        Or <span class="bold"><strong>2.5-5.7</strong></span>.</p></li></ul></div><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Timeout</p><p>This value could help fine-tune your downloads. If Portable Offline Browser is
        waiting for data from the Internet longer than the number of seconds
        specified in the Timeout setting, the connection will be broken. A
        high number of timeouts usually means that something is wrong with the
        path to the server. To remedy an extremely high number of timeouts,
        either decrease the <span class="bold"><strong>Number of
        connections</strong></span> (number of downloading channels) or increase
        the timeout value.</p></li></ul></div><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Cookies support</p><p>Check this setting to use MS IE cookies while downloading Web
        sites. This is useful for loading some protected sites which store
        user information in cookie files. In this case, it is best to log on
        to the site using MS Internet Explorer and then load it with Portable Offline Browser.
        Some sites use temporary cookies, so it is better to use the Internal
        browser in Portable Offline Browser to log on to the site first. Portable Offline Browser will use both
        permanent and temporary cookies from Internal browser.</p></li></ul></div><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Internal HTTP server port</p><p>Portable Offline Browser includes an internal HTTP (Web) server to facilitate
        viewing and sharing downloaded pages. By default, the internal HTTP
        server uses port <span class="bold"><strong>800.</strong></span> You may change
        this setting if you wish. To access the server from the computer where
        Portable Offline Browser is running, you may type: <span class="bold"><strong>http://127.0.0.1:800/</strong></span> in your Web browser’s URL
        field. Users on other computers should know the IP address of the
        computer to access the downloaded pages.</p></li></ul></div><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Agent Identification</p><p>Sometimes it is necessary to change the way Portable Offline Browser represents
        itself to other Web servers. This is called "User Agent." By default
        it is <span class="bold"><strong>MS Internet Explorer</strong></span>. Portable Offline Browser
        will try to identify MS IE version itself to use exactly the same
        representation. There are a few preset user agent values in the
        drop-down combo box. The actual representation is displayed in the
        <span class="bold"><strong>Use this identification</strong></span> field. If you
        need to use something other than the preset values, choose <span class="bold"><strong>Use this identification</strong></span> and type the desired
        user agent. The User Agent value doesn't affect most Web sites.
        However, you may experience problems downloading some protected Web
        sites, or HTML documents may be returned with incorrect encoding until
        the correct (in the Web site's opinion) User Agent is set.</p></li></ul></div><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Local access only</p><p>When this setting is
        checked, Portable Offline Browser will prevent other computers from accessing the
        Internal HTTP (Web) server. This could be used for security
        reasons.</p><p>Unchecking the setting allows you to share downloaded Web sites
        with other people.</p></li></ul></div></div></body></html>
