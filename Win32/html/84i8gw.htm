<P><A NAME="84i8gw"></A><B>Console Process Groups</B></P>

<P>When a process uses the <A HREF="5fbj_xx.htm"><B>CreateProcess</B></A> function to create a new console process, it can specify the CREATE_NEW_PROCESS_GROUP flag to make the new process the root process of a console process group. The process group includes all processes that are descendants of the root process. </P>

<P>A process can use the <A HREF="19h8n57.htm"><B>GenerateConsoleCtrlEvent</B></A> function to send a CTRL+C or CTRL+BREAK signal to all processes in a console process group. The signal is only received by those processes in the group that are attached to the same console as the process that called <B>GenerateConsoleCtrlEvent</B>. </P>
