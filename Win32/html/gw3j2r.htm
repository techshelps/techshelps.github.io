<P><A NAME="gw3j2r"></A><B>race condition</B></P>

<P>A bug in a multithreaded process where the code of thread A relies on thread B to complete some action, but where there is no synchronization between the two threads. The process works if thread B wins the race by completing its action before thread A needs it, but the process fails if thread A wins the race. See also <A HREF="bpy4ye.htm"><B>process</B></A>,<B> thread</B>.</P>
