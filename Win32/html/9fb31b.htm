<P><A NAME="9fb31b"></A><B>Objects Object</B></P>

<P>The Objects performance object consists of counters that monitor logical objects in the system, such as processes, threads, mutexes, and semaphores. This information can be used to detect the unnecessary consumption of computer resources. Each object requires memory to store basic information about the object.</P>

<P><B>Processes</B></P>

<P>Processes is the number of processes in the computer at the time of data collection. Notice that this is an instantaneous count, not an average over the time interval. Each process represents the running of a program.</P>

<P>Detail Level: Novice<BR>
Counter Type: PERF_COUNTER_RAWCOUNT</P>

<P><B>Threads</B></P>

<P>Threads is the number of threads in the computer at the time of data collection. Notice that this is an instantaneous count, not an average over the time interval. A thread is the basic executable entity that can execute instructions in a processor.</P>

<P>Detail Level: Novice<BR>
Counter Type: PERF_COUNTER_RAWCOUNT</P>

<P><B>Events</B></P>

<P>Events is the number of events in the computer at the time of data collection. Notice that this is an instantaneous count, not an average over the time interval. An event is used when two or more threads wish to synchronize execution.</P>

Counter Type: PERF_COUNTER_RAWCOUNT</P>

<P><B>Semaphores</B></P>

<P>Semaphores is the number of semaphores in the computer at the time of data collection. Notice that this is an instantaneous count, not an average over the time interval. Threads use semaphores to obtain exclusive access to data structures that they share with other threads.</P>

Counter Type: PERF_COUNTER_RAWCOUNT</P>

<P><B>Mutexes</B></P>

<P>Mutexes counts the number of mutexes in the computer at the time of data collection. This is an instantaneous count, not an average over the time interval. Mutexes are used by threads to assure only one thread is executing some section of code.</P>

<P>Detail Level: Expert<BR>
Counter Type: PERF_COUNTER_RAWCOUNT</P>

<P><B>Sections</B></P>

<P>Sections is the number of sections in the computer at the time of data collection. Notice that this is an instantaneous count, not an average over the time interval. A section is a portion of virtual memory created by a process for a storing data. A process might share sections with other processes.</P>
