<P><A NAME="wg3fx0"></A><B>About Clipping</B></P>

<P>Clipping is used by Microsoft® Win32®-based applications in a variety of ways. Word processing and spreadsheet applications clip keyboard input to keep it from appearing in the margins of a page or spreadsheet. Computer-aided design (CAD) and drawing applications clip graphics output to keep it from overwriting the edges of a drawing or picture. </P>

<P>A <I>clipping region</I> is a region with edges that are either straight lines or curves. A <I>clip path</I> is a region with edges that are straight lines, Bézier curves, or combinations of both. For more information about regions, see <A HREF="1y7dhc.htm">Regions</A>. For more information about paths, see <A HREF="qxbavo.htm">Paths</A>. </P>
