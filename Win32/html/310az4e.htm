<P><A NAME="310az4e"></A><B>About Buttons</B></P>

<P>There are several types of buttons and, within each type, one or more styles to distinguish among buttons of the same type. The user turns a button on or off by selecting it using the mouse or keyboard. Selecting a button typically changes its visual appearance and state (from checked to unchecked, for example). Windows, the button, and the application cooperate in changing the button's appearance and state. A button can send messages to its parent window, and a parent window can send messages to a button. Some buttons are painted by Windows, some by the application. Buttons can be used alone or in groups and can appear with or without application-defined text (a label). They belong to the BUTTON window class. </P>

<P>Although an application can use buttons in overlapped, pop-up, and child windows, they are designed for use in dialog boxes, where Windows standardizes their behavior. If an application uses buttons outside dialog boxes, it increases the risk that the application may behave in a nonstandard fashion. Applications typically either use buttons in dialog boxes or use window subclassing to create customized buttons. </P>
