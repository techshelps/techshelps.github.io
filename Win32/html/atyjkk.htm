<H1><A NAME="atyjkk"></A>Structured Exception Handling</H1>

<P>An <I>exception</I> is an event that occurs during the execution of a program, and that requires the execution of software outside the normal flow of control. Hardware exceptions can result from the execution of certain instruction sequences, such as division by zero or an attempt to access an invalid memory address. A software routine can also initiate an exception explicitly. </P>

<P>The Microsoft® Win32® application programming interface (API) supports <I>structured exception handling</I>, a mechanism for handling hardware- and software-generated exceptions. </P>
