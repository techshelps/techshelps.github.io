<P>To encrypt a file so only the current user can access its data, the file is bulk encrypted with a symmetric cipher. The key to this cipher is then kept in an access block (key blob) that can only be opened with the user's private key. Note that this technique also works for encrypting messages for specific recipients.</P>
