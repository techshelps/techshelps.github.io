<P><A NAME="cmai93"></A><B>Interactive Services</B></P>

<P>An interactive service is a service that can interact with the application desktop. Other desktops do not receive user input. For more information, see <A HREF="3ocly5.htm">Window Stations and Desktops</A>. </P>

<P>An interactive service must run in the context of the LocalSystem account and be configured to run interactively. Services are configured to run interactively when the <I>dwServiceType</I> parameter in a <A HREF="2wng26.htm"><B>CreateService</B></A> call is set to include the SERVICE_INTERACTIVE_PROCESS flag. However, the following registry key contains a value, <B>NoInteractiveServices</B>, that controls the effect of the SERVICE_INTERACTIVE_PROCESS flag: </P>

<P><B>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Windows</B></P>

<P>The <B>NoInteractiveServices</B> value defaults to 0, which means that services marked with the SERVICE_INTERACTIVE_PROCESS flag will be allowed to run interactively. When the <B>NoInteractiveServices</B> value is set to a nonzero value, no service started thereafter, regardless of whether it has been configured with SERVICE_INTERACTIVE_PROCESS, will be allowed to run interactively. </P>

<P><B>Note</B>  It is possible to display a message box from a service, even if it is not running in the LocalSystem account or not configured to run interactively. Simply call the <A HREF="1fw7bh.htm"><B>MessageBox</B></A> function using the MB_SERVICE_NOTIFICATION flag. Do not call <B>MessageBox</B> during service initialization or from the <A HREF="1eqr9ip.htm"><B>Handler</B></A> routine, unless you call it from a separate thread, so that you return to the SCM in a timely manner. </P>

<P>It is also possible to interact with the desktop from a non-interactive service by modifying the DACLs on the interface window station and desktop or by impersonating the logged-on user and opening the interactive window station and desktop directly. For more information, see <A HREF="15bexdk.htm">Interacting with the User by a Win32 Service</A>. </P>
