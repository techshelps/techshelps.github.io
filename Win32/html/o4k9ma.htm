<P>The system sends IME window messages to the window procedure of the application when certain event occur that affect the IME windows. For example, the system sends the <A HREF="pg2uwv.htm">WM_IME_SETCONTEXT</A> message to the application when a window is activated. IME-unaware application pass these messages to the <A HREF="32d1nbh.htm"><B>DefWindowProc</B></A> function which sends them to the corresponding default IME window. IME-aware applications either process these messages or forward them the their own IME windows.</P>

<P>You can direct an IME window to carry out an action, such as change the position of composition window, by using the <A HREF="vxufgi.htm">WM_IME_CONTROL</A> message. The IME notifies the application about changes to the composition string by using the <A HREF="y5wer6.htm">WM_IME_COMPOSITION</A> message and about general changes to the status of the IME windows by sending the <A HREF="hs7w24.htm">WM_IME_NOTIFY</A> message. </P>
