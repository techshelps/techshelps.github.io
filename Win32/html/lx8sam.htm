<P><A NAME="lx8sam"></A><B>Turning SNMP On and Off</B></P>

<P>You can start and stop SNMP from the console window or the Services icon in Control Panel. Since SNMP starts when the computer is started, you will usually not need to start or stop SNMP. However, if you configure trap destinations or add a new community string, you will need to restart SNMP.</P>

<P>You will also need to restart SNMP after you install a new extension agent DLL. From the console window or from the Services application in Control Panel, type <B>Net Stop Snmp</B> and then <B>Net Start Snmp</B>.</P>

<P>You will have to start the SNMP Trap Service if you want to receive traps. From the console window or from the Services application in Control Panel, type <B>Net Start Snmptrap</B> to start the SNMP Trap Service or <B>Net Stop Snmptrap</B> to disable trap reception.</P>

<P>Stopping a service cancels any network connections the service is using. You must have administrative rights to stop the server service.</P>
