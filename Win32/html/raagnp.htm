<P>An autohide appbar is one that is normally hidden, but becomes visible when the user moves the mouse cursor to the screen edge that the appbar is associated with. The appbar hides itself again when the user moves the mouse cursor out of the bar's bounding rectangle. </P>

<P>Although the system allows a number of different appbars at any given time, it allows only one autohide appbar at a time for each screen edge on a first come, first served basis. The system automatically maintains the Z order of an autohide appbar (within its Z order group only).</P>

<P>An application uses the <A HREF="epjwz2.htm">ABM_SETAUTOHIDEBAR</A> message to register or unregister an autohide appbar. The message specifies the edge for the appbar and a flag that specifies whether the appbar is to be registered or unregistered. The message fails if an autohide appbar is being registered, but one is already associated with the specified edge. An application can retrieve the handle of the autohide appbar associated with an edge by sending the <A HREF="2gygh25.htm">ABM_GETAUTOHIDEBAR</A> message.</P>

<P>An autohide appbar does not need to register as a normal appbar; that is, it does not need to be registered by sending the <A HREF="kn67e9.htm">ABM_NEW</A> message. An appbar that is not registered by ABM_NEW overlaps any appbars anchored on the same edge of the screen. </P>
