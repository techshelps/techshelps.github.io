<P>Each call to an event logging function is considered to be an atomic operation. For reading the event log, only whole event records are returned. For logging events, each event record is guaranteed to be written as a complete record in the log. The following list describes how the event logging service handles special conditions: </P>

<P>·Multiple calls written to the same log. The event logging service serializes the operations; the event logs are written sequentially in the logfile. </P>

<P>·A call to read and a call to write are made at the same time. What happens depends on where the current read operation is being carried out in the file. If the read position is at the end of the file, either the read operation fails with an "end-of-file" status (if the write operation has not been done), or it returns the new record that the write operation has just written to the log. </P>

<P>·Clearing the log before reading. The read operation returns an "end-of-file" status after the file is cleared. </P>

<P>·Clearing the log before writing. The clear operation truncates the logfile; the write operation then writes the new record at the beginning of the log. </P>
