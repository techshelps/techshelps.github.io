<P>Microsoft® Windows NT® supports an application type known as a service. A <I>Win32-based service</I> conforms to the interface rules of the Service Control Manager (SCM). It can be started automatically at system boot, by a user through the Services control panel applet, or by a Win32-based application that uses the service functions included in the Microsoft® Win32® application programming interface (API). Services can execute even when no user is logged on to the system. </P>

<P>Windows NT also supports a <I>driver service</I>, which conforms to the device driver protocols for Windows NT. It is similar to the Win32-based service, but it does not interact with the SCM. For simplicity, the term <I>service</I> refers to a <I>Win32-based service</I> in this overview. </P>

<P><B>Note</B>  Windows 95 supports a subset of the functionality provided by the Windows NT SCM. For more information, see Windows 95 Service Control Manager. </P>
