<P><A NAME="aay1xs"></A><B>The LocalSystem Account</B></P>

<P>The LocalSystem account is a predefined local account used by system processes. The name of the account is .\System. This account does not have a password. If you specify the LocalSystem account in a call to the <A HREF="2wng26.htm"><B>CreateService</B></A> function, any password information you supply is ignored. </P>

<P>A service that runs in the context of the LocalSystem account inherits the security context of the SCM. It is not associated with any logged-on user account and does not have credentials (domain name, user name, and password) to be used for verification. This has several implications: </P>

<P>톂he service cannot open the registry key <B>HKEY_CURRENT_USER</B>. </P>

<P>톂he service can open the registry key <B>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SECURITY</B>.</P>

<P>톂he service has limited access to network resources, such as shares and pipes, because it has no credentials and must connect using a null session. The following registry key contains the <B>NullSessionPipes</B> and <B>NullSessionShares</B> values, which are used to specify the pipes and shares to which null sessions may connect: </P>

<P><B>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\<BR>
LanmanServer\Parameters</B></P>

<P>Alternatively, you could add the REG_DWORD value <B>RestrictNullSessAccess</B> to the key and set it to 0 to allow all null sessions to access all pipes and shares created on that machine. </P>

<P>톂he service cannot share objects with other applications, unless they are opened using a DACL which allows a user or group of users access or NULL DACL, which allows everyone access. Specifying a NULL DACL is not the same as specifying NULL, which means that access is only granted to applications with the same security context. For more information, see <A HREF="1qnjrk.htm">Allowing Access</A>. </P>

<P>텶f the service opens a command window and runs a batch file, the user could hit CTRL+C to terminate the batch file and gain access to a command window with LocalSystem permissions. </P>

<P></P>
