<P><A NAME="rgbx93"></A><B>Device-Independent Bitmaps and Enhanced Metafiles</B></P>

<P>To provide for image color matching, color characterization is included in device-independent bitmaps (DIBs) and enhanced metafiles. In DIBs, the color characterization is placed in the DIB header. In enhanced metafiles, the characterization is in metafile records. Color characterization is not available for compatible bitmaps and standard (16-bit) metafiles.</P>

<P>You set the color characterization for a DIB by setting the appropriate members in the <A HREF="l6vhgx.htm"><B>BITMAPV4HEADER</B></A> structure for the DIB. This structure is identical to the <A HREF="05za4g.htm"><B>BITMAPINFOHEADER</B></A> structure except that it includes members that define the color space type, color endpoints, and other related values. Some operating systems support the device CMYK color space type in DIBs but only for 32-bit DIBs. In such cases, the output device must also accept this format. If a DIB does not contain color characterization information, the system uses a default characterization.</P>

<P>You set color characterization for an enhanced metafile by using the <A HREF="1nuo.w4.htm"><B>CreateColorSpace</B></A> and <A HREF="3lrf_ln.htm"><B>SetColorSpace</B></A> functions when recording the metafile. The system records information about the color spaces and carries out color matching with the intended output device when the metafile is played. The system also records the <A HREF="zpg8kw.htm"><B>SetICMMode</B></A> and <A HREF="79a12i.htm"><B>DeleteColorSpace</B></A> functions, but no other image color matching functions can be used with enhanced metafiles. If you specify a color profile in the <A HREF="1nir.71.htm"><B>LOGCOLORSPACE</B></A> structure when recording an enhanced metafile, the system records the filename of the color profile but not the content of the profile. This is similar to the way fonts are handled in enhanced metafiles. </P>
