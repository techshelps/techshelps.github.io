<P><A NAME="0j23xf"></A><B>Data Encryption</B></P>

<P>In using data encryption, a <I>plaintext</I> message can be encoded so it appears like random gibberish and is very difficult to transform back to the original message, without a secret key. In this document, the term <I>message</I> is used to refer to any piece of data. This message can consist of ASCII text, a database file, or any data you want to store or transmit securely. <I>Plaintext</I> is used to refer to data that has not been encrypted, while <I>ciphertext</I> refers to data that has.</P>

<P>Once a message has been encrypted, it can be stored on nonsecure media or transmitted on an nonsecure network, and still remain secret. Later, the message can be decrypted into its original form. This process is shown in the following illustration:</P>

<P>When a message is encrypted, an <I>encryption key</I> is used. This is analogous to the physical key that is used to lock a padlock. To decrypt the message, the corresponding <I>decryption key</I> must be used. It is very important to properly restrict access to the decryption key, because anyone who possesses it will be able to decrypt all messages that were encrypted with the matching encryption key. Note that the encryption and decryption keys are often the same key.</P>

<P>This may come as a surprise, but data encryption/decryption is pretty straight-forward. The really difficult part is keeping the keys safe and transmitting them securely to other users. This is discussed further in <A HREF="2jdzwvi.htm">Exchanging Cryptographic Keys</A>.</P>
