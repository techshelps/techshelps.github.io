<P>The pattern attribute specifies the pattern of a geometric pen. </P>

<P>The following illustration shows lines drawn with different geometric pens. Each pen was created using a different pattern attribute. </P>

<P><IMG SRC="../images/bm92.gif" ALT="" BORDER=0></P>

<P>The first line in the previous illustration is drawn using one of the six available hatch patterns; for more information about hatch patterns, see <A HREF="4g6b04.htm">Hatch</A>. The next line is drawn using the hollow pattern, identical to the null pattern. The third line is drawn using a custom pattern created from an 8- by 8-pixel bitmap. (For more information about bitmaps and their creation, see <A HREF="15l9v8p.htm">Bitmaps</A>.) The last line is drawn using a solid pattern. Creating a brush and passing its handle to the <A HREF="6kg3d6.htm"><B>ExtCreatePen</B></A> function creates a pattern. </P>
