<P>Windows provides a set of functions that applications can use to define hot keys. A <I>hot key</I> is a key combination that generates a <A HREF="uqh9ub.htm">WM_HOTKEY</A> message, a message the system places at the top of a thread's message queue, bypassing any existing messages in the queue. Applications use hot keys to obtain high-priority keyboard input from the user. For example, by defining a hot key consisting of the CTRL+C key combination, an application can allow the user to cancel a lengthy operation. </P>

<P>To define a hot key, an application calls the <A HREF="1gllzld.htm"><B>RegisterHotKey</B></A> function, specifying the combination of keys that generates the WM_HOTKEY message, the handle of the window to receive the message, and the identifier of the hot key. When the user presses the hot key, a WM_HOTKEY message is placed in the message queue of the thread that created the given window. The <I>wParam</I> parameter of the message contains the identifier of the hot key. The application can define multiple hot keys for a thread, but each hot key in the thread must have a unique identifier. Before the application terminates, it should use the <A HREF="1mgfjvp.htm"><B>UnregisterHotKey</B></A> function to destroy the hot key. </P>

<P>Applications can use a hot key control to make it easy for the user to choose a hot key. Hot key controls are typically used to define a hot key that activates a window; they do not use the <B>RegisterHotKey</B> and <B>UnregisterHotKey</B> functions. Instead, an application that uses a hot key control typically sends the <A HREF="13516.htm">WM_SETHOTKEY</A> message to set the hot key. Whenever the user presses the hot key, the system sends a <A HREF="3xmtv4t.htm">WM_SYSCOMMAND</A> message specifying SC_HOTKEY. For more information about hot key controls, see <A HREF="wd.ux1.htm">Hot-Key Controls</A>. </P>
