<P><A NAME="r.l3_a"></A><B>The Window Menu</B></P>

<P>The <I><B>window</B> menu</I> (also known as the <I>System menu</I> or <I>Control menu</I>) is a pop-up menu defined and managed almost exclusively by the operating system. The user can open the <B>window</B> menu by clicking the application icon on the title bar or by right-clicking anywhere on the title bar.</P>

<P>The <B>window</B> menu provides a standard set of menu items that the user can choose to change a window's size or position, or close the application. Items on the <B>window</B> menu can be added, deleted, and modified, but most applications just use the standard set of menu items. An overlapped, pop-up, or child window can have a <B>window</B> menu. It is uncommon for an overlapped or pop-up window not to include a <B>window</B> menu.</P>

<P>When the user chooses a command from the <B>window</B> menu, Windows sends a <A HREF="3xmtv4t.htm">WM_SYSCOMMAND</A> message to the menu's owner window. In most applications, the window procedure does not process messages from the <B>window</B> menu. Instead, it simply passes the messages to the <A HREF="32d1nbh.htm"><B>DefWindowProc</B></A> function for system-default processing of the message. If an application adds a command to the <B>window</B> menu, the window procedure must process the command. </P>

<P>An application can use the <A HREF="nh615u.htm"><B>GetSystemMenu</B></A> function to create a copy of the default <B>window</B> menu to modify. Any window that does not use the <B>GetSystemMenu</B> function to make its own copy of the <B>window</B> menu receives the standard <B>window</B> menu. </P>
