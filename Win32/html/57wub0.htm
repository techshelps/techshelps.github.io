<P>A process can use the <A HREF="1jvkg1x.htm"><B>FreeConsole</B></A> function to detach itself from its console. If other processes share the console, the console is not destroyed, but the process that called <B>FreeConsole</B> cannot refer to it. After calling <B>FreeConsole</B>, the process can use <A HREF="440z8e.htm"><B>AllocConsole</B></A> to create a new console. </P>

<P>A console is closed when the last process attached to it terminates or calls <B>FreeConsole</B>. </P>
