<P>The initial thread of a process. Also called the main thread or thread 1. When the <B>main</B> or <B>WinMain</B> function of a primary thread returns, the <B>ExitProcess</B> function is called implicitly, terminating all other threads of the process. A primary thread does not differ from other threads with respect to signals because all signals are delivered to the thread that caused them. See also <A HREF="bpy4ye.htm"><B>process</B></A>,<B> thread</B>.</P>
