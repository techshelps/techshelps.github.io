<P>Strings are optional language-independent (nonlocalized) strings used to fill in values for placeholders in description strings. Because the strings are not localized, it is critical that this field be used only to store language-independent strings such as numeric values or string tokens (filenames, user names, and so on). String length must not exceed 32 kilobytes - 1 characters. </P>

<P>It is not acceptable to use several strings to "paste" together a larger description or to use nontoken strings. The insertion string should be treated as data, not text. For example, the following example is <I>not</I> recommended: </P>

<P>Str1$ = successfully  </P>

<P>Description = "User was %1 added to database." </P>

<P></P>

<P>Using these two strings to form the string, "User was successfully added to database." (the alternative being Str1$ = "not") is not acceptable for three reasons: </P>

<P>1.The strings "successfully" and "not" should be localized. </P>

<P>2.Even if the insertion strings are obtained from language-dependent message files, this is done when the event is logged, not when it is viewed. When the event is viewed, the language may be wrong. </P>

<P>3.Such substitutions of adverbs and adjectives will not work in many other languages. The preceding example should use two separate events. </P>

<P></P>

<P>The following example shows an appropriate use of strings: </P>

<P>Str1$ = "c:\testapp.c".  </P>

<P>Description = "Access denied. Attempted to open the file %1" </P>

<P></P>
