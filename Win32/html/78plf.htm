<P><A NAME="78plf"></A><B>File Viewer Viewport Window Contents</B></P>

<P>The viewport window is where you provide most file-specific UI elements. The viewport occupies all space in the client area of the main window not used for the toolbar and status bar. It displays the file contents in whatever mode is applicable, and it is sensitive to the user-selected printer and page setup, as well as other View menu commands.</P>

<P>If the contents of the file are too large to be completely displayed within the viewport, the file viewer should provide scroll bars (with proportional scroll boxes) to shift the image. If the contents of the file are smaller than the viewport window, no scroll bars should appear. In addition, the file contents should not be initially scaled to fill the viewport window unless the user selects scaling through the View menu commands.</P>

<P>The only other requirement for the viewport window is that it should provide a context menu for the file. The context menu should appear when the user clicks the viewport with the mouse button 2. The context menu should include the following items.</P>

<TABLE cols=2>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=32%><B>Menu item string</B></TD>
<TD width=68%><B>Equivalent found on other menu</B></TD>
</TR>

</TABLE><BR>

<P></P>

<P>A file viewer may add more items as necessary. The Toolbar and Status bar menu items commands on the View menu should not appear in the context menu.</P>
