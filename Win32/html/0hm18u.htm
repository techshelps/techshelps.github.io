<P>Among cooperating processes, any one process is only as restricted as the least restricted process. For example, a process can call the <A HREF="1ojqkwy.htm"><B>DuplicateHandle</B></A> function to duplicate an object handle belonging to a second (source) process into a third (target) process. If the <A HREF="a48e53.htm">access rights</A> requested for the target process are greater than the rights held by the source process, the system checks the requested access rights against the security context of the process calling <B>DuplicateHandle</B>. If the calling process has the required access rights, the handle is duplicated, and the target process has greater access to the object than the source process. </P>
