<P><A NAME="jq6sqf"></A><B>Logging Performance and Size</B></P>

<P>Typically, how much disk space does an event log require? What is the overhead for an application that makes a call to log an event? The answers to these questions depend on how much information the application chooses to log. This is why it is important to log only essential information and to place event logging calls in an error path in the application, rather than place them in the main path, where the performance hit would be more severe. </P>
