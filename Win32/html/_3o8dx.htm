<P>File Manager installs extensions that have settings in the [AddOns] section of the WINFILE.INI initialization file. Each setting contains an entry and a value. An entry consists of a string that represents the name of an extension. The value assigned to the entry consists of a string that specifies the path to the extension DLL. An application can use the <A HREF="ghz6rp.htm"><B>WritePrivateProfileString</B></A> function to add a setting to WINFILE.INI. The following example shows a setting in WINFILE.INI. </P>

<P>[AddOns]  </P>

<P>MyExtension=C:\NT\SYSTEM\MYEXT.DLL </P>

<P></P>

<P>File Manager does not display an error message if it cannot find an extension DLL, so an extension DLL can be deleted in order to uninstall it. Even so, an application that installs an extension DLL should provide an uninstall option to remove the extension's setting from the WINFILE.INI file. </P>
