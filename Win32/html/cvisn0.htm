<P>A property sheet contains one or more overlapping child windows called <I>pages</I>, each containing control windows for setting a group of related properties. For example, a page can contain the controls for setting the font properties of an item, including the type style, point size, color, and so on. Each page has a tab that the user can select to bring the page to the foreground of the property sheet. The following illustration shows a property sheet for viewing and setting the properties of a floppy disk drive.</P>
