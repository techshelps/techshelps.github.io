<P><A NAME="v4uqvk"></A><B>Alert Functions</B></P>

<P>The alert functions notify network service programs and applications of network events. An event is a particular instance of a process or state of hardware as defined by an application. The alert functions allow applications to indicate when predefined events occur. </P>

<P>Other programs, network services, or internal network components use the <B>NetAlertRaise</B> function to raise an alert, notifying various applications or users when a particular type of event occurs. The Alert category functions, datatypes, structures, and constants are defined in the LMCONS.H, LMERR.H, and LMALERT.H header files. A source program can gain access to these definitions by defining the constants INCL_NETERRORS and INCL_NETALERT, and by including the header file LM.H.</P>

<P>The LMALERT.H include file defines the following classes of events for which alerts are sent out:</P>

<P>유 network event requiring administrative assistance</P>

<P>유n entry is added to an error log file</P>

<P>유 user or application receives a broadcast message</P>

<P>유 print job completes</P>

<P>유 user accesses or uses certain applications or resources</P>

<P></P>

<P>You can define other classes of alerts for network applications as needed. For example, an application on a server routinely writes large amounts of data to a disk drive, running the risk of filling the disk. In this case, you might want the event ``no free disk space'' to trigger an alert that notifies the application to pause or terminate the process that is filling the disk.</P>

<P>An application or network service program, also known as a client, registers a request to be notified of an event (or class of events) by calling the <B>NetAlertStart</B> function. You can register the client for several types of events by calling the <B>NetAlertStart</B> function multiple times. Each registration adds an entry to an alert table. An application or network service program receives alert messages through the use of a mailslot (registered as \mailslot\name). If a program requires detailed information about an event, register it as a mailslot. </P>

<P>You can register an application or network service program for one type of event, or for several types, by calling the <B>NetAlertStart</B> function multiple times. For a registered application or network service program, use the <B>NetAlertStop</B> function to remove that application or network service program entry from the alert table for the particular class of event. </P>

<P>The alert functions are:</P>

<P><A HREF="w_jzzb.htm"><B>NetAlertRaise</B></A> <BR>
<A HREF="29q4rs..htm"><B>NetAlertRaiseEx</B></A> </P>

<P>The <A HREF="w_jzzb.htm"><B>NetAlertRaise</B></A> function is used to indicate that an event has occurred.</P>

<P>The fixed-length header contains the standard alert structure, <A HREF="j166e1.htm"><B>STD_ALERT</B></A><B>.</B></P>

<P>Additional information is included in the following structures:</P>

<P><A HREF="fgaayd.htm"><B>ADMIN_OTHER_INFO</B></A><B><BR>
<A HREF="2hkvquo.htm">ERRLOG_OTHER_INFO</A><BR>
<A HREF="6mxb.lo.htm">PRINT_OTHER_INFO</A><BR>
<A HREF="go_3t8.htm">USER_OTHER_INFO</A></B></P>
