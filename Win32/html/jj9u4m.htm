<P><A NAME="jj9u4m"></A><B>About Shell Links</B></P>

<P>The user creates a shell link by choosing the Create Shortcut command from an object's context menu. The system automatically creates an icon for the shell link by combining the object's icon with a small arrow (known as the system-defined link overlay icon) that appears in the lower left corner of the icon. A shell link that has an icon is called a <I>shortcut</I>; however, the terms shell link and shortcut are often used interchangeably. Typically, the user creates shortcuts to gain quick access to objects stored in subfolders or in shared folders on other machines. For example, a user can create a shortcut to a Microsoft Word document located in a subfolder and place the shortcut icon on the desktop. Later the user can start Word and open the document simply by double-clicking the shortcut icon. If the document is later moved or renamed, the system takes steps to update the shortcut the next time the user selects it.</P>

<P>Applications can also create and use shell links and shortcuts. For example, a word processing application might create a shell link to implement a list of the most recently used documents. An application creates a shell link by using the <A HREF="222z_k0.htm"><B>IShellLink</B></A> interface to create a shell link object and uses the <B>IPersistFile</B> or <B>IPersistStream </B>interface to store the object in a file or stream. This overview describes the <B>IShellLink</B> interface and explains how to use the interface to create and resolve shell links from within a Win32-based application. </P>

<P>Because the design of shell links is based on the OLE Component Object Model (COM), you should be familiar with the basic concepts of COM and OLE programming before reading this overview. </P>
