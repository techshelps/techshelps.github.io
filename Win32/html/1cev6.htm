<P>Although the mouse is an important input device for Windows-based applications, not every user necessarily has a mouse. An application can determine whether the system includes a mouse by passing the SM_MOUSEPRESENT value to the <A HREF="jolchi.htm"><B>GetSystemMetrics</B></A> function. </P>

<P>Windows supports a mouse having up to three buttons. On a three-button mouse, the buttons are designated as the left, middle, and right buttons. Windows messages and named constants related to the mouse buttons use the letters L, M, and R to identify the buttons. The button on a single-button mouse is considered to be the left button. Although Windows supports a mouse with multiple buttons, most applications use the left button primarily and use the others little, if at all. </P>

<P>An application can determine the number of buttons on the mouse by passing the SM_CMOUSEBUTTONS value to the <B>GetSystemMetrics</B> function. To configure the mouse for a left-handed user, the application can use the <A HREF="jdp5pv.htm"><B>SwapMouseButton</B></A> function to reverse the meaning of the left and right mouse buttons. Passing the SPI_SETMOUSEBUTTONSWAP value to the <A HREF="flzd_g.htm"><B>SystemParametersInfo</B></A> function is another way to reverse the meaning of the buttons. Note, however, that the mouse is a shared resource, so reversing the meaning of the buttons affects all applications. </P>
