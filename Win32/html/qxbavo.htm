<P>A <I>path</I> is one or more figures (or shapes) that are filled, outlined, or both filled and outlined. Applications written for Microsoft® Windows® use paths in many ways. Paths are used in drawing and painting applications. Computer-aided design (CAD) applications use paths to create unique clipping regions, to draw outlines of irregular shapes, and to fill the interiors of irregular shapes. An irregular shape is a shape composed of Bézier curves and straight lines. (A regular shape is an ellipse, a circle, a rectangle, or a polygon.) </P>
