<P>In a graceful disconnect, all the data sent by both sides are delivered and there is full acknowledgment of the session termination by both sides. This contrasts with an abortive disconnect, in which one side unilaterally terminates the connection, disregarding any queued data. As a result, in an abortive disconnect there may be data loss.</P>
