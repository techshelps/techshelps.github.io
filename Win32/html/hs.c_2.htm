<P><A NAME="hs.c_2"></A><B>About the Taskbar</B></P>

<P>The taskbar includes the <B>Start</B> menu, taskbar buttons, a shortcut menu, and a status area.</P>

<P>The <I><B>Start</B> menu</I> contains commands that can be used to access programs, documents, and settings. The <B>Start</B> menu items are <B>Programs</B>, <B>Documents</B>, <B>Settings</B>, <B>Find</B>, <B>Help</B>, <B>Run</B>, and <B>Shut Down</B>.</P>

<P>A <I>window button</I> is placed on the taskbar whenever an application creates a unowned primary window. To switch to a window, simply click its window button. </P>

<P>To open the shortcut menu, click the taskbar with the right mouse button. The <I>shortcut menu</I> includes commands to cascade windows, tile windows, minimize all windows, and set taskbar properties. </P>

<P>Applications can put icons in the <I>status area</I> to indicate the status of an operation or to notify the user about an event. For example, an application might put a printer icon in the status area to show that a print job is under way. The status area is at the right end of the taskbar (if the taskbar has a horizontal orientation) or at the bottom (if the taskbar has a vertical orientation). The status area will also contain the current time if the <B>Show Clock</B> check box is selected in the taskbar properties.</P>
