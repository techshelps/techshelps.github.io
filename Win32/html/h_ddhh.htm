<P><A NAME="h_ddhh"></A><B>The Netbios Function and IPC</B></P>

<P>The Win32 API provides the <A HREF="1dz00xb.htm"><B>Netbios</B></A> function to process low-level network control functions. This capability is provided primarily for applications written using the IBM NetBIOS system that must be ported to Windows. It is highly recommended that a developer writing a new application use the other IPC mechanisms described in this topic rather than the low-level <B>Netbios</B> function. The IPC mechanisms provided in the Win32 API encapsulate and hide an enormous amount of raw NetBIOS functionality that the developer would otherwise have to implement. </P>

<P>Consider, for example, the following list of NetBIOS actions that would be necessary to emulate a Win32-based mailslot: </P>

<P><B>On the server end</B></P>

<P>·Add the name to the local table. </P>

<P>·Listen for the session connection. </P>

<P>·Read the data upon connection. </P>

<P>·Append the data to the message queue. </P>

<P>·Close the session. </P>

<P>·Listen for another session connection. </P>

<P>·Allow the queued messages to be retrieved. </P>

<P></P>

<P><B>On the client side</B></P>

<P>·Open the session. </P>

<P>·Write the data. </P>

<P>·Close the session. </P>

<P></P>

<P><B>Key Point</B>  The <A HREF="1dz00xb.htm"><B>Netbios</B></A> function is provided only for porting an existing application written using the IBM NetBIOS system or for those applications that need specialized access to low-level network functionality. For most applications, it is better to use the higher-level IPC mechanisms available in the Win32 API. </P>
