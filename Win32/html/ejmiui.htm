<P>Event logging in Microsoft® Windows® provides a standard, centralized way for applications (and the operating system) to record important software and hardware events. It also supplies a standard user interface for viewing the logs and a programming interface for examining the logs. Event logging provides a means to merge events from various sources into a single informative story. </P>
