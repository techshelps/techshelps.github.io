<P>The mouse generates an input event whenever the user moves the mouse, or presses or releases a mouse button. Windows converts mouse input events into messages and posts them to the appropriate thread's message queue. When mouse messages are posted faster than a thread can process them, Windows discards all but the most recent mouse message. </P>

<P>A window receives a mouse message when a mouse event occurs while the cursor is within the borders of the window, or when the window has captured the mouse. Mouse messages are divided into two groups: client area messages and nonclient area messages. Typically, an application processes client area messages and ignores nonclient area messages. </P>
