<P><A NAME="m56w8r"></A><B>Scroll Bar Requests</B></P>

<P>The user makes scrolling requests by clicking various parts of a scroll bar. Windows sends the request to the given window in the form of a <A HREF="e_2m08.htm">WM_HSCROLL</A> or <A HREF="1i8puw5.htm">WM_VSCROLL</A> message. A horizontal scroll bar sends the WM_HSCROLL message; a vertical scroll bar sends the WM_VSCROLL message. Each message includes a notification code that corresponds to the user's action, to the handle of the scroll bar (scroll bar controls only), and, in some cases, to the position of the scroll box. </P>

<P>The following figure shows the notification messages that the user generates when clicking various parts of a scroll bar. </P>

<P><IMG SRC="../images/bm41.gif" ALT="" BORDER=0></P>

<P>The scroll bar notification codes specify the action the user takes. An application examines the codes that accompany the WM_HSCROLL and WM_VSCROLL messages and then performs the appropriate scrolling operation. In the following table of notification messages, the user's action is specified for each message, followed by the application's response. In each case, a unit is defined by the application as appropriate for the given data. For example, the typical unit for scrolling text vertically is a line of text. </P>

<P></P>

<P>A scroll bar generates the SB_THUMBPOSITION and SB_THUMBTRACK notification messages when the user clicks and drags the scroll box. An application should be programmed to process either the SB_THUMBTRACK or the SB_THUMBPOSITION notification message. </P>

<P>The SB_THUMBPOSITION notification message occurs when the user releases the mouse button after clicking the scroll box. An application that processes this message performs the scrolling operation after the user has dragged the scroll box to the desired position and released the mouse button. </P>

<P>SB_THUMBTRACK notification messages occur as the user drags the scroll box. If an application processes SB_THUMBTRACK messages, it can scroll the content of a window as the user drags the scroll box. However, a scroll bar can generate many SB_THUMBTRACK notification messages in a short period, so an application should process these messages only if it can quickly repaint the content of the window. </P>
