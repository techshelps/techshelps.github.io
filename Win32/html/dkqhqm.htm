<P><A NAME="dkqhqm"></A><B>Edit Control Selection Fields</B></P>

<P>The <I>selection field</I> is the portion of a combo box that displays the currently selected list item. In simple and drop-down combo boxes, the selection field is an edit control and can be used to enter text that is not in the list. </P>

<P>An application can retrieve or set the contents of the selection field and can determine or set the edit selection. The application can also limit the amount of text a user can type in the selection field. When the contents of the selection field change, Windows sends notification messages to the parent window or dialog box procedure. </P>

<P>To retrieve the content of the selection field, an application can send the <A HREF="g5lbj5.htm">WM_GETTEXT</A> message to the combo box. To set the contents of the selection field of a simple or drop-down combo box, an application can send the <A HREF="_0kjsb.htm">WM_SETTEXT</A> message to the combo box. </P>

<P>The <I>edit selection</I> is the range of selected text, if any, in the selection field of a simple or drop-down combo box. An application can determine the starting and ending character positions of the current selection by using the <A HREF="2tjd_t4.htm">CB_GETEDITSEL</A> message. It can also select characters in the edit selection by using the <A HREF="17jzrrw.htm">CB_SETEDITSEL</A> message. </P>

<P>Initially, the amount of text that the user can type into the selection field is limited by the size of the selection field. However, if the combobox has the CBS_AUTOHSCROLL style, the text can continue beyond the size of the selection field. An application can use the <A HREF="1mkmg.x.htm">CB_LIMITTEXT</A> message to limit the amount of text a user can type into the selection field, regardless of whether the control has the CBS_AUTOHSCROLL style.</P>

<P>When the user edits the content of the selection field, the parent window or dialog box procedure receives notification messages. <A HREF="6md2ynj.htm">CBN_EDITUPDATE</A> is sent first, indicating that the text in the selection field has been edited. After the altered text is displayed, Windows sends <A HREF="2u8j_mp.htm">CBN_EDITCHANGE</A>. When the selection field content changes as the result of a list item being selected, these messages are not sent. </P>
