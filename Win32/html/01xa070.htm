<P>Just as an application requires a display DC before it can begin drawing in the client area of a window, it needs a special printer DC before it can begin sending output to a printer. A printer DC is similar to a display DC in that it is an internal data structure that defines a set of graphic objects and their associated attributes and specifies the graphic modes that affect output. The graphic objects include a pen (for line drawing), a brush (for painting and filling), and a font (for text output). </P>

<P>Unlike a display DC, printer DCs are not owned by the window management component, and they cannot be obtained by calling the <A HREF="4f0b0z.htm"><B>GetDC</B></A> function. Instead, an application must call the <A HREF="14cje25.htm"><B>CreateDC</B></A> or <A HREF="11768vz.htm"><B>PrintDlg</B></A><B> </B>function. When an application calls <B>CreateDC</B>, it must supply a driver and port name. This data is stored in one of the operating system initialization (.INI) files. It can be retrieved by calling the <A HREF="1ir.guq.htm"><B>EnumPrinters</B></A> function. </P>

<P>When an application calls <B>PrintDlg</B> and specifies the PD_RETURNDC value in the <B>Flags</B> member of the <A HREF="17iw9wo.htm"><B>PRINTDLG</B></A> structure, Windows automatically returns a handle identifying the user's selected printer DC. For an example that demonstrates this task, see <A HREF="42cv0a2.htm">Using a Print Dialog Box and Retrieving a Printer Device Context</A>. </P>
