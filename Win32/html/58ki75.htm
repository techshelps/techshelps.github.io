<P>A policy (.POL) file is a registry hive, which is created by using the Win32 <A HREF="2_uq_4o.htm"><B>RegSaveKey</B></A> function.</P>

<P>The following top-level keys are defined:</P>

<P><B>·Computers</B></P>

<P><B>·Groups</B></P>

<P><B>·GroupData</B></P>

<P>·<B>Users</B></P>

<P>·<B>Misc</B></P>

<P></P>

<P>A policy downloader uses the following steps to download policies:</P>

<P>1.Locates the appropriate computer key, if any, under <B>Computers</B>. Beneath that key is an image of the registry settings to be merged. The policy downloader should walk through all the subkeys and values and merge those settings into the <B>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE</B> key, paying attention to the control codes that are defined in the following section.</P>

<P>2.Locates the appropriate groups key(s), if any, under <B>Groups</B>. Under the <B>Groups</B> keys is an image of the registry settings to be merged. These settings must be merged into the <B>HKEY_CURRENT_USER</B> key.</P>

<P>3.Locates the appropriate user key, if any, under <B>Users</B>. Under the <B>Users</B> key is an image of the registry settings to be merged. These settings must be merged into the <B>HKEY_CURRENT_USER</B> key.</P>
