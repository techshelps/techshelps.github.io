<P><A NAME="..w7wk"></A><B>Logical Disk Object</B></P>

<P>The Logical Disk performance object consists of counters that monitor logical partitions of a hard or fixed disk drives. Performance Monitor identifies logical disks by their a drive letter, such as C. </P>

<P><B>Free Space</B></P>

<P>Percent Free Space is the ratio of the free space available on the logical disk unit to the total usable space provided by the selected logical disk drive</P>

<P>Detail Level: Novice<BR>
Counter Type: PERF_RAW_FRACTION</P>

<P><B>% Free Space</B></P>

<P>Percent Free Space is the ratio of the free space available on the logical disk unit to the total usable space provided by the selected logical disk drive</P>

<P>Detail Level: Novice<BR>
Counter Type: PERF_RAW_BASE</P>

<P><B>Free Megabytes</B></P>

<P>Free Megabytes displays the unallocated space on the disk drive in megabytes. One megabyte = 1,048,576 bytes.</P>

<P>Detail Level: Novice<BR>
Counter Type: PERF_COUNTER_RAWCOUNT</P>

<P><B>Current Disk Queue Length</B></P>

<P>Current Disk Queue Length is the number of requests outstanding on the disk at the time the performance data is collected. It includes requests in service at the time of the snapshot. This is an instantaneous length, not an average over the time interval. Multi-spindle disk devices can have multiple requests active at one time, but other concurrent requests are awaiting service. This counter might reflect a transitory high or low queue length, but if there is a sustained load on the disk drive, it is likely that this will be consistently high. Requests are experiencing delays proportional to the length of this queue minus the number of spindles on the disks. This difference should average less than 2 for good performance.</P>
