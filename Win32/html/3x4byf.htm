<P><A NAME="3x4byf"></A><B>Nonclient Area Mouse Messages</B></P>

<P>A window receives a nonclient area mouse message when a mouse event occurs in any part of a window except the client area. A window's <I>nonclient area</I> consists of its border, menu bar, title bar, scroll bar, System menu (also called the Control menu), Minimize button, and Maximize button. </P>

<P>Windows generates nonclient area messages primarily for its own use. For example, Windows uses nonclient area messages to change the cursor to a two-headed arrow when the cursor hot spot moves into a window's border. A window must pass nonclient area mouse messages to the <A HREF="32d1nbh.htm"><B>DefWindowProc</B></A> function to take advantage of the built-in mouse interface found in Windows. </P>

<P>There is a corresponding nonclient area mouse message for each client area mouse message. The names of these messages are similar except that the named constants for the nonclient area messages include the letters "NC". For example, moving the cursor in the nonclient area generates a <A HREF="26rwyuz.htm">WM_NCMOUSEMOVE</A> message, and pressing the left mouse button while the cursor is in the nonclient area generates a <A HREF="_vmzy2.htm">WM_NCLBUTTONDOWN</A> message. </P>

<P>The <I>lParam</I> parameter of a nonclient area mouse message is a <A HREF="24h.4h.htm"><B>POINTS</B></A> structure that contains the x- and y-coordinates of the cursor hot spot. Unlike coordinates of client area mouse messages, the coordinates are given in <I>screen coordinates</I> rather than client coordinates. In the screen coordinate system, all points on the screen are relative to the coordinates (0,0) of the upper left corner of the screen. </P>

<P>The <I>wParam</I> parameter contains a <I>hit-test value</I>, a value that indicates where in the nonclient area the mouse event occurred. The following section explains the purpose of hit-test values. </P>
