<P><A NAME="4i53ha"></A><B>Using the NetBIOS Interface</B></P>

<P>The Windows implementation of NetBIOS is based on the NetBIOS 3.0 specification. However, the Windows implementation of the <A HREF="1dz00xb.htm"><B>Netbios</B></A> function includes the following enhancements that are not part of the NetBIOS 3.0 specification:</P>

<P>·POST routines can be called from the C programming languages by means of the <B>ncb_post</B> member of the <A HREF="35heyl.htm"><B>NCB</B></A> structure.</P>

<P>·Each asynchronous network control block can supply an event (in the <B>ncb_event</B> member of the <B>NCB</B> structure) which is set to the signaled state when the NCB completes.</P>

<P>·An application can enumerate all available LAN adapters by using the <B>NCBENUM</B> command in the <B>ncb_command</B> member of the <A HREF="35heyl.htm"><B>NCB</B></A> structure.</P>

<P>·The numbers of the network names (the <B>ncb_num</B> member of the <B>NCB</B> structure) are assigned on a per-process basis.</P>

<P>·Requests for the status of the local adapter retrieve only the names that were added by the process making the request.</P>

<P>·The value 1 for the <B>ncb_lana_num</B> member of the <A HREF="35heyl.htm"><B>NCB</B></A> structure is not exclusive when the NCBRESET command is issued. All MS-DOS and 16-bit Windows-based applications also share access to name number 1.</P>

<P>·The system does not monitor the number of outstanding NCB commands specified when the NCBRESET command is issued. The memory quota limit for Windows is used to limit the total resources an application can use.</P>

<P>·Asynchronous commands on invalid sessions are rejected when they are submitted.</P>

<P></P>
