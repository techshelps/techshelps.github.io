<P><A NAME="s0piw8"></A><B>About Ported LAN Manager Functions</B></P>

<P>For OS/2-based servers, the Microsoft® LAN Manager functions provided much of the functionality required for a network operating system; this functionality was missing from the local operating system. Windows NT has much of this network functionality built in. Therefore, some of the LAN Manager functions are not supported. However, the set of LAN Manager functions is extended to provide additional capability not included in Windows NT. In addition, you may use these functions to monitor and administer OS/2-based LAN Manager servers.  </P>

<P>The functions specified in this overview are designed to provide some of the API functionality that was available in LAN Manager 2.<I>x</I>. They are not the base Windows networking functions. Windows NT also provides a network-independent set of network functions (<A HREF="zgr1to.htm">WNet functions</A>) that allow network functions to work across different network vendors' products. If a base function or WNet function exists that could be used by your application, you should convert your code to use the WNet equivalent. There are at least two reasons to make the change: </P>

<P>1.The WNet functions are network independent, while the ported LAN Manager functions work only on LAN Manager networks.</P>

<P>2.Some of the Windows networking functions documented in this SDK may not be supported in future releases of Windows or Windows NT if they have been superseded by base functions or WNet functions. Microsoft does not plan to remove specific functions unless equivalent or better functionality is available.</P>

<P></P>

<P>In this documentation, equivalent functions are listed that could be used in place of a ported LAN Manager function. These are the functions your application should use if at all possible.</P>
