<P><A NAME="1otwjmp"></A><B>High-Level Console I/O</B></P>

<P>The high-level I/O functions provide a simple way to read a stream of characters from console input or to write a stream of characters to console output. A high-level read operation gets input characters from a console's input buffer and stores them in a specified buffer. A high-level write operation takes characters from a specified buffer and writes them to a screen buffer at the current cursor location, advancing the cursor as each character is written. </P>

<P>High-level I/O gives you a choice between the <A HREF="cjnd8p.htm"><B>ReadFile</B></A> and <A HREF="g0sox_.htm"><B>WriteFile</B></A> functions and the <A HREF="4z7f5n.htm"><B>ReadConsole</B></A> and <A HREF="5_0w_r1.htm"><B>WriteConsole</B></A> functions. They are identical, except for two important differences. The console functions support the use of either Unicode characters or the ANSI character set; the file I/O functions do not support Unicode. Also, the file I/O functions can be used to access files, pipes, and serial communications devices; the console functions can only be used with console handles. This distinction is important if an application relies on standard handles that may have been redirected. </P>

<P>When using either set of high-level functions, an application can control the text and background colors used to display characters subsequently written to a screen buffer. An application can also use the console modes that affect high-level console I/O to enable or disable the following properties: </P>

<P>·Echoing of keyboard input to the active screen buffer </P>

<P>·Line input, in which a read operation does not return until the ENTER key is pressed </P>

<P>·Automatic processing of keyboard input to handle carriage returns, CTRL+C, and other input details </P>

<P>·Automatic processing of output to handle line wrapping, carriage returns, backspaces, and other output details </P>
