<P>The Unicode standard does not prescribe a specific meaning for the control codes 0x000D (carriage return) and 0x000A (linefeed). There is no requirement that these codes be used in combination, and if used individually, either code may represent either itself only or both codes together. It is entirely up to the application to determine what these codes represent. (Applications have always had to interpret these control codes in ASCII; the Unicode policy is not a change in their use.) </P>
