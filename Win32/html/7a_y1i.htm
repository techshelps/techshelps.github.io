<P><A NAME="7a_y1i"></A><B>File Viewer Toolbar Buttons</B></P>

<P>A file viewer must include a toolbar with a single button tied to the Open File for Editing menu item on the File menu described previously. The image in this button is a 16- by 15-pixel bitmap derived from the icon of the application that would be started if the user opened the file from the shell (using the shell's association route). The image is obtained by calling the <A HREF="1o2ghja.htm"><B>SHGetFileInfo</B></A> function with the path of the file. If this function fails, a file viewer can include a button that contains its own image and attempt to start the parent application, or the file viewer can remove the button and disable the Open File for Editing menu item on the File menu. This single button must be the leftmost item on the toolbar and must be separated from any other buttons that are specific to the file viewer.</P>

<P><IMG SRC="../images/bm45.gif" ALT="" BORDER=0></P>

<P>Other buttons should correspond roughly to the functions present in the file viewer menus. A file viewer that supports a Font menu item should have Increase Font Size and Decrease Font Size buttons. Other file viewer classes may need to include printing and rotation buttons on the toolbar.</P>

<P>A standard toolbar button is the Replace Window button. The default behavior for file viewers is for a new file viewer instance to be created whenever the user chooses the Quick View menu item. When the Replace Window button is toggled to the on position, however, a new instance is not created; instead, the contents of the relevant file viewer window are replaced by a view of the new file.</P>

<P>All buttons should have a corresponding tooltip control that displays some context information when the mouse cursor is positioned on the button. The standard Windows 95 toolbar control provides built-in support for tooltip controls such that you only have to provide the text string. &lt;&gt; The following illustration shows a tooltip control for a toolbar button.</P>
