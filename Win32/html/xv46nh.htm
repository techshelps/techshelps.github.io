<P>The Win32 API provides two very different approaches to console I/O, the choice of which depends on how much flexibility and control an application needs. The high-level approach enables simple character stream I/O, but it limits access to a console's input and screen buffers. The low-level approach requires that developers write more code and choose among a greater range of functions, but it also gives an application more flexibility. </P>

<P>An application can use the file I/O functions, <A HREF="cjnd8p.htm"><B>ReadFile</B></A> and <A HREF="g0sox_.htm"><B>WriteFile</B></A>, and the console functions, <A HREF="4z7f5n.htm"><B>ReadConsole</B></A> and <A HREF="5_0w_r1.htm"><B>WriteConsole</B></A>, for high-level I/O that provides indirect access to a console's input and screen buffers. The high-level input functions filter and process the data in a console's input buffer to return input as a stream of characters, discarding mouse and buffer-resizing input. Similarly, the high-level output functions write a stream of characters that are displayed at the current cursor location in a screen buffer. An application controls the way these functions work by setting a console's I/O modes. </P>

<P>The low-level I/O functions provide direct access to a console's input and screen buffers, enabling an application to access mouse and buffer-resizing input events and extended information for keyboard events. Low-level output functions enable an application to read from or write to a specified number of consecutive character cells in a screen buffer, or to read or write to rectangular blocks of character cells at a specified location in a screen buffer. A console's input modes affect low-level input by enabling the application to determine whether mouse and buffer-resizing events are placed in the input buffer. A console's output modes have no effect on low-level output. </P>

<P>The high-level and low-level I/O methods are not mutually exclusive, and an application can use any combination of these functions. Typically, however, an application uses one approach or the other exclusively. </P>

<P>The sections that follow describe in detail the console modes and the high-level and low-level I/O functions. </P>
