<P>The <B>String</B> structure depicts the organization of data in a file-version resource. This structure is not a true C-language structure because it contains variable-length members.

<P>The <B>String</B> structure contains a string that describes a specific aspect of a file. </P>

<P><B>Remarks</B></P>

<P>A <B>String</B> structure may have an <B>szKey</B> value of, for example, "CompanyName" and a <B>Value</B> of "Microsoft Corporation". Another <B>String</B> structure with the same <B>szKey</B> value could contain a <B>Value</B> of "Microsoft GmbH". This might occur if the second <B>String</B> structure were associated with a <B>StringTable</B> structure whose <B>szKey</B> value is 040704b0 ¾ that is, German/Unicode. The code page can be set to 1200 (decimal) or 0x04b0 (hexadecimal) to indicate Unicode. The code page can also be set to the value that is appropriate for the language component. After you choose the value for the code page you should continue to use the same value in later revisions to the file. </P>
