<P>There are other circumstances where a read or write operation can be completed with fewer than the requested number of characters, even though a time-out has not occurred. Following are some examples: </P>

<P>·Some drivers support the use of special characters, which complete a read operation immediately with only the characters that have been read up to the point when they are received. </P>

<P>·The <A HREF="1xj.r43.htm"><B>PurgeComm</B></A> function can be called to prematurely terminate pending read or write operations. This function can also delete the contents of the output or input buffers, or both. </P>

<P>·If a communications error occurs during a read or write operation, all I/O operations on the communications resource are terminated. Break conditions, parity errors, or framing errors are examples of such errors. When an error occurs, the process must call the <A HREF="j1cecx.htm"><B>ClearCommError</B></A> function to clear the error flag before it can begin additional I/O operations. <B>ClearCommError</B> reports the specific error that occurred and the current status of the device. </P>
