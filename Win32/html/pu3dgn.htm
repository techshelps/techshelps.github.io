<P>Once an application receives a request for help, it should display the appropriate help information. Because the Windows Help application supports a variety of ways to display help and a user interface that is consistent with that used by Windows to display its own help information, it is recommended that applications use Windows Help rather than other ways to display help. To direct Windows Help to display help information, an application uses the <A HREF="1p1p.rf.htm"><B>WinHelp</B></A> function, specifying details such as the information to display and the form of the window in which to display it. The following sections explain how to use <B>WinHelp</B> to display help information.</P>
