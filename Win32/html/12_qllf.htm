<P><A NAME="12_qllf"></A><B>Visibility of Taskbar Buttons</B></P>

<P>A taskbar button is placed on the taskbar whenever an application creates a unowned primary window. To ensure that the window button is placed on the taskbar, create the window by calling <A HREF="rpk.pc.htm"><B>CreateWindowEx</B></A> and include the WS_EX_APPWINDOW style. To prevent the window button from being placed on the taskbar, create the window by calling <B>CreateWindowEx</B> and include the WS_EX_TOOLWINDOW style. As an alternative, you can create a hidden window and make it the owner of your primary window.</P>

<P>The window button typically contains the application icon and title. However, if the application does not contain a <B>window</B> menu, the window button is created without the icon. </P>

<P>If you want your application to display a message to the user while its window is not active, use the <A HREF="19dmzhl.htm"><B>FlashWindow</B></A> function to let the user know that a message is waiting. This function flashes the window button. Once the user clicks the window button to activate the window, your application can display the message.</P>
