<P><A NAME="c6t7lb"></A><B>Owned Windows</B></P>

<P>An overlapped or pop-up window can be owned by another overlapped or pop-up window. Being owned places several constraints on a window. </P>

<P>·An owned window is always above its owner in the Z order. </P>

<P>·Windows automatically destroys an owned window when its owner is destroyed. </P>

<P>·An owned window is hidden when its owner is minimized. </P>

<P></P>

<P>Only an overlapped or pop-up window can be an owner window; a child window cannot be one. An application creates an owned window by specifying the owner's window handle as the <I>hwndParent</I> parameter of <A HREF="rpk.pc.htm"><B>CreateWindowEx</B></A> when it creates a window with the WS_OVERLAPPED or WS_POPUP style. The <I>hwndParent</I> parameter must identify an overlapped or pop-up window. If <I>hwndParent</I> identifies a child window, Windows assigns ownership to the top-level parent window of the child window. After creating an owned window, an application cannot transfer ownership of the window to another window. </P>

<P>Dialog boxes and message boxes are owned windows by default. An application specifies the owner window when calling a function that creates a dialog box or message box. </P>

<P>An application can use the <A HREF=".20tr_.htm"><B>GetWindow</B></A> function with the GW_OWNER flag to retrieve the handle of a window's owner. </P>
