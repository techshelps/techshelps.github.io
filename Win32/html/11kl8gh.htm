<P><A NAME="11kl8gh"></A><B>Public/Private Key Pairs</B></P>

<P>For each user, the CSP usually maintains two public/private key pairs. These keys are maintained from session to session.</P>

<P>The <I>key exchange key pair</I> (also known as the <I>exchange key</I>) is used to encrypt session keys so that they can be safely stored and exchanged with other users. (This is discussed in detail in the section <A HREF="2jdzwvi.htm">Exchanging Cryptographic Keys</A>.)</P>

<P>The <I>digital signature key pair</I> (also known as the <I>signature key</I>) is used to sign either hashes of data. This is discussed in detail in the section <A HREF="41b3l2.htm">Hashes and Digital Signatures</A>.)</P>

<P>There are a number of reasons for having two separate key pairs. For example, some CSPs may opt to use one algorithm for key exchange and another for digital signatures. This is because some digital signature algorithms are unsuitable for encryption or key exchange, and vise versa. Also, if some data (for example, a session key) is both signed and encrypted with the same public key pair, subtle weaknesses could be introduced that make the data vulnerable.</P>

<P>The exchange key and the signature key pairs are created by calling the <A HREF="dnbayj.htm"><B>CryptGenKey</B></A> function and specifying either AT_KEYEXCHANGE or AT_SIGNATURE. The CSP implements these keys in an application-independent manner. Applications are not permitted to know the details about the algorithm used.</P>
