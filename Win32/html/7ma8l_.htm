<P>The Microsoft® Win32® API enables RAS client applications to perform the following tasks.</P>

<P>·Display any of the RAS common dialog boxes. This includes the main <B>Dial-Up Networking</B> dialog box, the <B>Dial-Up Networking Monitor </B>property sheet, and other dialog boxes for creating, editing, copying, or dialing a phone-book entry.</P>

<P>·Start and end a RAS connection operation using the common dialog boxes or the low-level dialing functions.</P>

<P>·Create, edit, or copy phone-book entries using the common dialog boxes or the low-level phone-book functions. </P>

<P>·Work with entries in the RAS AutoDial mapping database, which maps network addresses to the phone-book entry that can establish a connection to the address.</P>

<P>·Get RAS information, including information about existing RAS connections, information about the RAS-capable devices configured on the local computer, and notifications when a RAS connection begins or ends.</P>

<P></P>

<P>For Windows NT version 4.0, the Win32 API also provides support for RAS server administration and for third-party extensions to RAS server security and connection management. Windows 95 does not provide RAS server support.</P>
