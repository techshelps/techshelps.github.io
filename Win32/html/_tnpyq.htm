<P><A NAME="_tnpyq"></A><B>About Event Logging</B></P>

<P>When an error occurs in a Win32-based application, the system administrator or support personnel must determine what caused the error, attempt to recover any lost data, and prevent the error from recurring. If applications record important events such as low-memory conditions or excessive disk retries, the record of this information, called an <I>event log</I>, can be used to help determine what conditions may have caused the error and the context in which the error occurred. (Event logging can also be applied to the Windows operating system and to system services.) By periodically viewing the event log, the system administrator may be able to identify problems before they cause serious damage. </P>

<P>Many applications record errors and events in various proprietary error logs. These proprietary logs have different formats, apply different user interfaces for their display, and cannot be merged to provide a complete report. But all of these logs store similar information and present the logged data in similar ways. </P>
