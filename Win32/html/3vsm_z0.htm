<P><A NAME="3vsm_z0"></A><B>Process Address Space Object</B></P>

<P>The Process Address Space performance object consists of counters that monitor memory allocation and use for a selected process.</P>

<P><B>Bytes Image Reserved</B></P>

<P>Bytes Image Reserved is the sum of all virtual memory reserved by images run within this process.</P>

<P>Detail Level: Wizard<BR>
Counter Type: PERF_COUNTER_RAWCOUNT</P>

<P><B>ID Process</B></P>

<P>ID Process is the unique identifier of this process. ID Process numbers are reused, so they only identify a process for the lifetime of that process.</P>

<P>Detail Level: Wizard<BR>
Counter Type: PERF_COUNTER_RAWCOUNT</P>

<P><B>Bytes Image Free</B></P>

<P>Bytes Image Free is the amount of virtual address space that is not in use or reserved by images within this process.</P>

<P><B>Mapped Space No Access</B></P>

<P>Mapped Space is virtual memory that has been mapped  to a specific virtual address (or range of virtual addresses) in the process's virtual address space. No Access protection prevents a process from writing to or reading from these pages and will generate an access violation if either is attempted.</P>

Counter Type: PERF_COUNTER_RAWCOUNT</P>

<P><B>Mapped Space Read Only</B></P>

<P>Mapped Space is virtual memory that has been mapped  to a specific virtual address (or range of virtual addresses) in the process's virtual address space. Read Only protection prevents the contents of these pages from being modified. Any attempts to write or modify these pages will generate an access violation. </P>

<P><B>Mapped Space Write Copy</B></P>

<P>Mapped Space is virtual memory that has been mapped  to a specific virtual address (or range of virtual addresses) in the process's virtual address space. Write Copy protection is used when memory is shared for reading but not for writing. When processes are reading this memory, they can share the same memory, however, when a sharing process wants to have write access to this shared memory, a copy of that memory is made.</P>
