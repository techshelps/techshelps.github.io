<P>This section lists the SNMP functions and structures. These elements support SNMP for Windows NT.  </P>

<P>These functions support the development of SNMP <I>agent</I> applications and SNMP <I>manager</I> applications. An SNMP <I>agent</I> application is an SNMP application entity that responds to queries from SNMP manager applications and generates traps to SNMP manager applications. An SNMP <I>manager</I> application is an SNMP application entity that generates queries to SNMP agent applications and receives traps from SNMP agent applications.  </P>

<P>The Manager functions allow multiple manager applications to simultaneously coexist. ISV-developed manager applications use the Manager functions to perform SNMP manager operations. The SNMP Manager functions are implemented as a Win32 DLL and as a single detached process. The DLL and the single detached process interact with one or more ISV-developed manager applications. Miscellaneous utility functions are also available to assist with comparing, copying, and freeing allocated data structures. </P>
