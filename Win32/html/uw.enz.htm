<P>A window that receives keyboard input typically displays the characters the user types in the window's client area. A window should use a caret to indicate the position in the client area where the next character will appear. The window should also create and display the caret when it receives the keyboard focus, and hide and destroy the caret when it loses the focus. A window can perform these operations in the processing of the <A HREF="1ml4f9e.htm">WM_SETFOCUS</A> and <A HREF="558y_gq.htm">WM_KILLFOCUS</A> messages. For more information about carets, see <A HREF="32ns__3.htm">Carets</A>. </P>
