<P><A NAME="0rz_oj"></A><B>Connection States</B></P>

<P>During the process of connecting to a remote server, the Remote Access Connection Manager and the RAS server on the remote computer perform several steps to establish the connection. Each of these steps is identified by a connection state. The <A HREF="244j07_.htm"><B>RASCONNSTATE</B></A> enumeration is a set of values that correspond to these connection states. The connection states can be divided into the following three groups:</P>

<TABLE cols=2>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=27%>Running states</TD>
<TD width=73%>The running states are the parts of the connection operation that RAS handles automatically, such as connecting to the necessary devices, authenticating the user, and waiting for a callback from the remote server. Unless an error occurs, the RAS client need take no action other than to pass the notification on to the user.</TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=27%>Paused states</TD>
<TD width=73%>The <A HREF="1o5h4lk.htm">paused states</A> occur when the remote server pauses the connection operation to get additional input from the user. During a paused state, the user can type a <A HREF="7knowz.htm">callback</A> number, a different user name and password if the user authentication fails, or a new password if the old one has expired.</TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=27%>Terminal states</TD>
<TD width=73%>The terminal states occur when the connection has been successfully established, the connection operation has failed, or the connection has been broken by a <B>RasHangUp</B> call.</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE><BR>

<P></P>

<P>There are several mechanisms that a RAS client can use to determine the current state of a connection operation. When a RAS client executes the <A HREF="1zuv.va.htm"><B>RasDial</B></A> function asynchronously, the Remote Access Connection Manager sends progress notifications to the client's <A HREF="12eihmz.htm">notification handler</A> whenever the connection state changes. In addition, the client can use the <A HREF="11ewq3o.htm"><B>RasGetConnectStatus</B></A> function to get the current state of any RAS connection operation.</P>
