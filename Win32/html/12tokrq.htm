<P><A NAME="12tokrq"></A><B>Using Regions to Clip Output</B></P>

<P>This section contains a single example that demonstrates how you can use regions to enable the user to define how a part of client area output can appear. Regions used for this purpose are called clipping regions. </P>

<P>The example for this section is taken from a Windows-based application that enables a user to capture the entire desktop as a bitmap and then isolate and save a part of this image as a .BMP file. </P>

<P>By selecting the Define Clip Region option from the application's menu, the user is able to select a clipping region by clicking the left mouse button and dragging the mouse. As the user drags the mouse, the application draws a rectangle that corresponds to the new clipping region.</P>

<P>By selecting the Clip option, the user is able to redraw the isolated part of the image within the boundaries of the specified rectangle. </P>
