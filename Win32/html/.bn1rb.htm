<P><A NAME=".bn1rb"></A><B>Groups Key</B></P>

<P>The windows that appear in the Program Manager window correspond to group files. From the user's perspective, a group file is a collection of icons that represent logically related applications, but from the programmer's perspective, a group file is actually a collection of data. This data includes the color information for the icons (AND and XOR masks), an offset to the resource header of each icon, the ideal resolution for displaying each icon, the name of the executable (.EXE) file that contains the application, and so on. </P>

<P>There are two types of groups: common and personal. A common group is shared among multiple users through network connections; a personal group is not shared. Program Manager stores information about personal groups under the <B>Groups</B> key. It stores information about common groups under the <B>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE</B> key. </P>

<P>The <B>Groups</B> key of the registry identifies the names of the group files that Program Manager displays as unique windows or icons. The groups must be numbered, but they need not be listed in any particular order. Program Manager never changes the number of an existing group. </P>
