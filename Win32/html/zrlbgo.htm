<P>Each user generally has two public/private key pairs. One key pair is used to encrypt session keys and the other to create digital signatures. These are known as the <I>key exchange key pair</I> and the <I>signature key pair,</I> respectively. (These keys pairs are discussed later in detail.)</P>

<P>Note that the while key containers created by most CSPs will contain two key pairs, this is not required. Some CSPs do not store any key pairs while others store additional ones.</P>
