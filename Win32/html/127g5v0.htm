<P><A NAME="127g5v0"></A><B>Filling</B></P>

<P>An application fills the interior of a region by calling the <A HREF="2aj4_s6.htm"><B>FillRgn</B></A> function and supplying a handle that identifies a specific brush. When an application calls <B>FillRgn</B>, Windows fills the region with the brush by using the current fill mode for the specified device context. There are two fill modes: alternate and winding. The application can set the fill mode for a device context by calling the <A HREF="41q4.rg.htm"><B>SetPolyFillMode</B></A> function. The application can retrieve the current fill mode for a device context by calling the <A HREF="fh3re_.htm"><B>GetPolyFillMode</B></A> function. </P>

<P>The following illustration shows two identical regions: one filled using alternate mode and the other filled using winding mode. </P>

<P><IMG SRC="../images/bm99.gif" ALT="" BORDER=0></P>

<P><B>Alternate Mode</B></P>

<P>To determine which pixels Windows highlights when alternate mode is specified, perform the following test: </P>

<P>1.Select a pixel within the region's interior. </P>

<P>2.Draw an imaginary ray, in the positive x-direction, from that pixel towards infinity. </P>

<P>3.Each time the ray intersects a boundary line, increment a count value. </P>

<P></P>

<P>Windows highlights the pixel if the count value is an odd number. </P>

<P><B>Winding Mode</B></P>

<P>To determine which pixels Windows highlights when winding mode is specified, perform the following test: </P>

<P>1.Determine the direction in which each boundary line is drawn. </P>

<P>2.Select a pixel within the region's interior. </P>

<P>3.Draw an imaginary ray, in the positive x-direction, from the pixel toward infinity. </P>

<P>4.Each time the ray intersects a boundary line with a positive y-component, increment a count value. Each time the ray intersects a boundary line with a negative y-component, decrement the count value. </P>

<P></P>

<P>Windows highlights the pixel if the count value is nonzero. </P>
