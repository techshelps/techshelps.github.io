<P><A NAME="1y3b_b5"></A><B>Line and Paragraph Separators</B></P>

<P>Use the line-separator character (0x2028) and the paragraph-separator character (0x2029) to divide plain text. A new line is begun after each line separator. A new paragraph is begun after each paragraph separator. </P>

<P>Because these are separator codes, it is not necessary to start the first line or paragraph in the file with them, or to end the last line or paragraph with them. (Doing so would indicate that there is an empty line or paragraph in that location.) </P>

<P>The line separator can be used to indicate an unconditional end of line. However, line separators do not correspond to the carriage-return and linefeed characters, or to the carriage-return-linefeed character combination; they must be processed separately from carriage return and linefeed characters. </P>

<P>The paragraph separator can be inserted between paragraphs of text. This allows plain text files to be created that can be formatted with different line widths on different systems. The receiving system can ignore any line breaks and break paragraphs only at the paragraph separators. </P>
