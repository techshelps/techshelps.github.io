<P>A conversation between a client and a server is always established at the request of the client. When a conversation is established, each partner receives a handle that identifies the conversation. The partners use this handle in other DDEML functions to send transactions and manage the conversation. A client can request a conversation with a single server, or it can request multiple conversations with one or more servers. </P>

<P>The remaining topics in this section describe how an application establishes new conversations and gets information about existing conversations. </P>
