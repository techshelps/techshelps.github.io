<P><A NAME="1m3wjrb"></A><B>Size and Height</B></P>

<P>The window procedure for the status window automatically sets the initial size and position of the window, ignoring the values specified in the <A HREF="rpk.pc.htm"><B>CreateWindowEx</B></A> function. The width is the same as that of the parent window's client area. The height is based on the metrics of the font that is currently selected into the status window's device context and on the width of the window's borders.</P>

<P>The window procedure automatically adjusts the size of the status window whenever it receives a <A HREF="d9cb1f.htm">WM_SIZE</A> message. Typically, when the size of the parent window changes, the parent sends a WM_SIZE message to the status window. </P>

<P>An application can set the minimum height of a status window's drawing area by sending the window an <A HREF="1j28a8p.htm">SB_SETMINHEIGHT</A> message, specifying the minimum height, in pixels. The drawing area does not include the window's borders. A minimum height is useful for drawing in an owner-drawn status window. For more information about owner-drawn status windows, see <A HREF="1c9ex43.htm">Owner-Drawn Status Windows</A>. </P>

<P>You retrieve the widths of the borders of a status window by sending the window an <A HREF="9gtt86.htm">SB_GETBORDERS</A> message. The message includes the pointer to a three element array that receives the widths.</P>
