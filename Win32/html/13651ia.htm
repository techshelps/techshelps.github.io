<P><A NAME="13651ia"></A><B>Synchronization Objects</B></P>

<P>A <I>synchronization object</I> is an object whose handle can be specified in one of the <A HREF="y2tc_3.htm">wait functions</A> to coordinate the execution of multiple threads. More than one process can have a handle to the same synchronization object, making interprocess synchronization possible. </P>

<P>The following object types are provided exclusively for synchronization. </P>

<TABLE cols=2>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=19%><B>Type</B></TD>
<TD width=81%><B>Description</B></TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=19%>Event</TD>
<TD width=81%>Notifies one or more waiting threads that an event has occurred. For more information, see <A HREF="3uvwch0.htm">Event Objects</A>.</TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=19%>Mutex</TD>
<TD width=81%>Can be owned by only one thread at a time, enabling threads to coordinate mutually exclusive access to a shared resource. For more information, see <A HREF="cwj6re.htm">Mutex Objects</A>.</TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=19%>Semaphore</TD>
<TD width=81%>Maintains a count between zero and some maximum value, limiting the number of threads that are simultaneously accessing a shared resource. For more information, see <A HREF="22xgt9.htm">Semaphore Objects</A>.</TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=19%>Timer</TD>
<TD width=81%>Notifies one or more waiting threads that a specified time has arrived. For more information, see <A HREF="jy2wvk.htm">Waitable Timer Objects</A>.</TD>

<P></P>

<P>Though available for other uses, the following objects can also be used for synchronization. </P>

<TABLE cols=2>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=28%><B>Object</B></TD>
<TD width=72%><B>Description</B></TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=28%>Change notification</TD>
<TD width=72%>Created by the <A HREF="pu4_hm.htm"><B>FindFirstChangeNotification</B></A> function, its state is set to signaled when a specified type of change occurs within a specified directory or directory tree. For more information, see <A HREF="qnj9so.htm">Files</A>. </TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=28%>Console input</TD>
<TD width=72%>Created when a console is created. The handle to console input is returned by the <A HREF="xn35yd.htm"><B>CreateFile</B></A> function when CONIN$ is specified, or by the <A HREF="1b8l_fr.htm"><B>GetStdHandle</B></A> function. Its state is set to signaled when there is unread input in the console's input buffer, and nonsignaled when the input buffer is empty. For more information about consoles, see <A HREF="7re1xz.htm">Consoles and Character-Mode Support</A>. </TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=28%>Process</TD>
<TD width=72%>Created when a new process is created by calling the <A HREF="5fbj_xx.htm"><B>CreateProcess</B></A> function. Its state is set to nonsignaled while the process is running, and signaled when the process terminates. For more information about processes, see <A HREF="glns2h.htm">Processes and Threads</A>. </TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=28%>Thread</TD>
<TD width=72%>Created when a new thread is created by calling the <B>CreateProcess</B>, <A HREF="70ts0y.htm"><B>CreateThread</B></A>, or <A HREF="19iu6kt.htm"><B>CreateRemoteThread</B></A> function.

<P></P>

<P>In some circumstances, you can also use a file, named pipe, or communications device as a synchronization object; however, their use for this purpose is discouraged. For additional information about I/O operations on files, named pipes, or communications, see <A HREF="l05c8e.htm">Synchronization and Overlapped Input and Output</A>.</P>
