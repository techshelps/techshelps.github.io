<P>The Handle functions allow an application to examine or change the communications parameters for character-device handles and named-pipe handles, provided that the handles refer to devices or pipes opened on a remote server. The Handle functions are:</P>

<P><B>NetHandleGetInfo<BR>
NetHandleSetInfo</B></P>

<P>The adjustable parameters are based on the LANMAN.INI file entries for <B>chartime</B>,<B> </B>the amount of time the workstation collects data to send to a character device or named pipe, and <B>charcount</B>, the number of characters the workstation stores before it sends data to a character device. See the NET_HANDLE_INFO data structure to obtain the values for <B>chartime</B> and <B>charcount</B>. ,which determine the workstation data structure elements. In addition, you can use the <B>NetHandleGetInfo</B> function to identify the user of a named pipe, provided the pipe has been opened from a remote server. </P>
