<P><A NAME="11fjjks"></A><B>Certificates and Certification Authorities</B></P>

<P>A certificate is a packet of data that contains a user's public key in addition to the data that serves to identify the user in the real world (for example, the user's name). Every certificate is created and signed by a trusted application known as a certification authority.</P>

<P>Because certificates are signed, they can be transmitted over a nonsecure network or stored on nonsecure media. Each time you receive a certificate, you should verify the signature using the certification authority's public key.</P>

<P>Certain details relating to certificates are beyond the scope of CryptoAPI. These include:</P>

<P>·The actual binary format of certificates is not specified by CryptoAPI, although ISO X.509 is recommended.</P>

<P>·The manner in which each client communicates his or her name and public keys to the certification authority is not specified.</P>

<P>·The manner in which the certification authority's public key is distributed is not specified.</P>

<P></P>

<P></P>

<P><B>Warning</B>  If you use the Microsoft RSA Base Provider to create a certification authority, your license to issue certificates is limited to certificates intended for use in the context of your particular application or service.</P>
