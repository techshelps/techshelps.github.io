<P><A NAME="jq5wx9"></A><B>Designing a Protected Server</B></P>

<P>The designer of a server application that assigns security to private object types must make many decisions about the design of the security interface, such as those in the following list: </P>

<P>·Define object. </P>

<P>·Determine the types of objects and the access types required, including whether to support SYNCHRONIZE. </P>

<P>·Determine whether an object is a container or noncontainer, as well as the appropriate inheritance flags.  </P>

<P>·Define appropriate access types and generic mappings. </P>

<P>·Determine impersonation characteristics. </P>

<P>·Develop security descriptor for the initial object and for new objects assembled from the parent's security descriptor and the client's access token. </P>

<P>·Consider string- versus handle-based object-manipulation functions. </P>

<P>·Resolve potential conflicts in <A HREF="a48e53.htm">access rights</A>. For example, decide what is to be done if an administrator and a user both have delete access to an object. </P>

<P></P>

<P>For example, the designer of a protected print server might choose to define a server object, a printer object, and a document object. The three access rights in the following table are likely to be required: </P>
