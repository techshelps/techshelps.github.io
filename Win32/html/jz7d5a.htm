<P><A NAME="jz7d5a"></A><B>Cache Object</B></P>

<P>The Cache performance object consists of counters that monitor the file system cache, an area of physical memory that stores recently used data as long as possible to permit access to the data without having to read from the disk. Because applications typically use the cache, the cache is monitored as an indicator of application I/O operations. When memory is plentiful, the cache can grow, but when memory is scarce, the cache can become too small to be effective.</P>

<P><B>Data Maps/sec</B></P>

<P>Data Maps/sec is the frequency that a file system such as NTFS, maps a page of a file into the file system cache to read the page.</P>

<P>Detail Level: Expert<BR>
Counter Type: PERF_COUNTER_COUNTER</P>

<P><B>Sync Data Maps/sec</B></P>

<P>Sync Data Maps/sec counts the frequency that a file system, such as NTFS, maps a page of a file into the file system cache to read the page, and wishes to wait for the page to be retrieved if it is not in main memory.</P>

Counter Type: PERF_COUNTER_COUNTER</P>

<P><B>Async Data Maps/sec</B></P>

<P>Async Data Maps/sec is the frequency that an application using a file system, such as NTFS, to map a page of a file into the file system cache to read the page, and does not wait for the page to be retrieved if it is not in main memory. </P>

<P><B>Data Map Hits %</B></P>

<P>Data Map Hits is the percentage of data maps in the file system cache that could be resolved without having to retrieve a page from the disk, because the page was already in physical memory. </P>

<P><B>Pin Reads/sec</B></P>

<P>Pin Reads/sec is the frequency of reading data into the file system cache preparatory to writing the data back to disk. Pages read in this fashion are pinned in memory at the completion of the read. While pinned, a page's physical address in the file system cache will not be altered.</P>

<P><B>MDL Reads/sec</B></P>

<P>MDL Reads/sec is the frequency of reads from the file system cache that use a Memory Descriptor List (MDL) to access the data.

<P><B>Fast Reads/sec</B></P>

<P>Fast Reads/sec is the frequency of reads from the file system cache that bypass the installed file system and retrieve the data directly from the cache. Normally, file I/O requests invoke the appropriate file system to retrieve data from a file, but this path permits direct retrieval of data from the cache without file system involvement if the data is in the cache.
