<P>An application can identify a private clipboard format by defining a value in the range CF_PRIVATEFIRST through CF_PRIVATELAST. An application can use a private clipboard format for an application-defined data format that does not need to be registered with the system. </P>

<P>Data handles associated with private clipboard formats are automatically freed by the system. Windows that use private clipboard formats can use the <A HREF="gpx9d0.htm">WM_DESTROYCLIPBOARD</A> message to free any related resources that are no longer needed. </P>

<P>For more information about the WM_DESTROYCLIPBOARD message, see <A HREF="20.s_p7.htm">Clipboard Ownership</A>.</P>

<P>An application can place data handles on the clipboard by defining a private format in the range CF_GDIOBJFIRST through CF_GDIOBJLAST. When using values in this range, the data handle is not a handle to a GDI object, but is a handle allocated by the <A HREF="f12w9..htm"><B>GlobalAlloc</B></A> function with the GMEM_DDESHARE and GMEM_MOVEABLE flags. When the clipboard is emptied the system automatically deletes the object using the <A HREF="dvjhb..htm"><B>GlobalFree</B></A> function</P>
