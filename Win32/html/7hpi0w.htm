<P>The Windows operating system provides two predefined classes of system messages: device messages and power messages. Device messages notify applications and installable drivers of device change events; power messages notify these of power management events. Applications and other components can also define and use their own system messages to provide for notification of other types of events.</P>

<P>This overview describes system messages, system-message broadcasts, and the specific class of system messages called device messages. For more information about power messages, see <A HREF="xd3rtk.htm">Power Management</A>. </P>
