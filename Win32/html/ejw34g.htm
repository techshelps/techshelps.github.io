<P>If a new process inherits a handle, it also inherits the security attributes associated with that handle. A pointer to a <A HREF="be53kg.htm"><B>SECURITY_ATTRIBUTES</B></A> structure is used as a parameter in most Win32 kernel and window-management functions that return object handles. The <B>bInheritHandle</B> member of this structure specifies whether the returned handle is inherited when a new process is created. The security attributes of the inherited handle are identical to those of the original handle. </P>
