<P>Symmetric algorithms are the most common type of encryption algorithm. They are known as symmetric because the same key is used for both encryption and decryption. Unlike the keys used with public-key algorithms, symmetric keys are frequently changed. For this reason, they are referred to here as <I>session keys</I>.</P>

<P>Compared to public-key algorithms, symmetric algorithms are very fast and, thus, are preferred when encrypting large amounts of data. Some of the more common symmetric algorithms are RC2, RC4, and the Data Encryption Standard (DES).</P>
