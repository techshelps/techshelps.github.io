<P><A NAME="he7lkj"></A><B>About SNMP</B></P>

<P>SNMP uses a distributed architecture consisting of <I>management systems</I> and <I>agents</I>. The SNMP agent is responsible for retrieving and updating local management information based on the requests of the management system. The SNMP agent also notifies registered management systems when a significant event occurs. </P>

<P>A Windows NT management system is any computer that has loaded the TCP/IP or IPX transport and is running third-party SNMP manager software. To use the Microsoft SNMP Service, you need at least one management system. The primary function of a management system is to request information from an agent. The management system initiates <B>Get</B>, <B>Get Next</B>, and <B>Set</B> operations. </P>

<P>·The <B>Get</B> operation is a request for a specific value, such as the amount of hard disk space available. </P>

<P>·The <B>Get Next</B> operation is a request for the value after a specified value in the conceptual database of management information that the agent maintains. </P>

<P>·The <B>Set</B> operation changes a value. </P>

<P>The primary function of an agent is to perform the <B>Get</B><I>, </I><B>Get Next</B><I>,</I> and <B>Set</B> operations requested by a management system. The only operation initiated by an agent is the <B>trap</B>, which alerts management systems to an extraordinary event, such as a password violation. The SNMP Service performs the duties of an SNMP agent on a computer running Windows NT. </P>
