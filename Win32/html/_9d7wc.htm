<P><A NAME="_9d7wc"></A><B>About Security</B></P>

<P>The security functions in the Microsoft Win32® application programming interface (API) allow an application to selectively grant and deny access to an object. An application can specify many different kinds of access for particular users and groups of users. The operating system grants or denies access to an object based on a comparison of the security provisions stored with an object with the access rights specified in a token associated with the process or thread requesting the access. These security functions allow an application to query and manipulate the security features of both an object and a process or thread. </P>

<P>The impact of Windows security on most Windows functions is minimal, and a Windows-based application not requiring security functionality usually does not need to incorporate any special code. However, a developer can use the security features of Windows NT to provide a number of services in a Windows-based application. Generally, any application that manipulates a system-wide resource such as the system time, must use the security system to gain access to that resource. A security-aware application might allow the user to query the security attributes of a file, provide specialized feedback when access to a secure file is denied, or customize the security attributes of a file or group of files so that only a subset of other users on a network has access to the information. </P>

<P>Windows NT is designed to support C2-level security as defined by the US Department of Defense. Some of the most important requirements of C2-level security are shown in the following list. </P>

<P>·It must be possible to control access to a resource. This access control must include or exclude individual users or named groups of users. </P>

<P>·Memory must be protected so its contents cannot be read after it is freed by a process. </P>

<P>·Users must identify themselves in a unique manner when they log on. All auditable actions must identify the user performing the action. </P>

<P>·System administrators must be able to audit security-related events. Access to this audit data must be limited to authorized administrators. </P>

<P>·The system must protect itself from external interference or tampering, such as modification of the running system or of system files stored on disk. </P>
