<P><A NAME="_kvdmi"></A><B>The License System Response</B></P>

<P>The license system first attempts to authenticate the message digest that the application sends as the challenge by performing the following steps: </P>

<P>1.Look up the secret stored within the license. </P>

<P>2.Compute a message digest with the MD4 Message-Digest Algorithm supplied by RSA Data Security, Inc. </P>

<P>3.Compare this message digest to the one passed by the application initiating the challenge. </P>

<P>4.Compute another message digest and passes it in the <A HREF="7eg8nz.htm"><B>LS_MSG_DIGEST</B></A> structure as the challenge response back to the application. The result of this encryption scheme is unique. For additional information about the format of this message digest, see <A HREF="12kqvfr.htm"><B>LS_CHALLDATA</B></A>. </P>

<P></P>

<P>The server cannot respond correctly to the challenge if it does not have the secrets associated with a particular license. The license system does not return a challenge response if either a license request or an update is unsuccessful. </P>
