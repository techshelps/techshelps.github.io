<P></P>

<P><B>Parameters</B></P>

<P><I>lpClassName</I></P>

<P>Points to a null-terminated string or is an integer atom. If this parameter is an atom, it must be a global atom created by a previous call to the <A HREF="1qh2cm4.htm"><B>GlobalAddAtom</B></A> function. The atom, a 16-bit value less than 0xC000, must be in the low-order word of <I>lpClassName</I>; the high-order word must be zero. </P>

<P>If <I>lpClassName</I> is a string, it specifies the window class name. The class name can be any name registered with the <A HREF="6v_00hu.htm"><B>RegisterClass</B></A> function or any of the predefined control-class names. For a complete list, see the following Remarks section. </P>

<P><I>lpWindowName</I></P>

<P>Points to a null-terminated string that specifies the window name. </P>

<P><I>dwStyle</I></P>

<P>Specifies the style of the window being created. This parameter can be a combination of the window styles and control styles listed in the following Remarks section. </P>

<P><I>x</I></P>

<P>Specifies the initial horizontal position of the window. For an overlapped or pop-up window, the <I>x</I> parameter is the initial x-coordinate of the window's upper-left corner, in screen coordinates. For a child window, <I>x</I> is the x-coordinate of the upper-left corner of the window relative to the upper-left corner of the parent window's client area. </P>

<P>If this parameter is set to CW_USEDEFAULT, Windows selects the default position for the window's upper-left corner and ignores the <I>y</I> parameter. CW_USEDEFAULT is valid only for overlapped windows; if it is specified for a pop-up or child window, the <I>x</I> and <I>y</I> parameters are set to zero. </P>

<P><I>y</I></P>

<P>Specifies the initial vertical position of the window. For an overlapped or pop-up window, the <I>y</I> parameter is the initial y-coordinate of the window's upper-left corner, in screen coordinates. For a child window, <I>y</I> is the initial y-coordinate of the upper-left corner of the child window relative to the upper-left corner of the parent window's client area. For a list box, <I>y</I> is the initial y-coordinate of the upper-left corner of the list box's client area relative to the upper-left corner of the parent window's client area. </P>

<P>If an overlapped window is created with the WS_VISIBLE style bit set and the <I>x</I> parameter is set to CW_USEDEFAULT, Windows ignores the <I>y</I> parameter. </P>

<P><I>nWidth</I></P>

<P>Specifies the width, in device units, of the window. For overlapped windows, <I>nWidth</I> is either the window's width, in screen coordinates, or CW_USEDEFAULT. If <I>nWidth</I> is CW_USEDEFAULT, Windows selects a default width and height for the window; the default width extends from the initial x-coordinate to the right edge of the screen, and the default height extends from the initial y-coordinate to the top of the icon area. CW_USEDEFAULT is valid only for overlapped windows; if CW_USEDEFAULT is specified for a pop-up or child window, <I>nWidth</I> and <I>nHeight</I> are set to zero. </P>

<P><I>nHeight</I></P>

<P>Specifies the height, in device units, of the window. For overlapped windows, <I>nHeight</I> is the window's height, in screen coordinates. If <I>nWidth</I> is set to CW_USEDEFAULT, Windows ignores <I>nHeight</I>. </P>

<P><I>hWndParent</I></P>

<P>Identifies the parent or owner window of the window being created. A valid window handle must be supplied when a child window or an owned window is created. A child window is confined to the client area of its parent window. An owned window is an overlapped window that is destroyed when its owner window is destroyed or hidden when its owner is minimized; it is always displayed on top of its owner window. Although this parameter must specify a valid handle if the <I>dwStyle</I> parameter includes the WS_CHILD style, it is optional if <I>dwStyle</I> includes the WS_POPUP style. </P>

<P><I>hMenu</I></P>

<P>Identifies a menu, or specifies a child-window identifier depending on the window style. For an overlapped or pop-up window, <I>hMenu</I> identifies the menu to be used with the window; it can be NULL if the class menu is to be used. For a child window, <I>hMenu</I> specifies the child-window identifier, an integer value used by a dialog box control to notify its parent about events. The application determines the child-window identifier; it must be unique for all child windows with the same parent window. </P>

<P><I>hInstance</I></P>

<P>Identifies the instance of the module to be associated with the window. </P>

<P><I>lpParam</I></P>

<P>Points to a value passed to the window through the <A HREF="19uxhwn.htm"><B>CREATESTRUCT</B></A> structure referenced by the <I>lParam</I> parameter of the <A HREF="2re1yt3.htm">WM_CREATE</A> message. If an application calls <B>CreateWindow</B> to create a multiple document interface (MDI) client window, <I>lpParam</I> must point to a <A HREF="1s_jdbh.htm"><B>CLIENTCREATESTRUCT</B></A> structure. </P>

<P></P>

<P><B>Return Values</B></P>

<P>If the function succeeds, the return value is the handle to the new window.</P>

<P>If the function fails, the return value is NULL. To get extended error information, call <A HREF="11c2vs7.htm"><B>GetLastError</B></A>. </P>

<P><B>Remarks</B></P>

<P>Before returning, <B>CreateWindow</B> sends a <A HREF="2re1yt3.htm">WM_CREATE</A> message to the window procedure. </P>

<P>For overlapped, pop-up, and child windows, <B>CreateWindow</B> sends <A HREF="2re1yt3.htm">WM_CREATE</A>, <A HREF="jv9zt5.htm">WM_GETMINMAXINFO</A>, and <A HREF="11ps3hu.htm">WM_NCCREATE</A> messages to the window. The <I>lParam</I> parameter of the <A HREF="2re1yt3.htm">WM_CREATE</A> message contains a pointer to a <A HREF="19uxhwn.htm"><B>CREATESTRUCT</B></A> structure. If the WS_VISIBLE style is specified, <B>CreateWindow</B> sends the window all the messages required to activate and show the window. </P>

<P>If the window style specifies a title bar, the window title pointed to by <I>lpWindowName</I> is displayed in the title bar. When using <B>CreateWindow</B> to create controls, such as buttons, check boxes, and static controls, use <I>lpWindowName</I> to specify the text of the control. </P>

<P>If you specify Windows version 4.x when linking your application, its windows cannot have caption buttons unless they also have <B>window</B> menus. This is not a requirement for applications that you linked specifying Windows version 3.x. </P>

<P>The following predefined control classes can be specified in the <I>lpClassName</I> parameter: </P>

<TABLE cols=2>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=22%><B>Class</B></TD>
<TD width=78%><B>Meaning</B></TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=22%>BUTTON</TD>
<TD width=78%>Designates a small rectangular child window that represents a button the user can click to turn it on or off. Button controls can be used alone or in groups, and they can either be labeled or appear without text. Button controls typically change appearance when the user clicks them.</TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=22%>COMBOBOX</TD>
<TD width=78%>Designates a control consisting of a list box and a selection field similar to an edit control. When using this style, an application should either display the list box at all times or enable a drop-down list box.</TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=22%>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD width=78%>Depending on the style of the combo box, the user can or cannot edit the contents of the selection field. If the list box is visible, typing characters into the selection field highlights the first list box entry that matches the characters typed. Conversely, selecting an item in the list box displays the selected text in the selection field.</TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=22%>EDIT</TD>
<TD width=78%>Designates a rectangular child window into which the user can type text from the keyboard. The user selects the control and gives it the keyboard focus by clicking it or moving to it by pressing the TAB key. The user can type text when the edit control displays a flashing caret; use the mouse to move the cursor, select characters to be replaced, or position the cursor for inserting characters; or use the BACKSPACE key to delete characters.</TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=22%>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD width=78%>Edit controls use the variable-pitch system font and display characters from the ANSI character set. The <A HREF="_0_tib.htm">WM_SETFONT</A> message can also be sent to the edit control to change the default font.</TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=22%>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD width=78%>Edit controls expand tab characters into as many space characters as are required to move the caret to the next tab stop. Tab stops are assumed to be at every eighth character position.</TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=22%>LISTBOX</TD>
<TD width=78%>Designates a list of character strings. Specify this control whenever an application must present a list of names, such as filenames, from which the user can choose. The user can select a string by clicking it. A selected string is highlighted, and a notification message is passed to the parent window. Use a vertical or horizontal scroll bar with a list box to scroll lists that are too long for the control window. The list box automatically hides or shows the scroll bar, as needed.</TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=22%>MDICLIENT</TD>
<TD width=78%>Designates an MDI client window. This window receives messages that control the MDI application's child windows. The recommended style bits are WS_CLIPCHILDREN and WS_CHILD. Specify the WS_HSCROLL and WS_VSCROLL styles to create an MDI client window that allows the user to scroll MDI child windows into view.</TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=22%>SCROLLBAR</TD>
<TD width=78%>Designates a rectangle that contains a scroll box and has direction arrows at both ends. The scroll bar sends a notification message to its parent window whenever the user clicks the control. The parent window is responsible for updating the position of the scroll box, if necessary. Scroll bar controls have the same appearance and function as scroll bars used in ordinary windows. Unlike scroll bars, however, scroll bar controls can be positioned anywhere in a window for use whenever scrolling input is needed for a window.</TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=22%>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD width=78%>The scroll bar class also includes size box controls. A size box is a small rectangle the user can expand to change the size of the window.</TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=22%>STATIC</TD>
<TD width=78%>Designates a simple text field, box, or rectangle used to label, box, or separate other controls. Static controls take no input and provide no output.</TD>
</TR>

<TD width=34%>DS_CONTEXTHELP</TD>
<TD width=66%>Includes a question mark in the title bar of the dialog box. When the user clicks the question mark, the cursor changes to a question mark with a pointer. If the user then clicks a control in the dialog box, the control receives a WM_HELP message. The control should pass the message to the dialog procedure, which should call the <A HREF="1p1p.rf.htm"><B>WinHelp</B></A> function using the HELP_WM_HELP command. The Help application displays a pop-up window that typically contains help for the control.
<P>Note that DS_CONTEXTHELP is just a placeholder. When the dialog box is created, the system checks for DS_CONTEXTHELP and, if it is there, adds WS_EX_CONTEXTHELP to the extended style of the dialog box. WS_EX_CONTEXTHELP cannot be used with the WS_MAXIMIZEBOX or WS_MINIMIZEBOX styles. </P>
</TD>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=34%>DS_CONTROL</TD>
<TD width=66%>Creates a dialog box that works well as a child window of another dialog box, much like a page in a property sheet. This style allows the user to tab among the control windows of a child dialog box, use its accelerator keys, and so on.</TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=34%>DS_FIXEDSYS</TD>
<TD width=66%>Use SYSTEM_FIXED_FONT instead of SYSTEM_FONT.</TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=34%>DS_LOCALEDIT</TD>
<TD width=66%>Applies to 16-bit applications only. This style directs edit controls in the dialog box to allocate memory from the application's data segment. Otherwise, edit controls allocate storage from a global memory object.</TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=34%>DS_MODALFRAME</TD>
<TD width=66%>Creates a dialog box with a modal dialog-box frame that can be combined with a title bar and <B>window</B> menu by specifying the WS_CAPTION and WS_SYSMENU styles.</TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=34%>DS_NOFAILCREATE</TD>
<TD width=66%>Creates the dialog box even if errors occur  for example, if a child window cannot be created or if the system cannot create a special data segment for an edit control.</TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=34%>DS_NOIDLEMSG</TD>
<TD width=66%>Suppresses <A HREF="uq_gln.htm">WM_ENTERIDLE</A> messages that Windows would otherwise send to the owner of the dialog box while the dialog box is displayed.</TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=34%>DS_SETFONT</TD>
<TD width=66%>Indicates that the dialog box template (the <A HREF="xaubx..htm"><B>DLGTEMPLATE</B></A> structure) contains two additional members specifying a font name and point size. The corresponding font is used to display text within the dialog box client area and within the dialog box controls. Windows passes the handle of the font to the dialog box and to each control by sending them the <A HREF="_0_tib.htm">WM_SETFONT</A> message.</TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=34%>DS_SETFOREGROUND</TD>
<TD width=66%>Does not apply to 16-bit versions of Microsoft Windows. This style brings the dialog box to the foreground. Internally, Windows calls the <B>SetForegroundWindow</B> function for the dialog box.</TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=34%>DS_SYSMODAL</TD>
<TD width=66%>Creates a system-modal dialog box. This style causes the dialog box to have the WS_EX_TOPMOST style, but otherwise has no effect on the dialog box or the behavior of other windows in the system when the dialog box is displayed.</TD>
