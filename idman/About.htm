<DIV>Internet Download Manager has a built-in download logic accelerator
that features intelligent dynamic file segmentation and safe multipart
downloading technology to accelerate your downloads. Unlike other download
accelerators and managers that segment files before downloading starts, Internet
Download Manager segments downloaded files dynamically during download process.
Internet Download Manager also reuses available connections without additional
connect and login stages to achieve better acceleration performance.

broken or interrupted downloads due to lost connections, network problems,
computer shutdowns, or unexpected power outages. Simple graphic user interface
makes IDM user friendly and easy to use. </DIV>
