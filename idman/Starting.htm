<P align=center><STRONG>Downloading with IDM in automatic mode</STRONG></P><div>This method to start downloads&nbsp;is the easiest one. IDM takes over downloads from Internet Explorer, MSN Explorer,
AOL, Opera, Mozilla and Netscape browsers, and starts&nbsp;downloading files automatically when users click on download links.</div>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>      If you click on a download link in Internet Explorer or in another browser, IDM will take over and accelerate this download. In this case you don't need to do anything special, just browse the Internet as you usually do. IDM takes over a download from Internet Explorer if its type matches the list of types/extensions. The list of file types/extensions to download with IDM can be edited in <A href="Options.htm">Options</A>-&gt;General. If IDM has taken over a
download, it shows the following dialog</DIV>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<DIV align=center><IMG alt="Image ie-capture.png" src="ie-capture.png" border =0 ></DIV>
<DIV align=center><EM>Download File Info </EM>Dialog</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>If you click on <b>Download Later</b> button, URL (web address) will be added to the list of downloads, but
the download process doesn't start. If you click on <b>Start Download</b> button, IDM will start downloading the file immediately. IDM lets you associate
your downloads with IDM categories. IDM suggests the category and the default
download directory according to file type. You may edit categories, delete and
add new categories in the <A href="Main.htm">main IDM window</A>. If you want
to see the contents of&nbsp;a zip file before downloading, you may click on
<STRONG>Preview</STRONG> button.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>IDM will take over any download if you hold down the <b>CTRL</b> key while clicking its download link in Internet Explorer. (you should check "Use <b>CTRL</b> key with IE
click monitoring" box in "IDM Options-&gt;General").</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>
If you hold down the <b>ALT</b> key while clicking on a download link in IE, IDM will not take over the download and let Internet Explorer download the file. (you should check "Use <b>ALT</b> key with IE click monitoring" box in "IDM
Options-&gt;General")</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>If you don't want IDM to take over any downloads from a browser, turn off
the browser integration in IDM options. After turning off or on the browser
integration in "IDM Options-&gt;General", don't forget to restart the
browser.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Remember if Internet Download Manager had problems downloading file, you should press <b>Alt </b>while clicking on a link to let the
browser process the download.</DIV>
