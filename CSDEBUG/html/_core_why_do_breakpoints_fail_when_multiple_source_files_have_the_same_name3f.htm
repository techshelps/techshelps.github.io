<P class=T>If two or more source files in the project have the same name, the debugger may have trouble determining which file the breakpoint is set in. This often happens if you create a module with the same name as a component of the Debug library you are linking to.</P>

<P class=T>To fix this problem, enter the full pathname for the source file. You can change the file name on the <B>File</B> tab of the <B>Breakpoint Properties</B> dialog box.</P>
