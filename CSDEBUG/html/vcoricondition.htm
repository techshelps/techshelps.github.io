<H1><A NAME="vcoricondition"></A>Condition</H1>

<P class=T>A break condition is an expression that gets evaluated when the breakpoint is reached. The result of the evaluation determines whether the breakpoint is hit. If the breakpoint is hit (and the hit count is correct), the debugger breaks execution.</P>

<P class=T>To specify or change a breakpoint condition, you must open the <B>Breakpoint Condition</B> dialog box. </P>

<P class=T>The condition can be any valid expression recognized by the debugger. </P>

<P class=T>You can specify how the condition is satisfied:

<UL>
	<LI class=LB1>When the expression is true (<B>is true</B> in the <B>Breakpoint Condition</B> dialog box)</LI>
</UL>

<P class=T>- or -

<UL>
	<LI class=LB1>When the value of the expression changes (<B>has changed</B> in the <B>Breakpoint Condition</B> dialog box)
<P class=LNT><B>Note</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you first set a breakpoint that uses <B>has changed</B>, the expression has no value. When the breakpoint is reached, the expression is evaluated and stored. The debugger does not consider that evaluation and store to be a change, so the debugger does not stop the first time the breakpoint is reached.
</LI>
</UL>
