<P class=T><B>Native Only </B>When you are using interface elements such as the Watch window, the Visual Studio debugger automatically expands common data types to show their most important elements. If you have your own custom data types that you want the debugger to autoexpand, you can add rules to the file autoexp.dat, which is located in the \bin directory. Instructions on how to write autoexp rules are located in the file itself. The structure of this file and the syntax of autoexp rules may change from one release of Visual Studio to the next.</P>
