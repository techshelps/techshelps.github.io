<H1><A NAME="vchowsettingexecutionpoint"></A>Setting the Execution Point</H1>

<P class=T>In the debugger, you can move the execution point to set the next statement of code to be executed. An arrowhead in the margin of a source window marks the current location of the execution point. By moving the execution point, you can skip over a portion of code or return to a line previously executed. This can be useful in some situations &#0151; for example, if you want to skip a section of code that contains a known bug and continue debugging other sections. </P>

<P class=NT><B>Caution</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Changing the execution point causes the program counter to jump directly to the new location. Use this command with caution. Note that:

<UL>
	<LI class=LB2>Instructions between the old and new execution points are not executed. </LI>

	<LI class=LB2>If you move the execution point backwards, intervening instructions are not undone. </LI>

	<LI class=LB2>Moving the execution point to another function or scope usually results in call-stack corruption, causing a run-time error or exception. If you try moving the execution point to another scope, the debugger opens a dialog box that gives you a warning and a chance to cancel the operation.</LI>
</UL>

<P class=T>You cannot set the execution point while your application is actively running. To set the next statement, the debugger must be in break mode.</P>

<P><B>To set the next statement to execute</B>

<OL>
	<LI class=LPROC>In a source window, click to select the statement you want to execute next.</LI>

	<LI class=LPROC>From the <B>Debug</B> menu, choose <B>Set Next Statement</B>. </LI>
</OL>

<P class=T>If the current execution point is in the same source file as the statement you want to set, you can move the execution point by dragging the marker arrow:</P>

<P><B>To set the next statement to execute (alternative method)</B>

<UL>
	<LI class=LB1>In a source window, click the execution point marker (yellow arrowhead) and drag it to a location in the same source file where you want to set the next statement.</LI>
</UL>
