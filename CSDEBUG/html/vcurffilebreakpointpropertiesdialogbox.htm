<P class=T>The following controls allow you to set properties for a breakpoint on a source file location:</P>

<P class=DT1><B>File</B></P>

<P class=IND>The name, and optional path, of the file in which the breakpoint is set. </P>

<P class=DT1><B>Line</B></P>

<P class=IND>The source-code line number, measured from the start of the function, at which the breakpoint is set. If this value is 1, the breakpoint is set at the start of the file.</P>

<P class=DT1><B>Character</B></P>

<P class=IND>The character within the source-code line where the function is set. If you think of the line number as a row number, the character number would be a column number. In most cases, you can leave this value set to 1, which sets the breakpoint at the start of the line. Sometimes, however, you may have more than one statement on a line. In that case, you can use the <B>Character</B> value to set the breakpoint on a specific statement within the line. </P>
