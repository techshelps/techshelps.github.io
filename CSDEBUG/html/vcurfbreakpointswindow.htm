<H1><A NAME="vcurfbreakpointswindow"></A>Breakpoints Window</H1>

<P class=T>To open the Breakpoints window, from the <B>Debug</B> menu, choose <B>Windows</B>, and then choose <B>Breakpoints</B>.</P>

<P class=T>The Breakpoints window contains a toolbar and a list of breakpoints currently set in your program. The toolbar contains the following tools:</P>

<P class=DT1><B>New (Breakpoint)</B></P>

<P class=IND>Opens a dialog box that gives you complete options for creating a new breakpoint. </P>

<P class=DT1><B>Delete</B></P>

<P class=IND>Removes whatever breakpoint is currently selected. You cannot undo this operation.</P>

<P class=DT1><B>Go to Source Code</B></P>

<P class=IND>Opens a source window, if necessary, and shows you the location where the breakpoint is set.</P>

<P class=DT1><B>Columns</B></P>

<P class=IND>Selects the informational columns that appear in the breakpoint list.</P>

<P class=DT1><B>Properties</B></P>

<P class=IND>Opens a dialog box that allows you to edit any breakpoint property.</P>

<P class=T>The list contains three columns of information by default:</P>

<P class=DT1><B>Name</B></P>

<P class=IND>A descriptive name for the breakpoint, created by the debugger based on the breakpoint's location or other properties. The <B>Name</B> allows you to distinguish between breakpoints and select the one you are interested in.</P>

<P class=IND>A check box appears before the name. You can use this check box to enable or disable the breakpoint.</P>

<P class=DT1><B>Condition</B></P>

<P class=IND>An optional property that determines whether your program breaks when the breakpoint is reached. The condition can be any valid expression recognized by the debugger. The debugger evaluates the condition and breaks execution only if the condition is satisfied.</P>

<P class=DT1><B>Hit Count</B></P>

<P class=IND>Another optional property that determines whether your program breaks when the breakpoint is reached. If this property is not set, the debugger stops each time the breakpoint is hit, assuming that the expression shown in <B>Condition</B> column is satisfied. The hit count can notify the debugger to break on the nth time the breakpoint is reached, or on every multiple of <I>N</I> hits, or on the <I>N</I>th hit and every time thereafter.</P>

<P class=T>The following columns are not shown by default, but you can add them using the <B>Columns</B> tool: </P>

<P class=DT1><B>Language</B></P>

<P class=IND>For a breakpoint set on a variable, which is a data breakpoint, the language in which the debugger evaluates the variable. </P>

<P class=DT1><B>Function</B></P>

<P class=IND>The name of the function where the breakpoint is set and the location within the function. </P>

<P class=DT1><B>File</B></P>

<P class=IND>The name of the file where the breakpoint is set and the location within the function.</P>

<P class=DT1><B>Address</B></P>

<P class=IND>The memory address where the breakpoint is set.</P>

<P class=DT1><B>Data</B></P>

<P class=IND>For a breakpoint set on a variable, which is a data breakpoint, the name of the variable.</P>

<P class=DT1><B>Program</B></P>

<P class=IND>The name of the program in which the breakpoint is set.</P>
