<P><B>To start debugging</B>

<UL>
	<LI class=LB1>From the <B>Debug</B> menu, choose <B>Start</B>,<B> Step</B> <B>Into</B>, <B>Step</B> <B>Over</B>, or <B>Run</B> <B>to</B> <B>Cursor</B>.</LI>
</UL>

<P class=T>If you choose <B>Start</B>, your application starts up and runs until it reaches a breakpoint. You can break execution at any time to examine values, modify variables, and otherwise examine the state of your program. </P>

<P class=T>If you choose <B>Step</B> <B>Into</B>, your application starts up and executes its first statement, then breaks. If the first statement is a function call, execution breaks inside the called function, just before the first statement in that function.</P>

<P class=T>If you choose <B>Step Over</B>, your application starts up and executes its first statement. If that statement is a function call, the application executes the entire function call and execution breaks in the main program just after the call statement.</P>

<P class=T>If you choose <B>Run</B> <B>to</B> <B>Cursor</B>, your application starts up and runs until it reaches a breakpoint or the cursor location, whichever comes first. You can set the cursor location in a source window. In some cases, a break does not occur. This means that execution never reached the code where the cursor is set.</P>
