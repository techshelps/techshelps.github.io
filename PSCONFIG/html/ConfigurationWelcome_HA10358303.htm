Then, you must use Central Administration to configure your site.</p><br><h1>Software requirements</h1><p>Before you can install, configure, or operate the server, the following conditions must be met:</p><ul><li>A 64-bit edition of a supported Windows Server 2008 operating system. 
</li>        <li>Microsoft SQL Server Express (for Standalone installations) or a supported version of Microsoft SQL Server 2005 or SQL Server 2008. </li><li>Appropriate administrative credentials on the servers on which you are installing and a domain account to use as the service account.
</li></ul><p>For detailed information about these requirements, and for the most current and comprehensive content related to this product, see the <a href="http://r.office.microsoft.com/r/rlidSharePoint2010Products" target="_new">Microsoft SharePoint 2010 Products TechCenter</a>.</p><br><h1>Standalone</h1><p>Deploying SharePoint products in a stand-alone environment will install all of the components and features on a single stand-alone computer by using default settings. The configuration wizard does not prompt you for any configuration settings or credentials. Instead, the configuration wizard uses default values to create the Web application, core services, and standard security groups that are required to start  Central Administration.</p><p>The configuration wizard uses the default settings if you selected one of the following options in the Setup Wizard:</p><ul><li><b class="ui">Standalone</b></li><li><b class="ui">Server Farm</b>, then <b class="ui">Stand-alone</b></li>   </ul><br><h1>Server Farm</h1><p>When you select the Server Farm option in the Setup Wizard, the configuration wizard enables you to install to a server farm, use an existing database, deploy a new, or connect to an existing server farm. You can create new databases or use existing databases. In your server farm one or more computers can be Web servers, and one or more computers can provide database services from Microsoft SQL Server.</p><p>The configuration wizard will prompt you for the credentials that are required to create the core elements such as creating the Central Administration Web application and creating the new configuration database.</p><br><h1>Repair</h1><p>You can use Repair to overwrite changed or damaged files and registry settings.</p><p>For example, you can use Repair if a registry entry has been overwritten and you need to return to the default setting.</p><p>When you repair an installation, the files that were installed are verified, missing components are detected, and then the configuration is repaired.</p><p>For information, see <a href="ConfigurationRepair_procedure_HA10358297.htm" id="HA10358297" lcid=" ">How to: Repair SharePoint products</a>.</p><br><h1>Upgrade</h1><p>You can upgrade to the latest version of SharePoint products.</p><h2 id="">Running the upgrade checker tool</h2><p>If you are performing an upgrade, you must first use the upgrade checker tool to scan your sites.  <p><b class="cntnote">&nbsp;Note&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;You must be a member of the Administrators group on the local computer to run this tool.</p></p><p>At a command line, change to the following folder on your hard disk: %COMMONPROGRAMFILES%\Microsoft Shared\web server extensions\12\bin, and then run  the following command to scan a server in your server farm:<pre>stsadm.exe -o preupgradecheck</pre></p><p>You must run the tool on every server in your server farm. Running the tool can take several minutes or a few hours depending on the amount of content in your environment.
</p><p>After the scan  has completed, you can view a result file which lists all issues found, and a description of how to fix the issues. The file is located in the %COMMONPROGRAMFILES%\Microsoft Shared\web server extensions\12\LOGS folder. The log files are named in the following format: PreUpgradeCheck_YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS-SSS-random-number.log, where YYYYMMDD is the date and HHMMSS-SSS is the time (hours in 24-hour clock format, minutes, seconds, and milliseconds) and the random number is used to differentiate between possible simultaneous attempts to run the pre-upgrade command.
</p><h2 id="">Upgrading a server farm</h2><p>If you are upgrading a server farm, you must use the following process:</p><p><ol><li>Run Setup, and then run the SharePoint Products Configuration Wizard on the server running SharePoint Central Administration in your farm. </li><li> When you see the message about running Setup on other servers in the farm, you must run Setup and the SharePoint Products Configuration Wizard on the other servers to get to the same point. </li><li>When all servers in the farm display the message, return to the first Web server, and then  click <b class="ui">OK</b> to continue the upgrade process for the first server. </li><li>After the wizard has completed on the first server, you can configure each of the other servers.
</li></ol></p><h2 id="">Applying updates to a farm</h2><p>After you apply an update, such as a service pack or cumulative update, you run the SharePoint Products Configuration Wizard to upgrade the farm to the new version. All servers in the farm must be updated to the same version and must have the same products and language packs installed before you can run the configuration wizard. If any servers in your farm have not been updated, the Farm Product and Patch Status page appears, listing the current status for each server in the farm. From this page, you can determine which servers need to be updated. To update your servers, exit the SharePoint Products Configuration Wizard, run the update on the servers that need to be updated, and then run the configuration wizard again.</p><br><META NAME="CreationDate" CONTENT="2006-02-22"></body></html>
