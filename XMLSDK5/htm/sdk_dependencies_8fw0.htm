<P>To enable developers to better deal with DLL conflicts, Microsoft Windows XP and Windows .NET Server provide new features for installing shared components (also known as assemblies). </P>

<P>For example, a new service pack updated version of MSXML 5.0 when installed in side-by-side mode, will not replace any earlier version of MSXML 5.0 used by another application. Also this type of side-by-side installation allows both versions to be loaded in memory and used simultaneously by separate applications that depend upon the different versions. This represents an improvement over the way globally shared installation of component DLLs worked in earlier versions of Microsoft Windows in which the component was replaced and all applications were required to use the most recent version of the component. </P>

<H2 class="dtH2">Background on MSXML 5.0 and Side-by-Side Assembly </H2>

<P>When MSXML 5.0 is installed on Microsoft&reg; Windows&reg; XP, it is installed as a shared side-by-side assembly. Side-by-side assemblies are:

<UL>
	<LI>One or more .dll files packaged together to install and function as a single shared component.</li>

	<LI>Installed by the Windows Installer into the managed assembly store located off of the Windows system root folder.</li>

	<LI>Authored so that multiple versions of the component can run at the same time without impacting each other. </li>

	<LI>Not registered globally on the system, but are globally available to applications that depend on them. </li>
</UL>

<P>For Windows XP, you specify all dependencies for your compiled applications or components with manifests. Assembly manifests are used with shared dynamic linked libraries. Application manifests are used with executables.</P>

<P>The table below summarizes some of the key differences between globally shared and side-by-side installations of the MSXML component. The same differences will apply for other Windows shared assemblies as well.</P>

	<LI>Side-by-Side technology described in this section applies only when you deploy applications that use MSXML 5.0 or later to computers running Microsoft&reg; Windows&reg; XP and Windows&reg; .NET Server.

	<LI>Windows XP Side-by-Side installation should not be confused with the side-by-side installation provided in previous versions of MSXML. The previous side-by-side installation was implemented by modifying GUIDs and ProgIDs. This topic covers Windows XP Side-by-Side installation exclusively.</li>
