<P>Just as CSS brought new richness and interactivity to static HTML pages, XSLT extends the value of XML data. XSLT allows you not only to present XML data, but also to transform it into completely new data that is designed specifically for a particular user, media, or client.</P>

<P>With XSLT, you can do the following:

<UL type="disc">
	<LI><B>Transform data so it can be exchanged between disparate business systems.</B>
<P>XSLT excels at mapping one XML-based representation into another. For example, a book retailer might represent a customer order based on one XML Schema, while a book supplier might represent it with another XML Schema. With XSLT, a customer order taken by the book retailer can be transformed into an XML-based representation that matches the book supplier's XML Schema. Once transformed, the book retailer can send the order to the book supplier in an XML format that the book supplier understands.
</li>

	<LI><B>Transform XML documents into HTML documents for a variety of browsers.</B>
<P>XSLT transformations are not only useful for backward compatibility for older browsers. They also transform data so that it can be rendered on the new Internet devices on the market, such as Internet-enabled handheld PCs, mobile phones, and TV set-top boxes.
</li>

	<LI><B>Transform XML data into a variety of media, including HTML documents for the Web and PDF format for print.</B>
<P>With XSLT, you can output XML to a variety of media, including HTML for the Web and Package Definition Format (PDF) for print.
</li>

	<LI><B>Dynamically filter information to target a specific user or user group.</B>
<P>For example, for an XML-based catalog, you can use one style sheet to present one set of information to retail customers, while using another style sheet to present information to wholesale customers.
