<P>MSXML 5.0 installs and depends upon Microsoft&reg; Windows&reg; HTTP Services (WinHTTP) 5.0. WinHTTP 5.0 is a new server-side component that provides an updated Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) stack for developing server-based applications for the Web.</P>

<P>MSXML 5.0 uses WinHTTP 5.0 for the <code class="ce">ServerXMLHTTP</code> object, a server-side interface for handling HTTP requests. This object differs from the <code class="ce">XMLHTTP</code> object, which performs in a similar role as a client-side interface on most computers running Windows. The primary difference between these two interfaces is that <code class="ce">XMLHTTP</code> cannot be used in a server environment. This is because it depends upon the WinInet component, which was not designed to provide adequate performance in server-side use.</P>

<P>Because of the dependency between WinHTTP 5.0 and MSXML 5.0, you will probably need to deploy WinHTTP 5.0 with your applications if you are working with the following related technologies:

<UL type="disc">
	<LI>Active Server Pages (ASP)</li>

	<LI>Internet Server Application Programming Interface (ISAPI) extensions for Internet Information Services (IIS)</li>
</UL>

<P>If you are developing server-side applications in these contexts with MSXML 5.0, be sure to distribute WinHTTP 5.0 or later with your application.</P>

<P>You should also be aware that if you are planning wide client deployment, you cannot use a component designed to use WinHTTP and MSXML for server-side applications in any client-side applications. This is because the WinHTTP component is not supported in Windows 9x/Me. Therefore, any code reference to the <code class="ce">ServerXMLHTTP</code> object will fail when executed on computers running these versions of Windows. For Windows 9x/Me, your application must use the older client-side <code class="ce">XMLHTTP</code> object.</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE class="dtBlock">
<b class="le">Note</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WinHTTP 5.1 will ship with the forthcoming release of Windows XP Server. This version will work side-by-side with WinHTTP 5.0. You will no longer have to monitor package and deployment issues for WinHTTP when you develop applications that use this platform.</BLOCKQUOTE>
