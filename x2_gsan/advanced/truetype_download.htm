        <h1>TrueType Font Download Option</h1>
        <p>On the <a href="tab_advanced.htm">Advanced tab</a>.</p>
        <p><a name="kanchor100"></a><a name="kanchor101"></a>Select one of the following settings to specify how TrueType fonts are downloaded to the printer:</p>
        <ul>
            <li class="Bul1" MadCap:conditions="Primary.pcl" value="1"><span class="span_1">Download as TrueType:</span> Downloads the TrueType font as a scalable, vector-based font. The fonts download to the printer exactly how they display on the screen. If your printer supports TrueType rendering, this is the best way to print TrueType fonts. If you are unable to print using the <span class="span_1">Bitmap</span> setting due to a printer memory shortage, use this setting instead.</li>
            <li class="Bul1" MadCap:conditions="Primary.pcl" value="2"><span class="span_1">Download as Bitmap:</span> Downloads the TrueType font as a bitmap font. A bitmap font is a non-scalable, rasterized font made up of numerous pixels combined to form each character. This setting is best when the font used in the job is one style and size, the document uses smaller point sizes (14 points or less), or if the font is used in combination with graphics, such as a logo. Do not use this setting when you are printing to a file that will be printed on different printers; bitmaps are not portable to printers with different resolutions.</li>
            <li class="Bul1" MadCap:conditions="Primary.pcl" value="3"><span class="span_1">Print as Graphics (None):</span> Downloads the TrueType font as a non-scalable graphic.</li>
            <li class="Bul1" MadCap:conditions="Primary.postscript" value="4"><span class="span_1">Automatic:</span> The driver automatically selects the best format for the fonts in the job.</li>
            <li class="Bul1" MadCap:conditions="Primary.postscript" value="5"><span class="span_1">Outline:</span> Downloads the TrueType font as an outline font. An outline font is a scalable, vector-based font that defines each character as a set of distinct objects (such as lines, circles, ellipses, and boxes) that specify the shape and size of the character. This setting uses less memory and reduces printing time for documents that contain large TrueType fonts (10 points or more). Use this setting to create a more portable PostScript file for printers that cannot process TrueType fonts.</li>
            <li class="Bul1" MadCap:conditions="Primary.postscript" value="6"><span class="span_1">Bitmap:</span> Downloads the TrueType font as a bitmap font. A bitmap font is a non-scalable, rasterized font made up of numerous pixels combined to form each character. This setting is best when the font used in the job is one style and size, the document uses smaller point sizes (14 points or less), or if the font is used in combination with graphics, such as a logo. Do not use this setting when you are printing to a file that will be printed on different printers; bitmaps are not portable to printers with different resolutions.</li>
            <li class="Bul1" MadCap:conditions="Primary.postscript" value="7"><span class="span_1">Native TrueType:</span> Downloads the TrueType font as a scalable, vector-based font. The fonts download to the printer exactly how they display on the screen. If your printer supports TrueType rendering, this is the best way to print TrueType fonts. If you are unable to print using the <span class="span_1">Outline</span> or <span class="span_1">Bitmap</span> settings due to a printer memory shortage, use this setting instead.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><span class="span_1">Note:</span> Not all options are available in all print drivers.</p>
