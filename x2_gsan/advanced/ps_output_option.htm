        <p>Select one of the following settings:</p>
        <ul>
            <li class="Bul1" value="1"><span class="span_1">Optimize for Speed:</span> Select this setting when print processing speed is more important than file portability. This setting creates PostScript output that is optimized for faster printing. However, it might not allow the full use of some network print spooler features.</li>
            <li class="Bul1" value="2"><span class="span_1">Optimize for Portability:</span> Select this setting when file portability is more important than print processing speed. This setting creates output that conforms to the Adobe Document Structuring Conventions (ADSC). Each PostScript page is independent of all other pages in a document. These self-contained page objects help documents print successfully on network spooler-based printers, as well as on remote printers. Select this setting if you intend to print to a sophisticated spooler.</li>
            <li class="Bul1" value="3"><span class="span_1">Encapsulated PostScript (EPS):</span> Select this setting to produce a single-page Encapsulated PostScript (EPS) file to insert as an image in a document in another application. The contents of the page can include any combination of text, graphics, and images. You can also use the EPS file for creating archives and for printing documents on remote printers (such as printers at a service bureau). It is generally best create EPS files in the application. When that is not possible, select this setting to set up this print driver to create EPS files. The EPS files created this way do not include on-screen preview images; they appear as blank spaces, black boxes, or as boxes with X's (placeholders for the image) when previewed but appear as expected when printed.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><span class="span_1">Note:</span> Not all applications can place EPS files in their documents. If you experience printing or compatibility problems with some applications, try printing the document with different PostScript settings.</p>
