<H1><A NAME="vxurfgeneralenvironmentoptionsdialogbox"></A>General, Environment, Options Dialog Box</H1>

<P class=T>Use this page of the Options dialog box to change default settings for the integrated development environment (IDE). You can access the Options dialog box by selecting <B>Options</B> from the <B>Tools</B> menu and then selecting the <B>General</B> page in the <B>Environment</B> folder.</P>

<H3>Settings</H3>

<P class=DT1><B>Tabbed Documents</B></P>

<P class=IND>Select this option to display document windows that are tabbed together within editors. Tabbed document windows are useful for organizing and switching between multiple open documents.</P>

<P class=LNT><B>Note</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You must restart the IDE for changes to take effect.</P>

<P class=DT1><B>MDI Environment</B></P>

<P class=IND>Choose this option to open documents in a multiple document interface (MDI) environment. MDI document windows are useful for gaining the screen space that is otherwise taken up by the tabs in the tabbed documents environment. When working in MDI mode, you can switch between documents by pressing <CODE>CTRL + Tab</CODE> or you can use the tile options located on the Window menu. </P>

<P class=LNT><B>Note</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You must restart the IDE for changes to take effect.</P>

<P class=DT1><B>Window menu contains </B></P>

<P class=IND>Customizes the number of windows that appear in the Windows list of the <B>Windows </B>menu. Type a number between 1 and 24. The default is 10.</P>

<P class=DT1><B>Show Status Bar</B></P>

<P class=IND>Displays the status bar. The status bar is located at the bottom of the IDE and displays information about the progress of ongoing operations.</P>

<P class=DT1><B>Animate Environment Tools</B></P>

<P class=IND>This control allows you to enable transition effects. Clearing this option causes auto-hidden windows to instantly appear when requested rather than slowly transition onto the screen.</P>

<P class=DT1><B>Speed</B></P>

<P class=IND>Controls the speed at which animation effects such as Auto Hide are executed. Experiment with animation speeds to find the setting that best suits you. This option is available only when you select the Animate Environment Tools option.</P>

<P class=DT1><B>Enable Autocompletion</B></P>

<P class=IND>Select this to see command completion options as you type commands or file paths. When using auto completion, you do not need to type an entire command or path in most cases. As soon as you type the first character, a list appears containing matching commands that could complete the command you are typing. As you continue typing, the list narrows to reflect only the saved command or path containing the letters you have typed. When you see the desired command or path in the list, you can use either mouse or arrow keys to select it.</P>

<H3>Find and Replace</H3>

<P class=DT1><B>Show message boxes</B></P>

<P class=IND>Choose this option to display the message boxes resulting from a find and replace operation. Two examples of message boxes affected by this option are: "The specified text was not found" and " No more occurrences found in the specified documents." Clear this option to hide all message boxes.</P>

<P class=DT1><B>Initialize Find text from editor</B></P>

<P class=IND>Select this option to automatically copy text around the cursor in the editor to the <B>Find what</B> textbox in the <B>Find</B> and <B>Replace</B> dialog boxes. Clearing this option reuses the last search pattern from the previous search in the <B>Find what </B>textbox.</P>
