<H1><A NAME="vxtsknavigatingtext"></A>Navigating Text</H1>

<P class=T>There are several ways to move throughout text:

<UL>
	<LI class=LB1>Mouse and navigation keys</LI>

	<LI class=LB1>Bookmarks</LI>

	<LI class=LB1>Incremental search </LI>

	<LI class=LB1>The <B>Go To Line </B>command</LI>

	<LI class=LB1>The <B>Go To Definition </B>command</LI>

	<LI class=LB1>The <B>Go Back </B>and <B>Go Forward </B>buttons</LI>
</UL>

<H4>Navigating with the mouse and keys</H4>

<P class=T>The most common way to navigate text is with the mouse and navigation keys:

<UL>
	<LI class=LB1>Use the arrow keys to move one character at a time, or the arrow keys in combination with the CTRL key to move one word at a time. Arrow keys move one line at a time also.</LI>

	<LI class=LB1>Click a location with the mouse.</LI>

	<LI class=LB1>Use the scroll bars or scroll wheel on the mouse to move through the text.</LI>

	<LI class=LB1>Use the HOME, END, PAGEUP, and PAGEDOWN keys.</LI>

	<LI class=LB1>Use CTRL+PAGEUP and CTRL+PAGEDOWN to move the insertion point to the top or bottom of the window, respectively.</LI>

	<LI class=LB1>Use CTRL+UP ARROW and CTRL+DOWN ARROW to scroll the view without moving the insertion point.</LI>
</UL>

<P class=T>You can also go directly to a procedure by clicking the <B>Object </B>box in the upper left corner of the document, and then clicking a procedure in the <B>Member </B>box in the upper right corner of the document.</P>

<H4>Navigating with Bookmarks</H4>

<P class=T>To edit a document elsewhere and then return to your current location, add a bookmark.</P>

<P><B>To add a temporary bookmark</B>

<OL>
	<LI class=LPROC>Click the line you want to return to at later time.</LI>

	<LI class=LPROC>Click the <B>Toggle Bookmark </B>button <IMG SRC="vxaddbookmarkbutton.gif" ALT="" BORDER=0>. You should see the temporary (or "unnamed") bookmark symbol <IMG SRC="vxbookmarksymbol.gif" ALT="" BORDER=0><B> </B>appear next to the line.</LI>

	<LI class=LPROC>Alternatively, you can press CTRL+K twice to toggle the bookmark.</LI>
</OL>

<P><B>To return to a temporary bookmark</B>

<OL>
	<LI class=LPROC>Click the <B>Next Bookmark <IMG SRC="vxnextbookmarkbutton.gif" ALT="" BORDER=0></B> or <B>Previous Bookmark <IMG SRC="vxpreviousbookmarkbutton.gif" ALT="" BORDER=0></B> button.  </LI>

	<LI class=LPROC>Alternatively, you can press CTRL+K and then CTRL+N for the next bookmark, or CTRL+K and then CTRL+P for the previous bookmark within in a document.
<P class=LNT><B>Tip</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another way to return to a location is by using the <B>Go Back </B>and <B>Go Forward </B>buttons.
</LI>
</OL>

<P><B>To remove one or more temporary bookmarks in a document</B>

<UL>
	<LI class=LB1>Click the <B>Clear Bookmarks</B> button <IMG SRC="vxremoveallbookmarksbutton.gif" ALT="" BORDER=0>.
<P class=LT1>&#0151;or&#0151;
</LI>

	<LI class=LB1>Press CTRL+K and then CTRL+L to erase all bookmarks in the current document.
<P class=NT><B>Note</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To delete a single bookmark, right-click the bookmark and click <B>ToggleBookmark</B>, or press CTRL+K and then CTRL+K again.
</LI>
</UL>

<P class=FIXP></P>

<H4>Incremental Search</H4>

<P class=T>Using incremental search is often a good way to navigate to another location in the current document.</P>

<P><B>To navigate using incremental search</B>

<OL>
	<LI class=LPROC>Enter a line of code.</LI>

	<LI class=LPROC>Click Move to do a bit of work, and then use <B>Go Back </B>to return to where were working before searching away to a new location.</LI>
</OL>

<H4>Goto Line command</H4>

<P class=T>Use the <B>Goto Line </B>command to go to a specific line number.</P>

<P><B>To go to a specific line number</B>

<OL>
	<LI class=LPROC>In the <B>General</B>, <B>All Languages</B>, <B>Text Editor</B>, <B>Options </B>dialog box, click <B>Line Numbers</B>.</LI>

	<LI class=LPROC>Click <B>Goto Line </B>in the <B>Edit </B>menu.</LI>

	<LI class=LPROC>Enter the line number you want to view.</LI>
</OL>

<H4>Navigating to code elements using Go To Definition</H4>

<P class=T>Use the command <B>Go To Definition </B>to immediately navigate to the parent procedure for a method call or variable definition. For example, if you have a procedure called <CODE>MyProc()</CODE> and later make a call to <CODE>MyProc()</CODE>, you could navigate directly to the procedure using <B>Go To Definition</B>.</P>

<P><B>To go to a procedure or variable definition</B>

<OL>
	<LI class=LPROC>Select the variable or procedure call.</LI>

	<LI class=LPROC>Press SHIFT+F2.</LI>
</OL>

<P class=T>You are taken to the procedure or variable definition. If you want to return to the variable or procedure call, press the <B>Go Back </B>button.</P>

<P class=T>If the definition lies outside your project, the item displays in the Object Browser.</P>

<H4>Go Back / Go Forward buttons</H4>

<P class=T>Use the <B>Go Back <IMG SRC="vxpreviousbutton.gif" ALT="" BORDER=0></B> button to navigate to previously visited locations in the document, then use the <B>Go Forward <IMG SRC="vxnextbutton.gif" ALT="" BORDER=0></B> button to return afterwards. These buttons are particularly useful when using commands that take you far away from where you are currently working and you want to return to that location quickly. Examples of such commands are Incremental Search, Goto Line, Beginning of Document, End of Document, Pasting text or inserting file contents, and Go To Definition commands. The editor remembers locations when you move in a single command more than several lines away from where you are currently working, or if you edit in a particular location that is not adjacent to the last place you edited. The goal is to remember interesting locations so that you can recall where you’ve been working without remembering so many locations the feature is not useful (such as every character typed, or every line entering several new lines of code one right after the other).</P>
