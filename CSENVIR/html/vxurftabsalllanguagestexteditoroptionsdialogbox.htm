<H1><A NAME="vxurftabsalllanguagestexteditoroptionsdialogbox"></A>Tabs, All Languages, Text Editor, Options Dialog Box</H1>

<P class=T>Allows you to change the default tab settings for the Code/Text Editor, which also affects other editors based upon it, such as the HTML Designer's Source view. You can access the <B>Options</B> dialog box from the <B>Tools</B> menu.</P>

<P class=NT><B>Note</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Options that apply to specific technologies can be selected within corresponding folders. For example, you can select options that apply specifically to the HTML Designer by opening the HTML folder and selecting options within its <B>General</B> and <B>Tabs</B> nodes.</P>

<P class=NT>Also, you might see the message "Individual selections conflict" displayed next to the <B>Indenting</B> or <B>Tab</B> options. This indicates that one or more individual languages have indenting or tab selection types that differ from the other languages. This message alerts you that selecting a particular indenting or tab type in this dialog affects all languages and sets their indenting or tab types to whatever you select here.</P>

<H4>Indenting</H4>

<P class=DT1><B>None</B></P>

<P class=IND>When selected, no automatic indenting occurs when you press ENTER to move to a new line of text and the cursor is placed at the first column of the next line.</P>

<P class=DT1><B>Block</B></P>

<P class=IND>When selected and you press ENTER, the new line of text is automatically indented to the same tab stop as the line preceding it.</P>

<P class=DT1><B>Smart</B></P>

<P class=IND>When selected, new lines of text are automatically formatted according to rules established by the current language service.</P>

<H4>Tabs</H4>

<P class=DT1><B>Tab size</B></P>

<P class=IND>Specifies the number of spaces represented by a TAB character.</P>

<P class=DT1><B>Indent size</B></P>

<P class=IND>Specifies the number of spaces to be inserted by an indent operation which occurs when the TAB key is pressed. The space inserted may be a combination of tab characters and/or space characters. </P>

<P class=DT1><B>Insert spaces</B></P>

<P class=IND>When selected, indent operations insert space characters rather than TAB characters. If indent size is set to 5, for example, then five spaces are inserted in the current line of text if you press the TAB key or the Indent button.</P>

<P class=DT1><B>Keep tabs</B></P>

<P class=IND>When selected, indent operations insert TAB characters rather than spaces when possible. The TAB character fills the number of spaces specified in Tab size. If the indent size is not an even multiple of the TAB size, space characters are inserted to fill the remaining space.</P>
