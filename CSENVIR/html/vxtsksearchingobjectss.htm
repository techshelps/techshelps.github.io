<H1><A NAME="vxtsksearchingobjectss"></A>Searching for Symbols: Objects, Definitions and References</H1>

<P class=T>Since the <B>Object Browser </B>is capable of displaying a large number of objects and members, it is important to be able to find symbols of interest quickly and easily. You can use the <B>Find Symbol </B>dialog box to easily find such symbols or to locate sections of code that use the symbol.</P>

<P class=T><B>Find Symbol </B>is useful for:

<UL>
	<LI class=LB1>Searching for definition of a symbol within your project. Also useful for discovering multiple definitions of a symbol.</LI>

	<LI class=LB1>Searching for uses of a symbol (references) within your code.</LI>

	<LI class=LB1>Discovering names of objects and members in referenced and external components, allowing you to learn about its functionality.</LI>

	<LI class=LB1>Finding symbols and browsing to their definitions in the <B>Object Browser </B>to discover their syntax and other information.</LI>
</UL>

<P class=T><B>Find Symbol</B> is different from finding text in that it:

<UL>
	<LI class=LB1>Allows you to limit the search scope to include only symbols, ignoring text in comments. </LI>

	<LI class=LB1>Definitions and references (when available) to the symbol are clearly indicated in the <B>Find Symbol Results</B> window.</LI>

	<LI class=LB1>Allows you to search in external components for which you do not have the source code.</LI>
</UL>

<P class=T>The scope that <B>Find Symbol </B>uses in its search is the same browsing scope currently in use by the <B>Object Browser</B>. Changing or customizing the scope here also updates the display in the <B>Object Browser</B>.</P>

<P class=T>To open the <B>Find Symbol </B>dialog box, either click the <B>Find Symbol</B> button on the <B>Object Browser</B> toolbar, or on the <B>Edit </B>menu, click <B>Find and Replace</B> and then <B>Find Symbol</B>.</P>

<P class=T></P>

<P><B>To find a symbol</B>

<OL>
	<LI class=LPROC>In the <B>Find what</B> box, enter all or part of the name of the symbol you want to find.</LI>

	<LI class=LPROC>You can limit the search by specifying the browsing scope in which to search. In the <B>Look in</B> combo box, select either <B>Active Project </B>or <B>Selected Components</B>. <B>Active Project </B>confines the search to the active project and its referenced components only, while <B>Selected Components </B>searches within the user-defined browsing scope, which can include projects and their referenced components as well as other external components.</LI>

	<LI class=LPROC>If your search scope is set to<B> Selected Components</B>, clicking the ellipse (<B>...</B>) button displays the <B>Selected Components </B>dialog box which allows you to change the <B>Selected Components</B> browsing scope. Note that this also updates the display in the <B>Object Browser</B>.</LI>

	<LI class=LPROC>You can further refine the search by specifying search options. Select either <B>Match substring</B>, <B>Match whole word</B>, or <B>Match prefix</B>. In addition, you can check the <B>Match case</B> check box if you want the search to be case-sensitive.</LI>

	<LI class=LPROC>After specifying the criteria, click the <B>Find</B> button to perform the search.</LI>
</OL>

<P class=T>The results of the search display in the Find Symbol Results window. You can navigate to the symbol in code by either double-clicking the result or by choosing <B>Goto Definition</B> from its context menu. For external components, you can browse to their definition in the <B>Object Browser </B>from here as well. If references are available for the symbol, you can expand the node to see its uses in code and navigate to them.</P>
