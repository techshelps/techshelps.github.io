<H1><A NAME="vxtskcustomizingwindowlayouts"></A>Arranging Windows</H1>

<P class=T>The integrated development environment (IDE) has two types of windows, tool windows and document windows. You can increase the viewing and editing space for code, depending on how you arrange the windows in the IDE. You have many options for arranging windows within the IDE, including the following:

<UL>
	<LI class=LB1>Tab-link several windows.</LI>

	<LI class=LB1>Dock tool windows to an edge of the development environment.</LI>

	<LI class=LB1>Minimize tool windows along any edge of the development environment.</LI>

	<LI class=LB1>Put windows on different monitors.</LI>

	<LI class=LB1>Tile document windows.</LI>
</UL>

<P><B>To tab-dock windows</B>

<UL>
	<LI class=LB1>For a tool window, see "To dock or hide tool windows."</LI>

	<LI class=LB1>For a document window, select <B>Tabbed Documents</B> on the <B>General</B> pane under the <B>Environment</B> option in the <B>Options</B> dialog box. The documents in the editor are automatically maximized and linked together.</LI>
</UL>

<P><B>To dock or hide tool windows</B>

<OL>
	<LI class=LPROC>Select <B>Dockable</B> from the <B>Window</B> menu and then drag the window toward an edge of the development environment window until you see a superimposed outline in the location you want. 
<P class=NT><B>Note&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>The position of the mouse pointer, not the edges of the window, determines where the window will be placed, not the edges of the window. 

<P class=NT><B>Tip</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To move a dockable window without snapping it into place, press CTRL while dragging it to the location you desire.
</LI>

	<LI class=LPROC>Right-click the window and choose <B>Auto Hide</B>. The window will reappear when your cursor is near the edge of the development environment window.</LI>
</OL>

<P class=T>If you have a second monitor, and your platform supports using it, you can choose which monitor to display windows on.</P>

<P><B>To place tool windows on different monitors</B>

<OL>
	<LI class=LPROC>Use the <B>Display</B> settings in the <B>Control Panel</B> to set up your multiple monitor configurations. See Windows Help for more information.</LI>

	<LI class=LPROC>Drag the tool window to the other monitor. This option is only available on platforms that support multiple monitors.</LI>
</OL>

<P class=T>If you want to view more than one document at a time while editing code, you can tile documents together.</P>

<P><B>To tile document windows</B>

<UL>
	<LI class=LB1>In Tabbed Documents mode, select a tab and drag it below or above the current document tile. A rectangular outline appears in the location that the new document tile will be placed, based on the position of the cursor.</LI>

	<LI class=LB1>In MDI modes, choose <B>Tile Horizontally</B> or <B>Tile Vertically</B> from the <B>Windows</B> menu.</LI>
</UL>
