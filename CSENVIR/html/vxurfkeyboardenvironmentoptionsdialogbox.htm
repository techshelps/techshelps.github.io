<H1><A NAME="vxurfkeyboardenvironmentoptionsdialogbox"></A>Keyboard, Environment, Options Dialog Box</H1>

<P class=T>The Keyboard page of the Options dialog box allows you to customize the keyboard scheme for the integrated development environment (IDE). Use this option to set shortcut keys for frequently used commands or to establish your favorite binding for a particular command. To access this dialog box, select <B>Options</B> from the <B>Tools</B> menu and choosing the <B>Keyboard</B> page from the <B>Environment</B> folder.</P>

<P class=NT><B>Tip</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Enter a key combination in the <B>Press shortcut key(s)</B> textbox to check the key combination for an existing command mapping. For example, File.SaveAll (Ctrl+S (Global)) displays in the <B>Shortcut currently used by</B> list when you enter Ctrl+S in the <B>Press shortcut key(s)</B> textbox</P>

<P class=DT1><B>Keyboard Mapping Scheme</B></P>

<P class=IND>Lists the set of all available collections of shortcut keys. To load a specific scheme, select it from the list. When you are ready to leave the options dialog box, click <B>OK</B> your selected scheme will be loaded into the IDE.</P>

<P class=LNT><B>Note</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clicking <B>OK</B> in the Options dialog box saves all Options settings, including settings made on other pages.</P>

<P class=DT1><B>Save As</B></P>

<P class=IND>Displays the <B>Save Scheme</B> dialog box, where you can enter a name of the new keyboard-mapping scheme to save. When you click <B>OK</B> on the <B>Save Scheme </B>dialog box, a new entry is added to the <B>Keyboard Mapping Scheme</B> list above.</P>

<P class=LNT><B>Note</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a scheme with the name specified already exists, you will be prompted to replace it.</P>

<P class=DT1><B>Delete</B></P>

<P class=IND>Deletes the selected keyboard scheme.</P>

<P class=LNT><B>Note</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You cannot delete any of the default keyboard schemes.</P>

<P class=DT1><B>Show commands containing</B></P>

<P class=IND>Lists all commands available in the integrated development environment (IDE) that contain the specified characters, or all commands if this edit box is empty. As you type a complete word, the result list displays all entries containing the typed word.</P>

<P class=DT1><B>Shortcut(s) for selected command</B></P>

<P class=IND>Lists mapped shortcuts for the command selected in the <B>Show commands containing</B> list. Some commands have more than one mapped shortcut.</P>

<P class=DT1><B>Remove</B></P>

<P class=IND>Removes the selected shortcut key combination.</P>

<P class=DT1><B>Use new shortcut in</B></P>

<P class=IND>Allows you use the new shortcut key globally in the IDE or only within a specific context (or window); Global is the default setting. If you choose a specific context, the shortcut key remains in effect only while the context is active. If you choose Global, the shortcut key works in any active window in the IDE, unless the same shortcut is mapped in another editor, in which case the editor overrides the shortcut.</P>

<P class=DT1><B>Press Shortcut Key(s)</B></P>

<P class=IND>Allows you to press a key combination to be used for the currently selected command. You must use one or more modifier keys such as CTRL, ALT, or SHIFT. The modifier keys appear in the order in which you press them. For example, pressing CRTL, then SHIFT, and then F2 creates the shortcut key, CTRL+SHIFT+F2. You can use BACKSPACE to delete the whole shortcut key combination at one time.</P>

<P class=LNT><B>Note</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following keys cannot be assigned: ALT, SHIFT, or CTRL without another key; ESC, PRINT SCRN/SYS RQ, SCROLL LOCK, PAUSE/BREAK, TAB, CAPS LOCK, INSERT, HOME, END, PAGE UP, PAGE DOWN, Windows logo keys, Application key, any of the ARROW keys, or ENTER; NUM LOCK, DEL, or CLEAR on the numeric keypad; or CTRL+ALT+DELETE.</P>

<P class=DT1><B>Assign</B></P>

<P class=IND>Assigns a new key combination to the selected command for the <B>Keyboard mapping scheme</B> displayed. The new assignment is added to the <B>Shortcut(s) for selected command</B> list, so it is possible to have multiple key combinations for one command. This button is not active until you type a key combination in the <B>Press shortcut key(s)</B> box. If you attempt to bind a key in the <B>[Default Settings]</B> scheme, you are prompted to make a copy of the scheme and give it a name.</P>

<P class=LNT><B>Note</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Changes made using the <B>Assign</B> button are not cancelled if you click the Cancel button.</P>

<P class=DT1><B>Shortcut currently used by</B></P>

<P class=IND>Displays the command to which the key combination is currently assigned. Appears only when you assign a key or key combination that is already assigned. To replace the shortcut with a custom shortcut key combination you must define a new <B>Keyboard mapping scheme</B>.</P>
