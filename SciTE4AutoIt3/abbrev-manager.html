  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>Rather then manually add abbreviations to the "<em>au3userabbrev.properties</em>" and "<em>au3.keywords.user.abbreviations.properties</em>" files, this utility allows you to create, edit and delete abbreviations without fuss.</p>
  <p>As the User abbreviations are loaded after the SciTE abbreviations supplied with the install, a User abbreviation will override a SciTE abbreviation of the same name.&nbsp; If during the creation or rename process there is a conflict between User
  and SciTE abbreviation names the manager will ask if the SciTE abbreviation is to be overridden.&nbsp; Note that the SciTE abbreviation is not deleted and removing the similarly-named User abbreviation will reenable it.</p>
  <h2>Main Screen</h2><img src="abbrev-managerb1.PNG" border="0" alt="graphic">
  <p>The abbreviations currently stored in the SciTE abbreviation files are loaded into internal lists - the radio buttons at lower left determine the list displayed.&nbsp; If the SciTE abbreviations are selected, a dialog asks for confirmation and the
  user can only override the existing SciTE abbreviation by adding a User abbreviation of the same name - the only buttons active are "<em>Search</em>" and "<em>OverRide</em>" (renamed from "<em>Edit</em>").</p>
  <h2>Search</h2>
  <p>Entering an abbreviation into the input a top left and pressing "<em>Search</em>" will find and highlight the relevant abbreviation if it exists - a dialog will announce if it was not found.&nbsp; Double-clicking an abbreviation displays a dialog
  (blue background) showing the expanded abbreviation as it would be entered in the editor.</p>
  <h2>Create</h2>
  <p>Pressing the "<em>Create</em>" button first checks that the new abbreviation entered into the input does not conflict with an existing abbreviation. A conflict with an existing SciTE abbreviation brings up a dialog offering the option to override
  that abbreviation (see next section).&nbsp; If there is no conflict an edit dialog (yellow background) opens to input the expanded text:</p>
  <p><img src="abbrev-managerb2.PNG" border="0" alt="graphic"></p>
  <p>Enter the text as text it is to be entered into the editor when the abbreviation is expanded.&nbsp; In all dialogs of this type use <em>Ctrl-TAB</em> to enter a <em>{TAB}</em>, {<em>ENTER}</em> is entered as normal.&nbsp; Once the text is entered,
  pressing "<em>Add</em>" adds the abbreviation to the internal list; pressing "<em>Cancel</em>" abandons the creation process.</p>
  <h2>Edit/Override</h2>
  <p>Pressing the "<em>Edit</em>" button brings up a similar dialog (red background) showing the current expanded text ready for amendment.&nbsp; The button reads "<em>Override</em>" when the SciTE abbreviations are listed and is the only action
  available.&nbsp; If the SciTE abbreviaiton is to be overridden, a dialog (orange background) containing the current expanded text of that abbreviation appears.&nbsp; Once the text is edited, pressing "<em>Save</em>" adds the abbreviation to the
  internal list; pressing "<em>Cancel</em>" abandons the process. Note that overridden abbreviations are added to the User abbreviation list - a dialog appears to confirm this.</p>
  <h2>Rename</h2>
  <p>Pressing the "<em>Rename</em>" button opens a dialog requesting the new name:</p>
  <p><img src="abbrev-managerb3.PNG" border="0" alt="graphic"></p>
  <p>If on pressing "<em>Save</em>" the new name conflicts with an existing User abbreviation a dialog appears and the rename is canceled, as is the case when the "<em>Cancel</em>" button is pressed.&nbsp; If the name conflicts with a SciTE abbreviation
  a dialog offers the option to override it.</p>
  <h2>Delete</h2>
  <p>On pressing the "<em>Delete</em>" button, a dialog asks for confirmation and then the abbreviation is removed from the internal list.</p>
  <h2>Save/Cancel</h2>
  <p>Pressing "<em>Save</em>" stores the current internal list of abbreviations in the SciTE User abbreviation and properties files.&nbsp; Pressing "<em>Cancel</em>" abandons all changes.</p>
