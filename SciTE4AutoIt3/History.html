*** Merged the SciTE v 4.1.0 by Neil Hodgson with our own version of SciTE. (Jos)
    This is a major change from the previous version so ensure you update all files including LUA or else you will get errors!
    - SciLexer au3: Fixed issues with nested CommentBlocks not always showing the correct color.
    - SciLexer au3: Change any line starting with # and no recognised keyword to be shown with the Pre-Processor in stead of default.
    - Changed Shortcut for AU3INFO to Ctrl+Shift+F6.
    - Moved the session restore logic for (save.session.advanced=1)into SciTE in stead of LoadSession.lua as that was clearing the recent files list of the last session
      when opening a file by double cliking it. This is fixed with this change.
      Default remains 0 so when a file is double clicked the last session isn't restored unless you add this to SciTEuser.properties:
      "save.session.advanced=1"
    - updated Tools.lua replacing [s%] with [ /t] to avoid empty lines being stripped by those functions. (Thanks Enyby)

        #Tidy_On ;Start the Tidy process below this line
    - Added the process to restore Bookmarks and Fold in the Tidied script by doing the following steps through the SciTE Director Interface:
        1. savesession: to %temp%\tidyscite.session

        3. SciTE Revert command to force the reload of the file.
        4. Read the saved bookmarks and Fold of the current File and add these back.
    Two limitation remarks about this feature:
    1. When there are multiple instances of SciTE then the commands will be send to the first found SciTE director window which could mean the bookmarks get lost.
    2. when lines are removed by tidy due to the /REM option, the bookmarks/Fold will be on the wrong line for those bookmarks located after the removed lines.
