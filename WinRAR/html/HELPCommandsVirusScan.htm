<P class="title"><A NAME="HELPCommandsVirusScan"></A>"Scan archive
for viruses" command<hr></P>

<P>This command is accessible both in <A HREF="HELPShellModes.htm">
file management</A> and in <A HREF="HELPShellModes.htm">archive management</A>
modes. It unpacks one or several archives to temporary folder and checks
contents of this folder with a third party virus scanner, which must
be installed on a user's computer. In the archive management mode it
processes only the currently opened archive, in the file management
mode all archives found in selected files and folders will be processed.</P>


<P>Dialog displayed by this command contains the following fields.</P>


<h1><I>Virus scanners found by WinRAR</I></h1>

<P>List of antivirus software installed on a computer and identified
by WinRAR. If this list contains several virus scanners, you may choose
anyone which you like. If the list contains only "User defined" item,
it means that WinRAR could not find any antivirus software and you
need to specify a scanner name and parameters manually.</P>

<h1><I>Virus scanner name</I></h1>

<P>Name of virus scanner executable. You need to modify this field
only if WinRAR cannot find antivirus software installed on your computer
and "Virus scanners found by WinRAR" list contains only "User defined"
item. In such case you need to press "Browse" button and locate a virus
scanner .exe file, which will be called by WinRAR to check unpacked
files.</P>

<h1><I>Virus scanner parameters</I></h1>

<P>Parameters passed to virus scanner. You need to modify this field
either if WinRAR cannot find antivirus software installed on your computer
or if it passes invalid parameters to virus scanner. For example, it
may happen if command line syntax of antivirus program is changed in
a new version. Usually virus scanners require only one parameter -
the name of folder containing unpacked files. WinRAR denotes this folder
as %f. Since its name may include spaces, it is necessary to enclose
it in quotes, so most likely you need to place "%f" string to this
field. Though, some scanners may require additional options, which
can be found in their documentation.</P>

<P>If you use only one antivirus and do not need to modify its parameters
every time, you may skip the virus scanner selection dialog by turning
"Propose to select virus scanner" option in <A HREF="HELPSecuritySettings.htm">
Security settings</A> off.</P>

<h1><B>Notes</B></h1>

<ol type="1">
  <li> WinRAR is not able to find viruses itself, it calls antivirus
    software already installed on your computer. If you do not have such
    software, you will not be able to use this WinRAR command;</li>
  <li> WinRAR does not display any messages after completion of this
    command. You should read information displayed by virus scanner to
    check if any viruses had been found;</li>
  <li> WinRAR unpacks all selected archives to temporary folder before
    calling a virus scanner, so your disk must have enough free space to
    hold all unpacked files. WinRAR deletes these files when scanning is
    done;</li>
  <li> WinRAR is able to detect many popular antivirus programs automatically,
    so normally you do not need to edit "Virus scanner name" and "Virus
    scanner parameters" fields manually. Just select a scanner from the
    list at the top of dialog and press "OK" and use two other fields only
    if this method does not work;</li>
  <li> WinRAR saves parameters of virus scanner started last time and
    restores them, when you activate this command again.</li>
