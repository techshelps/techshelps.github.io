<P class="title"><A NAME="HELPSecuritySettings"></A>Security settings
dialog<hr></P>

<P>To activate this dialog select "Settings…" command in <A HREF="HELPOptionsMenu.htm">
Options menu</A> and click on "Security" tab. The dialog contents are
described below.</P>

<h1><I>File types to exclude from extracting</I></h1>

<P>If you enable this option, you can specify the list of potentially
dangerous file masks in input field below. It is allowed to enter several
masks separated by spaces. WinRAR will skip files matching any of these
masks when extracting or opening archived files. </P>

<P>This option may help to protect users from infected email attachments.
For example, if you enter:</P>

<P>*.scr *.pif *.exe</P>

<P>in this field, it will prohibit users to unpack, view and run .scr,
.pif and .exe files with WinRAR.</P>

<h1><I>Wipe temporary files</I></h1>

<P>This group of options controls the delete mode for temporary files
in WinRAR temporary folder generated when processing already existing
archives. It involves external or internal viewer operations,
executing an archived file or unpacking with the drag and drop.</P>

<h1><I>Wipe temporary files/Never</I></h1>

<P>If "Never" is selected, temporary files are removed using the standard
system delete function and they can be recovered with special software
sometimes. This is a fastest, but less secure way to deal with temporary files.
</P>

<h1><I>Wipe temporary files/Always</I></h1>

<P>In "Always" mode, before deleting temporary files are overwritten
by zero bytes to prevent their recovery. This is a noticeably slower
and more secure approach.</P>

<h1><I>Wipe temporary files/Encrypted only</I></h1>

<P>If you selected "Encrypted only", temporary files are removed
with the secure and slow wipe function if WinRAR identified an archive
containing these files as encrypted. Otherwise a quick standard delete
is applied.</P>

<h1>Notes to "Wipe temporary files" options</h1>

<ul>
<li>Wipe operation is designed for usual hard disks, but may fail to
overwrite the original file data on solid state disks, as result of
SSD wear leveling technology and more complicated data addressing.</li>

<li>If temporary files are still in use, WinRAR may not delete them
immediately. Instead, when you run WinRAR the next time, all temporary
files older than one hour will be deleted or wiped out. The same happens
if WinRAR cannot reliably detect if temporary files are still in use by
external application.</li>

<li>This option works only with temporary files created after extraction
operations. It does not work with different kind of temporary files
like those created when modifying an archive. Such files are always removed
with the standard quick delete.</li>
</ul>

<h1><I>Propose to select virus scanner</I></h1>

<P>This option modifies behavior of <A HREF="HELPCommandsVirusScan.htm">
Scan archive for viruses</A> command. By default it is enabled, so
WinRAR proposes to select virus scanner name and parameters every time
when activating the virus scanning command. If you use only one antivirus,
it is possible to skip the antivirus selection step by turning this
option off.</P>
