<P class="title">"Generate report" command<hr></P>

<P>This command is accessible both when WinRAR is in the file management
and in the archive <A HREF="HELPShellModes.htm">management modes</A>.
</P>

<P>In the archive management mode this command creates a report containing
the complete list of files in the currently opened archive. File selection
is ignored. </P>

<P>In the file management mode a report provides information only
about selected items. Depending on command parameters, report may include
both usual files and contents of archives found in selected items.
If you selected a folder, WinRAR will process its files and subfolders
as well.</P>

<P>It is possible to modify report style using following parameters.</P>


<h1><I>Write report to file</I></h1>

<P>Here you may enter a file name to store the report. It is allowed
to leave this field blank if you do not need to save the report to
file.</P>

<h1><I>Send report to printer</I></h1>

<P>Set this option if you wish to print the report.</P>

<h1><I>Copy report to clipboard</I></h1>

<P>Set this option if you wish to copy the report to clipboard. It
takes some amount of memory to store data in the clipboard, so be cautious
with this option if you expect to produce a multi-megabyte report.
It may take too much memory and decrease the operation speed.</P>

<h1><I>Output format (HTML, Unicode text, text)</I></h1>

<P>Select the output format for report file. <i>HTML</i> and 
<i>Unicode text</i> formats support Unicode, so non-English characters
in file and archive names will be displayed properly. <i>Text</i> format
is not Unicode compatible and can damage non-English characters.</P>

<h1><I>Sort files by (original order, name, size, packed size, modification
time, checksum)</I></h1>

<P>Here you may select the sort mode or set it to <i>Original order</i>
to skip sorting. </P>

<h1><I>Sort archives separately</I></h1>

<p>If this option is enabled, contents of every archive included into
report will be sorted independently of other archives and files,
so all files of the same archive will be placed to the same group.
Otherwise all files included into report will be sorted as a single
stream ignoring archive borders. This option does not make any difference
in the original order sort mode.</p>

<h1><I>Include to report / Archives</I></h1>

<P>This option is available only in the file management mode. If it
is enabled, WinRAR analyzes all files and if archive found, its contents
is included into report. If you wish to get the list of usual files
on your disk and do not care about archive contents, disable this option
to speed up the operation.</P>

<h1><I>Include to report / Usual files</I></h1>

<P>This option is available only in the file management mode. If it
is enabled, WinRAR will include usual files into report. If you need
a report containing only archived files, you should disable this option.</P>


<h1><I>Include to report / Archive name</I></h1>

<P>If enabled, report will include an archive name before every continuous
group of files from this archive. You may wish to disable this option
only in some special cases, for example, if you need to pass a report
to external program.</P>

<h1><I>Include to report / Headers and totals</I></h1>

<p>If enabled, headers of report columns are added at the top of report
and statistics about processed files is included at the bottom.</p>
<p>Since the width of some report columns may vary for different files
and archives, it is possible for headers to be misaligned with columns.
Still they define the column order correctly.</p>
<p>Final statistics at the end of report includes information about
the total number and size of files. If "Usual files" option is enabled,
only usual files will be added to total information, otherwise
only archived files will be present here. It cannot count both usual
and archived files. For files split between volumes the total information
calculates only those of them, which start in the current volume.
It is done to avoid calculating split files several times, when processing
a group of volumes.</P>

<h1><I>Include to report / File size</I></h1>

<P>Include the uncompressed file size into report.</P>

<h1><I>Include to report / Packed size</I></h1>

<P>Include the compressed file size into report. For usual files it
may be not equal to uncompressed file size only on NTFS disks and only
if file has the attribute "Compressed".</P>

<h1><I>Include to report / File date</I></h1>

<P>Include the file modification date into report. Date format is
always YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm, it does not depend on system settings.</P>


<h1><I>Include to report / File checksum</I></h1>

<P>Include the file checksum into report. This option is available
for both archived and usual files. Checksum type for archived files
depends on archive format and options, for usual files it is always CRC32.
Enabling this option for usual files may slow down the operation
significantly, because WinRAR will need to read file data and calculate
CRC32 for every processed file. Usually archives already store previosuly
calcuated checksums, so this option does not introduce any additional
delays for archived files.</P> 


<h1><I>"Save" button</I></h1>

<P>Using "Save" button you may store default values of all dialog
options except a report file name. WinRAR preserves two sets of default
values for this command, one for archive and another for file management
mode.</P>
