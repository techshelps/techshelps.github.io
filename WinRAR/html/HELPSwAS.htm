<P class="title"><A NAME="HELPSwAS"></A>Switch <B>-AS  </B>-  synchronize
archive contents<hr></P>

<P>If this switch is used when archiving, those archived files which
are not present in the list of the currently added files, will be deleted
from the archive. It is convenient to use this switch in combination
with <A HREF="HELPSwU.htm"><B>-u</B></A> to synchronize contents of
archive and archiving folder.</P>

<P>For example, after the command:</P>

<p class="sample">WinRAR a -u -as backup sources\*.cpp</p>

<P>the archive <I>backup.rar</I> will contain only *.cpp files from
folder <I>sources</I>, all other files will be deleted from the archive.
It looks similar to creating a new archive, but with one important
exception: if no files are modified since the last backup, the operation
is performed much faster than the creation of a new archive.</P>
