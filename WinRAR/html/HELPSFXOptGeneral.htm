<P>This dialog is a part of the <A HREF="HELPSFXAdvOpt.htm">"Advanced
SFX options" dialog</A> and includes the following settings:</P>

<h1><I>Path to extract</I></h1>

<P>Set the default destination path for unpacked files. You may choose
to create it in the user's "Program Files" folder, in the current folder
or specify an absolute path here. In first two cases an entered path
must not include the disk letter or leading backslash, in the third
it must have one of them.</P>

<P>Corresponding <A HREF="HELPGUISFX.htm">SFX script</A> command -
<A HREF="HELPSFXPath.htm">Path</A></P>

<h1><I>Path to extract/Save and restore paths</I></h1>

<P>This option allows SFX to store the destination path entered by
user to Registry and then restore it when SFX archive with the same
<I>Path to extract</I> contents executed the next time. The original
path value is placed to the list associated with the destination path
input field, so a user may choose between previously entered and original
paths.</P>

<P>This feature may be convenient when installing new versions or
upgrades of some software in the same folder. It allows to change the
proposed path to desired only once instead of retyping it every time.</P>


<P>It may be used only in combination with non-empty <I>Path to extract</I>
field.</P>

<P>Corresponding <A HREF="HELPGUISFX.htm">SFX script</A> command -
<A HREF="HELPSFXSavePath.htm">SavePath</A></P>

<h1><I>Save current settings as default</I></h1>

<P>This button is displayed only if "Advanced SFX options" dialog is invoked
from <A HREF="HELPCommandsSFX.htm">Convert archive to SFX</A> command.
It saves settings entered in all dialog sections. These saved settings
are used only when converting an archive to SFX. Use the default
<A HREF="HELPProfiles.htm">compression profile</A> for other archive
modification commands.</P>
