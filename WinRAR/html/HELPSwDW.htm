after archiving<hr></P>

<P>Delete files after archiving. Before deleting file data are overwritten
by zero bytes to prevent recovery of deleted files, file is truncated
and renamed to temporary name.</P>

<P>Please be aware that such approach is designed for usual hard disks,
but may fail to overwrite the original file data on solid state disks,
as result of SSD wear leveling technology and more complicated data
addressing.</P>
