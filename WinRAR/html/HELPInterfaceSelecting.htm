<P class="title"><A NAME="HELPInterfaceSelecting"></A>Selecting files<hr></P>


<P>Before performing any operation you need to select, in the WinRAR
files list, all files and folders which should be processed.</P>

<P>If you need to select only one file, just move the cursor to it
and start an operation. There are several methods of file selection.
As in other Windows applications you may press arrow keys or the left
mouse button while holding Shift key to select a group of files. To
select several separate items hold down the Ctrl key and then click
each item you want. Press Ctrl+A or use the "Select all" command from
<A HREF="HELPFileMenu.htm">File menu</A> to select all the files and
folders in the current folder.</P>

<P>All methods described above provide the standard non-persistent
selection, which is canceled if you move the cursor. Though the standard
methods are usually enough, sometimes it is more convenient to have
persistent selection, allowing navigation in the current folder without
removing the selection from previously marked files. WinRAR provides
several keys for this:<br> 
</P>

<TABLE>

<TR>
<TD><b>Space, Ins</b></TD>
<TD>Select a file under the cursor and move the cursor down.
To deselect a file selected using Space or Ins, press Space or Ins
on the name again or use "Gray -" command.</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD><b>Gray * (on numpad)</b></TD>
<TD>Invert the current selection</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD><b>Gray + (on numpad)</b></TD>
<TD>Select files according to an entered wildcard mask</TD>

</TR>

<TR>
<TD><b>Gray - (on numpad)</b></TD>
<TD>Deselect files according to an entered wildcard mask</TD>

</TR>
</TABLE>
<BR>

<P>If no files are selected before starting extraction or testing,
all archived files will be extracted or tested. This rule is valid
only for test and extract operations.</P>
