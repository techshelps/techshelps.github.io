<P class="title"><A NAME="HELPSwMT"></A>Switch <B>-MT&lt;threads&gt;</B>
-  set the number of threads<hr></P>

<P>&lt;threads&gt; parameter can take values from 1 to 64. It defines
the recommended maximum number of active threads for compression algorithm
also as for other WinRAR modules, which can start several threads.
While WinRAR attempts to follow this recommendation, sometimes
the real number of active threads can exceed the specified value.</P>

<P>Change of &lt;threads&gt; parameter slightly affects the compression
ratio, so archives created with different -mt switches will not be
exactly the same even if all other compression settings are equal.</P>

<P>If -mt switch is not specified, WinRAR will try to detect the number
of available processors and select the optimal number of threads automatically.</P>
