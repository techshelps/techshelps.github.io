<P class="title"><A NAME="HELPOptionsMenu"></A>Options menu<hr></P>

<P>Command "Settings…" of this menu activates the dialog containing
the following WinRAR settings: <A HREF="HELPGeneralSettings.htm">General</A>,
<A HREF="HELPCompressionSettings.htm">Compression</A>,
<A HREF="HELPPathsSettings.htm">Paths</A>,
<A HREF="HELPFileListSettings.htm">File list</A>,
<A HREF="HELPViewerSettings.htm">Viewer</A>,
<A HREF="HELPSecuritySettings.htm">Security</A> and
<A HREF="HELPIntegrationSettings.htm">Integration</A>.
Select any of these topics for details. Keyboard shortcut for "Settings…"
command is Ctrl+S.</P>

<P>You can export WinRAR settings to file and import them later
using two appropriate commands of "Import and export" submenu.
This file has "Settings.reg" name and by default it is placed
in <a href="HELPAppData.htm">%APPDATA%\WinRAR</a> folder, but you can select
another folder in "Save WinRAR settings" or "Load WinRAR settings" dialogs.
Restoring settings from the file can reduce time required to configure
WinRAR if you re-installed Windows or need to move WinRAR to another
computer. If WinRAR cannot find settings in Registry and Settings.reg file
is present in WinRAR or <a href="HELPAppData.htm">%APPDATA%\WinRAR</a>
folders, it will be imported automatically. It might be necessary to restart
WinRAR to apply some of imported settings. These commands are unavailable
if <a href="HELPWinRARIni.htm">WinRAR.ini file</a> is used to store settings.</P>

<p>"Create WinRAR.ini file" command in "Import and export" submenu
creates a new <a href="HELPWinRARIni.htm">WinRAR.ini file</a> and copies
existing WinRAR settings from Registry to this file.</p>

<P>"File list" submenu contains two groups of options. "Flat folders
view" command (Ctrl+H keyboard hot key) switches between the classic
tree style view and flat view, when all archived files and folders
are displayed in the same list. It is applicable only in the <A HREF=
"HELPShellModes.htm">archive management mode</A>. Another options group
is "List view" and "Details" items, which control the file list appearance.
"List view" switches the list to multicolumn mode with only file names
displayed, when "Details" enables more informative view providing file
sizes and other information.</P>

<P>"Folder tree" submenu allows to turn on or off the folder tree
panel. You can configure it separately for <A HREF="HELPShellModes.htm">
file management</A> ("Show disk folders" menu item) and <A HREF="HELPShellModes.htm">
archive management</A> ("Show archive folders" item) modes. Another
way to change the state of folder panel is Ctrl+T keyboard shortcut.
Folder tree is convenient if you need to navigate in disk or archive
folders quickly. You may change the width of folder tree by dragging
its right border with the mouse.</P>

<P>"Themes" submenu contains the list of available WinRAR <A HREF=
"HELPThemes.htm">interface themes</A>, <A HREF="HELPOrganizeThemes.htm">
"Organize themes…"</A> command providing theme management functions
and "Get more themes…" command loading themes web page.</P>

<p><a href="HELPNameEncoding.htm">"Name encoding" submenu</a> permits to
specify encoding for archived file names.</p>

<p>Another command of this menu is "View log…". It opens, in the <A
HREF="HELPInterfaceInternalViewer.htm">internal viewer</A>, the contents
of <I>rar.log</I>, which exists in <a href="HELPAppData.htm">%APPDATA%\WinRAR
folder</a>. Note that you need to switch on "Log errors to file"
in <A HREF="HELPGeneralSettings.htm"> General settings</A> dialog to
force WinRAR to write errors to the log file. Use "Clear log" menu command
to clear contents of the log file. Logging is available only in
the registered version.</p>
