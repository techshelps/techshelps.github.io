<P class="title"><A NAME="HELPExtractAdvOptions"></A>Extraction path
and options dialog: advanced options<hr></P>

<P>You may specify the following options in this dialog:</P>

<h1>File time</h1>

<h1><I>Set modification/creation/last access time</I></h1>

<P>Windows file systems keep three different time fields for each
file: last modification, creation and last access. By default WinRAR
stores only last modification time, but using file time options in
<A HREF="HELPGetArcTime.htm">Time</A> part of archiving dialog you
may enable storing of creation and last access time. Even if a desired
time field is present in archive, it is also necessary to set the corresponding
time option in the extraction dialog to restore it on extraction. 
Availability of these options depends on a concrete archive format,
some formats do not support them.</P>


<h1>Attributes</h1>

<h1><I>Clear attribute "Archive"</I></h1>

<P>Clear attribute "Archive" on the extracted files. This option is
designed for backup purposes.</P>

<h1><I>Set file security</I></h1>

<P>This option has meaning only for NTFS file system and allows to
restore file owner, group, access control and audit information if
it was previously saved in the archive. It is necessary to specify
"Save file security data" option in <A HREF="HELPGetArcAdvanced.htm">
Advanced</A> part of archiving dialog to preserve security information
when creating an archive. You need to have necessary privileges in
order to use this facility. Processing of security data may decrease
the speed of archiving operation, so set this option only if you understand
its meaning and really need it, in most cases security processing is
not required for home users.</P>

<P>This feature is supported only by <A HREF="HELPRARVersusZIP.htm">
RAR</A> archives.</P>

<h1><I>Set attribute "Compressed"</I></h1>

<P>This option allows to restore NTFS "Compressed" attribute when
extracting files. WinRAR saves "Compressed" file attributes when creating
an archive, but does not restore them unless this option is specified.
</P>

<P>This feature is supported only by <A HREF="HELPRARVersusZIP.htm">
RAR</A> archives.</P>

<h1>File paths</h1>

<h1><I>Extract relative paths</I></h1>

<p>This mode is used by default. If you browse some archive subfolder
in WinRAR shell, the path part up to and including the current subfolder
will be removed from extracted file paths. For example, if you are inside
of "Backup\MyData" archive folder and extract "Images" folder,
it will be extracted as "Images", not as "Backup\MyData\Images".</p>

<p>If you browse the root archive folder or start extraction from
<a href="HELPWinShellMenu.htm">context menu</a>, this mode works
exactly as <I>Extract full paths</I> option.</p>

<h1><I>Extract full paths</I></h1>

<P>WinRAR unpacks contents of archive including the path information
into the destination folder. Unlike <I>Extract relative paths</I> mode,
the path information is unpacked completely, regardless of current archive
folder.
</P>

<h1><I>Do not extract pathnames</I></h1>

<P>If the option is set, selected files from the root archive folder
and from selected subfolders will be extracted into the destination
folder. The path information is ignored.</P>

<h1><I>Extract absolute paths</I></h1>

<P>If archive was created using "Store full paths including the drive
letter" mode selected in <A HREF="HELPGetArcFiles.htm">Files</A> part
of archiving dialog and you set "Extract absolute paths" option, WinRAR
will create unpacked files in their original folders and disks. Be
careful, do not set this option unless you are completely sure that
archive does not contain malicious files. You may read more about potential
benefits and dangers of "Extract absolute paths" mode in the description
of <A HREF="HELPSwEP3.htm">-ep3 switch</A>, which is the command line
equivalent of this WinRAR option. This feature is supported only by
RAR and ZIP archives.</P>

<h1>Delete archive</h1>

<h1><I>Never</I></h1>

<P>Do not delete an unpacked archive.</P>

<h1><I>Ask for confirmation</I></h1>

<P>Ask for user confirmation before deleting an unpacked archive.</P>

<h1><I>Always</I></h1>

<P>Delete an unpacked archive without a confirmation.</P>

<h1><I>Move to Recycle Bin</I></h1>

<P>Deleted archives are placed to Recycle Bin.</P>

<P>WinRAR deletes an archive only if it had been unpacked without
errors and if all archived files were selected to unpack. If you unpack
a <A HREF="HELPArcVolumes.htm">multivolume archive</A>, all its volumes
will be deleted.</P>

<P>Note that you can save the default state of this option with "Save
settings" button in <A HREF="HELPExtractOptions.htm">General</A> page
of extraction dialog and it will also affect command line and context
menu extraction commands. Use "Ask for confirmation" and especially
"Always" mode with care. Deleting an unpacked archive can cause data
loss if used improperly.</P>

<h1>Miscellaneous</h1>

<h1><I>Background extraction</I></h1>

<P>Minimize WinRAR to tray when starting the extraction process.</P>

<h1><I>Wait if other WinRAR copies are active</I></h1>

<P>Wait in the queue if other WinRAR copies are creating, modifying
or unpacking an archive and start the operation only when other WinRAR tasks
are complete or paused. If you are going to perform several archiving
or decompressing tasks, such sequential execution can help to reduce
amount of disk seeks and improve overall performance.</P>

<P>You can override this option for current operation by pressing
"Continue" button in operation progress window. When you press "Continue",
WinRAR stops waiting regardless of other copies activity.</P>

<p>This option is not supported for 7z archives.</p>

<h1><I>Allow absolute paths in symbolic links</I></h1>

<p>If this option is off, extraction command skips symbolic links pointing
outside of destination folder, with absolute paths, excessive number of ".."
in link target or with other potentially dangerous link parameters.
Links pointing to folders outside of extraction destination folder
can present a security risk. Enable this option only if you are sure
that archive contents is safe, such as your own backup.</p>

<p>Links that are considered safe by WinRAR are extracted always regardless
of this option.</p>

<h1><I>Allow potentially incompatible names</I></h1>
<p>While NTFS file system permits file names with trailing spaces and dots,
a lot of Windows programs fail to process such names correctly.
If this option is turned off, WinRAR removes trailing spaces and dots,
if any, from file names when extracting.</p>
