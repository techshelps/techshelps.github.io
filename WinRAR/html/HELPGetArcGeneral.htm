<P class="title"><A NAME="HELPGetArcGeneral"></A>Archive name and
parameters dialog: general options<hr></P>

<P>The dialog contains the following items:</P>

<h1><I>Destination archive name</I></h1>

<P>Enter the name manually or press the "Browse" button to browse
for the archive name. You may enter a name containing a disk letter
or the full path to the archive.</P>

<h1><I>Profiles...</I></h1>

<P>Opens the menu allowing to <A HREF="HELPProfileParameters.htm">
create new</A>, <A HREF="HELPOrganizeProfiles.htm">organize</A> and
select <A HREF="HELPProfiles.htm">compression profiles</A>. Compression
profiles allow you to quickly restore previously saved compression
options or to specify default options for this dialog. WinRAR provides
a few predefined profiles optimized for creating e-mail attachments,
backup files and other operations. Name of currently active profile
is displayed above "Profiles..." button. Please see the topic
<A HREF="HELPProfiles.htm"> Compression profiles</A> for more information.</P>

<h1 id="SetFmt"><I>Archive format (RAR, RAR4, ZIP)</I></h1>

<p>Select format of newly created archive. You can specify RAR to use
the latest <a href="HELPRAR5Format.htm">RAR 5.0</a> format, RAR4 for
format compatible with WinRAR 4.x or <a href="HELPRARVersusZIP.htm">ZIP</A>
to create ZIP archive. Depending on the archive format selected,
some advanced options not supported by target format will be disabled.
If you update an existing archive, this option is ignored and WinRAR
uses the format of updating archive.</p>

<h1><i>Compression method</i></h1>
<p>Choose between "Store", "Fastest", "Fast", "Normal", "Good" and "Best"
methods. "Store" writes files to archive at maximum speed and without
compression. All following methods compress data, providing a higher
compression ratio and lower speed when going from "Fastest" to "Best".</p>

<h1 id="DictSize"><i>Dictionary size</i></h1>
<p>This is a size of memory area used to find and compress repeated patterns
in processing data. Larger compression dictionary sometimes allows to improve
the compression ratio of big files, especially when creating 
a <a href="HELPArcSolid.htm"><I>solid</I></a> archive. But larger dictionary
also decreases the compression speed and increases memory requirements.</p>

<p>Maximum dictionary size for RAR 4.x archives is 4 MB. RAR 5.0 format
allows to create archives with up to 1 GB dictionary in 64 bit WinRAR
version and up to 256 MB in 32 bit WinRAR (up to 128 MB in Windows XP x86).
Decompression needs less memory than compression, so both 32 and 64 bit
WinRAR can decompress archives with all dictionary sizes including 1 GB
provided that computer has more than 1 GB of available memory. ZIP format
dictionary size is fixed to 32 KB.</p>

<p>If size of all source files for <a href="HELPArcSolid.htm">solid</a>
archive or size of largest source file for non-solid archive is at least
twice less than dictionary size, WinRAR can reduce the dictionary size.
It helps to lower memory usage without decreasing compression.</p>

<h1><A HREF="HELPArcVolumes.htm"><I>Volume</I></A> size in
"<I>Split to volumes, size"</I> field</h1>

<P>If you wish to create volumes, enter a size of single volume here.
You can choose size units in the drop down list to the right of size field.
In this list "B" means bytes, "KB" - kilobytes, "MB" - megabytes and "GB" - 
gigabytes.</P>

<P>It is allowed to enter decimal fractions using the decimal symbol
defined in Windows regional settings.</P>

<P>Also it is possible to select units by appending one or two characters
to volume size string. Lowercase 'k' means kilobytes, uppercase 'K' -
thousands of bytes, 'm' - megabytes, 'M' - millions of bytes,
'g' - gigabytes, 'G' - billions (milliards) of bytes. "KB", "MB" and "GB"
always mean kilobytes, megabytes and gigabytes regardless of character
case.</P>

<P>Volume size input field has the associated drop down list containing
previously entered, predefined and defined by user values.
You can use this list to quickly select any of items it contains.
This list can be customized with <A HREF="HELPDefVolSizes.htm">
Define volume sizes</A> dialog. To activate it press "Define volume
sizes…" button in <A HREF="HELPCompressionSettings.htm">Compression
settings</A> dialog.</P>

<P>If you are archiving to removable disks and using RAR format, you may
select "Autodetect" from the list and WinRAR will choose the volume size
automatically for each new volume.</P>

<h1><I>Update mode</I></h1>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Add and replace files (default).</strong>
       Always replace archived files, which have same name as files
       to be added. Always add those files, which are not present
       in the archive.</li>
  <li><strong>Add and update files.</strong>
       Replace archived files only if added files are newer.
       Always add those files, which are not present in the archive.</li>
  <li><strong>Freshen existing files only.</strong>
       Replace archived files only if added files are newer. Do not add
       those files, which are not present in the archive.</li>
  <li><strong>Ask before overwrite.</strong>
       Ask for confirmation to overwrite archived files, which have
       same name as files to be added. Always add those files,
       which are not present in the archive.</li>
  <li><strong>Skip existing files.</strong>
       Do not replace archived files, which have same name as files
       to be added. Always add those files, which are not present
       in the archive.</li>
  <li><strong>Synchronize archive contents.</strong>
       Replace archived files only if added files are newer.
       Always add those files, which are not present in the archive.
       Delete those archived files, which are not present in the added files.
       It looks similar to creating a new archive, but with the one
       important exception: if no files are modified since a last backup,
       the operation is performed much faster than the creation
       of a new archive.</li>
</ul>

<h1><I>Delete files after archiving</I></h1>

<P>Remove successfully archived source files.</P>

<h1><B></B><I>Create SFX archive</I></h1>

<P>Creates a <A HREF="HELPArcSFX.htm">self-extracting</A> archive
(exe file), which can be unpacked without using any other programs.
You may select the type of SFX module and set a few other SFX parameters
like a destination folder in the <A HREF="HELPGetArcAdvanced.htm">Advanced
options</A> of this dialog.</P>

<h1 id="CreateSolid"><B></B><I>Create solid archive</I></h1>

<P>Creates a <A HREF="HELPArcSolid.htm"><I>solid</I></A> archive.
Usually gives higher compression ratios, but applies some restrictions.
Read the description of <A HREF="HELPArcSolid.htm"><I>solid archives</I>
</A> for more details.</P>

<h1 id="RR"><B></B><I>Add recovery record</I></h1>

<P>Adds the <A HREF="HELPArcRecovery.htm">recovery record</A>, which
may help to restore an archive in case of damage. You can specify
the recovery record size in <A HREF="HELPGetArcAdvanced.htm">Advanced
options</A> of this dialog. Default value is 3% of total archive size.</P>

<h1><B></B><I>Test archived files</I></h1>

<P>Test files after archiving. This option is especially useful if
<I>"Delete files after archiving"</I> is also enabled<I>. </I>In this
case files will be deleted only if the archive had been successfully
tested.</P>

<h1><B></B><I>Lock archive</I></h1>

<P>>WinRAR cannot modify locked archives, so locking important archives
prevents their accidental modification by WinRAR. This option is not intended
or able to prevent modification by other tools or willful third party.
It implements a safety measure only for accidental data change by WinRAR.</p>

<h1 id="SetPwd"><I>Set password</I></h1>

<P>Set a password to <A HREF="HELPArcEncryption.htm">encrypt</A> archived
files. It is valid only during a single archiving operation and overrides
the default password entered in <A HREF="HELPFileMenu.htm">File menu</A>.
If the default password is present, it will be restored after the archiving
operation is completed. If the default password was absent before starting
archiving, it also will be absent after finishing the operation.</P>
