<P class="title"><A NAME="HELPCommandsTest"></A>"Test archived files"
command<hr></P>

<P>This command is accessible both in <A HREF="HELPShellModes.htm">
file management</A> and in <A HREF="HELPShellModes.htm">archive management</A>
modes.</P>

<P>In the archive management mode, when WinRAR shows archive contents,
first, you need to <A HREF="HELPInterfaceSelecting.htm">select</A>
archived files and folders, which are to be tested. Then run "Test
archived files" command using either <A HREF="HELPCommandsMenu.htm">
Commands menu</A>, "Test" button on the toolbar or Alt+T keyboard shortcut.</P>


<P>All errors found during test are displayed in the "Diagnostic messages"
window. If no errors detected, WinRAR will display a corresponding
message.</P>

<P>In the file management mode it is possible to test several archives
at once. In general the operation is similar to the described in the
previous paragraph, but instead of selecting files inside of archive
you need to <A HREF="HELPInterfaceSelecting.htm">select</A> archives
and folders, where WinRAR should search for archives. When a search
is completed, WinRAR will test contents of all found archives.</P>
