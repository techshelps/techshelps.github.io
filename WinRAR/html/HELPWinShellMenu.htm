<P class="title"><A NAME="HELPWinShellMenu"></A>Using context menus<hr></P>


<P>If you did not disable the option "Integrate WinRAR into shell"
when installing WinRAR, several additional items will be added to the
standard file and folder context menus, which appear when you click
the right mouse button on a file icon in Explorer or Desktop.</P>

<P>For archives WinRAR adds the items: "Extract files…", "Extract
Here" and "Extract to &lt;folder name&gt;", where &lt;folder name&gt;
is replaced with the real name of the folder. All the commands call
WinRAR to extract archive contents, but the first command allows you
to enter the destination folder and some extraction options in <A HREF=
"HELPExtractOptions.htm">Extraction path and options dialog</A>, while
the second performs extraction to the current folder and the third
to the proposed folder without additional questions. When you unpack
a group of archives, the context menu will also include "Extract each
archive to a separate folder" item allowing to place contents of each
unpacked archive to separate folder.</P>

<P>Also WinRAR modifies "Properties" item of archives context menu
to show archive information and, if present, <A HREF="HELPArcComment.htm">
archive comment</A>. The archive information is similar to that displayed
by <A HREF="HELPCommandsInfo.htm">Show information</A> command.</P>

<P>For common files and folders WinRAR adds items: "Add to archive…",
"Add to the archive &lt;archive name&gt;", "Compress and email…", "Compress
to &lt;archive name&gt; and email", where &lt;archive name&gt; is replaced
with the actual name of the archive. Both "Add" commands call WinRAR
to add selected files to archive, but the first command allows to enter
the archive name and some compression options in <A HREF="HELPGetArcName.htm">
Archive name and parameters</A> dialog, when the second starts adding
to the proposed archive without additional questions. Similarly, both
"Email" commands compress selected files and attach a created archive
to email message, but the first allows to set additional options. You
need to have a MAPI compliant email program installed to use these
"Email" commands (most modern email programs support MAPI interface).</P>
