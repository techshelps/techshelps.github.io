<P>In this dialog you may enter a password, which will apply to the
archive, which you are going to create now. The entered password will
be active during only one current archiving operation. If you need
a global password instead, you may enter it using "Set default password"
command in <A HREF="HELPFileMenu.htm">File menu</A>.</P>

<P>If <i>"Show password"</i> option is disabled, you will be asked to
type the password twice to ensure correctness.</P>

<P>If you set <I>"Encrypt file names"</I> option, WinRAR will encrypt
not only file data, but all other sensitive archive areas like file
names, sizes, attributes, comments and other blocks, so it provides
a higher security level. Without a password it is impossible to view
even the list of files in archive encrypted with this option. This
option is available only when compressing data to <A HREF="HELPRARVersusZIP.htm">
RAR</A> archive, it is not supported for ZIP format.</P>

<p>"ZIP legacy encryption" option is available only when adding files
to ZIP archive. It enables use of ZIP legacy encryption algorithm.
If this option is turned off, ZIP archives are encrypted with AES-256,
which is more secure, but can be incompatible with some older versions
of unzip tools.</p>

<p>If you already saved some passwords, you can access them either
using the drop down list associated with "Enter password" field
or utilizing the autocomplete feature. Press <i>"Organize passwords..."</i>
button to open <a href="HELPOrgPasswords.htm">"Organize passwords"</a> dialog,
where you can save frequently used passwords.</p>

<p>If saved passwords are protected with master password, you need to
enter the master password and press "OK" to access them. If entered password
does not match the master password, this dialog will treat it as a usual
password for archive operations.</p>
