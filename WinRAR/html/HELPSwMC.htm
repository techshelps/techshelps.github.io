<P class="title">Switch <B>-MC&lt;par&gt;</B>
-  set advanced compression parameters<hr></P>

<P>This switch is intended mainly for benchmarking and experiments.
In the real environment it is usually better to allow WinRAR to select
optimal parameters automatically. Please note that improper use of
this switch may lead to very serious performance and compression loss,
so use it only if you clearly understand what you do.</P>

<P>It has the following syntax:</P>

<P>-mc[param1][:param2][module][+ or -]</P>

<P>where <I>&lt;module&gt;</I> is the one character field denoting
a part of the compression algorithm, which has to be configured. It
may have the following values:<br>
</P>

<TABLE>

<TR>
<TD><b>A</b></TD>
<TD>audio compression;</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD><b>C</b></TD>
<TD>true color (RGB) data compression;</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD><b>D</b></TD>
<TD>delta compression;</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD><b>E</b></TD>
<TD>x86 executable compression;</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD><b>T</b></TD>
<TD>text compression.</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>

<P><a href="HELPRAR5Format.htm">RAR 5.0</a> archive format supports only
'D' and 'E' values.</P>

<P>'+' sign at the end of switch applies the selected algorithm module
to all processed data, '-' disables the module at all. If no sign is
specified, WinRAR will choose modules automatically, based on data
and the current compression method. Switch -mc- disables all optional
modules and allows only the general compression algorithm.</P>

<P>&lt;<I>Param1&gt;</I> and <I>&lt;Param2&gt;</I> are module dependent
parameters described below.</P>

<h1><B>Audio compression</B>,<B> delta compression</B></h1>

<P><I>&lt;Param1&gt;</I> is a number of byte channels (can be 1 -
31).</P>

<P>WinRAR splits multibyte channels to bytes, for example, two 16-bit
audio channels are considered by WinRAR as four channels one byte each.</P>


<P><I>&lt;Param2&gt;</I> is ignored.</P>

<h1><B>x86 Intel executable compression</B>, <B>true color (RGB) data
compression</B></h1>

<P><I>&lt;Param1&gt;</I> and <I>&lt;Param2&gt;</I> are ignored.</P>


<h1><B>Text compression</B></h1>

<p>The text compression algorithm provides noticeably higher compression
on plain text data. But it cannot utilize several CPU cores efficiently
resulting in slower compression time comparing to general algorithm
in multicore and multiprocessor environment. Also its decompression speed
is much slower than in general algorithm regardless of CPU cores number.
This is why the text compression is disabled by default. You can specify
-mct switch to allow WinRAR to select this algorithm automatically
for suitable data. Switch -mct+ will force use of the text compression
for all data.</p>

<p>Switch -mct can also include &lt;Param1&gt; and &lt;Param2&gt;, so its
full syntax is -mc[param1][:param2]t[+ or -].</p>

<P><I>&lt;Param1&gt;</I> is the order of PPM algorithm (can be 2 -
63).</P>

<P><I>&lt;Param2&gt;</I> is memory in megabytes allocated for PPM
(1-128).</P>

<P>PPM uses the equal memory size both to compress and decompress,
so if you allocate too much memory when creating an archive, other
people may have problems when decompressing it on a computer with less
memory installed. Decompression will be still possible using virtual
memory, but it may become very slow.</P>

<h1><B>Examples</B>:</h1>

<ol>
  <li> switch -mc1a+ forces use of 8-bit mono audio compression for
    all data.</li>
  <li> switch -mc10:40t+ forces use of text compression algorithm for
    all data, sets the compression order to 10 and allocates 40 MB memory.</li>
  <li> switch -mc12t sets the text compression order to 12, when the
    text compression is used, but leaves to WinRAR to decide when to use
    it.</li>
  <li> switches -mct -mcd- allow WinRAR to apply the text compression
    to suitable data and disable the delta compression.</li>
