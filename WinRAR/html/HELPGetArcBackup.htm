<P class="title"><A NAME="HELPGetArcBackup"></A>Archive name and parameters
dialog: backup options<hr></P>

<h1><I>Erase destination disk contents before archiving</I></h1>

<P>All files and folders on the target disk will be erased before
starting the archiving operation. If you create <A HREF="HELPArcVolumes.htm">
volumes</A>, erasing will be performed before creating of each volume,
giving you the chance to archive to non-empty removable disks. But
you must be sure that disks do not contain any useful information.
The option applies only to removable media, hard disk cannot be erased
using this function.</P>

<h1><I>Add only files with attribute "Archive" set</I></h1>

<P>Only those files which have attribute "Archive" set, will be added.
Folders are added regardless of their attributes.
This option is designed for backup purposes.</P>

<h1><I>Clear attribute "Archive" after compressing</I></h1>

<P>Clear attribute "Archive" on successfully compressed files.
Folder attributes are not changed. This option is designed
for backup purposes.</P>

<h1><I>Open shared files</I></h1>

<P>Allows to process files opened by other applications for writing.
It helps if an application allowed read access to file, but if all
types of file access are prohibited, file open operation still will
fail.</P>

<P>This option could be dangerous, because it allows a file to be
archived, while that file may be in the process of being modified by
an other application. Use with great care.</P>

<h1><I>Generate archive name by mask</I></h1>

<P>Appends the current date string to an archive name when creating
an archive. Useful for daily backups. The date string is formatted
by the specified mask. Read description of <A HREF="HELPSwAG.htm">switch
-ag</A> for details.</P>

<h1><I>Keep previous file versions</I></h1>

<P>Forces WinRAR to keep previous file versions when updating files
in the already existing archive. Old versions are renamed to 'filename;n',
where 'n' is the version number. Supported only by <A HREF="HELPRARVersusZIP.htm">
RAR</A> archives.</P>

<p>When using this option, it is recommended to avoid names in 'filename;n'
format among files to add. Such names can lead to duplicate entries
if old version with same name either is present in archive or will be created
later.</p>
