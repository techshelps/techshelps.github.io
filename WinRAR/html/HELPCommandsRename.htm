<P class="title"><A NAME="HELPCommandsRename"></A>"Rename file" command<hr></P>


<P>This command allows to rename a file or folder under the cursor
and is accessible both in <A HREF="HELPShellModes.htm">file management</A>
and in <A HREF="HELPShellModes.htm">archive management</A> modes. Renaming
files inside of archives is supported for RAR and ZIP formats. To run
this command use either <A HREF="HELPCommandsMenu.htm">Commands menu</A>
or F2 keyboard shortcut.</P>

<P>Rename command has some restrictions when working with <A HREF=
"HELPArcVolumes.htm">multivolume archives</A>. Only those files which
are contained in the current volume can be renamed. If you wish to
rename files in volumes, you need to disable "Merge volume contents"
option in the <A HREF="HELPFileListSettings.htm">File list</A> settings
dialog and open the volume containing required files.</P>

<P>Be careful when choosing a new file name. If it includes characters,
which are not supported by file system, you may have problems with
extracting the renamed file afterwards. In such situation just rename
it again to something more usable.</P>
