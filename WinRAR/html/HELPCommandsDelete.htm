<P class="title"><A NAME="HELPCommandsDelete"></A>"Delete files" command<hr></P>


<P>This command is accessible both in <A HREF="HELPShellModes.htm">
file management</A> and in <A HREF="HELPShellModes.htm">archive management</A>
modes. In file management mode it deletes the selected files and folders
to the Recycle Bin, so you have the chance to restore accidentally
deleted data. But in archive management mode the selected files and
folders are deleted from the archive completely, without any possibility
of restoring them later, so you need to be careful here. To run this
command use either <A HREF="HELPCommandsMenu.htm">Commands menu</A>
, button "Delete" on the toolbar, Alt+D or Del keyboard shortcuts.</P>


<P>In file management mode you can also delete files permanently.
Press Shift+Del instead of Del to avoid moving files to the Recycle Bin.
Shift+Del command silenly deletes even files with read-only and system
attributes and permits to delete files with non-standard names,
such as with trailing spaces and dots. Usual Recycle Bin based delete
can fail to process such names.</P>
