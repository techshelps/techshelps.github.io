<P class="title"><A NAME="HELPSwVER"></A>Switch <B>-VER[n]</B>  -
file version control<hr></P>

<P>Forces WinRAR to keep previous file versions when updating files
in the already existing archive. Old versions are renamed to '<I>filename;n</I>
', where <I>'n'</I> is the version number. Supported only for <A HREF=
"HELPRARVersusZIP.htm">RAR</A> archives.</P>

<P>By default, when unpacking an archive without the switch -ver,
WinRAR extracts only last added file version, the name of which does
not include a numeric suffix. But if you specify a file name exactly,
including a version, it will be also unpacked. For example, <I>'rar
x arcname'</I> will unpack only last versions, when <I>'rar x arcname
file.txt;5'</I> will unpack <I>'file.txt;5'</I>, if it is present in
the archive.</P>

<P>If you specify -ver switch without a parameter when unpacking,
WinRAR will extract all versions of all files that match the entered
file mask. In this case a version number is not removed from unpacked
file names. You may also extract a concrete file version specifying
its number as -ver parameter. It will tell WinRAR to unpack only this
version and remove a version number from file names. For example, <I>
'rar x -ver5 arcname'</I> will unpack only 5th file versions.</P>

<P>If you specify 'n' parameter when archiving, it will limit the
maximum number of file versions stored in the archive. Old file versions
exceeding this threshold will be removed.</P>

<p>When archiving with -ver switch, it is recommended to avoid names
in 'filename;n' format among files to add. Such names can lead to duplicate
entries if old version with same name either is present in archive
or will be created later.</p>
