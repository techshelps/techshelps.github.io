<P class="title"><A NAME="HELPPathsSettings"></A>Paths settings dialog<hr></P>


<P>To activate this dialog select "Settings…" command in <A HREF="HELPOptionsMenu.htm">
Options menu</A> and click on "Paths" tab. The dialog contents are
described below.</P>

<h1><I>Folder for temporary files</I></h1>

<P>WinRAR uses this folder to create temporary files. If this field
is blank, temporary files and folders will be created either 
in the current folder or in Windows temporary folder, depending
on command type.</P>
<p>Initial state of this parameter is the standard Windows temporary
folder. If you changed it and wish to revert it back to Windows temporary
folder later, you can enter <b>%temp%</b> instead of folder name.
WinRAR will expand it to Windows temporary folder name before creating
temporary files.</p>

<h1><I>Folder for temporary files/Use only for removable disks</I></h1>

<P>For hard disks generally it is faster to create a temporary archive
in the current folder, but for slow external disks it may be more efficient
to create an archive on a hard disk and then copy it to external disk.
To implement such behavior you should specify <I>Folder for temporary files</I>
and turn on <I>Use only for removable disks</I> option.</P>

<P><I>Use only for removable disks</I> option affects only those commands
which involve archive modification. Other commands would not benefit
from it, so they ignore the current disk type.</P>

<h1><I>Start-up folder</I></h1>

<P>You may enter here a folder, which will be opened each time when
WinRAR is started. This option has meaning only if <I>Restore last
working folder on start-up</I> option is switched off, otherwise last
opened folder will be set.</P>

<h1><I>Start-up folder/Restore last working folder on start-up</I></h1>


<P>If this option is enabled, WinRAR will set last viewed folder,
when executed without parameters.</P>

<h1><I>Default folder for archives</I></h1>

<P>If this field is not empty and an archive name does not contain
a full path, an archive will be created in the specified folder. For
example, if you entered the path to your Desktop, archives created
by WinRAR will appear on the Desktop.</P>

<P>If this field is empty and an archive name does not contain a full
path, archives will be created in the same folder as the files archived.</P>

<P>In the command line mode <A HREF="HELPSwCFGm.htm">-cfg-</A> switch disables
most of WinRAR settings including the default folder for archives.</P>


<h1><I>Default folder for extracted files</I></h1>

<P>You may enter here a name of the folder, which will be used as
a base to construct the destination folder in <A HREF="HELPCommandsExtract.htm">
Extract without confirmation</A> and <A HREF="HELPCommandsExtractTo.htm">
Extract files to a specified folder</A> commands. WinRAR builds the
destination path in these extraction commands merging the default folder
and an archive name. It may be convenient to enter Desktop path here,
so you will immediately see unpacked data on your Desktop.</P>

<p>Unlike the default folder for archives</I>, the default folder 
for extracted files is not used in the command line mode.
Only "Extract files..." command is affected
in <a href="HELPWinShellMenu.htm">context menus</a>.</p>


<h1><I>Append archive name to path</I></h1>

<P>It controls if archive name is appended to the default folder 
or to folder proposed in extraction dialog, when constructing
the destination path for extracted files.</P>

<h1><I>Remove redundant folders from extraction path</I></h1>

<p>This option works only in <a href="HELPWinShellMenu.htm">context menus</a>,
only for single selected archive with single folder and no files in archive
root folder and only for "Extract to DestName\" command, where 'DestName'
is a name of folder proposed by WinRAR and based on archive name.
If all these conditions are met, this option removes the top level folder
based on archive name from extraction path.<p>

<p>For example, if you have Pictures.rar containing all files in 'Samples'
folder and if you unpack it with "Extract to Pictures\" context menu command,
WinRAR will place files to "Pictures\Samples" if this option is off 
and to "Samples" if it is on. So it helps to save one click, avoiding
necessity to open 'Pictures' folder, which contains nothing but 'Samples'.</p>

<p>This option introduces an additional delay in the beginning
of extraction, because WinRAR needs to scan an archive and analyze
its folder structure. Note that context menu still displays
the archive based folder name even if it will be removed from path
when extracting. Showing the correct folder already in context menu
would introduce a potentially annoying delay between right clicking
an archive and displaying the context menu.<p>
