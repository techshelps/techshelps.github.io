<P class="title"><A NAME="HELPExtrPassword"></A>Enter password for
extracted file<hr></P>

<P>You are trying to extract an <A HREF="HELPArcEncryption.htm">encrypted</A>
file or view contents of encrypted archive. Enter the password or cancel
the extraction.</P>

<p>If you unpack several archives at once, you can enable
<i>"Use for all archives"</i> option to apply the entered password
to all archives. This option is not available if only one archive is 
processed. Another possible application for this option is skipping
encrypted archives. Just enter an empty string as a password
and set <i>"Use for all archives"</i> on.</p> 

<p>If you already saved some passwords, you can access them either
using the drop down list associated with "Enter password" field
or utilizing the autocomplete feature. Press <i>"Organize passwords..."</i>
button to open <a href="HELPOrgPasswords.htm">"Organize passwords"</a> dialog,
where you can save frequently used passwords.</p>

<p>If saved passwords are protected with master password, you need to
enter the master password and press "OK" to access them. If entered password
does not match the master password, this dialog will treat it as a usual
password for archive operations.</p>
