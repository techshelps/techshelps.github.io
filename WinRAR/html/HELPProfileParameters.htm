<P class="title"><A NAME="HELPProfileParameters"></A>"Profile parameters"
dialog<hr></P>

<P>In this dialog you can describe a new <A HREF="HELPProfiles.htm">
compression profile</A> or edit parameters of an existing profile.
It contains the following items:</P>

<h1><I>Profile name</I></h1>

<P>Profile name is a text string describing a profile. It may contain space
characters, for example, the name "Create e-mail attachment" is valid.
It is recommended to give sensible names to profiles, it simplifies their
identification and management. This field is required and cannot be empty.</P>

<p>You can add an optional %arcname% variable to profile name and it will be
replaced with actual archive name. It might be convenient when using
with "Add to context menu" option. For example, you can create ZIP compression
profile and set its name to "Add to %arcname%", to display it with actual
ZIP archive name in context menu.</p>

<h1><I>Save archive name</I></h1>

<P>If this option is on, the archive name specified in the field below
is saved in the profile and will be restored when selecting this profile.
If the option is off, an archive name will be proposed by WinRAR, as
usual.</P>

<h1><I>Save selected file names</I></h1>

<P>If this option is on, the file names specified in the field below
are saved in the profile. So if you select the profile later, WinRAR
will compress files saved in the profile instead of files selected
before activating the profile. </P>

<P>Initially this field contains names of files currently selected
in WinRAR file list, but you may edit them or enter new names here.
Folder names and wildcards are allowed. For example, you may create
a profile containing "C:\" as the selected file name to backup the
whole C: disk.</P>

<P>If this option is off, WinRAR will compress currently selected
files.</P>

<h1><I>Set profile as default</I></h1>

<P>If a profile is marked as default, it will be automatically selected
when opening the <A HREF="HELPGetArcName.htm">Archive name and parameters</A>
dialog before every archiving operation. It is convenient to create
a default profile with your favorite compression options, so you do
not need to set them every time. Only one profile can be set as default.
If no profiles are marked as default, the archiving dialog will be
initialized by the standard set of archiving options.</P>

<P>Some parameters of default compression profile are used not only
when adding files to archive, but in other archive modification operations
like deleting or renaming files. In this case WinRAR reads only those
parameters, which are suitable for current operation. Extraction
does not use any options from the default compression profile.</P>

<h1><I>Immediate execution</I></h1>

<P>If you select a profile having the <I>Immediate execution</I> parameter
set on, the archiving operation will be started immediately, without
possibility to modify compression settings or an archive name. It can
be useful for routine compression operations, because you do not need
to press the "OK" button every time after selecting such a profile.</P>


<h1><I>Create shortcut on Desktop</I></h1>

<P>This option is available only if <I>Save selected file names</I>
option is enabled. If selected, WinRAR will create the icon with a
profile name on Desktop, so you may activate a profile later simply
clicking on this icon. For example, you may create a profile to backup
your data and put its icon to the Desktop to simplify this operation.</P>

<h1><I>Add to context menu</I></h1>

<P>If this option is on, the profile name will be displayed in Explorer
<A HREF="HELPWinShellMenu.htm">context menus</A> allowing to activate
a profile from them. If you also set the <I>Immediate execution</I> profile
option, archiving will start immediately after choosing a profile
in context menu. If <I>Immediate execution</I> is off, you will see
<A HREF="HELPGetArcName.htm">Archive name and parameters</A> dialog first.
If <I>Save archive name</I> is on, WinRAR will use the saved name
for new archive. If <I>Save selected file names</I> is on, both names
stored in profile and names selected in Explorer will be added to archive.</P>
