<P class="title"><A NAME="HELPCompressionSettings"></A>Compression
settings dialog<hr></P>

<P>To activate this dialog select "Settings…" command in <A HREF="HELPOptionsMenu.htm">
Options menu</A> and click on "Compression" tab. The dialog contents
are described below. Note that most of compression options can be specified
via the <I>Compression profiles/Create default</I> button.</P>

<P>More details about different compression parameters can be found
in <A HREF="HELPArcOptimal.htm">How to choose optimal archiving
settings</A> topic.</P>

<h1><I>Compression profiles/Create default</I></h1>

<P>In the dialog displayed after pressing this button you may specify
default values for most compression options. Online help is available
for all sections of the dialog, simply press "Help" button at any time
to read detailed options description.</P>

<P>Options entered in this dialog are stored in the default <A HREF=
"HELPProfiles.htm">compression profile</A>, which name is "Default
Profile", and are automatically restored before every archiving operation.</P>

<P>Some parameters of default compression profile are used not only
when adding files to archive, but in other archive modification operations
like deleting or renaming files. In this case WinRAR reads only those
parameters, which are suitable for current operation. Extraction
does not use any options from the default compression profile.</P>

<h1><I>Compression profiles/Organize</I></h1>

<P>Opens the dialog to organize <A HREF="HELPProfiles.htm">compression
profiles</A>. In this <A HREF="HELPOrganizeProfiles.htm">Organize profiles</A>
dialog you may delete existing profiles or edit their parameters. For
example, you may rename a profile or set it as default. Read online
help associated with this dialog for more information.</P>

<h1><I>Volume size list/Define volume sizes…</I></h1>

<P>This button activates <A HREF="HELPDefVolSizes.htm">Define volume sizes</A>
dialog. Here you can customize the list of predefined volume sizes associated
with "Split to volumes, size" field in <A HREF="HELPGetArcGeneral.htm">
Archive name and parameters</A> dialog.</P>

<h1><I>File types to open as archives first</I></h1>

<p>Define how to handle Enter or double click on files with archive
contents and non-archive name extension in WinRAR file list
in <a href="HELPShellModes.htm">file management</a> mode.
It does not affect processing of usual archives with extensions
like .rar or .zip.</p>

<p>Specify one or more masks separated by spaces to choose files treated
as archives. All files with non-archive extensions not matching these masks
will be either executed or opened in their associated programs if such
programs are available. For example, if *.exe mask is not present here
and you press Enter on a self-extracting exe archive in WinRAR file list,
WinRAR will run this SFX archive instead of displaying its contents.</p>

<p>If file matches any mask, WinRAR will attempt to open it as an archive
first and only if it is not an archive, it will be procesed as a usual file.
This option is ignored inside of archives, so archived files are opened
in associated programs on Enter.</p>

<p>Regardless of this option, you can always browse any archive file contents,
inside or outside of archive, with standard or non-standard extension,
by pressing Ctrl+PgDn on its name in WinRAR file list.</p>
