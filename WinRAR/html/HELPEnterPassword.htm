<P class="title"><A NAME="HELPEnterPassword"></A>Enter default password<hr></P>


<P>In this dialog you may enter a default password, which will apply
to the add, extract, test and view operations. </P>

<P>If <I>"Show password"</I> option is disabled and password is requested
for archiving operation, you will be asked to type the password twice to
ensure correctness.</P>

<P>If you set <I>"Encrypt file names"</I> option, WinRAR will encrypt
not only file data, but all other sensitive archive areas like file
names, sizes, attributes, comments and other blocks, so it provides
a higher security level. Without a password it is impossible to view
even the list of files in archive encrypted with this option. This
option makes sense only when compressing data to <A HREF="HELPRARVersusZIP.htm">
RAR</A> archive, it is ignored when the default password is used to
decompress data or to compress to ZIP.</P>

<p>"ZIP legacy encryption" option is available only when adding files
to ZIP archive. It enables use of ZIP legacy encryption algorithm.
If this option is turned off, ZIP archives are encrypted with AES-256,
which is more secure, but can be incompatible with some older versions
of unzip tools.</p>

<p>If you enabled <i>"Use for all archives"</i> option and entered
the empty string as a password, extract and test commands will skip
all encrypted archives. All attempts to open encrypted files and archives
will also be blocked until this option is turned off. This mode can be
convenient if you are going to unpack a group of archives in unattended 
mode and want to avoid password prompts. <i>"Use for all archives"</i> is not
available for non-empty passwords, because non-empty default passwords
are applied to all archives automatically, without any additional options.</p> 

<p>If you already saved some passwords, you can access them either
using the drop down list associated with "Enter password" field
or utilizing the autocomplete feature. Press <i>"Organize passwords..."</i>
button to open <a href="HELPOrgPasswords.htm">"Organize passwords"</a> dialog,
where you can save frequently used passwords.</p>

<p>If saved passwords are protected with master password, you need to
enter the master password and press "OK" to access them. If entered password
does not match the master password, this dialog will treat it as a usual
password for archive operations.</p>
