dialog: time options<hr></p>

<h1><i>Store modification, creation, last access time</i></h1>

<p>Enable storing file modification, creation, last access times
in archive. Supported only by <A HREF="HELPRARVersusZIP.htm">RAR</A> archives.
Only <a href="HELPRAR5Format.htm">RAR 5.0</a> archive format allows to
disable storing the file modification time. If one of these file times
is not saved in archive, it will be assigned to the current system time
when extracting.</p>

<p>You need to enable "Set creation time" and "Set last access time" options
in <a href="HELPExtractAdvOptions.htm">Advanced</a> part of extraction dialog
to restore these times when extracting files. "Set modification time"
is enabled by default.</p>

<h1><i>High precision time format</i></h1>

<p>If this option is disabled, file time is stored with 2 second precision
for RAR 4.x and ZIP archives and with 1 second precision for RAR 5.x archives.
Enabling this option slightly increases the archive size, but allows to
preserve the file time with 0.0000001 second precision.</p>

<p>If this option is enabled for ZIP format, all three file times
(modification, creation, last access) are stored with the high precision.
Unlike RAR format, we cannot store a single file time with the high precision
in ZIP.</p>


<h1><i>Preserve source files last access time</i></h1>

<p>By default the last access time of source files is changed after archiving.
We can enable this option if we wish to preserve the original value of this
time. This option keeps the original last access time of archiving files,
but it does not control which timestamps are to be stored in archive.
For example, if we wish to save the last access time to archive and preserve
the last access time of source files, we need to use this and "Store last
access time" options together. This option can prevent to open some files,
which can be opened without it.</p>


<h1><I>Include files: of any time / older than / newer than / before / after</I></h1>

<P>The default value of this option is "any time", so WinRAR will
archive all selected files regardless of their time stamp. But changing
it to "older than" or "newer than" you may force WinRAR to archive
only those files which modification, creation or last access time is older
or newer than a specified number of days, hours and minutes.
For example, it can be useful if you wish to archive only files modified
in last 3 days. Using "before" or "after" options you may choose only those
files which modification, creation or last access time is older or newer
than specified date.</P>

<p>"Newer than" and "after" options also include files matching
the specified date exactly. "Older than" and "before" exclude such files.</p>

<h1><I>Set archive time to: current system time / original archive
time / latest file time</I></h1>

<P>Default value for this option is the "current system time",
so every new or modified archive receives the current system time
as modification file time.
But you also may set this option to the "original archive time" to
prevent the archive time from changing or to the "latest file time"
to set the modification time of a changed archive to the time of 
newest file in the archive.</P>
