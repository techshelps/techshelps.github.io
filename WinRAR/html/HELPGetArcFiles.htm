<P class="title"><A NAME="HELPGetArcFiles"></A>Archive name and parameters
dialog: files<hr></P>

<h1><I>Files to add</I></h1>

<P>Names of files and folders to compress. This field is automatically
filled by selected file names, but, if necessary, you may edit them manually
or press "Append" button to choose more files to add to the list.</P>

<P>It is allowed to enter wildcard masks here. In this case WinRAR will
search for files matching a mask in the current folder and all subfolders.
If you need to specify several masks, separate them by spaces.
If mask contains spaces, enclose it in quotes.
For example, you may enter:</P>

<P>*.txt *.doc "set 1.*"</P>

<P class="noindent">to archive all .txt and .doc files and files
matching "set 1.*" mask.</P>

<h1><I>Files to exclude</I></h1>

<P>File masks and file names to exclude from the archiving operation.
Wildcards are supported both in path and name parts of masks. 
If you need to specify several masks, separate them by spaces.
If mask contains spaces, enclose it in quotes. 
For example, you may enter:</P>

<P>c:\temp\info.txt *.bak *.tmp *\temp\</P>

<P class="noindent">to skip c:\temp\info.txt file, all .bak and .tmp files,
all temp folders and all files in temp folders. You may enter file names
manually or use "Append" button to browse for file to exclude.</P>

<P>Detailed information about exclusion masks syntax is provided
in description of <A HREF="HELPSwX.htm"><B>switch -x</B></A>. This switch
uses the same format of exclusion masks as "Files to exclude" field.</P>

<h1><I>Files to store without compression</I></h1>

<P>File masks and file names to store without compression.
This option may be used to store already compressed files, which helps to
increase archiving speed without noticeable loss in the compression ratio.
If you need to specify several masks, separate them by spaces.
If mask contains spaces, enclose it in quotes. 
For example, you may enter:</P>

<P>*.rar *.zip *.jpg </P>

<P class="noindent">to store without compression all RAR and ZIP archives
and JPG images.</P>

<h1><I>File paths</I></h1>

<P>Select the method of storing file paths in archive. WinRAR can store
relative paths which is the default mode, full file paths except the drive
letter and leading backslash character, file names only without paths
or full paths including the drive letter.</P>

<p>Relative paths mode excludes the current WinRAR folder. For paths entered
manually in "Files to add" field it excludes the base folder up to last path
separator similarly to <a href="HELPSwEP1.htm">-ep1</a> switch.</p>

<P>If you store names without paths, it is possible to create an archive
containing several files with the same name, so use "Do not store paths"
option with care.</P>

<P>If you store full paths including the drive letter, WinRAR will
replace drive separators (colons) by underscore characters. WinRAR
is able to change underscores back to colons and create unpacked files
in their original folders and disks, if you set "Extract absolute paths"
option in <A HREF="HELPExtractAdvOptions.htm">"Advanced"</A> part of
extraction dialog. You may read more about potential benefits and dangers
of "Store full paths including the drive letter" mode in the description
of <A HREF="HELPSwEP3.htm">-ep3 switch</A>, which is the command line
equivalent of this WinRAR option.</P>

<h1><I>Put each file to separate archive</I></h1>

<P>Put each selected file or folder to separate archive. If you set
this option, an entered archive name is treated only as a destination
path for new archives (if it is not a folder, its name part is ignored)
and archive names are generated basing on file names.</P>

<h1><I>Double extensions for archives</I></h1>
<p>This option modifies "Put each file to separate archive" behavior.
If "Double extensions for archives" is on, archives produced by
"Put each file to separate archive" will have names in filename.ext.rar
style, with archive extension appended to file name. If this option is off,
we'll have filename.rar archives with a file extension replaced by archive
extension. Even if this option is off, WinRAR can apply the double extension
mode to files which have the same name part and differ in extension only.</p>

<h1><I>Archives in subfolders</I></h1>
<p>This option modifies "Put each file to separate archive" behavior.
If "Archives in subfolders" is on, "Put each file to separate archive"
will place every file in selected subfolders to separate archive.
If this option is off, the entire contents of every selected folder
will be stored to separate archive.</p>

<h1><I>Send archive by email to [&lt;addr&gt;] [and then delete]</I>
</h1>

<P>This option allows to attach a created archive to email message.
You need to have an installed MAPI compliant email program to use this
option (most modern email programs support MAPI interface). If you
do not enter a destination email address here, it will be asked by
your email program. It is possible to specify several addresses separated
by commas or semicolons. If you set <I>"and then delete"</I> option,
an archive will be deleted after it was successfully attached to an
email.</P>

<P>If <I>Send archive by email</I> option is used when creating a
<A HREF="HELPArcVolumes.htm">multivolume archive</A>, every volume
will be attached to a separate email message.</P>
