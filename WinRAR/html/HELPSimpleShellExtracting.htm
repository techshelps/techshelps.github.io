<P class="title"><A NAME="HELPSimpleShellExtracting"></A>Quick start:
extracting files using WinRAR shell mode<hr></P>

<P>In order to extract files using WinRAR shell mode you must first
<B>open the required archive in WinRAR</B>. This may be achieved in
one of several ways:

<UL>
	<LI>double-click or press Enter on the archive name in Windows shell
(Explorer or Desktop). If WinRAR was associated with archives during
installation (the default installation option), an archive will be
opened in WinRAR. You also may associate WinRAR with archives after
installation using <A HREF="HELPIntegrationSettings.htm">Integration
settings dialog</A>;</LI>
	<LI>double-click or press Enter on the archive name in WinRAR window;</LI>
	<LI><A HREF="HELPWinShellDrag.htm">drag-and-drop</A> an archive to
the WinRAR icon or window. Before doing this ensure that WinRAR does
not already display another archive, otherwise the dropped archive
will be added to the currently displayed archive;</LI>
	<LI>run WinRAR from the command line with a single parameter - the
archive name.</LI>
</UL>

<P>When an archive is opened in WinRAR, its contents are displayed.
<B>Select files and folders</B>, which should be extracted. You may
do this using Shift + arrow keys or Shift + left mouse button as in
Windows Explorer and other Windows programs. Also in WinRAR it is possible
to <A HREF="HELPInterfaceSelecting.htm">select files</A> using Space
or Ins keys. "Gray +" and "Gray -" keys on the numeric keypad allow
the selection of groups of files using file masks.</P>

<P>Having selected one or more files, <B>click the Extract To button</B>
at the top of the WinRAR window or press Alt+E , enter the destination
folder in the dialog box and click on <B>OK</B>. This dialog box also
offers a few advanced<B> </B>options (see <A HREF="HELPExtractOptions.htm">
Extraction path and options dialog</A> for more information).</P>

<P>During the extraction process, a window will be displayed showing
operation statistics. If you wish to break the extraction process,
click on the Cancel button in the command window. You may press the
"Background" button in this window to minimize WinRAR to the tray.
If the extraction is completed without errors, WinRAR will return to
the shell, in case of an error, a <B>Diagnostic message window </B>
will be displayed.</P>
