<P>Here you need to select an archive to unpack.</P>

<P>Press <I>"Browse"</I> button, locate your archive, put the cursor
to its name and press <I>"Open"</I>. Also , instead of using <I>"Browse"</I>,
you may drag the archive icon and drop the icon to this dialog.</P>


<P>After you selected the archive name, press <I>"Next"</I> button
at the bottom of dialog.</P>

<P>Note that WinRAR may attempt to guess an archive name and set a
name of some existing archive from your Desktop when activating the
dialog. If it is really the archive which you wanted to unpack, just
press <I>"Next"</I>, but if WinRAR guess was wrong, simply select an
archive name which you want, as described above.</P>
