<P class="title"><A NAME="HELPSimpleWindowsArchiving"></A>Quick start:
archiving files in Explorer or Desktop<hr></P>

<P>If you did not disable the "Integrate WinRAR into shell" option
when installing WinRAR, it is possible to archive files directly in
a Windows shell. Select the files you are going to compress, in Explorer
or Desktop, press the right mouse button on the selected files and
choose "Add to archive…". Enter the destination archive name in the
dialog box which appears or accept the default name. You may also select
the format of the new archive (<A HREF="HELPRARVersusZIP.htm">RAR or
ZIP</A>), compression level, volume size and other archiving parameters.
This dialog is described in detail in the <A HREF="HELPGetArcName.htm">
Archive name and parameters dialog</A> topic. Click on the OK button
when done. An archive will be created in the same folder as the selected
files.</P>

<P>You may also select the "Add to &lt;archive name&gt; archive" command
to add to the proposed archive without additional requests. In this
case compression settings selected in the default <A HREF="HELPProfiles.htm">
compression profile</A> will be used.</P>

<P>Note that if the option "Cascaded context menus" in <A HREF="HELPIntegrationSettings.htm">
Integration settings dialog</A> is switched on, you need to open "WinRAR"
submenu to access to described above commands. Otherwise they are resided
in the top level menu.</P>

<P>Another method is to drag file icons to an existing archive icon
and drop them. Files will be added to this archive.</P>
