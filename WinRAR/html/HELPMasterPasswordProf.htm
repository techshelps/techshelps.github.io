<P class="title"><A NAME="HELPMasterPasswordProf"></A>Storing a password in compression profile<hr></P>

<P>Unless the master password is set, passwords stored in compression
profiles are not encrypted securely and can be read by anybody having access
to your computer. You can enter the master password to encrypt password
data stored in Registry and protect it from unauthorized access.
You will need to enter the master password in password prompt dialog
to access such compression profile after that.</p>

<p>You can use the same master password as in password organizer
or choose the different password. You can even assign different master
passwords to different compression profiles, though it might be inconvenient
to use.</p>

<p>Once entered, the master password is valid for subsequent profile reads
until WinRAR is closed or compression profile with another master
password is selected. Close WinRAR and open it again after specifying
the master password if you wish to see how protection works.</p>
