<h1><I>How to install an application from an archive</I></h1>

<P>You may install or run an application directly from an archive.
Just enter to an archive and press Enter on setup.exe or install.exe
program. When Enter is pressed on an archived file, which has .exe
extension WinRAR extracts the entire contents of the archive to a temporary
folder and then runs the executable file. When the executable has terminated,
WinRAR tests the modification time of the extracted files and if any
files were changed or if new files were created, Offers to update the
archive and then deletes the temporary folder and its contents.</P>


<h1><I>If you want to use WinRAR to handle archives, but an external
program changed archive associations</I></h1>

<P>Some programs may register themselves as the default archive viewer
even without asking. If this happens and you want to re-register WinRAR
again, select "Settings…" item in <A HREF="HELPOptionsMenu.htm">Options</A>
menu, activate <A HREF="HELPIntegrationSettings.htm">Integration settings
dialog</A>, select archive formats to associate with WinRAR and press
Enter.</P>

<h1><I>How to install WinRAR in silent mode</I></h1>

<P>If you need to install WinRAR to a large number of computers,
it may be boring to answer to setup questions again and again.
In such case you may run WinRAR installation with switch -s to skip
all questions and use default settings.</P>
