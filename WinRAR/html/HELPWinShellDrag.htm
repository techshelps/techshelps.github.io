<P>WinRAR supports the Windows drag and drop facility.</P>

<P>If, in the <A HREF="HELPShellModes.htm">file management mode</A>,
a single archive is dropped to WinRAR, the archive contents will be
displayed and WinRAR will enter <A HREF="HELPShellModes.htm">archive
management mode</A>.</P>

<P>If, in the file management mode, a one or more non-archive files
are dropped to WinRAR, WinRAR will prompt for an archive name and add
these files to that archive.</P>

<P>If, in the archive management mode, a single archive is dropped
to WinRAR toolbar or address bar, contents of dropped archive will
be displayed. If you wish to add one or more files to currently browsing
archive, drop them to WinRAR file list. Though, if files are not archives,
dropping them to toolbar or address bar will produce the same result
as dropping to file list. Dropping files is available only into RAR
and ZIP archives.</P>

<P>Regardless of the current WinRAR mode and archive format, you may
drag files from WinRAR to other programs.</P>

<P>If you did not disable the option "Integrate WinRAR into shell"
when installing WinRAR, you may drop files to RAR or ZIP archive icons
on the Desktop to add files to an archive. Also if you drag an archive
using the right mouse button and drop it to the destination folder,
you may select "Extract Here" in the context menu to extract all 
iles from the dropped archive to the destination folder.
If you drag a single non-archive file or several files with right mouse
button and drop them to the destination folder, you will be able to create
an archive containing these files in the destination folder using 
"Add to archive..." and "Add to &lt;archive name&gt;" commands
in context menu.</P>
