<P class="title"><A NAME="HELPSimpleShellArchiving"></A>Quick start:
archiving files from the WinRAR shell<hr></P>

<P>First, you need to <B>run WinRAR</B>.  Double-click or press Enter
on the WinRAR icon. You can also start it from the Windows "Start menu":
enter "Programs" then "WinRAR" and then run the "WinRAR" item.</P>

<P>When WinRAR is running, it displays a list of files and folders
in the current folder. You need to <B>go to the folder, which contains
files to archive</B>. You may use Ctrl+D, the disks list below the
toolbar or click on the small disk icon in the bottom left corner,
to change the current disk. Press BS, Ctrl+PgUp, small "Up" button
below the toolbar or double-click on the folder named ".." to go to
the parent folder. Press Enter, Ctrl+PgDn or double-click on any other
folder to enter that folder. Ctrl+\ sets the root disk folder
or folder containing an archive as the current.</P>

<P>When you have entered the folder with the desired files, <B>select
the files and folders</B>, which you are going to archive. This may
be achieved by using Shift + arrow keys or the mouse as in Windows
Explorer and other Windows programs. It is also possible, in WinRAR,
to select files using Space or Ins keys. "Gray +" and "Gray -" keys
on the numeric keypad allow the selection of groups of files using
file masks.</P>

<P>Having selected one or more files, <B>click on the Add button</B>
at the top of the WinRAR window, press Alt+A or select the "Add files
to archive" command in the <A HREF="HELPCommandsMenu.htm">Commands
menu</A>. Enter the destination archive name in the dialog box which
appears or simply accept the default name. You may select, in this
dialog, the format of the new archive (<A HREF="HELPRARVersusZIP.htm">
RAR or ZIP</A>), compression level, volume size and other archiving
parameters. This dialog described in details in <A HREF="HELPGetArcName.htm">
Archive name and parameters dialog</A> topic. <B>Click on the OK button</B>
when you are ready to create the archive.</P>

<P>During the archiving process, a window will be displayed showing
operation statistics. If you wish to break the archiving process, click
on the Cancel button in the command window. You may press the "Background"
button in this window to minimize WinRAR to the tray. When archiving
is completed, the command window disappears and the newly created archive
becomes the currently selected file.</P>

<P>It is also possible to add files, to an existing RAR archive, using
<A HREF="HELPWinShellDrag.htm">drag-and-drop</A>.<B> </B>Select the
desired archive in the WinRAR window and press Enter (or double click)
on its name. RAR will read the archive and display its contents. You
may now add files to the archive by simply dragging them from another
program and dropping to WinRAR.</P>
