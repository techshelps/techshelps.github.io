<P class="title"><A NAME="HELPConsoleRAR"></A>Console RAR version<hr></P>


<P><B></B>Additionally to WinRAR you can find the file <I>rar.exe</I>
in the distributive. This is also RAR version for Windows, but it
supports only the command line text mode interface. This console RAR
version is convenient, when you need to call RAR from BAT and CMD files
or to use it at the command prompt. It supports a larger number of
command line switches and commands comparing to WinRAR.
Though common aspects of the command line WinRAR syntax considered
in <A HREF="HELPCommandLineSyntax.htm">Command line interface</A> chapter
are also true for console RAR, this help file does not contain
descriptions of those switches and commands, which are supported
only by the console version. Please read <B><I>rar.txt</I></B> file
for a detailed description of all console RAR features.</P>
