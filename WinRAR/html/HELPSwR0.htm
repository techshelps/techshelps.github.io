<P class="title"><A NAME="HELPSwR0"></A>Switch <B>-R0</B>  -  recurse
subfolders for wildcard names only<hr></P>

<P>Similar to <A HREF="HELPSwR.htm">switch -r</A>, but when used with
the commands <B>a</B>, <B>u</B>, <B>f</B>, <B>m</B> will recurse subfolders
only for those file masks, which include wildcard characters '*' and '?'.</P>

<p>This switch works only for file names. Folder names without a file name
part, such as 'foldername', are not affected by -r0 and their contents
is added to archive completely unless <A HREF="HELPSwRm.htm">-r- switch</A>
is specified.</p>

<h1><B>Example</B></h1>

<p>add all *.doc files from the current folder and its subfolders and file
readme.txt only from the current folder to docs.rar archive. In case of
usual -r switch, WinRAR would search for readme.txt in subfolders too.</p>

<p class="sample">WinRAR a -r0 docs.rar *.doc readme.txt</p>
