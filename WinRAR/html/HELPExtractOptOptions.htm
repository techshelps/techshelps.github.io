<P class="title"><A NAME="HELPExtractAdvOptions"></A>Extraction path
and options dialog: options<hr></P>

<h1><I>Extract archives to</I></h1>

<P>These options are available only if several archives are selected.
"Destination path" places extracted files to specified destination folder.
"Subfolders in destination path" creates a separate subfolder in destination
folder for each archive. "Subfolders in archive folders" creates a separate
subfolder for each archive in archive's own folder. "Archive folders" places
extracted files directly to archive's own folders without creating separate
subfolders.</p>

<h1><I>Additional switches</I></h1>

<P>Here you can provide one or more <a href="HELPSwitches.htm">command line
switches</a>. It might be useful if there is no option in WinRAR graphical
interface matching a switch. For example, to ignore stored file attributes
and exclude .txt files, set this string to:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="sample">-ai -x*.txt</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Switches entered here override similar graphical interface options.
Use this feature only if you are familiar with WinRAR command line syntax
and clearly understand what specified switches are intended for.
Not every switch is applicable here. Improper use of this option
can interfere with WinRAR functionality and even lead to data loss.</p>
