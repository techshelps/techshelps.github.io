<P class="title"><A NAME="HELPSwOH"></A>Switch <B>-OH</B>  - save hard links
as the link instead of the file<hr></P>

<p>If archiving files include several NTFS hard links, store the first
archived hard link as usual file and the rest of hard links in the same set
as links to this first file. When extracting such files, WinRAR will create
hard links instead of usual files.</p>

<p>You must not delete or rename the first hard link in archive
after the archive was created, because it will make extraction
of following links impossible. If you modify the first link,
following links will also have the modified contents after extracting.
Extraction command must involve the first hard link to create following
hard links successfully.
Supported for <a href="HELPRAR5Format.htm">RAR 5.0</a> archives only.</p>


<p>This switch is the command line equivalent of
<a href="HELPGetArcAdvanced.htm#hardlinks">Store hard links as links</a>
group of options in "Archive name and parameters" dialog.</p>
