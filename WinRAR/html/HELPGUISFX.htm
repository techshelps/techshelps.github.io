<P class="title"><A NAME="HELPGUISFX"></A>GUI RAR and ZIP SFX modules
(Default.SFX and Zip.SFX)<hr></P>

<P>Using these two modules you may create GUI (graphic mode)
<a href="HELPArcSFX.htm">self-extracting archives</A> for Windows.</P>

<P>Use <I>Default.SFX</I> module for <A HREF="HELPRARVersusZIP.htm">
RAR archives</A> and <I>Zip.SFX</I> for <A HREF="HELPRARVersusZIP.htm">
ZIP archives</A>.</P>

<p>WinRAR x64 also includes Default64.SFX and Zip64.SFX, which are 64 bit
versions of these SFX modules. By default WinRAR x64 uses 32 bit versions,
but you can select 64 bit modules explicitly in 
<A HREF="HELPSFXOptModule.htm">SFX options: Module</A> dialog.
Resulting 64 bit SFX archive will work only in Windows x64.<p>

<p>Both these modules support simple setup commands and command line options.
Use links below to read more about it:

<li><a href="HELPGUISFXCmd.htm">SFX command line options</a>.

<h1><B>Notes</B></h1>

<ol type="1">
  <li>It is allowed to edit Windows resources contained in SFX modules
to adapt them for your needs. For example, you may wish to resize
the start dialog or add some graphics to it. WinRAR does not provide
tools or documentation for modifying resources. It is rather complicated
process and if you wish to do so, you must already have a resource editor
and you must know how to work with it. But you do not need to edit
resources if the standard SFX start dialog is acceptable for you.
Also if you need to change only SFX logo or icon, you can use "Text and icon"
page of <A HREF="HELPSFXAdvOpt.htm">Advanced SFX options</A> dialog.</li>
  <li>By default, exit codes returned by GUI self-extracting archives
when terminating are the same as <a href="HELPExitCodes.htm">WinRAR exit
codes</a>. It is possible to modify this behavior with 
<A HREF="HELPSFXSetupCode.htm">SetupCode</A> command, so SFX will also
return setup program exit codes.</li>
