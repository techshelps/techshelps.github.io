<P class="title"><A NAME="HELPSwSV"></A>Switch <B>-SV</B>  -  create
independent solid volumes<hr></P>

<P>By default WinRAR tries to reset <A HREF="HELPArcSolid.htm">solid</A>
statistics as soon as possible when starting a new <A HREF="HELPArcVolumes.htm">
volume</A>, but only if enough data was packed after a previous reset
(at least a few megabytes). This switch forces WinRAR to ignore packed
data size and attempt to reset statistics for volumes of any size.
It decreases compression, but increases chances to extract a part of
data if one of several solid volumes in a volume set was lost or damaged.</P>


<P>Note that sometimes WinRAR cannot reset statistics even using this
switch. For example, it cannot be done when compressing one large file
split between several volumes. WinRAR is able to reset solid statistics
only between separate files, but not inside of single file.</P>

<P>Ignored if used when creating a non-volume archive.</P>

<P>Also you may put this option to <A HREF="HELPRARVar.htm">RAR environment
variable</A> to use it in WinRAR shell.</P>
