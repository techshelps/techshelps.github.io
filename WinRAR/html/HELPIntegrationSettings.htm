<P class="title"><A NAME="HELPIntegrationSettings"></A>Integration
settings dialog<hr></P>

<P>To activate this dialog in WinRAR select "Settings…" command in
<A HREF="HELPOptionsMenu.htm">Options menu</A> and click on "Integration"
tab. The same set of options also is available when installing WinRAR,
so it is possible to change the described below options both during
installation and later, in WinRAR settings.</P>

<h1><I>Associate WinRAR with (RAR, ZIP, etc.)</I></h1>

<P>Associate WinRAR as default viewer for selected formats. It is reasonable
to leave these options selected, so you can open archives in WinRAR by
double clicking on archive name or icon in Explorer or Desktop. 
"Toggle all" button selects all formats at once or deselects them
if all they are already selected.</P>

<p>Beginning from Windows 10, Windows treats these association options
as recommendation only. Generally they are applied in case no other user
application is associated with a file type. Otherwise they are utilized
to build "Open with" list with multiple entries. So it may be necessary
to resort to Windows own settings to change an already existing file
association, such as "Choose another app" with "Always use this app to
open files" option in "Open with" Explorer menu or "Choose default apps
by file type" in Windows settings.</p>

<h1><I>User defined archive extensions</I></h1>

<P>Here you can specify additional file name extensions for archive
formats supported by WinRAR. For example, if you have files with ".dat"
extension, which are in RAR format, you can enter "dat" in this field
to associate WinRAR with such files and add extraction commands to
<A HREF="HELPWinShellMenu.htm">context menus</A> displayed for "dat"
files in Windows shell. If you need to enter several extensions, separate
them by spaces.</P>

<p>This option is available only in WinRAR settings, but not
in WinRAR installer.</p>

<h1><I>Interface/Add WinRAR to Desktop</I></h1>

<P>Add WinRAR icon to the Desktop.</P>

<h1><I>Interface/Add WinRAR to Start Menu</I></h1>

<P>Add WinRAR icon to the Start Menu.</P>

<P>This option adds WinRAR icon to top level of classic style Start Menu
in Windows XP. Starting from Windows Vista, programs cannot add themselves
to the top of the Start menu, so this option adds WinRAR icon to
"All Programs" list. You can use "Pin to Start Menu" Windows command 
if you need to add an application icon to top of Start Menu in Windows
Vista and newer.</P>

<h1><I>Interface/Create WinRAR program group</I></h1>

<P>Create a WinRAR program group in Start Menu/Programs.</P>

<h1><I>Shell integration/Integrate WinRAR into shell</I></h1>

<P>Allows the use of <A HREF="HELPWinShellMenu.htm">context menus</A>
and <A HREF="HELPWinShellDrag.htm">drag and drop</A> for handling WinRAR
archives.</P>

<h1><I>Shell integration/Cascaded context menus</I></h1>

<P>Place all items added by WinRAR to file and archive context menus
into submenu.</P>

<h1><I>Shell integration/Icons in context menus</I></h1>

<P>Add small icons to items added by WinRAR to file and archive context
menus.</P>

<h1><I>Shell integration/Context menu items</I></h1>

<P>Choose items to display in Explorer <A HREF="HELPWinShellMenu.htm">
context menus</A>.</P>
