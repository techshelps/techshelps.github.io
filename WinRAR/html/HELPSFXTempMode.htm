<P><B><I>TempMode=[Question][,Title]</I></B></P>

<P>This command forces SFX to create a temporary folder, extract all
files to it, start the program specified in <I>Setup</I> command and
remove the temporary folder including all its contents after completing
the <I>Setup</I> program. The SFX automatically sets the <A HREF="HELPSFXSilent.htm">
silent mode</A> to 2 to skip the start dialog when performing these
operations, but you can override it by specifying <I>Silent</I> command with
another parameter. Temporary folder with unpacked files is set as the current
folder for setup program.</P>

<P><I>TempMode</I> command may have the optional string parameter,
which is used to define a question and question title displayed before
extraction. In such case the extraction is started only if user selects
"Yes" button.</P>

<P>If <I>TempMode</I> command is present, a script should also have
<I>Setup</I> command. <I>Path</I> command is ignored in this mode.</P>

<P>In TempMode SFX needs to detect the termination of setup program to
delete temporary files. Such approach works correctly if setup program is not
terminated before installation is done. But sometimes the setup program starts
a child process and terminates, expecting a child process to complete
installation. In such case SFX deletes temporary files immediately after
detecting that main setup application is finished, resulting in malfunctioning
child process. So TempMode works correctly only with those setup programs,
which do not start another processes or, at least, are not terminated
until all child processes are finished.</P>
