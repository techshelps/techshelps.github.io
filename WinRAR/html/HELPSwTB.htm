<P class="title"><A NAME="HELPSwTB"></A>Switch <B>-TB[m,c,a,o]&lt;date&gt;</B>
-  process files modified before the specified date<hr></P>

<P>Process only files modified before the specified date.
Files matching the specified date exactly are not included.</P>

<P>Format of the date string is YYYYMMDDHHMMSS. It is allowed to insert
separators like '-' or ':' to the date string and omit trailing fields.
For example, the following switch is correct: -tb2001-11-20. Internally
it will be expanded to -tb20011120000000 and treated as "files modified
before 0 hour 0 minutes 0 seconds of 20 November 2001".</P>

<p>Use 'm', 'c', 'a' modifiers to specify modification, creation
and last access time accordingly, such as -tbc20011120 for creation time.
If such modifier is omitted, modification time is assumed.</p>

<p>It is allowed to use several modifiers in the same switch,
such as -tbmc20190215, to set the same date for all specified times.
Alternatively you can add several time filtering switches to command line.
By default, time filters use AND logic, so a file must match all such filters
to be processed. It can be changed to OR logic with 'o' modifier,
so a file will have to match at least one 'o' filter.
For example, use -tbco20190201 -tbmo20190210 to include files created
before 2019-02-01 or modified before 2019-02-10.</p>
