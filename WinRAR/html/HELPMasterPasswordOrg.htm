<P>Enter the master password to encrypt password records stored in Registry
and protect them from unauthorized access. You will need to enter
the master password in password prompt dialog to access these records
after that. Once entered, the master password is valid until WinRAR is closed.
Close WinRAR and open it again after specifying the master password
if you wish to see how protection works. Enter an empty password to
remove encryption from previously protected password records.</p>

<p>Actual encryption is performed only after you press "OK" in parent
"Organize passwords" dialog and not immediately after closing this master
password prompt.</p>
