<P>To activate this dialog select "Settings…" command in <A HREF="HELPOptionsMenu.htm">
Options menu</A> and click on "Viewer" tab. The dialog contents are
described below.</P>

<h1><I>Viewer type</I></h1>

Possible actions are:<br>
</P>

<TABLE cols=2>

WinRAR viewer</A></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD><b><I>External viewer</I></b></TD>

the "External viewer name" field</TD>
</TR>

<TR>

</TABLE>
<BR>

<P>These settings are ignored for some file types. In the <A HREF=
"HELPShellModes.htm">file management mode</A> they are ignored for
archives and executables. On Enter WinRAR always tries to open archives
and to run exe files. In the <A HREF="HELPShellModes.htm">archive management
mode</A> they are ignored for file types specified in "Unpack everything
for" field of viewer settings dialog. If Enter is pressed on such file,
WinRAR extracts the entire archive contents to a temporary folder,
runs a file, waits for it to terminate, updates the source archive
if necessary and then deletes the temporary folder and all of its contents.
This provides the convenient method of installing applications directly
from archives.</P>

<P>Unlike Enter, <A HREF="HELPCommandsView.htm">View file</A> command
always opens a file in the <A HREF="HELPInterfaceInternalViewer.htm">
internal WinRAR viewer</A>.</P>

<h1><I>Internal viewer/Autodetect encoding</I></h1>

<P>If this option is enabled, internal viewer attempts to automatically
detect file contents as Windows text (ANSI), DOS text (OEM), Unicode UTF-8
or UTF-16 little endian. If detection is incorrect, it is possible to change
encoding of already opened file using "View as…" commands in internal viewer
"View" menu.</P>


<h1><I>Internal viewer/Reuse existing window</I></h1>

<P>If this option is off, WinRAR creates a separate internal viewer
window for each viewing file. When the option is on, the already existing
window is reused, so only one instance of the viewer is opened.</P>


<h1><I>Internal viewer/Word wrap</I></h1>

<P>Switches between wrapping long strings and scrolling modes in the
internal viewer. This option affects only new viewer windows, already
opened are not changed.</P>

<h1><I>Unpack everything for</I></h1>

<P>Here you may define file masks which require unpacking of complete
archive contents, when user presses Enter or double clicks an archived
file matching one of these masks. Masks must be separated by spaces.
For example, if this field contains <i>*.exe *.htm *.html</i>, WinRAR will
unpack the complete archive before opening an archived executable or
HTML file. This option is necessary for those file types, which need
to access other archived files for proper executing or viewing.</P>

<P>WinRAR ignores "Viewer type" setting for file types defined in
"Unpack everything for" field and always opens them using an associated
program.</P>

<h1><I>Ignore modifications for</I></h1>

<P>By default, WinRAR proposes to update an archive if viewer modified
an opened file or created any new files, but it is possible to disable such
behavior. You can enter one or several file masks separated by spaces 
in "Ignore modifications for" field and WinRAR will not prompt to update
an archive if file created or modified by viewer matches one of these
masks and will not add such file to archive.</P>

<P>For example, if this field contains <i>*.doc *.txt</i>, any .doc and .txt
files modified or created by external or associated viewer, will be ignored
and any changes made by user in such files while viewing them will be lost.
If you wish to disable archive updating for all viewed files, use * mask.</P>

<P>Masks in this option can have more complex syntax, combining archive
and file mask separated by two backslash characters: <i>arcmask\\filemask</i>.
Masks can include the path, which limits archives or files to specified folder
and its subfolders. You can use environment variables in the path.
It is allowed to omit 'arcmask\\' or 'filemask' components if you wish to
match all archives or all files.</P>

<P>For example, <i>*.rar\\*.txt</i> means all .txt files in all .rar archives,
<i>*\\temp\*</i> or just <i>temp\*</i> matches all files in 'temp' folders
inside of archives and <i>%temp%\*\\*</i> or <i>%temp%\*\\</i> instructs
the viewer to not update any archives in Windows temporary folder.</P>

<h1><I>External viewer name</I></h1>

<P>If "On Enter run external viewer" option is set, here you need to
specify a name of program to use as an external viewer. Name of file to
view is passed to this program as a single parameter.</P>
