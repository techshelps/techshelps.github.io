-  send archive by email<hr></P>

<P>Attach an archive created or updated by the add command to email
message. You need to have a MAPI compliant email client to use this
switch (most modern email programs support MAPI interface).</P>

<P>You may enter a destination email address directly in the switch
or leave it blank. In the latter case you will be asked for it by your
email program. It is possible to specify several addresses separated
by commas or semicolons.</P>

<P>If you append a dot character to -ieml, an archive will be deleted
after it was successfully attached to an email.</P>

<P>If the switch is used when creating a multivolume archive, every
volume is attached to a separate email message.</P>
