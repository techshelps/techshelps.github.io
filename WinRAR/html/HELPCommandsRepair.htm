<P class="title"><A NAME="HELPCommandsRepair"></A>"Repair archive"
command<hr></P>

<P>This command is accessible both in <A HREF="HELPShellModes.htm">
file management</A> and in <A HREF="HELPShellModes.htm">archive management</A>
modes. It considers selected files or opened archive as corrupt archives
and attempts to repair them. To run this command use either
<A HREF="HELPToolsMenu.htm">Tools menu</A> , "Repair" button
on the toolbar or Alt+R keyboard shortcut.</P>

<P>WinRAR is able to repair only RAR and ZIP archives. WinRAR tries
to detect the type of the archive automatically using archive data
and extension, but user also may set an archive type manually.</P>

<P>The source archive is not changed and result of operation
is stored into a new archive, which is named <I>fixed.arcname.rar</I>
or <I>rebuilt.arcname.rar</I>, where 'arcname' is the original archive
name.</P>

<P>Success of "Repair" operation depends on the archive type
and type and size of damaged area. Chance of successful RAR archive
repair is significantly higher if it has the <a HREF="HELPArcRecovery.htm">
recovery record</a>. If archive does not contain the recovery record,
chances are lower for <a href="HELPArcSolid.htm">solid archives</a>
and no repair is possible for archives with encrypted file names.</P>

<P>Technical details of archive repairing are provided
in the <a href="HELPCmdR.htm">command "r"</a> description
("r" is the command line equivalent of "Repair archive" command).</P>
