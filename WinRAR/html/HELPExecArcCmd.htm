<P class="title"><A NAME="HELPExecArcCmd"></A>Executing an archive operation<hr></P>


<P>Archive operation is being executed. Wait until it is finished
or press the "Cancel" button to break it immediately. While
archiving or extracting you may also press the "Background"
and "Pause" buttons. "Background" minimizes WinRAR into
the tray. It will be restored automatically after finishing the current
operation or you may click on the small WinRAR icon in the tray to
restore it. "Pause" button pauses the current operation, you
need to press "Continue" to resume it.</P>

<P>Both when archiving and when extracting, the progress bar at the
top of the command window shows processing of the current file.</P>

<p>During archiving and some of extraction operations an additional
progress bar indicating the total operation progress is displayed
at the bottom of the command window. Its look depends on "Windows progress bar"
option in <A HREF="HELPGeneralSettings.htm">General settings dialog</A>.
If this option is off and WinRAR is archiving files, the total operation
progress bar will use 3 colors. Compressed data is painted in yellow
and read data in light gray, so comparing yellow to gray you can estimate
the compression ratio. If "Windows progress bars" is on, only two colors
are used, but in either case the compression ratio is also displayed
in the separate line of this window.</p>

<p>During archiving, extraction and test operations you can use
"Mode…" button to switch the state of "When done" option on the fly,
so you can turn PC off, hibernate, sleep or restart when operation is done.
For archiving operations you can also change the compression method here,
but WinRAR cannot switch to and from "Store" mode in this dialog.</p>
