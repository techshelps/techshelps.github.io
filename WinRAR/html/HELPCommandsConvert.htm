<P class="title"><A NAME="HELPCommandsConvert"></A>"Convert archives" command<hr></P>

<P>This command allows to recompress archives from one format to another.
It is accessible both in <A HREF="HELPShellModes.htm">file management</A>
and in <A HREF="HELPShellModes.htm">archive management</A> modes. In
the file management mode you may select several files and folders to
process, WinRAR will scan them and convert found archives. In the archive
management mode only the current archive is converted by default. "Convert
archives" dialog contains several items controlling command execution.
They are described below.</P>

<h1><I>Archives to convert</I></h1>

<P>List of archives, which will be converted by WinRAR. You may add
or remove items of this list using "Add" and "Remove" buttons. "Remove"
button does not delete files on the disk, it just removes them from
the list to convert.</P>

<P>Contents of archive list depends on the next dialog parameter,
list of formats.</P>

<h1><I>Archive types</I></h1>

<P>Here you may choose which archive formats you are going to convert.
Archive formats in this list may be followed by the number enclosed
in parentheses. It shows how many archives of this type are found and
ready to be converted. For example, "zip(12)" means that WinRAR found
12 zip archives. If this number is missing, no archives of this type
were found.</P>

<h1><I>Conversion options/Lowest allowed ratio</I></h1>

<P>This option allows to specify the lowest &lt;new packed size&gt;/&lt;old
packed size&gt; percent acceptable for converted archives. For example,
if you set it to 100, WinRAR will preserve already existing archives,
when a new archive is larger than old one. If it is disabled, WinRAR
ignores archive sizes.</P>

<h1><I>Conversion options/Compression</I></h1>

<P>"Compression" button activates a dialog, where you may choose different
parameters for converted archives. For example, you may select either
they will be rar or zip.</P>

<h1><I>Conversion options/Folder for converted archives</I></h1>

<P>Here you may enter a folder to place converted archives. WinRAR attempts
to create this folder if it does not exist. If this field is empty,
new archives will be placed in the same folder as old converted files.</P>

<h1><I>Conversion options/Delete original archives</I></h1>

<P>Chooses either to delete successfully converted archives.</P>

<P>If original and new archives have the same format and "Folder for
converted archives" field is blank, original archives will be deleted
regardless of this option.</P>

<h1><I>Conversion options/Skip encrypted archives</I></h1>

<P>If this option is enabled, archives with encrypted data will not be
processed. It might be useful if you wish to run the conversion command
in unattended mode, avoiding password prompts. Though, if you know
that all encrypted archives use the same password, another approach
can be to have this option off and set <A HREF="HELPEnterPassword.htm">
the default password</a> in <A HREF="HELPFileMenu.htm">File menu</A>
before invoking the convert command.</P>

<h1><I>"Save"</I> button</h1>

<P>This button stores the state of all dialog controls except "Archives
to convert" list, so it will be restored when activating the dialog
next time. You may use it to save your favorite conversion settings.</P>


<h1><B>Remarks</B></h1>

<ol type="1">
  <li> WinRAR keeps the new archive only if it was successfully created,
    tested and reported the total unpacked size of contained files equal
    to unpacked size of original archive.</li>
  <li> WinRAR attempts to preserve archive comments when possible.
    But if user specified a comment in the dialog activated by "Compression"
    button, it will have a higher precedence. File comments are not converted.
    Other special archive information like NTFS streams and file security
    data may be either converted or not depending on compression settings
    and archive format.</li>
  <li> WinRAR unpacks original archives to temporary folder before
    converting. You need to have enough free space in this folder.</li>
  <li> WinRAR may fail to convert archives containing special data
    like links or file versions.</li>
</ol>
