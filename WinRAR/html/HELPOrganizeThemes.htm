<P>This dialog allows to manage WinRAR <A HREF="HELPThemes.htm">interface
themes</A>.</P>

<P>Press "Select" to activate the theme under the cursor. Use "Add"
button to install a new theme file. "Delete" removes the theme under
the cursor from the list and deletes all its files from the disk, so
you will not be able to select it again.</P>

<P>"Apply to archive icons" option is global for all themes. If it
is turned off, themes will modify only WinRAR graphics, but will not
change RAR, ZIP and other archive icons. If it is on, both WinRAR graphics
and archive icons are modified. Unlike other commands of this dialog,
you need to press "OK" to apply a new value of "Apply to archive icons"
option.</P>
