<P class="title"><A NAME="HELPGeneralSettings"></A>General settings
dialog<hr></P>

<P>To activate this dialog select "Settings…" command in <A HREF="HELPOptionsMenu.htm">
Options menu</A> and click on "General" tab. The dialog contents are
described below.</P>

<h1><I>System/Low priority</I></h1>

<P>WinRAR uses this parameter to regulate system load in a multitasking
environment. Usually the default priority is the best choice, so you
do not need to activate this option, but if you frequently run WinRAR
in the background while working with other applications, you may wish
to set low priority.</P>

<h1><I>System/Threads</I></h1>

<p>Here you can specify the maximum number of CPU threads to use by WinRAR
compresson and other modules. While WinRAR attempts to follow this option,
sometimes the real number of active threads can exceed the specified value.</p>

<p>Typically the default value is optimal, but you may want to reduce it
if you wish WinRAR to take less CPU resources. Reducing this parameter
can downgrade WinRAR performance.</p>

<h1><I>History/Keep archives history</I></h1>

<P>By default WinRAR keeps names of a few recently opened archives
in <A HREF="HELPFileMenu.htm">File menu</A>, so you may quickly access
them again. But if you need to disable it, for example, for security
purposes, you may clear this option.</P>

<P>Also, if this option is on, WinRAR adds opened archives to Windows
recent documents list. If "Keep archives history" is off, Windows maintains
the recent documents list itself and in such case archive names may
or may not be added to it depending on Windows version and settings.</P>

<h1><I>History/Allow history in dialogs</I></h1>

<P>Some input fields in many WinRAR dialogs support lists of previously
entered strings, which allow to restore a earlier entered value (an
archive name, destination path, etc.) quickly. It may save user's time,
but like the previous option, security of such feature may be questionable
in multi-user environment. So if you share your computer with other
people, you may wish to disable it.</P>

<h1><I>Toolbar/Buttons size</I></h1>

<P>Choose the toolbar buttons size. Available only with the default WinRAR
<A HREF="HELPThemes.htm">interface theme</A>.</P>


<h1><I>Toolbar/Show buttons text</I></h1>

<P>Controls displaying of button titles.</P>

<h1><I>Toolbar/Lock toolbars</I></h1>

<P>Prevent moving or resizing toolbars by user. You may enable this
option to avoid an accidental modification of toolbars position or
size after you already customized toolbars to your needs.</P>

<h1><I>Toolbar/Toolbars…</I></h1>

<P>Activates the dialog allowing to turn on or off the main WinRAR
toolbar, the additional small toolbar containing "Up one level" button
and address bar with path or archive information.</P>

<h1><I>Toolbar/Buttons…</I></h1>

<P>Press "Buttons…" to open the <A HREF="HELPToolbarButtons.htm">dialog</A>,
where you may choose toolbar buttons.</P>

<h1><I>Interface/Activate Wizard on start</I></h1>

<P>Switch WinRAR to <A HREF="HELPWizard.htm">Wizard</A> mode, just
after it started.</P>

<h1><I>Interface/Enable sound</I></h1>

<P>Enable WinRAR to produce sounds in case of errors or finishing
long operations.</P>

<h1><I>Interface/Show archive comment</I></h1>

<P>Display <A HREF="HELPArcComment.htm">comment</A> window, if an
opened archive has a comment. </P>

<h1><I>Interface/Reuse existing window</I></h1>

<P>If an attempt is made to open a new archive executing "WinRAR &lt;arcname&gt;"
command or clicking on archive icon and a WinRAR window already exists,
the archive will be opened in the already existing window. If this
option is not enabled, a new window will be created.</P>

<h1><I>Interface/Always on top</I></h1>

<P>Place WinRAR window above all other programs. You may set it if
you frequently use WinRAR as a drag and drop target.</P>

<h1><I>Interface/Full paths in title bar</I></h1>

<P>Display the full path of currently opened folder or archive
in WinRAR title bar.</P>

<h1><i>Interface/Windows progress bars</i></h1>

<p>This option controls look of progress bars in window displaying
archiving and extraction progress. If enabled, WinRAR will use standard
Windows progress bars. If disabled, WinRAR version of progress bars will be
used. It may be reasonable to turn this option off in older Windows versions
and enable it in Windows Vista and later, where controls have a new impressive
look. Note that Windows progress bars are two color only, so unlike WinRAR
progress bars they do not indicate the current compression ratio.
But the compression percent is also displayed in separate line of progress
window.</p>

<h1><i>Interface/Taskbar progress bar</i></h1>

<p>If this option is enabled, WinRAR will display the total progress
of operation also on WinRAR icon on Windows taskbar. Taskbar progress feature
is available only beginning from Windows 7, so "Taskbar progress bar" option
is disabled in older Windows versions.</p>


<h1><I>Logging/Log errors to file</I></h1>

<P>Write error messages and information on archive damage to the file
<I>rar.log</I> in <a href="HELPAppData.htm">%APPDATA%\WinRAR</a> folder. This option is available
only after <A HREF="HELPRegistering.htm">registration</A>. Use "View
log…" command in <A HREF="HELPOptionsMenu.htm">Options menu</A> to
view contents of log file.</P>

<h1><I>Logging/Limit log file size to &lt;nnn&gt; KB</I></h1>

<P>Enables to limit size of <I>rar.log</I> file produced by WinRAR.
The minimum allowed log file value is 50KB.</P>
