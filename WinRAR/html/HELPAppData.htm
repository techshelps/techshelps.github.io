<p>Old WinRAR versions stored supplementary files like a registration key,
exported settings file settings.reg, themes or log file in the same folder
as WinRAR executable. In Windows Vista and following Windows versions it is
not recommended to store such data in the program folder. Software may
even fail when trying to do it. Recommended locations for application data
are subfolders of so called %APPDATA% folder.</p>

<p>Real path to %APPDATA% depends on Windows version. To open %APPDATA%
folder do the following: run Windows Explorer or open "My Computer" window,
type %APPDATA% in address bar and then press Enter. WinRAR stores its files
in "WinRAR" subfolder of %APPDATA%. You may enter %APPDATA%\WinRAR
in Windows Explorer address bar to go directly to WinRAR data folder.</p>

<p>Situations when you need to access %APPDATA%\WinRAR manually are rare.
Samples of such situations may include copying settings.reg to another
computer or browsing the error log file with some external viewer.</p>

<p>Note that WinRAR tries to search the registration key and settings.reg
file both in %APPDATA%\WinRAR and in WinRAR program folder,
with %APPDATA%\WinRAR having precedence.</p>

<p>If you need to override the location of %APPDATA%\WinRAR, you can set
the string value "AppData" in Registry key HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\WinRAR\Paths
containing a new path to WinRAR supplementary files.</p>
