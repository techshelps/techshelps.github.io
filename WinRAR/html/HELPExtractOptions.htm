<P class="title"><A NAME="HELPExtractOptions"></A>Extraction path
and options dialog: general options<hr></P>

<P>This part of extraction dialog enables to select the destination
folder for extracted files and set some general options. By default
the destination folder is the same as the archive name and is placed
in the current folder, but you may change the default value using <A
HREF="HELPCompressionSettings.htm">Compression settings</A>. You can
enter the new path (which will be created if does not already exist)
in "Destination path" field or select an existing folder from
the folders tree pane.</P>

<P>The dialog attempts to choose an entering folder name in the tree
automatically as you type, but only after a small delay (about 0.5s),
if the entered path contains a drive letter and if such automatic selection
does not take too much time. If folder does not exist, either its parent
or another folder most similar to the entered one will be selected.
Also you may force the dialog to immediately search for the entered folder
name by pressing <b>Display</b> button, which may be useful if you need to
locate a folder proposed when opening the dialog or if automatic
selection was aborted because of low speed.</P>

<p>You can create a new folder using <b>New folder</b> button.
It will be created in a folder selected in tree pane or specified
in "Destination path" field, depending on what you changed last.
Use F2 key to rename folders in tree pane, Del to remove them
and F5 to refresh the tree contents.</p>

<P>Extraction dialog is resizable. You can use the mouse to drag its
border to the desired size to provide more space for folder list pane.
WinRAR will store new dimensions of this dialog.</P>


<P>Additionally to destination path, the general part of extraction
dialog provides the following options:</P>

<h1>Update mode</h1>

<h1><I>Extract and replace files (default)</I></h1>

<P>Extract all selected files.</P>

<h1><I>Extract and update files</I></h1>

<P>Extract those selected files, which copies either not present in
the target folder or older than extracting files.</P>

<h1><I>Freshen existing files only</I></h1>

<P>Extract only those selected files, which exist in the target folder
and older than the corresponding file in the archive. If a file not
present on disk, it will be skipped.</P>

<h1>Overwrite mode</h1>

<h1><I>Ask before overwrite (default)</I></h1>

<P>Prompts before overwriting a file.</P>

<h1><I>Overwrite without prompt</I></h1>

<P>Files are overwritten without any prompt.</P>

<h1><I>Skip existing files</I></h1>

<P>Do not overwrite files which are already exist.</P>

<h1><I>Rename automatically</I></h1>

<P>Rename extracted files automatically if file with the same name
already exists. Renamed file will get the name like 'filename(N).txt',
where 'filename.txt' is the original file name and 'N' is a number.</P>


<h1>Miscellaneous</h1>

<h1><I>Extract archives to subfolders</I></h1>

<P>This option is available only when more than one archive is unpacked.
It will place unpacked contents of each archive to separate subfolder,
which name will be generated basing on the archive name.</P>

<h1><I>Keep broken files</I></h1>

<P>WinRAR will not delete files which are not extracted properly,
for example, when the archive is damaged (by default, WinRAR deletes
such files). You can try to save part of the information from a broken
file. </P>

<h1><I>Display files in Explorer</I></h1>

<P>After the extraction is finished, WinRAR will open Explorer window
displaying contents of destination folder. </P>

<h1><I>Save settings</I></h1>

<P>Press "Save settings" button if you wish to save the current state
of both parts (General and Advanced) of extraction dialog. Saved state
will be restored as the default when activating the dialog next time.
WinRAR saves all options except the destination path. If you need to
specify the default destination folder, use <A HREF="HELPCompressionSettings.htm">
Compression settings</A> dialog.</P>
