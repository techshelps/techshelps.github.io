<P class="title"><A NAME="HELPCommandsExtractTo"></A>"Extract files
to a specified folder" command<hr></P>

<P>This command is accessible both in <A HREF="HELPShellModes.htm">
file management</A> and in <A HREF="HELPShellModes.htm">archive management</A>
modes. </P>

<P>In the archive management mode, when WinRAR shows archive contents,
first, you need to <A HREF="HELPInterfaceSelecting.htm">select</A>
archived files and folders, which are to be extracted. Then run "Extract
files to a specified folder" command using either <A HREF="HELPCommandsMenu.htm">
Commands menu</A>, "Extract to" button on the toolbar or Alt+E keyboard
shortcut. In the <A HREF="HELPExtractOptions.htm">Extraction path and
options dialog</A> you may specify the destination folder for extracted
files and, if necessary, set additional options. After closing this
dialog, extraction is started.</P>

<P>In the file management mode it is possible to unpack several archives
at once. In general the operation is similar to the described in the
previous paragraph, but instead of selecting files inside of archive
you need to <A HREF="HELPInterfaceSelecting.htm">select</A> archives
and folders, where WinRAR should search for archives. If any archives
are found, the <A HREF="HELPExtractOptions.htm">Extraction path and
options dialog</A> will be displayed. After closing this dialog contents
of all found archives will be extracted.</P>
