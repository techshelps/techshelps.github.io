<P class="title"><A NAME="HELPCommandsLock"></A>"Lock archive" command<hr></P>


<P>This command is accessible both in <A HREF="HELPShellModes.htm">
file management</A> and in <A HREF="HELPShellModes.htm">archive management</A>
modes. If you are inside of archive, there is no need to select any
files, just run "Lock archive" command using either <A HREF="HELPCommandsMenu.htm">
Commands menu</A>, "Lock" button on the toolbar or Alt+L keyboard shortcut.
If you browse uncompressed files in the file management mode, first
select files and folders which will be searched for archives to lock.</P>

<p>WinRAR cannot modify locked archives, so locking important archives prevents
their accidental modification by WinRAR. Such protection might be especially
useful in case of WinRAR commands processing archives in groups.</p>

<p>This command is not intended or able to prevent modification by other tools
or willful third party. It implements a safety measure only for accidental
data change by WinRAR. It is supported only by <A HREF="HELPRARVersusZIP.htm">RAR</A> archives.</P>
