<P class="title"><A NAME="HELPAcknowledgments"></A>Acknowledgments<hr></P>

<P>We want to thank <B><a href="http://www.rarlab.com/ron.htm" target="_blank">Ron Dwight</a></B>, who did so much for RAR and
its users. It is so sad that Ron will never see next WinRAR versions.</P>

<P>WinRAR incorporates <a href="HELPInfoZip.htm">the code by
<B>Info-ZIP group</B></a>, which is used to handle ZIP archives.</P>

<P>Text compression algorithm is based on <B>Dmitry Shkarin</B> PPMII
and <B>Dmitry Subbotin</B> carryless rangecoder public domain source code.
You may find it in <a href="ftp://ftp.elf.stuba.sk/pub/pc/pack">ftp.elf.stuba.sk/pub/pc/pack</a>.</P>

<P>WinRAR encryption includes parts of code from <B>Szymon Stefanek</B>
and <B><a href="HELPGladmanAES.htm">Brian Gladman</a></B> AES implementations 
also as <B>Steve Reid</B> SHA-1 source.</P>

<P>WinRAR uses CRC32 function based on <a href="HELPIntelCRC.htm">
Intel Slicing-by-8 algorithm</a>.</P>

<P>RAR archives may optionally include <a href="https://blake2.net" target="_blank">
BLAKE2sp</a> hash, designed by <b>Jean-Philippe Aumasson</b>, 
<b>Samuel Neves</b>, <b>Zooko Wilcox-O'Hearn</b>
and <b>Christian Winnerlein</b>.</P>

<P>Useful hints provided by <B>Alexander Khoroshev</B> and <B>Bulat
Ziganshin</B> allowed to significantly improve RAR compression and
speed.</P>

<P>7z archives are decompressed using 7zxa.dll library copyrighted by
<B>Igor Pavlov</B>, developer of 7-Zip archiver. 7zxa.dll is distributed
under GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL)
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl-2.1.html" target="_blank">version 2.1</a>
or <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl.html" target="_blank">later</a>.
You can modify portions of 7zxa.dll and perform reverse engineering
solely for purpose of debugging such 7zxa.dll modifications according to LGPL.
XZ and LZMA ZIP archives are decompressed using the public domain LZMA SDK
by Igor Pavlov. 7zxa.dll library source code and LZMA SDK are available on
<a href="http://www.7-zip.org" target="_blank">www.7-zip.org</a>.</P>

<p>We used "Screaming Fast Galois Field Arithmetic Using Intel SIMD
Instructions" paper by <b>James S. Plank</b>, <b>Kevin M. Greenan</b>
and <b>Ethan L. Miller</b> to improve Reed-Solomon coding performance.
Also we are grateful to <b>Artem Drobanov</b> and <b>Bulat Ziganshin</b>
for samples and ideas allowed to make Reed-Solomon coding more efficient.</p>

<P>WinRAR graphic design had been prepared by <B>Aditya Nugraha Putra</B>
from <a href="http://weirdsgn.com" target="_blank">weirdsgn.com</a>.</P>

<P>The idea of WinRAR shell extension was inspired by <B>Ylian Saint-Hilaire</B>
and his nice "RAR shell extension" program.</P>

<P>Special thanks to <B>Andrey Spasibozhko</B> for help in development
and promotion of early RAR versions.</P>
