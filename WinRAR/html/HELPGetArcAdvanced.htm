<P class="title"><A NAME="HELPGetArcAdvanced"></A>Archive name and
parameters dialog: advanced options<hr></P>

<h1><I>Save file security data</I></h1>

<P>This option has meaning only for NTFS file system and allows to
save file owner, group, access control and audit information. You need
to have necessary privileges in order to use this facility. Processing
of security data may decrease the speed of archiving operation, so
set this option only if you understand its meaning and really need
it, in most cases security processing is not required for home users.</P>

<P>This option is supported only for RAR archives.</P>

<h1><I>Save file streams</I></h1>

<P>This option has meaning only for NTFS file system and allows to
save alternate data streams associated with a file. You may need to
set it if you use software storing data in alternative streams.
Streams are not saved for NTFS encrypted files.</P>

<P>This option is supported only for RAR archives.</P>


<h1 id="symlinks"><I>Store symbolic links as links</I></h1>

<p>Store NTFS symbolic links and reparse points as links, so file or folder
contents is not archived. Such archive entries are restored as symbolic links
or reparse points when extracting. You may need to run WinRAR as
administrator to create symbolic links when extracting.
Symbolic links pointing outside of destination folder, with absolute paths,
excessive number of ".." in link target or with other potentially dangerous
link parameters, can present a security risk and are extracted only
if "Allow absolute paths in symbolic links" option
in <a href="HELPExtractAdvOptions.htm">extraction dialog</a> is set
or <a href="HELPSwOL.htm">-ola switch</a> is specified.
Supported for <a href="HELPRAR5Format.htm">RAR 5.0</a> archives only.</p>


<h1 id="hardlinks"><I>Store hard links as links</I></h1>

<p>If archiving files include several NTFS hard links, store the first
archived hard link as usual file and the rest of hard links in the same set
as links to this first file. When extracting such files, WinRAR will create
hard links instead of usual files.</p>

<p>You must not delete or rename the first hard link in archive
after the archive was created, because it will make extraction
of following links impossible. If you modify the first link,
following links will also have the modified contents after extracting.
Extraction command must involve the first hard link to create following
hard links successfully.
Supported for <a href="HELPRAR5Format.htm">RAR 5.0</a> archives only.</p>


<h1><I>Pause after each volume</I></h1>

<P>By default WinRAR asks for confirmation before creating or unpacking
next <A HREF="HELPArcVolumes.htm">volume</A> only for removable disks.
This option forces WinRAR to ask such confirmation always. It can be
useful if disk space is limited and you wish to copy each volume to
another media immediately after creation.</P>

<P>This option is supported only for RAR volumes.</P>


<h1><I>Old style volume names</I></h1>

<P>By default RAR <A HREF="HELPArcVolumes.htm">volumes</A> have names
like '<I>volname.partNNN.rar</I>', where NNN is the volume number.
For RAR 4.x archive format using this option it is possible to select
another, extension based naming scheme, where the first volume file
in a multi-volume set has the extension .rar, following volumes are numbered
from .r00 to .r99. <a href="HELPRAR5Format.htm">RAR 5.0</a> archives do not
support this option and extension based names.</P>

<h1><I>Recovery volumes</I></h1>

<P>This option is available only when you create RAR <A HREF="HELPArcVolumes.htm">
multivolume</A> archive, in this case you just need to select the number
of <A HREF="HELPArcRecVolumes.htm">recovery volumes</A> to create.
You may also append a percent character to this parameter, in such
case the number of creating .rev files will be equal to this percent
taken from the total number of RAR volumes. Each recovery volume allows
to reconstruct one missing volume file. You may read more about this
feature <A HREF="HELPArcRecVolumes.htm">here</A>.</P>

<h1><I>Background archiving</I></h1>

<P>Minimize WinRAR to tray when starting the archiving process.</P>

<h1><I>Wait if other WinRAR copies are active</I></h1>

<P>Wait in the queue if other WinRAR copies are creating, modifying
or unpacking an archive and start the operation only when other WinRAR tasks
are complete or paused. If you are going to perform several archiving
or decompressing tasks, such sequential execution can help to reduce
the amount of disk seeks and improve overall performance.</P>

<P>You can override this option for current operation by pressing
"Continue" button in operation progress window. When you press "Continue",
WinRAR stops waiting regardless of other copies activity.</P>

<h1><I>Recovery record</I></h1>

<P>Specify the <A HREF="HELPArcRecovery.htm">recovery record</A> size
as a percent of total archive size. Larger recovery record allows to
recover from more serious damage, but it also increases an archive size
and processing time, so 3 - 10% is probably optimal. This value is used
only if you enabled "Add recovery record" option on
<A HREF="HELPGetArcGeneral.htm#RR">General</A> page of this dialog.
You cannot set it to zero. If you do not need the recovery record,
turn off "Add recovery record" option instead.</P>

<h1><I>Compression…</I></h1>

<P>Opens <A HREF="HELPCompressionAdvanced.htm">Advanced compression
parameters</A> dialog, where you may configure different modules of
WinRAR compression algorithm. Improper settings in this dialog may
seriously hurt archiver performance, so use it carefully.</P>

<h1><I>SFX options</I></h1>

<P>Selects a <A HREF="HELPArcSFX.htm">self-extracting</A> module and
sets a number of <A HREF="HELPSFXAdvOpt.htm">optional SFX parameters</A>
like a destination folder or window title. Note that SFX parameters
are applicable only to Windows GUI module and are not supported by
console or non-Windows SFX. The <I>"SFX options"</I> button is available
only if you enabled <I><B>"</B>Create SFX archive" </I>option in the
<A HREF="HELPGetArcGeneral.htm">General options</A> of this dialog.
</P>

<P>It is possible to store selected SFX options in a <A HREF="HELPProfiles.htm">
compression profile</A>, WinRAR puts commands describing SFX parameters
to the <A HREF="HELPArcComment.htm">archive comment</A>.</P>

<h1><I>When done</I></h1>

<p>This option allows to turn PC off, hibernate, sleep or restart
when archiving is done. Appropriate power features must be supported
by operating system.<p>
