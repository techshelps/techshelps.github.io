<P class="title"><A NAME="HELPCmdRR"></A>Command <B>RR[N]</B> - add
data recovery record<hr></P>

<p>Optionally, redundant information (<a href="HELPArcRecovery.htm">recovery
record</a>) may be added to RAR archive. While it increases the archive size,
it helps to recover archived files in case of disk failure or data loss
of other kind, provided that damage is not too severe. Such damage recovery
can be done with <a href="HELPCmdR.htm">command "r"</a>.
ZIP archive format does not support the recovery record.</p>

<p>RAR 4.x and <a href="HELPRAR5Format.htm">RAR 5.0</a> archives use
different recovery record structure and algorithms.</p>

<p>RAR 4.x recovery record is based on XOR algorithm.
You can specify 4.x record size as a number of recovery sectors
or as a percent of archive size. To specify a number of sectors
just add it directly after 'rr', like 'rr1000' for 1000 sectors.
To use a percent append 'p' or '%' modifier after the percent
number, such as 'rr5p' or 'rr5%' for 5%. Note that in Windows
.bat and .cmd files it is necessary to use 'rr5%%' instead of
'rr5%', because the command processor treats the single '%'
as the start of a batch file parameter, so it might be more
convenient to use 'p' instead of '%' in this case.</p>

<p>RAR 4.x recovery sectors are 512 bytes long. If damaged area
is continuous, every sector helps to recover 512 bytes of
damaged information. This value may be lower in cases of
multiple damage. Maximum number of recovery sectors is 524288.</p>

<p>Size of 4.x recovery record may be approximately determined as
&lt;archive size&gt;/256 + &lt;number of recovery sectors&gt;*512 bytes.</p>

<p>RAR 5.0 recovery record uses Reed-Solomon error correction codes.
Its ability to repair continuous damage is about the same
as for RAR 4.x, allowing to restore slightly less data than
recovery record size. But it is significantly more efficient
than RAR 4.x record in case of multiple damaged areas.</p>

<p>RAR 5.0 record does not use 512 byte sectors and you can specify
its size only as a percent of archive size. Even if '%' or 'p'
modifier is not present, RAR treats the value as a percent
in case of RAR 5.0 format, so both 'rr5' and 'rr5p' mean 5%.
Due to service data overhead the actual resulting recovery record size only
approximately matches the user defined percent and difference is larger
for smaller archives.</p>

<p>RAR 5.0 recovery record size cannot exceed the protecting
archive size, so you cannot use more than 100% as a parameter.
Larger recovery records are processed slower both when creating
and repairing.</p>

<p>Both 4.x and 5.0 records are most efficient if data positions
in damaged archive are not shifted. If you copy an archive
from damaged media using some special software and if you have
a choice to fill damaged areas with zeroes or to cut out them
from copied file, filling with zeroes or any other value is
preferable, because it allows to preserve original data positions.
Still, even though it is not an optimal mode, both versions of record
attempt to repair data even in case of deletions or insertions
of reasonable size, when data positions were shifted.
RAR 5.0 recovery record handles deletions and insertions
more efficiently than RAR 4.x.</p>

<p>If you use the plain 'rr' command without optional parameter,
WinRAR will set the recovery record size to 3% of archive size
by default.</p>

<p>This command is the command line equivalent of <A HREF="HELPShellModes.htm">
archive management</A> command <A HREF="HELPCommandsProtect.htm">Protect
archive from damage</A>.</p>

<h1><B>Examples</B></h1>

<ol>
  <li> add a data recovery record of the default size (3%) to the archive
    <I>backup</I></li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
  <p class="sample">WinRAR rr backup</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="2">
  <li> add a data recovery record to the archive <I>pictures</I> and
    set its size to 5% of the total archive size</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
  <p class="sample">WinRAR rr5p pictures</p>
