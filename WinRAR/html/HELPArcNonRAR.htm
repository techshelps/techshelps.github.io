formats<hr></P>

<P>Additionally to complete support of <B>RAR</B> and <B>ZIP</B>, WinRAR
provides basic operations for <B>7Z, ARJ, BZ2, CAB, GZ, ISO, JAR, LZ,
LZH, TAR, UUE, XZ, Z</B> files created by other tools: view contents,
extract files, show comments and archive information.
You do not need to have any external programs to handle these formats.
Several types of <b>ZIPX</b> archives are supported.</P>

<p>Also WinRAR can combine files split to multiple parts with <b>.001</b>,
<b>.002</b>, ... extensions. You can open .001 file as a usual archive
and then unpack its contents. All parts must be stored in the same folder
before starting extraction.</p>
