<P class="title"><A NAME="HELPOrgPasswords"></A>Organize passwords<hr></P>

<p>"Organize passwords" dialog provides a way to save frequently used
passwords and access them quickly later. It contains the list of password
records stored by user. Normally password labels and archive masks 
are included to this list, but if no label is defined, the password text
is displayed instead of label in "Label" column.</p>

<P>You can open "Organize passwords" from usual WinRAR password dialog.
Just press "Organize passwords..." button, when you  
<A HREF="HELPEnterPassword.htm">enter the default password</a> or when
WinRAR requests a password for encrypted file or archive.</P>

<p>Press <b>"Add"</b> button to add a new password record to the list,
at position below the cursor. It will open <a href="HELPPswInfo.htm">
Password information dialog</a>, where you can specify the password text,
label and archive mask. Read <a href="HELPPswInfo.htm">Password information
dialog</a> topic for more details about these options.</p>

<p><b>"Delete"</b> button removes all selected password records.
Use <b>"Edit"</b> button to modify parameters of password record
under the cursor in <a href="HELPPswInfo.htm">Password information dialog</a>.
<b>"Move up"</b> and <b>"Move down"</b> change the position of all selected
passwords in the list.</p>

<p>Press <b>"Set master password"</b> button, set the master password
and then press "OK" in "Organize passwords" dialog if you wish to encrypt
password records and protect them from unauthorized access.
You will need to enter the master password in password prompt dialog to
access these records after that. Once entered, the master password is valid
until WinRAR is closed. Close WinRAR and open it again after specifying
the master password if you wish to see how protection works. Enter an empty
password to remove encryption from previously protected password records.</p>

<p>If master password is not set, saved passwords are stored in Registry
in insecure format. So anybody having access to your computer may be able to
retrieve them. While this password organizer feature can make working
with passwords more convenient, you need to weigh security risks carefully.
If information protected with password is sensitive and confidential,
either avoid this feature or use it only if your computer is protected
from unauthorized access or set the master password.</p>

<p><b>"Enable autocomplete"</b> option allows the autocomplete feature
in password dialog. It is enough to enter first letters of password
or password label and if this password or label is found in the list of
saved password, WinRAR will propose its full text. Autocomplete feature
works only if "Show password" option in <a href="HELPEnterPassword.htm">
password dialog</a> is enabled. If passwords are hidden, autocomplete
is disabled. If label is defined for stored password, autocomplete will
work only for label and not for password text.</p>

<p>When all modifications of password list in "Organize passwords" dialog
are done, you need to press "OK" to save them.</p>

<p>You will be able to access saved passwords in password dialog,
either using the drop down list associated with "Enter password" field
or utilizing the autocomplete feature.</p>
