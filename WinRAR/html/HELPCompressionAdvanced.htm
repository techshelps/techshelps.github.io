<P class="title">Advanced compression parameters<hr></P>

<P>Usually there is no need to change settings in this dialog and
it is safer to allow WinRAR to select optimal parameters automatically.
Please note that improper use of this dialog may lead to very serious
performance and compression loss, so change its parameters only if
you clearly understand what you do.</P>

<p>Most of settings below are supported only by RAR 4.x archive format.
None of these settings are available for ZIP. Only delta compression
and 32 bit executable compression can be enabled for
<a href="HELPRAR5Format.htm">RAR 5.0</a> archives.</p>

<P>This dialog contains the following options.</P>

<h1><I>Text compression/(Auto/Force/Disable)</I></h1>

<P>Text compression allows to improve the compression ratio for plain text
data, but its compression and decompression speed also as ability to
utilize several processor cores are much worse than in general compression
algorithm. So the default state for this option is "Disable".
You can change it to "Auto" to allow WinRAR to select this algorithm
automatically for suitable data. "Force" applies the text compression
algorithm to all data, but be prepared to slower archiving and extracting
if using this option.</P>

<h1><I>Text compression/Prediction order</I></h1>

<P>Set the prediction order of PPM algorithm (the kernel of RAR text
compression). Allowed values are 2 - 63. Usually a higher value slightly
increases the compression ratio of redundant data, but only if enough
memory is available to PPM. In case of lack of memory the result may
be negative. Higher order values decrease both compression and decompression
speed. If this field is set to 0, WinRAR will choose the order automatically.</P>


<h1><I>Text compression/Memory to use, MB</I></h1>

<P>Memory in megabytes allocated for PPM (can be 1-128). Higher values
may increase the compression ratio, but note that PPM uses an equal
memory size both to compress and decompress, so if you allocate too
much memory when creating an archive, other people may have problems
when unpacking it on a computer with less memory installed. If this
field is set to 0, WinRAR will choose the memory size automatically.</P>


<h1><I>Audio compression/(Auto/Force/Disable)</I></h1>

<P>In "Auto" mode WinRAR will decide when to use the audio compression
depending on source data and only if "Normal", "Good" or "Best" compression
method is selected. "Force" applies the audio compression algorithm
to all compressing data. It makes sense only if you are sure that all
compressed files completely consist of raw audio data. "Disable" prohibits
the audio compression algorithm at all.</P>

<P>The audio compression is designed to process raw audio data like
WAV files. It does not increase compression of already compressed audio
files like MP3.</P>

<h1><I>Audio compression/Channels</I></h1>

<P>Number of byte channels (can be 1 - 31).</P>

<P>WinRAR splits multibyte channels to bytes, for example, two 16-bit
audio channels are considered by WinRAR as four channels one byte each.
If this field is set to 0, WinRAR will detect a number of channels
automatically.</P>

<h1><I>True color compression/(Auto/Force/Disable)</I></h1>

<P>In "Auto" mode WinRAR will decide when to use the true color compression
depending on source data and only if "Normal", "Good" or "Best" compression
method is selected. "Force" applies the true color compression algorithm
to all compressing data. It makes sense only if you are sure that all
compressed files completely consist of true color (RGB) data. "Disable"
prohibits the true color compression algorithm at all.</P>

<P>The true color compression is designed to process raw RGB based
color data like 24-bit BMP files. It does not increase compression
of already compressed files like JPG.</P>

<h1><I>Enable x86 executable compression</I></h1>

<P>Allow WinRAR to improve compression of Intel x86 executable
files using an algorithm specially optimized for this data type.
It can be efficient for both 32 and 64 bit x86 executables.</P>

<h1><I>Enable delta compression</I></h1>

<P>Allow WinRAR to improve compression of structured table data using
an algorithm specially optimized for this data type.</P>

<h1><I>Default button</I></h1>
<p>Reset all options of this dialog to default values.</p>
