options<hr></P>

<P>Here you may specify some additional archiving options.</P>

<P>If high archiving speed is more important for you than compression
ratio, enable <I>"Faster, but less tight compression"</I>.</P>

<P>If you wish to delete files after they had been successfully archived,
set <I>"Delete files after archiving"</I>.</P>

<P>If you need to create a <A HREF="HELPArcSFX.htm">self-extracting</A>
archive, enable <I>"Create self-extracting (.exe) archive"</I> option.
Such archive does not need WinRAR to be unpacked, it has exe extension
and it is enough to run it (double click on its icon) to unpack its
contents.</P>

<P>You can press <I>"Set password…"</I> button and specify a password
if you wish to <A HREF="HELPArcEncryption.htm">encrypt</A> archiving
files. Do not forget your password, it is impossible to unpack encrypted
files without it.</P>

<P>Also, if you create a new archive, you may split it to several
separate parts (called <A HREF="HELPArcVolumes.htm">volumes</A>). Sometimes
it may be more convenient to have several files of smaller size than
one large file. If you wish to do it, just enter a size of single part
in the input field near the bottom of dialog. You can specify the size
in bytes, kilobytes, megabytes or gigabytes. Just select an appropriate
item in drop down list to the right of volume size field. Decimal fractions
are allowed.</P>

<P>If you update an already existing archive, options to create self-extracting
archive and to split it to parts are disabled. They are accessible
only in case of new archive.</P>

<P>Note that all settings in this dialog are optional, usually you
may keep their default values.</P>

<P>When done, press <I>"Finish"</I> button at the bottom of dialog
to start the archiving operation.</P>
