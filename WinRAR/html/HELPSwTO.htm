<P class="title"><A NAME="HELPSwTO"></A>Switch <B>-TO[m,c,a,o]&lt;time&gt;</B>
-  process files older than the specified time<hr></P>

<P>Use this switch to process only those files, which are older than
the specified time period. Files matching the specified time period exactly
are not included.<p>

<p>Format of the time string is:</p>

<P>[<I>&lt;ndays&gt;</I><B>d</B>][<I>&lt;nhours&gt;</I><B>h</B>][<I>
&lt;nminutes&gt;</I><B>m</B>][<I>&lt;nseconds&gt;</I><B>s</B>]</P>

<P>For example, use switch -to15d to process files older than 15 days
and -to2h30m to process files older than 2 hours 30 minutes.</P>

<p>Use 'm', 'c', 'a' modifiers to specify modification, creation
and last access time accordingly, such as -toc2h30m for creation time.
If such modifier is omitted, modification time is assumed.</p>

<p>It is allowed to use several modifiers in the same switch,
such as -tomc30d, to set the same period for all specified times.
Alternatively you can add several time filtering switches to command line.
By default, time filters use AND logic, so a file must match all such filters
to be processed. It can be changed to OR logic with 'o' modifier, so a file
will have to match at least one 'o' filter. For example, use -toco30d
-tomo20d to include files with creation time older than 30 days
or modification time older than 20 days.</p>
