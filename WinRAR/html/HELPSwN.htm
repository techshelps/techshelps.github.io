<P class="title"><A NAME="HELPSwN"></A>Switch <B>-N&lt;file&gt;</B>
-  additionally filter included files<hr></P>

<P>Apply the mask as an additional filter to included file list.
Wildcards may be used both in the name and file parts of file mask.
See <A HREF="HELPSwX.htm">switch -x</A> description for details
on mask syntax. You may specify the switch '-n' several times. This switch
does not replace usual file masks, which still need to be entered
in the command line. It is an additional filter limiting processed files
only to those matching the include mask specified in -n switch.
It can help to reduce the command line length sometimes.</P>


<P>For example, if you need to compress all *.txt and *.lst files
in folders Project and Info, you can enter:</P>

<p class="sample">WinRAR a -r text Project\*.txt Project\*.lst Info\*.txt Info\*.lst</p>

<P>or using the switch -n:</P>

<p class="sample">WinRAR a -r -n*.txt -n*.lst text Project Info</p>
