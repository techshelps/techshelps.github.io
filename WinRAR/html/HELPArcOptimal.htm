<P class="title"><A NAME="HELPArcOptimal"></A>How to choose optimal
archiving settings<hr></P>

<P>When creating a new archive, you are presented with several compression
related parameters on <a href="HELPGetArcGeneral.htm">General options</a>
page of "Archive name and parameters" dialog. Firstly you need to select
the archive format, which can be <a href="HELPRARVersusZIP.htm">RAR</a>,
<a href="HELPRARVersusZIP.htm">ZIP</a> 
or RAR4. ZIP is preferable if you are not sure that receiver of your archive
has WinRAR or other software able to unpack RAR archives. Otherwise it is
recommended to choose RAR, which supports more functions and higher
compression. RAR4 is a previous version of RAR format, which lacks some
important changes like AES-256 encryption, more efficient recovery record,
larger dictionary sizes introduced by <a href="HELPRAR5Format.htm">RAR5</a>
format in WinRAR 5.0 in 2013. Some older tools including WinRAR versions
prior to WinRAR 5.0 are not able to decompress archives in latest RAR format.
If you wish to create RAR archives compatible with such software,
you can select RAR4 option.</p>

<P>Regardless of the archive format the next step is selection of
compression method. You can choose among "Store", "Fastest", "Fast",
"Normal", "Good" and "Best" methods. "Best" provides highest,
but slowest compression, "Fastest" compresses poorly, but is very fast,
"Store" adds files to archive with maximum possible speed, but without
any compression. "Fastest" might be more suitable for daily backups,
"Best" for Internet distribution, "Normal" for everyday use like
compressing email attachments.</P>

<p>If you selected the ZIP archive format, your preparations are finished
at this stage. In case of RAR and RAR5 there are two more important options
affecting compression: dictionary size and solid archiving mode.</p>

<p>Compression dictionary is the memory area used by compression algorithm
to find and compress repeated data patterns. Larger dictionary frequently
improves compression of big files, especially in solid mode,
but it also leads to slower compression and higher memory requirements.
Normally we recommend to use 4 MB dictionary for RAR format and 32 MB
for RAR5 (RAR 5.0) archive format. You can read more about the dictionary
size <a href="HELPGetArcGeneral.htm#DictSize">here</a>.</p>

<p>"Create solid archive" option compresses files as single contiguous 
data stream resulting in higher compression ratio when processing many
small similar files. But it also reduces speed of further archive 
modifications and increases amount of data loss in case of archive damage.
This mode is explained in details <A HREF="HELPArcSolid.htm">Solid
archives</A> topic.</P>

<P>These are all the main settings, which affect compression ratio
and speed. Actually, you do not need to set them before every archiving.
Simply select your favorite default values once in the default 
<A HREF="HELPProfiles.htm">compression profile</A>, which can be created
in <A HREF="HELPCompressionSettings.htm">Compression settings</A> dialog.</P>
