<P class="title"><A NAME="HELPArcRecovery"></A>Protecting archives
from damage<hr></P>

<P><A HREF="HELPRARVersusZIP.htm">RAR archive format</A> supports
a special type of redundant data called the <I>recovery record</I>.
Presence of recovery record makes an archive larger, but allows to
repair it even in case of physical data damage due to disk failure
or data loss of any other kind, provided that the damage is not too severe.
Such damage recovery can be done with <A HREF="HELPCommandsRepair.htm">Repair
archive</A> command. ZIP archive format does not support the recovery
record.</P>

<P>Set "Add recovery record" option in <a href="HELPGetArcGeneral.htm#RR">Archive
name and parameters dialog</a> to add the recovery record to archive.
Another approach is to enable "Add recovery record" option in the default
<A HREF="HELPProfiles.htm">compression profile</A>. In this case
the recovery record will be added to archives after any archive
modification.</P>

<p>If you need to add the recovery record in 
<A HREF="HELPCommandLineSyntax.htm">the command line mode</A>,
please read descriptions of <A HREF="HELPCmdRR.htm">rr[N] command</A>
and <A HREF="HELPSwRR.htm">-rr[N] switch</A>, which can be used for this
purpose.</p>

<p><a href="HELPRAR5Format.htm">RAR 5.0</a> recovery record uses
Reed-Solomon error correction codes. Its ability to repair continuous
damage is about the same as for RAR 4.x, allowing to restore slightly
less data than recovery record size. But it is significantly more efficient
than RAR 4.x record in case of multiple damaged areas.</p>

<p>RAR 4.x recovery record consists of 512 byte sectors and cannot contain
more than 524288 sectors. So its useful size and data recovery ability
are limited to 256 MB. In case of RAR 5.0 format the recovery record
can be as large as archive itself.</p>

<p>You can specify the recovery record size in
<A HREF="HELPGetArcAdvanced.htm">Advanced options</A> of "Archive name
and parameters" dialog as a percent of archive size. Also it can be set
in <A HREF="HELPCommandsProtect.htm">Protect archive</A> command.
Larger recovery record allows to restore a larger damaged area,
but increases the archive size more and is processed slower.
Usually 3 - 10% of archive size is a reasonable choice.
Due to service data overhead the actual resulting recovery record size only
approximately matches the user defined percent and difference is larger
for smaller archives.</p>

<P>To repair a corrupt archive, which includes the recovery record, in WinRAR
shell mode apply "Repair" command to it. In the command line use
<A HREF="HELPCmdR.htm">command "r"</A>. Repaired archive will have 
<I>fixed.arcname.rar</I> name, where 'arcname' is the original (damaged)
archive name. If corrupt archive does not contain the recovery record
or if archive is not completely recovered due to major damage,
the second stage is performed. During this stage only the archive structure
is reconstructed and it is impossible to recover files, which fail
checksum validation, but it is still possible to recover undamaged files,
which were inaccessible due to corrupt archive structure. This is useful
mostly for non-solid archives. This stage is not performed for archives
with encrypted file names, which can be repaired only if recovery record
is present.</P>

<P>When the second stage is completed, the reconstructed archive will be
saved as <I>rebuilt.arcname.rar</I>, where 'arcname' is the original archive
name.</P>

<p>RAR 5.0 recovery record is more resistant to damage of recovery record
itself and can utilize a partially corrupt recovery record data.
Note, though, that "Repair" command does not fix broken blocks
in recovery record. Only file data are corrected. After successful
archive repair, you may need to create a new recovery record
for saved files.</p>

<p>Both 4.x and 5.0 records are most efficient if data positions
in damaged archive are not shifted. If you copy an archive
from damaged media using some special software and if you have
a choice to fill damaged areas with zeroes or to cut out them
from copied file, filling with zeroes or any other value is
preferable, because it allows to preserve original data positions.
Still, even though it is not an optimal mode, both versions of record
attempt to repair data even in case of deletions or insertions
of reasonable size, when data positions were shifted.
RAR 5.0 recovery record handles deletions and insertions
more efficiently than RAR 4.x.</p>
