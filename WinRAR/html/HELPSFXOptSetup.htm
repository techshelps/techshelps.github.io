<P class="title">SFX options: Setup<hr></P>

<P>This dialog is a part of the <A HREF="HELPSFXAdvOpt.htm">"Advanced
SFX options" dialog</A> and includes the following settings:</P>

<h1><I>Setup program/Run after extraction</I></h1>

<p>SFX will try to execute the specified program after successful
extraction. The folder containing extracted files is set as the current
before executing the program. If a program name contains spaces,
it must be enclosed in quotes.</p>

<p>It is allowed to specify several setup programs here, one program
per line. If you do not want to start all setup programs simultaneously,
set "Wait and return exit code" option.</p>

<p>You can insert &lt;Max&gt;, &lt;Min&gt; and &lt;Hide&gt; commands
before a program name to start it in maximized, minimized or hidden window.
&lt; and &gt; brackets is a part of command and must be included.
For example, use &lt;Hide&gt;setup.exe to hide setup.exe window. </p>

<p>Read notes to <A HREF="HELPSFXSetup.htm">Setup</A> topic for some
additional details.</p>

<h1><I>Setup program/Run before extraction</I></h1>

<P>SFX will try to execute the specified program before starting
extraction, so this program must already exist on disk.
The destination folder is set as the current before executing the program.
If a program name contains spaces, it must be enclosed in quotes.
You may use this command, for example, to remove a previous version of
program, when installing a new version over the old one.</P>

<p>It is allowed to specify several programs here, one program per line.
SFX waits for termination of every such program before starting next
program or continuing with extraction.</p>

<p>You can insert &lt;Max&gt;, &lt;Min&gt; and &lt;Hide&gt; commands
before a program name to start it in maximized, minimized or hidden window.
&lt; and &gt; brackets is a part of command and must be included.
For example, use &lt;Hide&gt;setup.exe to hide setup.exe window. </p>

<h1><I>Setup program/Wait and return exit code</I></h1>

<p>If this option is on, SFX waits for termination of every setup program
specified to start after extraction and returns the exit code of such program
as the exit code of SFX executable. If SFX failed to run a setup program
because of some error, it returns its own error codes, which are the same as 
<a href="HELPExitCodes.htm">WinRAR exit codes</a>. Returned values are
adjusted according to "Exit code adjustment" parameter.</p>

<h1><I>Setup program/Exit code adjustment</I></h1>

<p>Since a setup program and SFX module can use same exit code values to
define various events, "Exit code adjustment" parameter allows to map codes
to different areas. If it contains a positive integer, it is added to setup
program codes while returning SFX own codes as is. For negative integer
its absolute value is added to SFX own codes while returning setup program
codes as is. Use 0 to return both setup and SFX codes as is.</p>

<p>You can read <A HREF="HELPSFXSetupCode.htm">SetupCode</A> topic
for additional details.</p>
