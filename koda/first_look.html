Koda was built with Delphi. It also uses some standard Delphi components and concepts. We understand that it can be a bit unfamiliar for one who hasn&#039;t work with an IDE like Delphi, <acronym title="">VB</acronym>, VC, etc., so we&#039;ll try to explain some of the “unique” aspects of Koda. 

</p>
<ol>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> <em class="u"><strong>I can understand “Button”, but what does the strange “TAButton” mean?</strong></em><br/>
This concept comes from the object oriented language Delphi. In Delphi, all object classes begin with the letter “T”. When creating an instance of an object, T is dropped and the “name of the instantiated object” becomes the “name of class (without T) + number of instance”. In Koda a pre-pended letter “A”,  is indicative of “Autoit”.<br/>
The benefit of the “<acronym title="">GUI</acronym>” is that the properties of the controls are provided in a consistent and sequential manner with the benefit being increased productivity, so it is not necessary to get caught up in the naming conventions used. <img src="icon_smile.gif" class="middle" alt=":-)" /></div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> <em class="u"><strong>What about those strange color names?</strong></em><br/>
Actually, this concept is convenient enough. You will find a greater explanation of the color naming conventions <a href="proped_color_editor.html" class="wikilink1" title="">here</a>.</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> <em class="u"><strong>What&#039;s the weird prefixes for some properties, for example the “fs” in fsBold, etc.?</strong></em><br/>
This comes directly from Delphi, where all flags in one set usually have some prefix. Usually, those prefixes are meaningful. Just as an example, “fs” means “<strong>f</strong>ont <strong>s</strong>tyle”.<br/>
This may change in future versions.</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> <em class="u"><strong>Where do I set text color? Color property changes background color.</strong></em><br/>
Text color is set in the Font property group.</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> <em class="u"><strong>Control positions are strange for controls, placed in group control.</strong></em><br/>
Please read about <a href="container_control.html" class="wikilink1" title="">Container controls</a>.</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> <em class="u"><strong>What to do with strange controls placed for Menu, ContextMenu, and TrayMenu?</strong></em><br/>
Please read about <a href="substitute_control.html" class="wikilink1" title="">Substitute controls</a>.</div>
</li>
</ol>

That&#039;s all! If you got the text above, you are ready to start building a <acronym title="">GUI</acronym> with Koda!
