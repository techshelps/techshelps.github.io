<p class="GlossaryTerm">SLI technology</p>
<p>NVIDIA SLI multi-GPU technology takes advantage of the increased bandwidth 
 of the PCI Express™ bus architecture to allow multiple GPUs to work together 
 to deliver accelerated performance.</p>
<p>An NVIDIA SLI system consists of a PCI Express motherboard that supports 
 two physical connectors capable of having two NVIDIA PCI Express graphics 
 cards plugged into them. The two graphics cards must be joined together 
 by the NVIDIA SLI connector.</p>
<p>With the appropriate graphics drivers installed, SLI mode can then be 
 enabled or disabled. When SLI mode is disabled, you can use all the nView 
 multi-display modes that are supported, including using up to four monitors 
 connected to the two SLI graphics cards. When SLI mode is enabled, nView 
 multi-display modes are not available. Instead, the two graphics cards 
 drive a single display to provide accelerated 3D performance in DirectX 
 and OpenGL applications.</p>
<p>For more information on NVIDIA SLI technology and for an up-to-date 
 list of compatible hardware and software please visit <a href="http://www.SLIZone.com" 
															 target="_blank">www.SLIZone.com</a>.</p>
<p class="GlossaryTerm">stereoscopic 3D</p>
<p>The technique for presenting two-dimensional images in such a way that 
 it creates the illusion of depth. &#160;This effect is created by presenting 
 slightly different images to each eye. &#160;</p>
<p class="GlossaryHead">W</p>
<p class="GlossaryTerm">window</p>
<p>A window is any independent window on your desktop. Applications such 
 as Microsoft® Windows® Outlook® or Explorer may have several windows which 
 are all part of the same application. Windows can be dragged around the 
 screen, opened and closed, and resized.</p>
<p>The nView Desktop Manager application (described in the NVIDIA nView 
 Desktop Manager User’s Guide) allows you to do even more with windows 
 such as make them transparent or force them always to be on top of other 
 windows.</p>
