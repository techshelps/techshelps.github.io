IDM has 2 main queues: download queue and synchronization queue. Also you can create any number of additional queues.
</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>
You can schedule the start and the stop times of download/synchronization queues, or you can start and stop download queues manually. The main IDM list of downloads has <b>"Q"</b> column that shows which queue downloads belong to.

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>
The icon with three yellow files means that the download belongs to the main download queue, three green files icon stands for the main synchronization queue. The icon with two yellow and the icon with two green files show that the download belongs to an additional download queue and an additional synchronization queue correspondingly. If a queue is scheduled for the start, then its icon has a small clock sign.
</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>
The categories field of the main IDM window has <b>"Queues"</b> node that shows the list of queues.
</div>

When you select a queue in the list, the main IDM list of downloads shows only the files that belong to the selected queue. The queues in this list have a simple and convenient context menu.
</div>

When you add a new file to download, IDM adds it to the main download queue by default, and IDM deletes the file form the download queue when its download is complete.
