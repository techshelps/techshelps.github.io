<h1>About NVIDIA Multi-Display Cloning</h1>
<p>NVIDIA Multi-Display Cloning takes advantage of the multi-stream capabilities offered by DisplayPort 1.2 technology. When several DisplayPort displays are connected through the same DisplayPort connector on the graphics card, you can set them up to display the same content, given certain restrictions as described further.</p>
<p>To set up Multi-Display Cloning, you need -</p>
<ul>
<li class="p-Bullet1">
<p class="Bullet1">An NVIDIA Quadro card that has one or more DisplayPort 1.2 connectors</p>
</li>
<li class="p-Bullet1">
<p class="Bullet1">Release 295 or later NVIDIA graphics driver</p>
</li>
<li class="p-Bullet1">
<p class="Bullet1">DisplayPort displays that support the DisplayPort 1.2 specification</p>
</li>
<li class="p-Bullet1">
<p class="Bullet1">Windows Vista or later Windows operating system &#160;&#160;&#160;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p class="hcp2">Q. What is a multi-display Clone Group?</p>
<p>A. &#160;A Multi-Display Clone Group is a set of DisplayPort displays that are connected through the same Quadro card DisplayPort connector and are set up to display the same content.</p>
<p class="hcp2">Q. How many displays can I include in the same Clone Group?</p>
<p>A. In general, you can include a maximum of 16 displays per Clone Group. &#160;There are some limitations in the complexity of the connection topology. The driver will alert you if your configuration is not supported. &#160;&#160;&#160;</p>
<p class="hcp2">Q. How do I select which displays to include in the Clone Group?</p>
<p>A. The displays that are included in the Clone Group are all the displays that are connected to the same DisplayPort connector on the Quadro card and that meet the mode requirements that you set, as long as the display configuration limit has not been reached. If a display is connected at a later time and meets the requirements, it will automatically be added to the clone group. You cannot restrict arbitrary displays from being included.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Q. After I set up a multi-display Clone Group, how do I change the displays that are included?</span></p>
<p>A. Any display that you connect will be included in the Clone Group as long as it supports the mode requirements that you specified, and as long as the resulting topology is supported. If you want to use displays that meet a different mode requirement, you must connect at least one of those displays and then follow the instructions in <a href="To_change_the_multi-display_clone_group_configuration.htm">How to change the multi-display Clone Group configuration.</a> &#160;</p>
<p class="hcp2">Q. Can I still use other displays connected through the Clone Group's connecter if they are not part of the Clone Group?</p>
<p>A. No. If a display does not meet the requirements for the clone group, it will not be active and will not be available for use.</p>
<p class="hcp2">Q. How is Digital Audio affected?</p>
<p>A. If any display in the Clone Group is audio-capable, there will be one display entry for the DisplayPort connector listed in the NVIDIA Control panel <span class="hcp3">Set Up Digital Audio</span> page and it will read "Clone Group". &#160;If no display is audio-capable, then the display entry will read "No audio capable display available".</p>
<p>If "Clone Group" is selected for audio from the Windows Sound settings, then all audio-capable displays in the Clone Group will play the audio. &#160;</p>
<p class="hcp2">Q. How is multi-display setup affected?</p>
<p>A. On the NVIDIA Control Panel <span class="hcp3">Set Up Multiple Displays</span> page, the display name under the Quadro card is designated as "Clone Group". You can select or deselect it just as you would a display. &#160;</p>
<p class="hcp2">Q. How are the Change Resolution page settings affected?</p>
<p style="font-weight: normal; font-style: normal;">A. The display icon labelled "Clone Group" identifies the multi-display Clone Group, and the resolution list will include a limited number based on the resolution selected in the <span class="hcp3">Multi-Display Cloning</span> setup page. &#160;</p>
<p class="hcp2">Q. How is SLI and PhysX affected?</p>
<p>A. The display icon labelled "Clone Group" on the SLI, PhysX, or Surround page identifies the multi-display Clone Group and can be treated as any other display. &#160;</p>
<p class="hcp2">Q. How is HDCP affected?</p>
<p>A. HDCP is not supported for any display in the multi-display Clone Group.</p>
